These staff are allocated to the various functional areas on the basis of need, having regard to overall resource availability. Of the total Departmental staff, 283 work in the area of natural heritage through the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department.  In addition, my Department will take on up to 50 seasonal staff during the year to assist the NPWS.   As the Deputy will be aware, the moratorium on public service recruitment remains in place and, as a result of this, my Department is not in a position to recruit new staff to deal with wildlife protection. However, it is hoped to bring in some staff from other Departments on secondment to assist in priority areas. <\/p><p>  Despite the constraints, I am satisfied that NPWS is playing a comprehensive and valuable role in the conservation and protection of our natural heritage.  For example, in the last year or so:<\/p><p>  - Ireland's 6 National Parks of Wicklow, Killarney, The Burren, Connemara, Ballycroy and Glenveagh have been well managed, remained open for visitors and provided a wide range of education and visitor services to the public.<\/p><p>  - Significant progress has been achieved on a major capital project of developing Killarney House and Gardens as a new interpretive and information service for Killarney National Park.<\/p><p>  - Considerable progress was made on the development of a suite of initiatives to address peatlands policy issues. This work, which was carried out in conjunction with the Peatlands Council, led to the publication early in 2014 of a draft National Peatlands Strategy, a draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan and the results of the Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area (NHA) Review. These documents raise issues of considerable importance for current stakeholders and future generations. A public consultation process in relation to them began in early 2014.<\/p><p>  - A total of 2,959 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, applicable to raised bog special areas of conservation, have been received and are being dealt with by my Department.<\/p><p>  - The Burren Farming for Conservation Programme is in 4th year of operation, with some 160 farmers involved. In September 2013, I accepted Ireland&rsquo;s first &lsquo;European Diploma of Protected Areas Award&rsquo; from the Council of Europe for the sustainable management of the Burren.<\/p><p>  - In the period 2009 to end-2013, there were almost 160 prosecution cases taken by NPWS officials for breaches of national wildlife legislation.<\/p><p>  - My Department's NPWS staff processed and granted some 7,000 licences in 2013 under various provisions of the Wildlife Acts and the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.   In addition, over 360 certificates and permits were granted under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).<\/p><p>  - My Department's NPWS contributed to a successful Irish Presidency of the European Council in relation to Cultural and Heritage issues, including guiding European legislation, leading at international meetings and hosting relevant events and meetings here at home.<\/p><p>  In the circumstances, I consider that my Department's staff are continuing to deliver an excellent service to the public, notwithstanding the demands placed on them, including resource constraints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100069#WRA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":39,"content":"<p>Question No. 22 answered with Question No. 8.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":40,"content":"<p>Question No. 23 answered with Question No. 9.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foras na Gaeilge","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100069#WRA02950"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[24279\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100069#WRA03000","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"an bhfuil s&eacute; s&aacute;sta leis an bpr&oacute;iseas inar roghnaigh Foras na Gaeilge s&eacute; cheanneagra&iacute;ocht le freastal ar r&eacute;ims&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la d&rsquo;fheidhmi&uacute; polasa&iacute; Gaeilge; an bhfuil s&eacute; s&aacute;sta go bhfuil Foras na Gaeilge ag di&uacute;lt&uacute; sol&aacute;thar d&oacute;thanach foirne a chead&uacute; do na ceanneagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; roghnaithe agus ina ionad sin, go bhfuil an Foras ag br&uacute; strucht&uacute;r foirne a fh&aacute;gfaidh nach mbeidh na ceanneagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; &aacute;balta a gcuid feidhmeanna a chomhl&iacute;onadh; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[24278\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100069#WRA03100","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta an aonta&iacute;onn s&eacute; leis an gc&oacute;ras nua-mhaoinithe at&aacute; molta ag Foras na Gaeilge a fh&aacute;gfaidh go mbeidh laghd&uacute; foirne i m&oacute;r&aacute;n gach r&eacute;imse de na ceanneagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; roghnaithe; nach mbeidh sol&aacute;thar d&eacute;anta d&rsquo;&iacute;oca&iacute;ochta&iacute; iomarca&iacute;ochta do na ceanneagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; roghnaithe n&aacute; do na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; a bheidh ag cailleadh maoinithe; go mbeidh Foras na Gaeilge ag s&aacute;r&uacute; dea-chleachtais maidir le bainisti&uacute; athruithe; go bhfuil luas m&iacute;chu&iacute; leis an bpr&oacute;iseas; agus go bhfuil an Foras ag s&eacute;anadh a gceart ar fhostaithe na hearn&aacute;la Gaeilge; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.

The granite stone features extensively in ancient texts and is associated with the inauguration rites for the Kings of Tara.  In the early nineteenth century the stone was moved from the nearby Mound of the Hostages to its current position to mark the graves of rebels who fell in the Battle of Tara in 1798.   On the morning of 29 May last, OPW guides arriving at Tara discovered that the Lia  F&aacute;il had suffered vandalism overnight, involving paint being poured over the monument. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was immediately notified and an investigation was commenced.  On foot of the initial report, a conservation team from the OPW and an archaeologist from my Department attended the site and, later the same day, the OPW team undertook cleaning of the stone.  While they were successful in removing most of the paint, the monument remains somewhat discoloured and there are paint deposits remaining within channels in the stone.  It is thought that, over time, the discolouration and the remaining deposits will disappear through normal weathering.  Archaeologists from my Department will continue to liaise closely with the OPW in relation to the conservation and restoration needs of the monument.<\/p><p>  Thankfully, incidences of vandalism at archaeological monuments are relatively rare, though the Lia F&aacute;il was also targeted in 2012, when it was struck by a hammer or similar instrument.  This year, in addition to the Lia F&aacute;il incident, vandalism has occurred at two other archaeological monuments, Ross Errily Friary in Co. Galway and Carrowmore Passage Tomb in Co. Sligo.  These incidents are also the subject of Garda investigations.<\/p><p>  All known archaeological monuments, of which there are in excess of 130,000, are entitled to protection under the National Monuments Acts. A significant number of these monuments are located in the more remote parts of the country and the vigilance of local people has proved to be of crucial assistance in identifying instances of unlawful interference with archaeological remains.  In relation to national monuments in State care, my Department and the OPW keep security measures at such sites under ongoing review, seeking to strike an appropriate balance between the protection and conservation of this irreplaceable resource while facilitating the widest possible level of public access to the monuments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100070#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":68,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100070#WRB00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":67,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100070#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[24855\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100070#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has been in communication with the Israeli Government requesting it to cease its policy of administrative detention under its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1018","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[24976\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100070#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the continued use of administrative detention in the occupied Palestinian Territories; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":70,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together. <\/p><p>  I have consistently made clear my concerns about the use of administrative detention by the Israeli authorities.

However, there are clear grounds for concern that administrative detention is being used in some cases to suppress legitimate dissent and protest. Coupled with the application of military law to all Palestinians under occupation, but not to Israeli citizens living in the same areas, there is clear potential for abuse, and for the familiar phenomenon whereby supposedly exceptional powers are increasingly used in broader and indeed routine circumstances.

Revenue can provide information on this project, but some self-employed contractors may have had audits or other interventions outside of the project which are not captured because they are not categorised as contractor interventions.<\/p><p>  \u00a0In 2011, through normal audit activity, Revenue identified a potential issue in situations where professionals providing engineering\u00a0 services formed companies (of which they were both directors and employees) which then contracted with client companies, often multinationals, for the provision of the services of the individual.\u00a0 A characteristic of these companies was that they typically had no other business, and no non-director employees.\u00a0 In a number of such cases examined, the level of expenses reimbursed tax free to the director\/contractor was found to be excessive and in several cases included expenses which either had not been incurred at all, or were personal rather than business-related.<\/p><p>  A pilot project operated in Revenue's South West Region in 2012 and 2013 which\u00a0 audited 119 companies with additional liability in 107 cases, and a further 24 directors of contractor companies have also agreed settlements.\u00a0 The total additional tax liability was &euro;2,801,977.\u00a0 Penalties of &euro;906,433 (32%) and interest of &euro;857,216 were imposed.\u00a0 By this time it was clear that there was a pattern of behaviour which warranted a national audit project.\u00a0 A list of companies was compiled from the business sectors identified in previous audits, where there were few or no employees apart from the directors, and which exhibited one of the following characteristics: (a) travel and subsistence expenses amounting to more than 20% of turnover; (b) other expenses amounting to more than 20% of turnover, or (c) the combination of both amounting to more than 25% of turnover.\u00a0 The cases fell into the categories of professional, scientific and technical services (60%), information and communication services (38%) and certain administrative and support services (2%).\u00a0 In addition to cases from this list, audits which remained open in the South West Region at 1 July 2013 were subsumed into the national project.<\/p><p>  Since 1 July 2013, a total of 385 company audit cases have been closed, with additional liability in 299 cases, and a further 49 directors of contractor companies have also agreed settlements.\u00a0 Additional tax of &euro;5,969,630 has been identified, with penalties of &euro;1,765,995 (30%), and interest of &euro;1,639,623.\u00a0 At the moment 368 companies remain under audit, and Revenue is now moving to bring these cases to finality.\u00a0 Most of the audits now open indicated their intention to make a disclosure to Revenue some months ago and availed of a concession whereby Revenue agreed to allow additional time and to provide guidance in compiling disclosures.\u00a0 Revenue has now written to those taxpayers advising that the process of preparing disclosures must be completed urgently if the benefits of voluntary disclosure (which encompass lesser penalty and non-publication provided certain specific conditions are met) are to be preserved. <\/p><p>  In the course of the contractors project it has become clear that the provision of services under contract is a large and growing practice with many thousands of contractors involved in a range of professional services sectors.\u00a0 Many of these professional contractors operate companies in a traditional mode, where they employ staff, operate from an established place of business, and provide a range of specialised services on the open market.\u00a0 For such companies, Revenue's project has generally found little or no additional tax liability arising from travel expenses.\u00a0 Another, quite different type of contracting also exists in considerable numbers, where an individual's services are obtained, often through the facilitation of a recruitment agency, and a contract is concluded with the individual's company.\u00a0 In some cases, a company may be provided to the individual for this purpose.\u00a0 Typically, the work is done at the client's premises and the contractor's company has no other business.\u00a0 Between these two types of contractor there are a huge number of individual variations.<\/p><p>  Revenue published two tax briefing articles in 2013 which made it clear that, where the services of an individual are being provided through an intermediary, as opposed to the traditional provision of goods or services to the market generally, the expenses which may be claimed against tax liability are similar to those that may be claimed by an employee.\u00a0 Thus for example an individual going to work abroad under a contract must bear the cost of doing so him\/herself regardless of whether the contract is with the person or with his\/her company.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  As the current phase of the project comes to a conclusion, Revenue will review the outcomes in detail and decide how best to reflect them in future audit activity.\u00a0 At the same time, Revenue will examine the impact of emerging practices in other areas, for example in the use of contractors operating abroad, to ensure that they pose no risks of loss to the exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100070#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland Staff","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100070#WRB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[24860\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100070#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of employees at the Central Bank of Ireland;

Therefore, the State was paying 20% of the cost of all private medical insurance premiums. <\/p><p>  The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance has increased significantly in recent years, estimated at &euro;404 million in 2011, &euro;448 million in 2012 and &euro;500 million in 2013. Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the numbers insured are estimated to have reduced by approximately 170,000 over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover has decreased on some policies. Against this background the increase in costs\u00a0was unsustainable. If the relief had remained unchanged and the trend was to continue, the cost would increase to approximately &euro;1 billion per annum by 2020.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the recent reform, the tax system is still supporting those who can afford private medical insurance to the tune of around &euro;400 million\u00a0per annum. Effectively that means that some taxpayers who could never afford private health insurance, or who have had to give up their policies due to personal circumstances, are continuing to provide financial support via the tax system to those individuals who can afford such insurance. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that the Commission on Taxation in its 2009 report recommended the retention of medical insurance relief but that it should be limited. The introduction of an upper ceiling on the amount of medical insurance premiums that will qualify for tax relief achieves this recommendation.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  There is no question of reinstating tax relief on medical insurance premiums as it was never abolished. However, the new ceilings ensure continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100070#WRB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Staff","counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100070#WRB02450"},{"type":"question","counter":92,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[24893\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100070#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding AIB banks review of the service department; the need to ensure employees jobs and rights are protected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":93,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware under the Relationship Framework the State does not intervene in the day to day operations of the bank or their management decisions regarding commercial matters.

The Regulation allows Member States to bring certain State aid schemes into place without prior notification to the EU Commission, provided that they are within the parameters set out in the regulation.<\/p><p>The Commission estimates that 75% of current aid measures and about two thirds of total aid amounts granted by Member States could be covered by the new Regulation. This could even extend to up to 90% of all aid measures, if Member States fully utilise the Regulation. <\/p><p>The current regulation already allows some areas of the below categories to be block exempted. Most of these categories will now be broadened:<\/p><p>- Aid for climate change and for other environmental protection;<\/p><p>- Aid for research and development and innovation;<\/p><p>- Aid for the rescue and restructuring of firms in difficulty;<\/p><p>- Aid for small and medium-sized enterprises;<\/p><p>- Aid to employment;<\/p><p>- Training aid;<\/p><p>- Aid for risk capital;<\/p><p>- Aid for services of general economic interest.<\/p><p>Agreement on the revised Enabling Regulation was secured by the Competition Working Party, chaired by Ireland, in June 2013. The Enabling Regulation dictates how the Commission decides upon the scope of the types of aid that could in the future be covered by block exemptions. <\/p><p>The adoption of a revised Enabling Regulation allowed the Commission to exempt new categories, such as aid for local, broadband, research and energy infrastructures, innovation clusters, regional urban development funds, culture and heritage conservation, audio-visual works, sports and recreational infrastructures and aid to make good damage caused by certain natural disasters.<\/p><p>The revised GBER has also been simplified by the Commission, taking on board comments from Member States at multilateral meetings and through a public consultation process. The conditions required for aid measures to benefit from the exemption have been significantly clarified and simplified. This simplification of process is one of the core principles of the State Aid Modernisation process.<\/p><p>The scope of the GBER has been enhanced significantly and therefore the Commission has introduced improved ex-post controls. The regulation introduces a provision on evaluation by Member States of very large schemes with an average annual budget exceeding &euro;150 million. This aims at verifying whether the conditions underlying the compatibility of an aid scheme have been complied with, whether its objectives have been realised and what impact it had on competition and trade.    <\/p><p>Based on an analysis of recent expenditure amounts, it is anticipated that very few Irish schemes under the Industrial Development Agency, Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will be subject to the evaluation requirements. Aid measures will also be made more transparent, by asking Member States to publish lists of the aid beneficiaries.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a state aid measure is not covered by the GBER does not imply that it is incompatible with EU state aid rules; it merely means that the measure needs to be notified to the Commission for individual assessment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100071#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permit Appeals","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100071#WRC01750"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[24929\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100071#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will review a decision to refuse a work permit in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>A notification of a decision to revoke the permit issued to the person named by the Deputy on 15 May 2014.

It is a highly threatened animal, categorised as Critically Endangered within Ireland and across Europe. There are many factors involved as to why it is so endangered. The freshwater pearl mussel is listed in Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive and requires the designation of Special Areas of Conservation for its protection.    The freshwater pearl mussel has an unusual life-cycle, in that the larval stage must attach to fish gills for a period of around 10 months.  In Irish rivers, young Atlantic salmon are the usual hosts. <\/p><p>  Because of this dependency, the habitats of the freshwater pearl mussel and juvenile salmonids frequently overlap.  All of these species are associated with good and high water quality.

As Minister with responsibility for co-ordinating the Decade of Centenaries, I have been following the historical timeline closely, marking key stages in the progress of the 3<sup>rd<\/sup>Home Rule Bill through the parliament at Westminster. To mark the centenary of the introduction of the Bill, an exhibition was prepared that was hosted at Westminster in London, at the Houses of the Oireachtas and the National Library of Ireland in Dublin, and at Stormont in Belfast. This exhibition set the 3<sup>rd<\/sup>Home Rule Bill in its historical context and provided an insight into the political forces that drove, and restricted, the progress of the Bill. As the Bill was introduced in April 1912, I arranged, on its centenary in April 2012, the 'Redmond Memorial Lectures' in Waterford delivered by Frank Callinan SC and Dermot Meleady (see for further information). <\/p><p>My Department also supported the production of a supplement to the Irish Times <i>&quot;Home Rule and Ulster's Resistance&quot;<\/i>that was distributed free of charge to schools.

In January 2013, in partnership with NIO Minister Penning and Lord Bew, we arranged for a special presentation to mark the centenary of the second passing of the Bill. <\/p><p>Indeed, I am pleased to say that on 1 July next, I will be attending again at Westminster for a commemorative event arranged by the Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, MP.  With contributions from John Bruton, Baroness Shirley Williams, Lord Paul Bew and Professor Michael Laffan, the event will attended by over 100 invited guests from parliament, media and academic life.  I hope to arrange that the proceedings will subsequently be available online.<\/p><p>While I am keen to ensure that the life and work of John Redmond is given appropriate recognition in the Decade of Centenaries, the role of other distinguished members of the Irish Parliamentary party should also be reflected. Initiatives rooted in the areas and communities from which they were elected would be particularly welcome. The specific arrangements for the anniversary of the legislation on 18 September and the address by John Redmond at Woodenbridge on 20 September 2014 remain under consideration and will include publication of historical resource material.<\/p><p>As indicated in the recent announcement of capital expenditure on commemorative projects, I consider it appropriate that provision is being made to restore the burial vault of John Redmond. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100072#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Areas of Conservation Designation","counter":183,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100072#WRD01050"},{"type":"question","counter":184,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[24879\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100072#WRD01100","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the scientific evidence available to prove afforestation affects the breeding grounds of the hen harrier; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":185,"content":"<p>The 1979 EU Birds Directive requires that each Member State of the European Union classify suitable areas as Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for the protection of endangered species of bird, including the Hen Harrier. Under Article 6 of the Habitats Directive, which applies to SPAs, Ireland is obliged to prevent the deterioration of these SPAs as suitable areas for the species and only to consent to projects, including afforestation, where there is clear scientific evidence that such projects will not lead to an adverse impact on the integrity of the SPA.    It is now well established that afforestation interacts with the ecology of Hen Harriers. During the early growth stages, these areas are selected by breeding Hen Harriers for nesting and foraging. Depending on the location and scale, afforestation can lead to an increase in breeding populations. However, as plantations mature, their value as a feeding and nesting resource is significantly diminished. Therefore, if particular areas are dominated by plantations of a similar age, then the overall availability of suitable breeding habitat for the Hen Harrier declines as a result of the maturing trees. The availability of suitable habitat is a fundamental requirement for the conservation of breeding birds in the wild. The results of the latest national survey recorded a significant decline in the numbers of breeding Hen Harriers in those SPAs that were designated for the conservation of this species. <\/p><p>  A report based on a recent Irish scientific study observed that the breeding productivity rate of Hen Harriers in their study sites was low and that a negative relationship existed between second rotation pre-thicket forests and Hen Harrier breeding success. The potential impact of such a negative association is of concern,  due to the fact that a large proportion of Hen Harrier nests in Ireland are situated in second rotation pre-thicket forestry. <\/p><p>  The following published scientific reports and papers have informed this understanding:<\/p><p>  - Irwin, S., Wilson, W., O'Donoghue, B., O'Mahony, B., Kelly, T., O'Halloran, J.

Progress in relocating turf cutters is being achieved in a number of cases.<\/p><p>Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been made as regards a group from Clara Bog special area of conservation in County Offaly and a group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog special areas of conservation in County Galway. The group from Clara Bog commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June 2012, where 25 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated. 23 qualifying turf cutters from the group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog have been accommodated at the Islands Bog and Killasolan Bog, County Galway from the 2014 turf cutting season.<\/p><p>Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of 9 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare to Timahoe North, County Kildare, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na. The site has been available for turf cutting during this season. However, turf cutters have not agreed with my Department to cut turf there.<\/p><p>Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation of qualifying turf cutters from Moyclare Bog special area of conservation in County Offaly to Lemanaghan Bog, County Offaly, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na, from the 2015 turf cutting season.<\/p><p>My Department has provided 7 turf cutters from Monivea Bog special area of conservation with the possibility of relocating to a number of sites which have been assessed as suitable for relocation:<\/p><p>- Killaclogher Bog, Abbert Demense, County Galway which could accommodate 11 turf cutters;<\/p><p>- Clogh, Cloonkeen Bog, Attymon, County Galway, which could accommodate 14 turf cutters; and<\/p><p>- Gortnalone South, Cloonkeen Bog, Attymon, County Galway which could accommodate 10 turf cutters.<\/p><p>Due to the number of turf plots available, my Department is also endeavouring to determine whether other turf cutters may be interested in relocating to one of these sites.<\/p><p>Lattins Bog, also known as Mouds North Bog, in County Kildare, has been identified as a potential relocation site for turf cutters from Mouds Bog special area of conservation.  Bord na M&oacute;na has undertaken a full suitability assessment for the site and my Department has provided a copy of the assessment report to the Secretary of the Committee of the Kildare Turf Cutters Association. This report illustrates that 19 turf cutters could be accommodated on the site. Bord na M&oacute;na, in consultation with my Department, is investigating the potential for the accommodation of additional turf cutters on the site.<\/p><p>Relocation sites have also been assessed as suitable for turf cutters from Ardgraigue Bog, Moanveanlagh Bog and Redwood Bog special areas of conservation. Due to the small number of turf cutters from these bogs who have expressed an interest in relocation and to the number of plots available, my Department is endeavouring to ascertain whether other turf cutters may be interested in relocation to these sites.<\/p><p>I am advised that of the remaining 43 raised bog special areas of conservation, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 28 bogs and work is on-going on identifying and investigating sites.  Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 15 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number that had been cutting turf on these sites during the relevant five year qualification period.<\/p><p>The <i>Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs),<\/i>which is available to download from my Department&rsquo;s website at <b><i><font color=\"#0082BF\"><\/font><\/i><\/b>, provides details on future arrangements regarding turf cutting on each of the 75 raised bog natural heritage areas. <\/p><p>Carbury Bog NHA in County Kildare is one of the NHAs which are to be conserved. In the case of this bog, the review envisages the cessation of turf cutting on the site by 1 January 2017 to preserve its conservation value. Turf cutting may continue on the bog until that date, on plots that have been cut in the five year period prior to the Government decision of 14 January 2014 on the NHA review.   <\/p><p>To ensure that cutting does not intensify over the next 3 years, owners of plots or of turbary rights who have cut over the past 5 years must obtain a permit to cut from my Department. Contractors are also obliged to obtain permits.  <\/p><p>The NHA review also envisages the complete or partial de-designation of 46 existing NHAs where turf cutting may continue into the future. In these de-designation cases, it will not be necessary for individuals to seek consent to cut turf. Hodgestown Bog NHA in County Kildare is one of these de-designation cases.<\/p><p>Any turf cutter required to cease turf cutting on an NHA is being offered compensatory measures similar to those available to turf cutters from raised bog special areas of conservation. Such compensation will be available to qualifying persons with effect from 2014. <\/p><p>My Department has issued in the region of 250 compensation forms in relation to NHA sites and 50 completed forms have been received. My Department has also received 129 permit applications in relation to NHA sites, resulting in 90 permits to cut turf until the end of 2016 being issued. 5 permits to cut turf have also been issued to contractors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100072#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":191,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[24954\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100072#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the total compensation paid to traditional to date to traditional turf cutters being discommoded or displaced arising from SACs or NHAs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":192,"content":"<p>My Department has operated a number of compensation schemes applicable to those who have been cutting turf on raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas for domestic use.

In the four years of its operation (including its precursor schemes), some 321 projects were funded with over &euro;36m grant aid disbursed to eligible projects, which realized 822GWh of energy savings. The Scheme has been replaced with the National Energy Services Framework, supported by the Energy Efficiency Fund, designed to stimulate innovative energy efficiency projects in the commercial and public sectors.Following the commitment in the Programme for Government and National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP), my Department developed the National Energy Services Framework in 2013 to help develop the energy-efficiency market in the non-domestic sector throughout Ireland. The Framework provides an integrated resource to both businesses and public bodies to help them become more energy efficient. The key to the success of the Framework will be the ability to identify and build a pool of investment grade projects. The first tranche of exemplar energy efficiency projects was launched in June 2013. Collectively, the exemplar projects will see investments of up to &euro;55 million in energy saving measures, resulting in annual energy cost savings of &euro;7 million. A total of &euro;550,000 in technical assistance has so far been committed across the exemplar projects. The Framework will be complemented by the Energy Efficiency Fund, which will provide commercially priced finance to energy efficiency projects.   The energy Efficiency Fund was established in March 2014 with the objective of providing appropriately priced finance for energy efficiency projects in the public and private sectors. Its aim is to address one of the predominant barriers to economic activity in the non-domestic sector &ndash; the availability of credit that is structured properly and of appropriate term. This financing gap is being experienced across all sectors of the economy, not least the public sector. <\/p><p>  The government has committed up to &euro;35 million as a cornerstone investor in the Fund, which is being managed by Sustainable Development Capital Limited (SDCL), with a view to establishing a fund of over &euro;70 million when matched with investment from the private sector. It is anticipated that as much as &euro;300 million in leveraged funding will be delivered based on a fund size of &euro;70 million. Just last month I was delighted to announce that Tesco Ireland will become the first company to avail of the fund as part of a significant retrofit programme and the first Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) exemplar project to reach financial close. In a deal worth &euro;2 million Irish energy services company, DCS Electrical (DCS) will retrofit an initial seven Tesco stores with a follow-on funding commitment for up to 40 stores nationwide. The project to replace existing lighting across 7 Tesco stores with high-efficiency LEDs is expected to result in the creation of 16 new jobs at DCS and deliver estimated average annual energy savings of over &euro;540,000.<\/p><p>  The SEAI continues to support the Large Industry Energy Network (LIEN) and the Energy Agreements Programme as part of the implementation of the NEEAP. Now in operation for over 18 years, the LIEN engages over 160 of the largest energy users in on-going relationships, including site visits, through seminars, networking clusters, and annual energy performance reporting. LIEN members recorded savings of 580GWh in 2012 which equates to a &euro;40 million saving.<\/p><p>  The Energy Agreements Programme comprises approximately half of the LIEN membership and supports large industry to implement an energy-management system through the new ISO 50001 standard. Consistent annual savings across the Network averages between 2% and 3% per annum. Cumulative savings of in excess of 28% have been achieved to date.<\/p><p>  The SEAI also promote energy efficiency and associated cost reduction programmes through the small business support centre. During 2013, close to 300 organisations availed of the Advice Mentoring and Assessments (AMA) and\/or EnergyMap training with a further 300 engaging in networking events, seminars, master classes and awards, collectively resulting in energy savings to SMEs of &euro;2.6 million. Annual savings of over 10% are being generated by the participating businesses year on year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100073#WRE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alternative Energy Projects","counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100073#WRE00950"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[24883\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100073#WRE01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if Waste-To-Energy or Energy-From-Waste plants are being considered by his Department as part of the wider solution to reduce fossil fuel emissions; the current number of plants which have been constructed in the State; and his plans to extend the use of this technology.","asker":"1023","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":236,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s energy policies recognise the importance of waste as an energy resource and both the AER and REFIT schemes support electricity generated from anaerobic digestion, landfill gas and the biodegradable element of municipal solid waste.

This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>-  policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and    <\/p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. <\/p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. <\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention. I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This list is available on my Department's website, . Currently, a total of 59 areas in County Kerry have been identified as requiring an intervention. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn. <\/p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard, I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 33 fibre-based broadband networks in County Kerry, including in the area of Tarbert, by July 2016.<\/p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end implementation strategy for the State led intervention. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed implementation strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised. This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100073#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Fisheries","counter":240,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100073#WRE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":241,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[24925\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100073#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 424 of 13 May 2014, if some form of stocking will take place at a lake in County Kerry; if he will consider stocking the lake for the months of July and August or some fairer outcome than the complete cessation of stocking; his views that just because the lake is the furthest away from the rearing-on facility that it should not be completely dropped from the stocking schedule; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[24926\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100073#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding fishing licences and so on; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":243,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 102 together.<\/p><p>The response to Question No. 424 of 13th May 2014 sets out comprehensively the position as regards the issues raised by the Deputy.

In broad terms, since 1 July 2013, manufacturers are required , when placing a construction product on the market, to make a Declaration of Performance and to affix the CE mark   to each product .    The relevant harmonised European standard for concrete blocks is I.S. EN 771-3:2011  Specification for masonry units - Part 3: Aggregate concrete masonry units (Dense and lightweight aggregates ).   <\/p><p>  Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 , building control authorities have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the remit of Construction Products Regulation.  Under these Regulations, market surveillance authorities have significant powers to deal with situations where constructions products are placed on the market which do not comply with the requirements set out in the Construction Products Regulation.   <\/p><p>  From the information provided to date, it appears that a single manufacturer is involved in this particular case and that the relevant market surveillance authority took immediate and appropriate action to deal with the issue when it was brought to its attention.  The relevant market surveillance authority has engaged with the manufacturer, in the first instance, to identify if there was a problem and thereafter to determine the precise nature and extent of the problem, the actions being taken by the manufacturer to deal with the problem; additional documentation is also being sought to demonstrate compliance   with the manufacturer&rsquo;s obligations under the Construction Products Regulation.   <\/p><p>  Responsibility for demonstrating a construction product&rsquo;s compliance with the requirements of the Construction Products Regulation and the applicable harmonised European standard(s)   rests with the manufacturer although obligations are also imposed on both the importers and distributors of such products. My Department understands that t he manufacturer appears to be co-operating with the market surveillance authority on this issue. While certain information has already been provided by the manufacturer, additional information is being sought to further clarify a number of issues , including more precise information on the extent of the problem and the distribution of the defective blocks.   <\/p><p>  A number of sites have been identified where it is alleged the defective blocks were supplied and the relevant building control authorities in those areas are also taking appropriate actions in relation to the relevant construction works to establish whether or not the requirements of the Building Regulations are being complied with.  In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, i.e. the homeowner, the builder, the manufacturer, supplier, quarry owner and\/or their respective insurers.  In the event that the contracting parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation the option of seeking redress in the Courts can be considered.   It is understood that the contractual arrangements between the parties involved in the known cases are being used to address matters and are providing   the mechanisms for resolution.<\/p><p>  While I understand that resolution may require a number of the houses \/buildings to be demolished as a consequence of the incorporation of defective blocks in the construction it is not possible at this point in time to say if all of the dwellings in the sites identified are affected and if  this course of action will be required in all cases.  In this regard, I am not in a position to identify what impact, if any, this problem will have on the cashflow of the contractors involved. These are matters typically governed by the terms and conditions set out in the contractual arrangements between the relevant parties to a construction project.   <\/p><p>  This is a serious matter and both my Department and the relevant building control authorities involved are working closely to ensure that the necessary actions are taken to resolve the problems identified and to guard against defective products being placed on the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100073#WRE02600","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":259,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[24913\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100073#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the reason his Department has not introduced new regulations on the quarries producers, the industry who caused the previous pyrite problem and now the same industry which are, in some cases, still supplying contaminated products three years later in the form of contaminated blocks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":260,"content":"<p>The report of the independent Pyrite Panel (2012) recommended inter alia, that in light of the knowledge and experience gained since 2007 when the problem of pyrite was first brought to the attention of my Department, a more detailed and specific testing, certification and traceability regime should be put in place for hardcore material to be used in dwellings and buildings . Following receipt of the report and in light of the recommendations in the report, I asked the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) to undertake a review of Standard Recommendation (S.R.) 21:2004+A12 007 which provides specific guidance on reducing the risk of reactive forms of pyrite being present in hardcore material for use under concrete floors in dwellings and buildings.

More explicit guidance is given on the geological and petrographic assessment to limit the risk of swelling due to the potential presence of a reactive form of pyrite. The minimum test frequencies under Factory Production Control (FPC) for some properties are increased in order to improve confidence within the supply chain. The system of attestation and verification of constancy of performance has changed from system 4   to system 2+ for this particular end use aggregate. This crucially\u00a0creates the requirement of third party oversight by a notified body who, once satisfied, issue a certificate of conformity of the factory production control on the basis of initial inspection of the quarry and of the\u00a0FPC as well as continuous surveillance, assessment and evaluation of FPC.   <\/p><p>  In addition, a Code of Practice\u00a0for the procurement and use of unbound granular fill (hardcore) for use under concrete floors and footpaths is currently being prepared,   again under the aegis of the NSAI.   <\/p><p>  The Code will provide   best practice guidance on post manufacturing operations such as procurement, haulage, delivery and receipt, storage and handling, placing, record management with the aim of improving the chain of custody within the supply chain and ensuring the traceability of hardcore suitable for this particular end use.

As of 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307\/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. <\/p><p>  In developing the shape of the new system of Direct Payments in Ireland, I have been very conscious of the needs of sheep farmers, in particular those who farm on hill and commonage land. In general, sheep farmers hold low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme. <\/p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307\/2013 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme. This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  <\/p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the value of the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme for those farmers concerned. The Grassland Sheep Scheme is the only Article 68 scheme that is being incorporated into the calculation of entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme. If such incorporation does not take place the value of such payments would simply remain in the national fund and would be redistributed generally among all farmers who establish entitlements. <\/p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019. Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will have an immediate financial benefit in 2015 as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100073#WRE04900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":292,"content":"<p>Question No. 120 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Eligibility","counter":294,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100074#WRF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":295,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[24935\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100074#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a person (details supplied) in County Kerry is entitled to increased entitlements now that they are milking and have moved away from sucklers.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":296,"content":"<p>The Single Payment Scheme entitlements established for every farmer under the Single Farm Payment Scheme in 2005 were based on the average number of animals or of Arable Aid, and the average number of hectares on which payment was made, under the Livestock Premia schemes and\/or Arable Aid Schemes during the reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002.

I am currently progressing measures to ensure that we will have an adequate supply of consultants and NCHDs into the future.<\/p><p>  While the number of consultants (Whole Time Equivalents) has increased by 700 since the establishment of the HSE, more recently it has become more difficult to fill posts and there are some specialties, including anaesthesia, where this is especially so. The Personnel Census shows that the number of consultant anaesthetists at the end of April 2014 was 351 (WTEs), 4 less than the corresponding figure in April 2013.<\/p><p>  The ability of the public service to attract and retain high quality front-line staff shapes the extent to which the HSE can maintain and develop the range of health services required. I set up a group under the chairmanship of Professor Brian McCraith last July to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures. The Group is making recommendations aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system and planning for future service needs.  It provided an Interim Report in December 2013 focusing on training. In April 2014 the Group submitted its second report to me and this dealt with medical career structures and pathways following completion of specialist training. The final report of the Group will deal with workforce planning and this is due to be submitted by the end of June 2014. The work of the Group is fundamental to ensuring that we have attractive propositions for consultants and doctors in training, NCHDs, in the years ahead.<\/p><p>  Where front-line staffing shortages exist, the HSE makes alternative arrangements to ensure service provision, including recourse to agency and locum cover. However, it is preferable that sufficient numbers of key staff are recruited to permanent posts to support the most efficient and effective delivery of services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100076#WRH00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Services","counter":427,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100076#WRH00650"},{"type":"question","counter":428,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[24972\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061100076#WRH00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Mayo General Hospital maternity services along with other hospitals in the west are under review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":429,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware my Department is currently developing a National Strategy for Maternity Services which will determine the optimal configuration of maternity services to ensure that women in Ireland have access to safe, high quality maternity care in a setting most appropriate to their needs.
