I believe that public servants\u00a0understand that\u00a0position.<\/p>  <p>  However,\u00a0I have indicated that, following receipt of the 1st Quarter Exchequer returns and engagement with my Government colleagues, it is my intention to engage with Public Service Unions regarding the gradual unwinding, in parallel and consistent with our improving economy, of the emergency measures implemented under the FEMPI Acts.  This is consistent with the approach adopted in securing agreement on the HRA through engagement with those directly affected.\u00a0 The public service unions have also indicated their intention to submit pay claims this year.  Any discussions on pay will, of course, take place in the context of the State's fiscal position and the pace of financial recovery for this year and 2016.  Any proposed changes to the FEMPI legislation will be subject to Government approval and will be\u00a0brought before\u00a0the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  The legality of the Acts is predicated on there being a financial emergency.\u00a0 In fact,\u00a0I am required to review these Acts annually.

The Councils have heretofore discharged their responsibility through the River Suck Joint Drainage District Committee. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent formal report submitted by the Committee to the Office of Public Works (OPW) shows that it expended almost &euro;142,000 in 2011.  This expenditure comprised routine maintenance works including the cleaning of drains and river bed, cutting back trees or other obstructions, weed control and, where possible, improving water flow.  The OPW has been advised  that the Committee has since expended &euro;136,000 in 2012, &euro;149,310 in 2013 and &euro;150,891 in 2014 on further maintenance works.  I am advised that the River Suck Joint Drainage Committee was disbanded with effect from 1st January, 2015 on foot of Ministerial Order.  However, as I have indicated, the ongoing maintenance of the channel and the funding of that work remains the joint responsibility of Roscommon County Council and Galway County Council.<\/p>  <p>  Substantial  funding has been provided by the Office of Public Works under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme to enable Galway and Roscommon County Councils to undertake flood alleviation projects identified by the Councils within the River Suck catchment to address localised flood problems.  Since the introduction of the Scheme in 2009, nearly &euro;2.1m has been approved to Galway County Council and over &euro;550,000 to Roscommon County Council for this purpose.  Details of all the projects for which funding has been approved to local authorities under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme are available on the OPW website www.opw.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW's core strategy for addressing flood risk in the  River Suck area, as part of the larger River Shannon Basin, is the River Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study.  The output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address, in a comprehensive and sustainable way, the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon Basin.  Draft predictive flood maps are currently being produced by engineering consultants undertaking the Shannon CFRAM Study, on behalf of the OPW, in partnership with the relevant local authorities.  Public consultation has already taken place in relation to the draft flood maps for many of the study areas and I am pleased to say that these were generally well attended.  The consultations for the draft maps for the remaining areas will take place over coming weeks, details of which are being advertised locally and on the Study website www.shannoncframstudy.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The next phase in the CFRAM Study will then be the identification of appropriate flood risk management options for each significant risk area, following which Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs) are scheduled to be prepared in late 2015\/early 2016.  The draft FRMPs will then be the subject of public consultation before being finalised.  Updates on the study are available on the Study website.<\/p>  <p>  The FRMPs, when finalised following public consultation process, will provide the basis for decisions regarding future investment by the State in flood risk management in significant risk areas, including those in the River Suck catchment area.  I would therefore strongly urge members of the public and other stakeholders to take part fully in the consultation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500070#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1106"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Recruitment","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500070#WRA01000"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[11696\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500070#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will end restrictions in place on recruitment in all areas of the public service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1195","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>I announced at Budget time in October that the Moratorium on Recruitment and Promotion in the Civil and Public Service would be brought to an end in 2015.\u00a0\u00a0In its place will\u00a0be\u00a0a new arrangement that\u00a0gives Departments delegated sanction for the management of staff numbers, including recruitment.\u00a0 My Department is currently engaging with all other Departments to put in place the necessary administrative and oversight structures and controls that will govern the new arrangement.\u00a0 Some\u00a0have already been agreed and sanction has issued, and it now falls to those Departments to determine staff and service priorities and to continue to drive reform and deliver efficiencies.\u00a0 These new arrangements\u00a0will be subject to Departments remaining within agreed\u00a0pay ceilings and meeting ongoing efficiency and reform objectives, but it provides them with more\u00a0freedom to recruit and assign staff where they determine the need is greatest. <\/p>  <p>  The Moratorium was a necessary emergency response at a time of fiscal crisis, and it played an important role in helping to reduce the size and cost of the public service to a level that was affordable and sustainable.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that throughout the time of the Moratorium, the Government continued to\u00a0provide for targeted recruitment into key frontline areas in Education and Health, in particular.\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, most recently, at Budget time in October, I\u00a0made additional financial\u00a0provision for 1,700\u00a0new teachers, Special Needs Assistants and resource teachers, as well as additional front line staff in Health and 300 new Garda recruits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500070#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500070#WRA01300"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[11690\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500070#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he has conducted an analysis of levels of low pay in the public service; his plans to address same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>The terms, conditions\u00a0and\u00a0pay rates for public servants have traditionally been determined through collective bargaining processes with due regard to statutory provisions including the National Minimum Wage Act.\u00a0 It is also worth noting, in the context of low pay, that one of the first actions of this Government on taking office was to\u00a0restore\u00a0the Minimum Wage rate to its pre-existing rate.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives and the reform measures introduced to date go somewhat toward that goal.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age is taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. <\/p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, to qualify for a state pension a person must:<\/p>  <p>  -  have at least 520 paid contributions; and<\/p>  <p>  -  satisfy a yearly average (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid and\/or credited is required for a full rate pension). <\/p>  <p>  There have been significant changes to the PRSI system over the years which have increased social insurance coverage to most classes of working people.<\/p>  <p>   Accordingly, under the pension reform programme, it is planned to adopt a total contributions approach where the number of contributions recorded over a work life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received.  For example, in a model where 30 years contributions (1,560) paid or credited would qualify a person for a maximum State pension (contributory), a person could accumulate 1\/30th of a pension for each year of contributions up to a maximum of 30\/30ths, if otherwise qualified for payment.  This is just an illustration of a model as the new system is under development.  It is not possible, therefore, at this stage to state with certainty the number of years that will be required for a full pension, but this will be announced well in advance of the introduction of changes.  <\/p>  <p>  The proposed date for the introduction of a move to a total contributions approach is 2020, but this may be subject to change as it is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500070#WRA04600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Social Scheme Applications","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500070#WRA04700"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[12265\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500070#WRA04800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason no response has issued from her Department in relation to an increase in the spouses and children's scheme in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Mayo who is on a rural social scheme.","asker":"1074","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the child dependant payment due to the person referred to by the Deputy was approved for payment with effect from 1<sup>st<\/sup>September 2014.

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or\u00a0to the mortgage interest rates charged.\u00a0 It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.\u00a0 It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of mortgage holders.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. <\/p>  <p>  As I stated in previous Parliamentary Questions, a previous Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that, as in most advanced economies, including Ireland, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis.  Such control would strongly discourage new entrants. In this regard, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services.  In this regard, there has been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may well be entering a new and more competitive phase. <\/p>  <p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding. However, as part of the Central Bank's work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500070#WRA07100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Liquidation","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500070#WRA07200"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[12194\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500070#WRA07300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>Firstly, I would like to thank Mr Lynch for his email in relation to IBRC.<\/p><p>The Special Liquidators continue to implement\u00a0an orderly and efficient wind down of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited (in Special Liquidation) in accordance with the provisions of the IBRC Act and the instructions issued by me under that Act. <\/p><p>Any interference by the State in the Special Liquidation of IBRC which might impinge on the Special Liquidators overarching objective of maximising the recovery for all creditors of the bank could be challenged by other creditors in the courts.\u00a0\u00a0However, since the special liquidation of IBRC in February 2013, in line with\u00a0statutory requirements, the Special Liquidators are obliged to report any wrongdoing they have encountered in their investigations to the appropriate authorities.

These owners and receivers\/administrators are responsible for the efficient management of properties, which includes the collection of rents and service charges in accordance with specific commercial lease terms entered into freely by tenants and landlords.  Where a lease has been signed, legally binding contractual obligations clearly come into existence and govern engagement between landlords and tenants, including in relation to issues such as the treatment of rent arrears.\u00a0 NAMA clearly is not party to these leases and cannot seek the setting aside or breach of legally binding contracts between landlords and tenants.  Accordingly, the treatment of rent arrears is a matter between each landlord and tenant and is determined by reference to the related contractual terms and a range of other property management considerations.  In cases where a property has been sold, any arrears remain a matter between the tenant and the original landlord.\u00a0 In the case of a loan sale or the sale of a company, the property in question may continue to be managed by the original owner or receiver\/administrator and in such circumstances existing lease arrangements would generally not be affected.<\/p><p>NAMA's concern as a lender\/security holder is that properties securing its loans are professionally managed at the most economical cost and that rental and occupancy is optimised towards the servicing of interest and capital repayments on the related loans.<\/p><p>As advised to the Deputy in my response to Parliamentary Question 77 (22\/01\/15), in December 2011, NAMA introduced a rent abatement initiative to assist small and medium businesses in the retail sector that were experiencing difficulties meeting their contractual rent obligations as a result of the economic downturn.\u00a0 Under that initiative, NAMA has received 370 applications for rent abatements through its debtors and receivers.\u00a0 Of these, 341 have been approved and a further 17 are currently being assessed.\u00a0 The aggregate annual value of rent abatements approved to date is in excess of &euro;23 million and NAMA has also approved long-term rent reliefs worth in excess of &euro;40 million.<\/p><p>The Guidance Note underpinning NAMA's abatement initiative is available on NAMA's website, . As advised to the Deputy in my response to Parliamentary Question 202 (27\/01\/15), if any tenant considers that his or her landlord is not engaging with them in accordance with the Guidance Note they can contact NAMA directly at and ask that NAMA look into the matter on their behalf.<\/p><p>In its role as lender\/security holder, NAMA responds promptly and pragmatically to requests from its borrowers regarding lease arrangements including rent abatements on their properties where there is a justifiable case.\u00a0 This is borne out by the approval of &euro;23 million in annual rent abatements and &euro;40 million in long-term rent reliefs.  In this regard, the Deputy will note NAMA can only consider rent abatement applications presented by the landlord that accompanied by the relevant financial information as set out in the Guidance Note.  Agreement to rent abatements outside of the terms of the Guidance Note would prove contrary to the requirement on the Agency to protect the position of Irish taxpayers by extracting the best possible returns on its acquired loans and underlying property assets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500071#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Yield","counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500072#WRC00100"},{"type":"question","counter":90,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[12249\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500072#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of revenue, using the latest available data on house prices the local property tax would raise, if it was based on these up-to-date valuations, and ignoring local variations implemented by local councils in the rate.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":91,"content":"<p>Under existing legislation, liability to Local Property Tax (LPT) for the years 2013 to 2016 is based on the (initial) self-assessed valuation of a property on 1st May 2013, assuming it was made in good faith. <\/p><p>This valuation remains valid from 1 May 2013 to 31 October 2016, and will not be affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes, including repairs or improvements made, during this period. <\/p><p>The next valuation date is not until 1 November 2016, and the self assessed valuations on that date will determine property tax liability for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. <\/p><p>Valuation periods of three years were introduced (with the exception of the first valuation period which covers three and a half years) in order to provide certainty to homeowners as to the liability to LPT and to ease the administration burden by not having to revalue their houses each year.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>I have asked\u00a0Dr Don Thornhill to conduct a review to consider and make recommendations on the operation of the Local Property Tax (LPT) having regard, in particular, to any impacts on LPT liabilities due to property price developments.

Ireland is among the small group of seventeen ILO member countries that have ratified this Convention to date.  To mark the occasion of Ireland's ratification of the Convention and to help promote greater awareness of domestic workers' rights, Minister Bruton welcomed members of the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland's Domestic Workers Action Group, along with IBEC and ICTU, to the Department on 9 July 2014 for the launch of a NERA Information Leafleton the employment rights of domestic workers in Ireland.  Ireland's strong track record in the area of protecting people involved in domestic work is evidenced by the fact that we were in a position to ratify the Domestic Workers Convention without having to amend our existing suite of employment rights legislation.<\/p><p>The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has undertaken a programme of inspections involving domestic workers, and continues to respond to any complaints received from domestic workers.  In addition, the Labour Relations Commission, in conjunction with the social partners, produced a Code of Practice for Protecting Persons Employed in Other People's Homes which recognises the unique circumstances that occur in the domestic work employment relationship.<\/p><p>There is no legal definition of the term &ldquo;au pair&rdquo; in Irish legislation.  However Ireland's body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees.  For example, the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 requires that any persons working under a contract of employment to be paid the statutory National Minimum Wage.  For the purposes of this Act, this means a contract of service or apprenticeship, or any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to do or perform personally any work or service for that person.<\/p><p>Where the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, NERA will investigate with a view to establishing the person's statutory entitlements under employment law.  The question as to whether a person is an employee or not is generally established by reference to the provisions of existing employment legislation and established contract law, regardless of any title or designation given to the individual.  Complaints involving &quot;au pairs&quot; are considered on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the facts of each case.<\/p><p>Any persons with questions or complaints regarding their rights under employment law should contact the Workplace Relations Customer Service on lo-call 1890 808090 or at <i>www.workplacerelations.ie.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500077#WRH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1067"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Scientific Research","counter":175,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500077#WRH00550"},{"type":"question","counter":176,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[12203\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500077#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide an update on any upcoming strategies for science, technology and innovation; the priorities in these strategies; and the moneys that will be made available for them.","asker":"1190","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":177,"content":"<p>A successor to the Strategy for Science, Technology &amp;amp; Innovation (SSTI) 2006 &ndash; 2013 is being formulated and will provide the framework for the strategic direction to enable the delivery and support of effective research that produces outputs of maximum impact for Ireland's economy and society.

Currently there is no statutory provision for paternity leave however a number of employers, including the public service, provide a small numbers of days leave usually 3\/5 days.<\/p>  <p>  There are two aspects to the question of costing paternity leave.  The first is the cost of a possible social welfare paternity benefit, which is a matter for my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  The second is the gross cost to the national payroll of such a new leave allowance for employees. The gross cost to employers of the introduction of 2 weeks paternity leave would depend on a number of factors, primarily the take up rate and also average rates of pay.  There were 67,000 live births in 2014.  Allowing for multiple births, this gives a maximum of 64,500 potential qualifying fathers.  Average weekly earnings in the last quarter of 2014 were &euro;704 per week.  Assuming that 10% of new fathers are unemployed, the gross payroll value if all eligible fathers availed of the leave would be in the order of some &euro;40 million per week of paternity leave, out of a total weekly payroll cost of &euro;1.114 billion (again using Q4 2014 figures). This is of course the value of salary and wages of fathers eligible to take paternity leave but not the cost of paternity leave.  Additional costs for employers would depend on take up and would only arise when individual employees are replaced during absences on paternity leave. However, experience in other jurisdictions is that full take up of a new paternity leave allowance is unlikely.  For example, in the UK some 50% of fathers avail of their full paternity leave entitlement.  It should also be noted that many employers already make some allowance for paternity leave.  In the civil service, 3 days paid leave are currently available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500081#WRM00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1018"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Judicial Reviews","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500081#WRM00850"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[12195\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500081#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on a murder case (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his Question No. 424 of 24 March 2015.<blockquote><i>As I have indicated to the Deputy previously, I met with family members of the victim to whom the Deputy refers and their legal representative to hear their concerns about aspects of the Garda investigation of the murder of their loved one and their call for an inquiry.  I also committed to consider the family's request on the basis of information which they furnished to me.

Although the needs of people with autism have received some recognition in recent years, the Bill is seen as contributing to a more enlightened and educated public debate.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the Autism Bill, it is important to note that the Government is already committed under the National Disability Strategy (NDS) to ensuring that people with autism are empowered by policy and programmes to participate meaningfully as citizens in Irish society. The NDS is driven by this basic but fundamentally important objective and is the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for all people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has been examining issues around autism across Government Departments in association with the National Disability Authority (NDA).

Compliance with the Government Decision of 23 July 2014 on Gender Balance on State Boards is an essential requirement of these Guidelines. <\/p><p>The Guidelines also provide that in accordance with best corporate governance practice it is advisable that no member of a State Board should hold appointments to more than two State Boards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500094#WRZ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":491,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500095#WRAA00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Guidelines","counter":490,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500095#WRAA00150"},{"type":"question","counter":491,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[12262\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032500095#WRAA00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will address the concerns raised in correspondence (details supplied) regarding wind developments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":492,"content":"<p>In December 2013, my Department published proposed &ldquo;draft&rdquo; revisions to the noise, setback distance and shadow flicker aspects of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines.  These draft revisions proposed:<\/p><p>-The setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments, <\/p><p>-A mandatory minimum setback distance of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations, and <\/p><p>-The complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings. <\/p><p>A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the Guidelines, which ran until February 21 2014.  My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this period. It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible. In this regard, account has to be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation in framing the final guidelines. Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the Wind Guidelines. <\/p><p>The revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines 2006, when finalised, will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.

The Deputy CMO also referred to the limited number of peer reviewed articles and research in this area and that Australia's NHMRC may recommend further high quality research. <\/p><p>Australia's NHMRC released a statement on 11th February 2015 stating that &ldquo;after careful consideration and deliberation of the body of evidence, NHMRC concludes that there is currently no consistent evidence that wind farms cause adverse health effects in humans&rdquo;.<\/p><p>My Department will continue to liaise with the Department of Health, particularly in relation to the findings of any further international peer reviewed research on this subject.

However, I am advised that all such expenses are paid in accordance with the guidelines and rules set down by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<table><tr><th>Body<\/th><th>Total board members<\/th><th>Female board members<\/th><th>% female membership<\/th><th>Fees paid in 2014 <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>National Library<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>30%<\/td><td>All board members waived their fees.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Archives Advisory Council<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>60%<\/td><td>All board members waived their fees.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Crawford Art Gallery<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>33%<\/td><td>All board members waived their fees.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Chester Beatty Library<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>30%<\/td><td>All board members waived their fees.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Manuscripts Commission<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>35%<\/td><td>All board members waived their fees.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Concert Hall<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>53%<\/td><td>&euro;2,993 paid to the previous Chairperson from 1 January to 15 April 2014.<br \/><br \/>The current Chairperson was appointed on a pro bono basis.<br \/><br \/>No fees are payable to board members.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Gallery of Ireland<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>40%<\/td><td>&euro;4,896 paid to board members who accepted a fee from 1 January to 28 February 2014.<br \/><br \/>All board members thereafter waived their fees.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>IMMA<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>60%<\/td><td>Chairperson has waived the fee payable.<br \/><br \/>No fees are payable to board members.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Museum of Ireland<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>33%<\/td><td>All board members waived their fees.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Heritage Council<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>45%<\/td><td>&euro;26,334 paid to 5 board members.
