He is quite right: there is a congestion problem in Dublin.  Dublin City Council and the National Transport Authority, NTA, jointly published in 2015 Dublin City Centre Transport Study, which sets out the various measures proposed for Dublin's city centre to ensure the efficient functioning of transport within the city centre.  In preparing the 2015 study, Dublin City Council and the NTA reviewed the current and future transportation needs of the city centre, taking into account the Luas cross city project, the need to make the city more attractive and safer for walking and cycling and the move towards a more sustainable and accessible city for all.  These two bodies, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, are progressively implementing the measures set out in that document to enable the continued development and growth of the city.<\/p>  <p>  A number of changes have been made throughout the city centre over the past six months to accommodate the operation of the new Luas line.  The most significant change was the introduction of the additional bus lanes along the north and south quays last August.  A host of other junction and traffic signal changes have been implemented in advance of the Luas cross city becoming operational.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it was recognised that the College Green area would be unable, following the introduction of Luas trams, to cater for the same number of vehicles as it had previously.  Addressing this, a separate proposal for a civic plaza at College Green was developed by the city council.  This proposal also provides for revised traffic arrangements through this area.<\/p>  <p>  The College Green civic plaza proposal is with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for determination.  If approved, it would remove much of the conflicting traffic movements that exist on College Green.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of a rescheduled oral hearing, the NTA, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and Dublin City Council, has proceeded to reduce bus vehicle volumes passing through the area, which would allow the junctions and signals to function more effectively.  The combined effect of these changes has been to reduce the volume of buses passing through the College Green and College Street area by about 20% in order to reduce the delay issues arising in the area.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that these parties continue to keep the situation under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500003#A00700","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1518690600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>On the opening of the Luas crossover, the Taoiseach said it would encourage more people to use public transport, alleviate congestion and reduce our carbon footprint.

The average time it takes a bus to get from Heuston Station to O'Connell Bridge has doubled since the introduction of the second bus lane on the north quays.  That is certainly not something to be welcomed or proud of.  This morning I took the Luas crossover from Dawson Street to O'Connell Bridge.  It took 20 minutes.  I would have been quicker walking.  I took it in order to experience for myself the length of time it takes.  Coming back from Talbot Street this morning I took a taxi in order to be here on time for Question Time.

The Deputy is quite correct in saying that delays have happened elsewhere.  They certainly have not happened in my Department; in fact, quite the opposite has happened.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the State is required to appoint an airport noise regulator under EU Regulation 598\/2014.

In Ireland, only Dublin Airport is large enough to fall subject to the regulation.<\/p><p>As I have previously explained to the House, an earlier proposal to appoint the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, as the noise regulator ultimately ran up against legal advices, which made it impracticable.  Those are the delays to which the Deputy referred.  Therefore, an alternative had to be found.

In the\u00a0Government&rsquo;s budgetary framework for capital investment, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021, funding was allocated to progress a number of key public transport projects in the NTA's strategy, including the DART expansion programme.<\/p><p>The DART expansion programme has a key role to play in delivering an efficient transport system.  When fully implemented, the enhancements to the heavy rail system provided for in the NTA's transport strategy will create a full metropolitan area DART network for Dublin with all of the lines linked and connected.  This integrated rail network will provide the core high capacity transit system for the region and will deliver a very substantial increase in peak-hour capacity on all lines from Drogheda, Maynooth, Hazelhatch and Greystones.<\/p><p>The original cost of the overall DART expansion programme, including the DART underground tunnel element, was estimated, as the Deputy will be well aware from his own experience, at &euro;4 billion, of which &euro;3 billion was in respect of the tunnel as originally designed.  The Government decided in September 2015 that the original proposal for the tunnel should be redesigned to provide a lower cost solution.  I understand that the NTA is working with Irish Rail on a revised proposal that is expected to be completed soon.<\/p><p>In the meantime, significant investment to upgrade signalling and turn-back facilities in the critical city centre area allowed the\u00a0upgrade and reopening of the Phoenix Park tunnel in 2016.  At the time of its opening, the NTA stated that the opening of the tunnel was an opportunity in the short term, at modest cost, to bring commuters from the west and south west to the city centre and the business district in the south of the city.  It stated also that the opportunity of developing the DART underground is to be protected for the future.<\/p><p>The upgrade to the Phoenix Park tunnel in 2016 at a cost of &euro;13.5 million has seen commuters on the Kildare to Dublin Heuston line benefit from having the option of direct trains to Connolly, Tara Street, Pearse and Grand Canal Dock stations.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>Following the mid-term review of capital priorities, budget 2018 increased the multi-annual capital investment funding envelopes for the coming four-year period, including providing an enhanced capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion for Ireland's public transport investment between 2018 and 2021.  This enhanced capital envelope includes funding in the order of &euro;230 million for mainline rail and DART capacity enhancement and will allow acceleration of the initial stages of the overall DART expansion programme, focusing particularly at this stage on providing additional fleet to enhance capacity and extending the electrified DART system.  Specifically, it will allow substantial progress on electrification of the Northern rail line as far as Balbriggan, now expected to be delivered in 2022, and commencing work on the Maynooth line.<\/p><p>Planning for longer term investment will form part of the\u00a0national development plan, the Government's overall\u00a0ten-year investment plan which we will be launching later this week alongside the new national planning framework for the period to 2040.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500007#E00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1518693000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>That is the same no nothing answer the Minister gave me a year ago.

Instead, this Government is saying, \"Aren't we great\".  It is 30 years late in opening up those lands for housing.

Sport Ireland is currently reviewing the master plan for the campus development, in consultation with the sporting bodies.  The original master plan was drafted in 2004 and there has been substantial progress since then.<\/p><p> The review will be completed later this year and will be aligned with wider Government capital planning.  It may also identify other possible projects which would add further value to the existing facilities, subject to available resources.<\/p> <p> Work commenced in July 2017 on the development of Phase 2 of the National Indoor Arena and is due for completion in mid-2019.  Phase 2 will see the construction of full-sized and half-sized covered synthetic pitches, primarily for soccer and rugby but capable of accommodating all field-sports, together with changing facilities, strength and conditioning facilities, offices and meeting rooms.  This covered facility will provide our elite athletes and competitors in the relevant codes with year-round, always open, training facilities regardless of weather conditions, in preparation for competitive fixtures and international tournaments.<\/p> <p> As part of the wider partnership strategy for the development of dedicated field-sport training facilities by individual national governing bodies of sport, Sport Ireland approved plans for the phased development of a high performance, all-weather cricket training facility by Cricket Ireland.  The facility will comprise both synthetic and turf bowling nets with a turf outfield area.  Work on the facility commenced in December 2017 with a scheduled completion date for the first phase of May 2018.<\/p> <p> Work on new office accommodation for Sport Ireland and another national governing bodies at the National Sports Campus has commenced with completion expected in mid-2018.  In addition, Sport Ireland is examining the feasibility of providing further office accommodation for national governing bodies which have expressed interest in relocating to the campus.<\/p> <p>The Government has committed &euro;16 million to develop a national velodrome and badminton centre at the campus in 2020 and 2021.  The proposed facility will comprise a 250 metre cycling track, 12 to 16 badminton courts in the in-track area, spectator seating and ancillary facilities including office space.  As the first indoor velodrome on the island, this arena will be a hugely valuable resource for our athletes and should also help to increase participation levels in both cycling and badminton.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500007#E07900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518693600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

It is the second successive year where it has broken the 1 million visitor mark and we are very hopeful that it will continue.  Work on the Football Association of Ireland HQ was completed in 2007, having completed refurbishment of the former State laboratories to provide a permanent headquarters to the FAI.

I have had constant engagement with them.  They are clearly very interested in the programme.  I am glad to say we have an appeals process for the first time.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, and I want it to be as flexible and accommodating as possible for those whose applications were found to be invalid following the allocation of the programme's funding.<\/p>  <p>  In November and December last, we were very glad to be able to announce &euro;60 million in funding to a record 1,800 clubs and organisations nationwide.  A record number of applications was also received at 2,320.  Unfortunately, around 20% of applications were invalid in 2017.  However, that was substantially less than the rate of invalid applications in 2014 and 2015, which was around one third, and in 2012 when it was 48%.  This was achieved following various attempts to reduce the rate of invalidation, including a streamlining of the online application process to make it simpler for applicants, and several workshops were held throughout the country prior to the scheme opening to advise applicants on the process and give them the optimum opportunity to make a valid application.  We also tried to improve the validation process and the confirmation process for recipients.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, 20% of applications were still invalid.  For the first time, we have opened an appeals process, notwithstanding there being the lowest rate of invalidation since the sports capital programme began in 1998.  We have opened an appeals process to applicants who feel they were wrongly invalidated by the Department.  By the closing date, 20 December 2017, we had received 148 appeals from the local programme.  The deadline for the regional programme was 19 January 2018 and we are currently assessing those appeals.  We hope we can announce the outcomes of those appeals in the next couple of weeks.  The officials in the Department in Killarney and those here in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport have been working hard on this and are doing their best to bring the results as quickly as possible to those who have made appeals.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and I wish to be as flexible and accommodating as possible to applicants to the sports capital programme whose applications have been found to be invalid.  We know that the vast majority of applicants are volunteers in their local communities who are trying to do the best they can for them in providing vital facilities for participation in sport by people of all ages, backgrounds, genders and ability levels.  We very much value their work and are trying to assist them and serve them as much as we can, which is why we have introduced this appeals system.  The reality is that it is unlikely that we can give everyone a successful outcome, but we are continually monitoring the situation to see how we can best address the issue.<\/p>  <p>  We are also looking to the future.  We hope to open up a new scheme in the not-too-distant future too in order to assist those who were unsuccessful here.<\/p>  <p>  To clarify, in the regional application process, the top two thirds of all valid applicants received funding but for the local scheme, every valid applicant received funding, which was also a first.  It is something the Minister, Deputy Ross, and myself were very keen to achieve.  It was a very positive outcome.  We had &euro;26 million for the local scheme.<\/p><p>We were able to increase that to &euro;60 million in the budget and that enabled to us to fund every valid application.  That was a good day's work.  The impact of the sports capital programme is felt in every community.  Since 1998, &euro;967 million has been allocated under the programme along with &euro;4 million under the regional programme, giving a total of &euro;971 million for clubs and organisations.  That has had a profound impact on the State's sporting infrastructure and the footprint is there for all to see.  When I visit small rural communities, disadvantaged urban communities or large and small towns, I see that the sporting infrastructure has improved no end over the past 20 years and we want to build on that into the future because, apart from the immediate, direct impact this infrastructure has on the provision of sports in communities, it also has a huge role to play in the long-term health of the nation.  We want to build on and advance that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500008#F01400","speaker":"1318","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518694200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his worthwhile reply.

We work closely with these clubs and organisations and we are aware of their hopes and ambitions.  Sometimes a stroke of pen or an issue with title deeds invalidates an application and it is welcome that an appeals mechanism is being put in place, which was never available previously.  It is galling for the clubs whose application has been rejected to find out on the same day as all their neighbouring clubs will get a large allocation.

In reply to Deputy Deering's queries, the key issue regarding invalidations is title.  Generally, the largest number of invalidations result from the title documents not being in order.  They have to be to protect public moneys.  That is why we require such stringent adherence to the title requirements.  Supporting documentation such as bank statements needs to be in date and the names need to correspond with those on the application.<\/p>  <p>  The appeals process will examine whether the Department was at fault in the invalidation of applications and whether there was an overinterpretation of our rules.  They will be the primary reasons for adjudicating the outcomes of the appeals.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Neville's comments on the rural aspect of the SCP, the programme reaches into every community in the country, regardless of where it is, and it is one of the most pro-rural programmes administered by the State.  I acknowledge the role the Minister played in the budget negotiations because, without the additional &euro;30 million for the local programme, a cut-off point would have been necessary and we would have been unable to give funding to every valid applicant.  I reiterate that this is the first time ever that every valid applicant under the SCP local scheme has received funding.

Feedback is imperative and we need to continue to have more synergy and more integrated communication between the Department and the organisations that are applying.  As the Minister of State said, the people making the applications are volunteers.  They do this while running their own lives, organising underage matches on a Saturday morning, raising funds, running table quizzes and so on.  It is difficult and it is always the same three or four people involved in running the organisation.

Everything else was in order.  In another case, a date was left off one of the quotes for a tender.  I wonder whether that is a proper ground to invalidate an application.  The appeals process is, therefore, important to give clubs and the Department an opportunity to review whether there should be some flexibility.  Although it is not the case anymore, during previous rounds of the programme, there was a sense that these reasons were used as a system to weed out clubs.  I welcome the Minister of State's comment that it is hoped to have a future round.  Will he introduce an early bird system in order that where clubs are missing something simple but vital to the application, it is flagged with them early in the process and they have the opportunity to rectify that within a month or be informed that they are out?

I would like to reduce the number of invalid applications by ensuring we avoid the submission of as many such applications as possible.  This can be done by giving people an opportunity to submit further information if their applications are found to be invalid when they are first checked.  It would be fair and right to give people a chance to rectify what needs to be rectified.  In many cases, one page can be the difference between invalidation and validation.  The current appeals process examines whether the Department was at fault by reference to the published terms, conditions and criteria.  It does not give applicants an opportunity to provide further information to validate their applications.  We hope to provide the outcomes of appeals within two weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I am embarking on a nationwide tour of constituencies to meet front-line volunteers in sports clubs and organisations who have previously submitted applications under the sports capital programme or intend to submit applications in the future.  I want to hear their views on the programme and their feedback on what we are doing right, what we are doing wrong and what we need to build on and improve.  So far, the tour has proved to be an invaluable exercise.  It is an excellent way to meet volunteers and hear from them exactly what we need to be doing.  I am glad to say I will be in Limerick, Carlow and Kildare the week after next.  I was in Longford-Westmeath on Tuesday night and Galway the previous week.

The services are expected to commence later this year and I am determined that they will.  Industrial relations are a matter for the company and its employees.  Disputes about pay or conditions can only be solved by engagement.  As Deputies are aware, the State can assist through the normal industrial relations machinery.  The Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission are the appropriate forums for discussion.  I have made it clear time and again that I will not intervene in areas in which it is not appropriate for a Minister to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Following two days of strike action by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann staff in early November 2017, the Labour Court intervened and a recommendation of a 7.5% increase over three years was accepted on 8 December.  A separate Labour Court recommendation which issued in August 2017 related only to train drivers and union claims involving past productivity gains which unions allege were never remunerated.  The court recommended an award of 1.15% in full and final settlement of the issue, in return for which drivers would co-operate in the mentoring and supervision of trainee drivers in their final phase of training.  Unions rejected the proposed 1.15% additional award on 10 January.  The NBRU and SIPTU have commenced a ballot of their members and a result is expected on 28 February.  The company and the trade unions have agreed to a referral to the Labour Court for adjudication on the training and mentoring of trainee drivers.  The lack of agreement has delayed the completion of the training of new drivers and forced the company to suspend the expansion of services, including services on the Kildare line, as mentioned by Deputy Robert Troy earlier.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Bus &Eacute;ireann, I have been advised that progress has been made on many parts of the 2017 Labour Court recommendation, including changes to rosters to ensure maximum rostering efficiency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500010#H01000","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1518694800,"counter":186,"content":"<p>The Minister has a little amnesia.

The Deputy is aware that during an industrial relations dispute when the unions, quite understandably, asked that I become involved and intervene, which I cannot do, I pledged to hold a public transport stakeholder dialogue on the condition that it should not take place during an industrial relations dispute because that would probably be the only subject of conversation, which is not the purpose of the dialogue.  We made several attempts to establish that dialogue but, unfortunately, industrial relations disputes were ongoing.  A few weeks ago, we were ready to send out invitations for the dialogue but an industrial relations dispute broke out.  As soon as there is industrial peace within the relevant companies, I will send out those invitations because I am determined to progress the dialogue.  The industrial relations problems in the transport companies would not necessarily be resolved but would be ameliorated by getting all parties together to discuss the future of transport.  My Department is embarking on the preparation of a public transport policy statement.  As part of that review, I am committed to convene and host the round-table policy discussion to which Deputy Troy referred.

We are pleased to say that the campaign has been launched and is operational and will target 10 million Britons who will be reminded in a very vivid way of how close to them the Wild Atlantic Way is.  The selected airports are all within two hours of the Wild Atlantic Way and we are using a number of high visibility outdoor advertising media such as billboards to highlight its proximity to those cities.<\/p>  <p>  We are very keen to reverse the fall in visitor numbers from the UK to Ireland since the Brexit vote in June 2016 and this campaign will produce results.

It is critical the global community does not become complacent about such heedless, needless and gun-fuelled violence.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the families.  A very basic right is that one's children should go to school and come home safely.  We send our solidarity to the people of the area and the people of the USA as they grapple with yet another major school tragedy.<\/p><p>This morning, thousands of homeowners across the country are reading in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>that their home loans are being put up for sale without their agreement.  Permanent TSB is beginning to market a portfolio of home loans worth nearly &euro;3 billion to a range of international investors, including those we know as vulture funds.  It is estimated this could represent up to 20,000 loans.  That is 20,000 families who are facing a very uncertain future this morning.  I want to put that 20,000 figure into context.  In the third quarter of 2017, there were just over 11,000 family home loans held by unregulated vulture funds.  This one sale could nearly triple that figure in one go.  The loans will be sold at less than their actual value to these vultures but the borrowers, these families, will still have to pay every cent of the loan plus interest.  Many of the potential bidders for this portfolio are already in business in Ireland and it has not been a good story.  They are impossible to engage with.  They do not have branches; they have call centres.  They rely on anonymous call centres, which may not even be based in the State, to deal with customers.  They are aggressive in dealing with borrowers and their families.  They are aggressive to the point of causing considerable mental and physical stress to the people involved.  They get away with it.  They get away with that aggression because there is no regulation.  They are accountable to nobody.  The finance committee has sought in recent weeks to try to get these people to come into the committee to engage with it but virtually all of them have turned down the request of an Oireachtas committee to account for their actions.  Yet, we propose to hand another 20,000 families into their clutches.  Permanent TSB is only the first; other banks will follow suit.  Loans involving more family homes, family farms and family businesses will be sold to the highest bidder with no regard for the families and borrowers involved.<\/p><p>The Government owns 75% of Permanent TSB.  It is the main shareholder so it pays the piper.  When was the Government made aware by Permanent TSB of its decision to put this loan portfolio up for sale in this specific manner?  Did the Government at any time signal any concerns to Permanent TSB about family homes and the treatment of families in this process?  What protections is the Government seeking for those families?  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe's spokesperson said this morning that some banks, including Permanent TSB, were considering the sale of portfolios.  What other banks, in addition to Permanent TSB, was she, and therefore the Minister, referring to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500012#K01000","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1518696000,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  It is important to say to the House that we want to complete the repair of the banking system and ensure banks are there to support the wider public interest, which is the whole purpose of a functioning banking system within an economy, as set out in the programme for Government.  Dealing with non-performing loans is one of the key priorities of the European regulator, the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM.  While great progress has been made in the Irish banks, the SSM has made it clear that further reductions need to be made.  At 28%, as of last June, Permanent TSB's non-performing loan ratio was one of the highest in the eurozone.  Given the volume of borrowers who have not engaged with the bank in recent years and the number of cases where treatments were not possible or have failed, the bank has said that achieving an acceptable non-performing loan ratio will not be possible without some form of loan sales.  Under the terms of the relationship framework with the bank, loan sales do not require the Minister for Finance's consent.  However, the bank will be required to consult with the Minister and will do so in due course.  In any loan sale, it is important to highlight that the contractual terms of borrowers, or indeed tenants, remain in place after the loan sale while the Central Bank code of conduct for mortgage arrears still applies.  In other words, mortgage holders have the same rights regardless of who owns the loan book.  While loan sales are regrettable, the Minister for Finance is conscious of the need for the bank to continue on a path of recovery.<\/p>  <p>  The Government was briefed on this by the Minister for Finance on Tuesday at its last meeting.  On the Deputy's question about other banks, Ulster Bank had a loan sale last year or 18 months ago.  Of course people are concerned about who will be managing their loans and who they will be talking to or negotiating with in terms of debt.  We are very conscious of that.  We are also conscious of the rules that apply and there is a significant onus on the Central Bank to make sure that when loans are sold, the contractual rights of those who are linked to those loans continue to apply and we will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500012#K01100","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1518696000,"counter":292,"content":"<p>The vulture funds are not regulated by the Central Bank.

Sinn F&eacute;in engaged.  We worked in good faith.  We stretched ourselves.  This time yesterday afternoon there was an accommodation with the DUP.  We had the basis of a deal.

We are crystal clear on this.  Direct rule is not an option.  The Taoiseach said in December that the Irish Government \"won&rsquo;t be supporting direct rule\".

My understanding of the accommodation that was reached is one that ensures that the Irish language is not a threat to anybody but instead is part of the diversity of Northern Ireland and part of the identity of many who live there who see the Irish language as part of who they are and who do not want to force that part of who they are on anybody else.

She travelled here this morning with her mother Tricia from Mayo.  Aisling had rods inserted when she was a young child because she had scoliosis.  In 2014, the rods had to be removed as they were infected and she went on the waiting list for surgery to get rods reinserted.  Aisling was under the care of a consultant orthopaedic surgeon in University Hospital Galway.  I first had contact with Aisling in early 2015 as I had been raising many questions about the Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin.  I will read out a few lines from a letter from the consultant in University Hospital Galway:<\/p><blockquote>Aisling is one of approximately 40 people under my direct care that require major complex spinal surgery at Galway University Hospitals.  She has been placed on a waiting list for some time for this to occur and in the current context of allocation of resource to me at my hospital I do not see it happening easily for the foreseeable future.<\/blockquote><p>This is exactly what happened.  She was transferred to a consultant in Tallaght Hospital.  Her first consultation was in January 2016.  Aisling was assessed and put on the surgery list as a priority.  Eventually, she was given a date of 5 September 2017.  She had to come up to Dublin for pre-operative assessment, scans and X-rays.  It is complex surgery so Aisling and her family and friends were anxious and had to arrange travel and time off work.  It was cancelled by the surgeon due to personal matters.  That can happen.  It was a huge letdown.  The operation was rescheduled for 28 November 2017.  Again, she underwent pre-operative assessment, X-rays and scans.  It involved getting organised, getting her bags packed and anxiety.  At the eleventh hour, the operation was again cancelled due to personal matters.  This was a massive letdown mentally and physically for Aisling.<\/p><p>To add insult to injury, to date, the consultant has made no professional contact with or arrangement to meet Aisling despite her ringing him continuously.  Every time she does so, the surgeon is out due to personal matters, his secretary has not spoken to him, he is busy between Tallaght Hospital and Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin or he is out sick.  In the mean time, Aisling's curve is now 70%.  There is a danger that her walk, structure and organs will be affected.  Her life is on hold.  She gets terrible spasms of pain and often ends up in accident and emergency departments or stays in bed for days.  Aisling cannot plan her future.<\/p><p>Let us be honest.  Is this acceptable?  Does the Government stand over a health service that treats patients this way?  The Minister for Health knows about this case.  I brought it to his attention two weeks ago and rang his PA yesterday to say that I would be raising this issue today.  I am surprised he is not here in the Chamber to meet Aisling.  Aisling is seeking an honest answer and expects an honest reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500014#M00300","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1518697200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for giving some notice of this question so that I could give her a proper answer.  We have been in contact with the Minister's office and he has been in contact with the hospital involved regarding this case.  I am happy to meet Aisling after Leaders' Questions if that would be helpful.  We received a letter from the hospital this morning.  The Deputy may not have seen it yet because it has only just been sent but it does confirm that Tallaght Hospital is committed to completing the procedure in three months' time.  The Deputy asked whether we could outsource this operation or whether it could be done abroad.  My understanding is that it is too complex an operation for that to be done.  Undertaking the procedure involves two consultant doctors because of its complexity.  One of those consultants is not available for personal reasons between now and when it can be done but we have a commitment in writing today that this procedure will take place in three months' time so I hope that will give Aisling and her family some certainty.  I and, I am sure, many others in this House know what it is like to work with families whose members have scoliosis.  As people grow and as their spine does not develop as it should, all sorts of other complexities emerge apart from it being extremely painful.  I understand the time issues here and why they are important, which is why we are trying to provide clarity for the family and Aisling.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to say that the Minister introduced a paediatric scoliosis action plan last year which is delivering real results.  As a result of that action plan, 321 surgeries took place in 2017 compared with 220 in 2016.  This represents a 46% increase in activity.  The HSE has confirmed that it will maintain a four-month target into 2018 and beyond, which is international best practice in terms of limiting waiting times for people who need clinical care and surgery.

This is an arse-covering exercise as far as I can see because the hospital had plenty of time from 29 January 2018, which was when I put in the question.  The Minister for Health knew about this two weeks ago.  Are we saying that patients have to wait for consultants at the consultants' call?  Two operations have been cancelled while there has been no contact with the patient to date and we are talking about it taking place in three months' time.  Are we saying that this consultant is the only consultant who can do this surgery?  If that is the case, the HSE is in trouble.  If the consultant died tomorrow, and I would not wish it on the man, what would happen then?  Are we saying there is no other consultant there to do it?  This is an emergency case.  She is a priority.  If it cannot be done here within a reasonable period of time, not three months because something else could happen in three months' time, we should bring some expert over from London or Europe to carry out this surgery.  Would the T&aacute;naiste accept waiting for four years?  Would he accept his daughter walking around in severe pain for four years?  It is not acceptable and the health service should be able to respond and service its patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500014#M00500","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1518697200,"counter":330,"content":"<p>The Deputy probably knows that it is not as straightforward as that, particularly with regard to very complex cases involving scoliosis.

I refer to how this is impacting on small to medium sized enterprises, SMEs, by using the example of Templemore Garda College.  There are 600 people on-site serving 2,000 meals a day.  Up to now, purchases were made from local suppliers.  There are 31 local suppliers from across Tipperary, in places such as Templemore, Thurles, Roscrea, Nenagh and Newport, that have traditionally supplied the needs of the college.  They are mostly small family businesses.  They are reputable and reliable and work long hours to give exceptional service with high standards and good quality food.  It is quality food on the doorstep of the college.  Until now the management of the college always dealt with these matters.  It is capable, competent and efficient.  For instance, it tendered locally for a butcher and got three suppliers.  The management bargained, got the best price and reached agreements, and those agreements were honoured by both sides.  Above all, they always came in within the budget available.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda College has been put under the spotlight in a persistent prolonged period of allegations and questions concerning historical events.  This has involved several appearances by Garda management before the Committee of Public Accounts, with a subsequent stream of negative publicity.  There is no doubt that this exercise has been damaging to the reputation of the college.  The current administration of the college has been left answering questions about practices that happened under senior personnel many years ago, most of whom have retired or moved on to different positions.  The college has been unfairly undermined and the administration and its capacity to govern deliberately questioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500015#N00800","speaker":"1240"},{"type":"speech","time":1518697800,"counter":339,"content":"<p>By Deputy Kelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500015#N00900","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1518697800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Arising from this episode, changes have been introduced, in particular to the procurement policy of purchasing goods and services.  All decisions regarding the purchasing of supply items to the college have been removed from local management.  They will now be under the control of the Office of Government Procurement.  This is a significant and alarming development for the small businesses in the Templemore area supplying the needs of the college and they have now lost out.  Those people were informed last week and of 31 local suppliers, 26 have lost out.  They are disillusioned, disheartened and angry.  They have lost out and, effectively, have been locked out.  Their services have been dismissed in an impersonal and hurtful manner.  This business was the core of their businesses and jobs are threatened as a result of this decision, which does not make economic sense.  Faceless people in a Dublin office are now going to be making decisions about purchasing for the kitchen in Templemore and controlling the management of the kitchen.  It does not make sense and it very damaging and unfair to the local suppliers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500015#N01000","speaker":"1240"},{"type":"speech","time":1518697800,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I am sure the Deputies are aware that the financial practices and procedures at the Garda College in Templemore were the subject of public controversy last year and were examined in great detail by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Government has no direct role in the management of the finances of the Garda College.  The Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the organisation.  The Garda Vote is subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  They have taken a particularly active approach in examining matters concerning the Garda College.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised the Garda College in Templemore previously had an historic practice, as the Deputy outlined, of purchasing food from local businesses.  Following the public controversy last year, I understand the Committee of Public Accounts was particularly concerned the college had directly engaged local suppliers in the community rather than following correct procurement procedures.  I am informed that a tendering process in accordance with the public procurement rules is now almost complete.  Successful tenderers have been notified and the outcome of the tendering process is subject to a two-week cooling off period.<\/p>  <p>  I can understand the frustrations of the local businesses concerned.  The communications between the Garda College and those suppliers, who may not have been successful through this tendering process, sounds like it could have been much better.  However, it is important to note the controversy we have been through in respect of procurement procedures in Templemore and how money was allocated and spent.  The Garda needs to lead by example in these things.  That is why there is now strict adherence to the procurement rules in respect of how contracts are assigned.  I regret that has had a negative consequence for many local businesses.  However, given the history of this over the last six to eight months, it is understandable how it has developed the way it has. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500015#N01100","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1518697800,"counter":342,"content":"<p>This does not just affect Templemore.

Precarious employment is a plague affecting large numbers of workers and one of the most terrible consequences of three decades of neoliberal policy under the guise of flexibility and competitiveness, two of the favourite words of employers.  As a result, the conditions of employment for hundreds of thousands of workers have been severely degraded.  Once upon a time, workers could expect some employment security and some sense of what their working week or month would look like.  Nowadays, hundreds of thousands of workers are in temporary employment and do not know from week to week or month to month what hours they will work and, as a consequence, what earnings they will have.  This has serious financial and personal implications for the workers in question, many of whom are women with families who suffer particularly from this type of precarious employment.<\/p>  <p>  Precarious employment has serious impacts on family life and workers' ability to plan and have a life because they do not know how many hours they will work or how much they will earn.  For example, the notion of securing a mortgage has become a complete fantasy for large numbers of workers owing to the precarious nature of their employment and the remuneration they may receive for it.  In any event, low pay also plagues the sectors in which precarious employment is rife.  Approximately 20% of workers in this country are low paid and in working in terrible, precarious jobs. <\/p>  <p>  To put some perspective on the claims of economic recovery and the often trumpeted figures about employment, for which the Government slaps itself on the back, despite the increase in employment in recent years, there are now 109,000 fewer permanent jobs than there were in 2008.  The ongoing process of implementing neoliberal policy in this country, which has been largely championed by the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il parties for three decades, intensified during the period of austerity.  For neoliberals, the crash was as if all their birthdays had arrived at once because the economic downturn provided employers with an excuse to ramp up precarious employment.  Workers were so desperate for employment that employers had the whip hand and were able to employ people under precarious conditions.  The quality of life of hundreds of thousands of low paid workers is diminished greatly by having to put up with these conditions.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting the deterioration in the quality of life for workers in precarious employments when compared with the conditions enjoyed by previous generations of workers who could expect to be able to put a roof over their heads, make plans in life and obtain a pension.  All of these expectations have been degraded for large numbers of workers.  At the same time, many people have done very well because profits have increased significantly as a result of this development in the past decade. <\/p>  <p>  It is not the case that we all felt the same pain in the past ten years.  With the exception of 2008, employers have been doing better under austerity.  The economic collapse worked for employers and the rich because it gave them the whip hand and allowed them to drive up profits.  Since 2008, profits have gone through the roof.  As I have noted several times, wealth inequality has grown dramatically and is linked to the downgrading of conditions for workers and a consequent boost of profits for employers.  Another indicator of how the balance has shifted in favour of employers to the detriment of workers is that while wages accounted for approximately 60% of national income in the 1970s, with profits and shares accounting for the remaining 40%, the inverse is now the case.  In Ireland, this reversal has been more significant that in any other country in Europe, with 60% of the national cake currently going to employers in the form of profits and only 40% going to workers.  There has been a dramatic shift of wealth from the have-nots to the haves in recent decades, as reflected in the astonishing rise in wealth inequality in society.<\/p>  <p>  On the face of it, the Bill attempts to address some aspects of precarious employment.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions sent a letter to the Minister after it published a document on precarious work.  In its executive summary, ICTU makes a number of demands for dealing with precarious employment, including the provision of statements of core conditions and compensation for employees who are called into work to find they are not given hours of work, measures to deal with banded hours and the imposition of penalties on employers who fail to comply with legal requirements.<\/p><p>On the face of it, the Government has responded to the lobbying of the trade union movement but in looking at the detail, we can see the Government has diluted the propositions to the point where the Bill will be barely effective at all in many circumstances.<\/p> <p> We can give some examples of how the Government has diluted the proposals.  The bands proposed by the Government in the Bill are so wide as to give enormous flexibility to employers to continue imposing a great deal of precariousness on affected workers.  The first band is between one and ten hours and there is a hell of a difference between one hour and nine hours.  The next band is between 11 and 24 hours; if a contract indicates a person will generally work 12 hours in a week but that person consistently works 23 hours per week, under the Government's proposals that worker will not move into a different band and will have no claim to say the employer is being unfair.  This can be systematically abused.  In contrast, Deputy Cullinane's Bill on banded hours had several more bands.  If the hours people were asked to work by the employer varied on a regular basis across the narrower bands, the worker could claim to move to a different band and for this to be acknowledged as a condition of employment.  This suits the employers and does not really change much in what they will do in abusing the position of many vulnerable workers.<\/p> <p> If a person is trying to plan life around kids, family and time off, having to do everything people have to do, with the variation in a working pattern up to 13 hours in a week, it can have a huge impact.  If that happens on a regular basis, there would potentially be enormous consequences for family, earnings and all the knock-on effects.  This could happen systematically even if this legislation is passed, so it is not good enough and must be substantially amended.<\/p> <p> There are similar concerns with the compensation for workers called in who do not receive work.  The University of Limerick, which did the study that is supposed to inform this legislation, proposed that if a person was called in but did not get work, he or she would get the normal wage for that employment for three hours.  Under this legislation, the payment rate will be the national minimum wage, which is substantially less than the payment that could be due in many cases, unless it is covered by an employment regulation order.  Many types of employment are not covered by those orders, so that is not good enough.  The Government must explain why it has diluted and downgraded compensation that would accrue to employees called in under those circumstances.<\/p> <p> The provision of contracts and statements of terms and conditions within five days is an improvement but there is a big problem that is fundamental to this Bill.  Workers' rights and employment legislation are as we speak being flouted left, right and centre.  Even the existing inadequate and weak legislation is being flouted all over the place.  I mentioned the Boland's Mills site, which is an iconic site connected to the 1916 Rising, which is seeing enormous redevelopment.  The main contractor there will also be doing the new national children's hospital.  I have heard reports of workers, many but not all of them immigrant workers, getting paid dramatically less than the sectoral rate for the area by a subcontractor.  These workers feel very vulnerable and do not know their rights and entitlements.  Part of the problem is that the main contractor can wash its hands of this as a subcontractor has been brought in.  The subcontractor keeps changing name and it has operated under several guises.  Those workers are very vulnerable and frightened and they do not know their rights.  They are being underpaid dramatically and they are not getting payslips.<\/p> <p> I know this because an Irish person employed as a foreman on that site complained about the underpayment of these workers and the fact that many workers, including himself, were not getting payslips.  He said he would not put up with it unless something was done.  He started a protest but nothing has been done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500021#T00400","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518701700,"counter":508,"content":"<p>To whom did he complain?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500022#X00200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1518701700,"counter":509,"content":"<p>He complained to the employer.  That is the problem.  Unless there will be a very proactive move by the authorities, with inspections and raids happening on a much greater level, all the legislation in the world will make no difference.  A person is legally entitled to a payslip but workers are not getting them.  Such practice is rampant in the construction industry.  There is also the problem of agencies, as it means there is a buffer for the main contractor, which might be responsible for big sites.  This legislation does not deal with agencies abusing people at will with respect to hours of employment.  If anybody kicks up about such issues, he or she is gone and will not get work again for months.  What will we do about this?<\/p>  <p>  The final demand of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, is not included in the legislation.  I have raised it, along with many others here, time and again.  It is bogus self-employment, which is rampant in construction and other areas.  There are serious allegations about this happening in the film industry and we have been getting reports similar to what we have received week in, week out, month in, month out, year in and year out from construction workers for the past decade.  If workers walk on to a site and ask for PAYE employment, they can forget it as they will be shown the door.  They either agree to being classified as subcontractor or they can forget it.  The employer does not want to have any responsibility or give sick or holiday pay, or the various entitlements a person might have in direct employment.<\/p>  <p>  It is very obviously the case that these workers are not entrepreneurs.  The numbers of supposed entrepreneurs in construction are ridiculous, with the latest figures at approximately 60,000 from the total construction work force of approximately 130,000.  Nearly half of construction workers in this country seem to be entrepreneurs, including the labourers.  It is an absolute joke.  To be classified as self-employed and an entrepreneur, a series of conditions must be met but they do not apply to these workers.  Nobody is independently assessing this and instead the employer can go online and classify people as self-employed.  That is the way it works.  The onus is put on the worker again in this respect.  When I mention the problem in this House I am told a worker can get on to the Revenue Commissioners and complain but if they do this, they will get sacked or blacklisted and never get on a site again.  That is what happens.  We now see allegations of similar carry-on in the film industry.  None of it is dealt with in the legislation.<\/p><p> We will support the passage of the Bill because anything is better than nothing but I do not believe the suggestion that it will substantially address the plague of precarious employment which is affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.  There are too many get-out clauses.  It looks to me as if the employers have lobbied the Government intensively to dilute the legislation to ensure that it is easy for them to get around it.  This is not good enough because, to return to my original point, profits have gone through the roof in every single sector where precarious and temporary employment and bogus self-employment are rampant.  These are the sectors that have seen dramatic increases in profitability.  Precarious employment is good for some but it is very bad for huge numbers of workers, and employers are lobbying and having an influence on the framing of this legislation which the Government claimed would address the issue of precarity.<\/p> <p> We will seek to amend the Bill and I suspect many others will too.  I welcome that we are at least debating it but we have to go a hell of a lot further than this if we are to address the problem.<\/p> <p> In my last 43 seconds, I will raise one other matter about the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which is the appeals process.  Take, for example, the Rhatigan dispute where the workers had a ruling in their favour.  Rhatigan appealed it and the matter went into the social welfare appeals office where the appeal hearing was a kangaroo court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500022#X00300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518702300,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500023#Y00200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1518702300,"counter":512,"content":"<p>It was a kangaroo court.

To be perfectly honest, this area is becoming like that of tax legislation.  In other words, people in HR departments continually review and change work arrangements to beat, if one likes, the system of labour and wage regulation.  The Government needs to acknowledge and wake up to that fact.<\/p>  <p>  During my time in government, one of the first things I did was raise the minimum wage by &euro;1 per hour, reversing the reduction introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party at the height of the crisis.  When I was T&aacute;naiste, I got the agreement of Fine Gael to bring in the Low Pay Commission and to introduce the only labour legislation throughout the EU, and certainly in any of the countries which had experienced economic collapses such as Ireland's, to give additional powers to trade unions and strengthen provision in the area of collective bargaining.<\/p>  <p>  The concept of what a job is and what is work is important.  We all know how important work is to people and how important it is that they can get work.  One of the very good things of recent years is the fact that, notwithstanding the 330,000 jobs lost at the height of the crisis, many people have been able to return to work.  In some cases, people have set up their own businesses.  All of that has been positive.  The concept of work, however, is that a person will do work which is satisfying and important to him or her or gives experience so that the person can go on to do those things that he or she wants to do.  It is important to people's lives and well-being.  Furthermore, if people work hard, they can support themselves and their family.  Through their PRSI contributions and taxation, they can collectively provide for a social insurance and social welfare system that will provide for income support in periods of unemployment and for pension entitlement on retirement.  That is the way the social democratic model works and it has worked well in countries such as Germany, Austria and those in Scandinavia.  It has also worked well here for generations.<\/p>  <p>  The other key element is collective bargaining, but the Fine Gael Party is highly adverse to it.  For the social democratic model to work, it must include collective bargaining.  Fine Gael shies away from collective bargaining, however, and we can see that running through this legislation.  Although the Bill seeks to improve on the serious flaws and gaps in current legislation, it simply does not go far enough, and this is not in our interests as a country.  We want to attract more development, employment, business and foreign direct investment.  We also want to develop Ireland in a way which provides employment and all of the different things we want in our society, whether that is education, health care, public development or public works.<\/p>  <p>  When I was a Minister, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions brought to my attention issues relating to this area, including the issue of bogus self-employment.  After a long wait and continuing questioning on my part of the Taoiseach on the matter, the report was finally published in the past week or two.  It was approximately ten days ago.  Lo and behold, there was no debate or discussion.  In two tables, however, the report showed that there was a loss to the Exchequer of approximately &euro;60 million in tax and social welfare revenue as a consequence of disguised or bogus self-employment, or whatever one might want to call it.  That is part of the problem.  There are very few days a Government will sniff at recovering an extra &euro;60 million in either PRSI or taxation because that money would go into the collective to fund our system and give people assurance.<\/p><p>Will the Minister arrange a debate in the House on the report on bogus self-employment?  Why is the Government looking this gift horse of &euro;60 million in tax and social welfare receipts in the mouth?  It deserves a debate.  The Minister made a short comment when the report was released but it received almost no media attention.<\/p> <p> From my ministerial experience in this area over five and a half years, there are two sectors of workers who face particular difficulties, namely, younger workers, particularly those under 25, and older workers, particularly those over 55.  If they have had spells of unemployment, be they in an urban or in a rural area, they may find it extremely difficult to get a job.  They are extremely vulnerable when it comes to precarious work.  We need to take a sectoral approach to this and provide for a mechanism over and above the Low Pay Commission.  I put forward this in the previous Government and Fine Gael agreed to it on a limited basis.  I also appointed my colleague, Senator Ged Nash, as Minister of State in the then Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to work on the required legislation and on which he did a good job.  As this field is evolving so rapidly, however, it is difficult to keep up with the development of the structures, which continuously outrun and outwit the formal structure.<\/p> <p> One of the best protections against this would be for the Minister to work in partnership with both employers and with the representatives of employees, particularly the trade unions.  Including in this legislation a framework for an ongoing social partnership would be the greatest guarantee for the Minister and the Government, ensuring they would be advised and informed of new mechanisms emerging.  This was traditional but disappeared at the height of the crisis, partly because it got a bad name.  When I was in government, I argued strongly for a social dialogue, which was essentially the beginning of a return to social partnership.  If we really want to tackle this issue, we need more institutional development.<\/p> <p> Our society has a difficulty with certain kinds of jobs where the skills of our people are now being intensely sought internationally.  We sorted this issue out with primary school teachers when the Labour Party was in government.  However, we have researchers and teachers in colleges and universities whose skills are highly sought internationally.  Our society invested in their education and in the development of their PhDs and other postgraduate qualifications.  However, they have no proper employment contract structure or security.  The bands set out by the Minister are too wide.  Far more bands are needed to ensure it is possible to address different situations where, for periods, the amount of work available might be relatively small.  However, as the person builds up in a job, there may be a callous disregard for that individual's right to employment.  Accordingly, they may never get a permanent contract.<\/p> <p> What are the social implications of this?  If a skilled university researcher, qualified secondary school teacher or third level librarian is not able to get an actual contract of employment, it may mean that when they want to get a mortgage, they have no status of employment.  In turn, this will prevent them from buying a home for themselves or their family.  That is tearing the social fabric of the society apart.  The Minister needs to give thought as to how she will strengthen the power of employers, employer organisations and the trade unions to have a social partnership which will seek to address these issues.  As I said, the idea of social partnership is deeply unfashionable with Fine Gael.  However, without that kind of structure, it is impossible to keep up with what is happening in the employment field.<\/p> <p> Young people, those over 55 and those who live in jobless households, if they cannot get part-time or full-time employment, are more likely to be at risk of poverty than other groups.  The economist, Joseph Stiglitz, who has written extensively on poverty, acknowledges the European model of social welfare and supports in Ireland has prevented the kind of poverty levels one sees in societies, such as Greece, where the social welfare system is either limited or non-existent over large elements of the economy.  Similarly in the United States, if one loses employment, one loses medical insurance and so forth.  In turn, as there is no replacement, one can sink rapidly down to losing one's home and so on.  Joseph Stiglitz commends the European model, which we have here.  While we need to strengthen it, all the longitudinal surveys showed that, notwithstanding our economic crash, our social welfare system saved significant numbers of people from falling into poverty.  Joseph Stiglitz acknowledged this in his writings and when he visited UCD.<\/p> <p> Is the Minister open to amending the Bill to ensure strengthening of the social welfare and work protection framework in order that a job is treated in law as employment and the worker acquires rights?  Is she prepared to address the bogus self-employment issue in which she is losing out on &euro;50 million a year?  The Labour Party will be happy to work with the Minister to achieve these two measures.<\/p> <p> Notwithstanding all the work already done in providing younger people with opportunities around apprenticeships, little progress has been made by this Government.  Apprenticeship numbers are staggeringly low.<\/p><p>While I welcome the new apprenticeships in finance and insurance, the old model in the construction trade, which is returning to high levels of activity, whereby plasterers and so on used to take on one, two or three apprentices, is no longer available with small employers.  Many young people would love to take up apprenticeships as sparks, plumbers or so on in construction or the motor trade, but that option is not available to them because the structure of those industries means that the small traditional employers who used to provide apprenticeships can no longer do so.  Larger companies can, however.  During my time, we got the ESB to restart recruiting electrical apprentices.  Many large companies, including the one doing the work on Leinster House, are employing a large number of apprentices, which is great.  If we keep building at this pace, however, and in light of all the new housing that we will build, we will not have enough people to do the skilled work.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government knows this.  As such, the Government must think afresh about how to get young people who are interested in a range of trades into good apprenticeships and how to give them the opportunity to get qualifications and well-paid, regulated jobs with good terms and conditions, as provided for in the legislation.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection should set up a monitoring unit in her Department if one is not already there.  Since my time, employment has moved into her Department.  Just as is the case with other areas of activity that are examined, there should be a unit that monitors continuously whether there are negative developments in respect of workers' rights.  When I entered the Department, one of the tragedies of the time was that so many building companies had collapsed and gone into liquidation.  The then Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was not able to cope with the level of demand for redundancy payments.  The then Department of Social Protection took that function over, built platforms and ensured that people received their redundancy payments within a relatively short period.  If a monitoring unit was established in conjunction with social partnerships, given that this is a social partnership model requirement, it would be possible to examine those areas where employment patterns do not allow people to earn a decent living wage, have proper terms and conditions and have access to the social welfare system in a way that would grant them entitlements in the event of experiencing periods of unemployment or other difficulties for which they would need social welfare support.<\/p> <p> If-and-when contracts are not properly covered in this legislation, but they should be.  The bands are too few and too wide.  The House should be able to agree that this matter can be addressed immediately in the form of an amendment.  The legislation will be no good if it does not help the person who is in an exploitative situation and needs proper terms and conditions.  When replying, the Minister might be in a position to make those commitments for the benefit of workers throughout the country.<\/p> <p> I see people cycling around Dublin on Deliveroo bikes and carrying large boxes.  I was a student and I worked in all kinds of jobs down the years.  We have all done that, but to think that grown men and women - men, in particular - might spend large parts of their lives as human carriers on the streets of our cities without having proper terms and conditions is sad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500023#Y02200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518703500,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I appreciate the views that have been expressed today and yesterday.  They have been useful for me and my officials, and I am looking forward to what will obviously be a humdinger of a debate when we get to Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  Everyone inside and outside the House will agree that every worker and, indeed, human being has the right to be treated with dignity and respect.  We have a right to be respected by one another.  Most importantly in a work situation, we have the right to be respected by our employers.  That is why this and the previous Government - yesterday, I mentioned Senator Nash and the Ministers of State, Deputies Breen and Mitchell O'Connor, as well as the tremendous amount of work and consultation that the officials have undertaken in the past three years - worked to introduce this legislation.  We want to ensure that we have copper-fastened in our law the dignity and respect that we should adhere to in society.<\/p>  <p>  I will revisit a number of the points that were made during the debate.  I value Deputy Burton's opinion, given that she spent five years in this Department, although it is now slightly different.  She has an intense interest in this area, not least because of her political ideology.  Like some other Deputies, however, she suggested that we were doing nothing to protect people on if-and-when contracts.  That is not correct.  The banded hours provision will apply to people on if-and-when contracts so that when they have worked an average number of hours over the 18-month reference period, they will be entitled to be placed on a band of hours that reflects the reality of the hours they have worked during that time.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act will require an employer to inform employees by the fifth day after commencing their employment with that company what the employer reasonably expects the normal length of their working day and working week to be.  An established intention of what their work will be will be given to them.  An employer will be required to state the expected duration of the contract and whether it is a temporary or fixed term.<\/p>  <p>  Employees on if-and-when contracts will benefit from the new minimum compensation provisions where they are given notice of work but, after they show up, they do not get that work.  They will also benefit from the anti-penalisation provisions, in that, if an employer penalises an employee for raising a query or issue or for exercising any of his or her rights under existing laws, he or she will be entitled to pursue the matter with the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Penrose stated that a person on an if-and-when contract would have no recourse to employment rights bodies.  With respect, that is not true.  It is well established in the jurisprudence of the constitutional courts and the Labour Court that they will look behind the written terms of a contract to establish the true nature of an arrangement.  The particular concern that Deputy Penrose raised was addressed in the Labour Court in a case, entitled Ticketline Trading as Ticketmaster and Sarah Mullen.  The court accepted that, while the written contract of employment was that of an if-and-when type with no mutuality of obligation, it was operated on the basis that the employee was required to be available for work at all times and, therefore, was entitled to the protections of the Organisation of Work Time Act, in particular the compensations provided for under section 18.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the prohibition of zero-hour contracts, while we understand and agree with the University of Limerick, UL, that such contracts are thankfully not prevalent in Ireland, we want to ensure that it stays that way.  Prohibiting such contracts except in some very limited and specific circumstances will help to achieve this goal.  However, it is important for everyone to understand that we are not saying in this Bill that all casual or flexible working arrangements are wrong and should be stopped.  It is worth recalling that the UL study acknowledged that the flexibility offered by genuine casual work can be mutually beneficial for employees and employers in some cases.  In certain sectors, such arrangements can help employers to satisfy peak demands and fill staffing gaps on a short-term basis.  It has often been mentioned in this debate that flexible arrangements only suit the employer.<\/p><p>In some cases they do suit the employee, for example, students working during holiday periods, individuals who need to work around caring responsibilities for children or older people, or semi-retired persons who might only want to work hours that suit them on a flexible basis.  We have to acknowledge that only a very small section of the community are engaged in casual work and that it works for them.  While it has also been suggested employers will deliberately miscategorise employees as casual, it is important to remember that section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 refers to work of a casual nature but does not define it.  In the 20 years since it was enacted, it has not led to a regulatory problem with employers incorrectly categorising employees as casual.  The fears expressed about the Bill not specifically categorising or defining casual work are probably unfounded.  Like all legislation, if, 12 months after it is introduced, it is not doing exactly what it says on the tin, we can reflect on it.  It is not good practice to include definitions in legislation when the plain, ordinary meaning of a word is capable of being understood by all of the bodies responsible for adjudicating on it.  The WRC and the Labour Court are capable of examining all of the circumstances of particular cases and making an appropriate judgment on whether a particular arrangement is genuinely casual, as they have been doing for the past 20 years.<\/p> <p> Regarding the penalisation provisions, it is very important that all employees feel safe in order that they can exercise their employment rights without fear of being punished for doing so.  It is worth bearing in mind that the penalisation provisions included in the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 were broadly drafted to cover a wide range of scenarios in which an employee could be adversely treated.  The relevant provisions mirror all of those in other employment legislation and are core to the Bill, the new banded hours provisions in particular.  Under the banded hour provisions, if an employer reduces an employee's working hours or even threatens to do so because the employee sought to exercise his or her right, the employee can pursue a penalisation case to the WRC.  He or she would be awarded anything up to two year's salary if the adjudication officer finds on the balance of probabilities that he or she was penalised for invoking his or her right under the Organisation of Working Time Act.  <\/p> <p> A number of Deputies have expressed concern that employees will have to wait 18 months post-enactment of the Bill to benefit from the banded hours provisions.  I want to be forceful on this issue.  They have potentially misunderstood the Bill.  Perhaps they have read it, but their concerns are misplaced.  I assure everybody that that is not what we intend.  I draw attention to the proposed new section 18A(14) which specifically states a continuous period of employment before the commencement of the section will be reckonable as the reference period of the look-back period.  In other words, if the section is commenced on 1 July 2018, an employee who commenced work on 1 January 2017 will be entitled from 1 July 2018 to seek to have a band of hours that reflects the 18 month period before the day it was enacted.  Last night Deputies raised concerns that if we did not enact the Bill until the summer, people would have to wait for a further 18 months.  That is not the case and it certainly is not our intention.  Almost every Deputy who spoke last night and today said the 18-month reference period was too long for the banded hours provisions.  It is fair to say we will be happy to look at the issues raised when we reach the Committee Stage amendments.  <\/p> <p> There are a number of points I would like to make.  It is important that the look-back period and the length of time an employee is statutorily entitled to stay in a band of hours remain the same.  If we are to look back 18 months, the time the employee needs to stay in the band of hours is the same.  If people want to reduce it to six months, as was suggested last night, we would only be providing security for six months.  We need to reflect very carefully and come up with something that is simple.  It is also important that we use an easy divisor; therefore, 13 months as a reference period might not be desirable from that point of view.  Nevertheless, we are genuinely willing and open to considering a reference period of 15 months.  Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall reminded us last night that the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation had recommended 12 months as the reference period, but it would not work because it would not reflect real seasonality.<\/p> <p> Several speakers expressed concern about the widths of the bands.  I understand their concerns and their points were well made.  I reiterate that the bands should be sufficiently broad to allow a reasonable degree of flexibility in managing what will be the new banded hours arrangements.  Wherever we finally pitch them, they will have to be beneficial to both employees and employers.  Many of the Deputies who have spoken are left of centre, but we have to recognise that if we do not have employers, we will not have employees.  The balance we need to strike in this legislation has to benefit both sides.  A greater number of bands with a narrower range of hours would be more difficult to manage, but we will look at the issue on Committee Stage.  We also recognise that some companies that have bargained collectively on banded hours arrangements may already have a higher number of bands with a narrower range of hours in each band, which works for particular sectors of employment.  We certainly do not want to interfere with these arrangements because they work very well for those sectors, but we have to recognise that we are not passing legislation that is specific to a particular section of the retail market or the construction industry.  We are passing legislation that will affect every employer and employee in the country.  That is something of which we have to be very conscious and we will reflect on it on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> Some Deputies asked about the schedule for the five pieces of crucial information being supplied to employees by their employers and why it was not day one instead of day five.  We need to reflect on the fact that today an employer has two months in which to provide that information.  While the University of Limerick suggested one day, we want to be reasonable to employers.  Day five is not unreasonable in the context of new employment.  To those who do not accept that day five is sufficient, it is the first time ever we have introduced a criminal offence.  We are very serious about making sure people will have their right to receive the most basic information on their employment terms of contract.  Day five is reasonable, but for somebody who takes the Mick thereafter, there should be serious consequences.  The introduction of a criminal offence sets the tone.  What we are trying to do is make sure employers will give the information.  It is the most basic information and the least we would expect to be given to employees before day five.  <\/p> <p> Different Deputies brought up the issue of compensation where workers showed up for work and none was available.  I make no apology for targeting at the low-paid the minimum payment provision.  If somebody is earning much more money, he or she will not be as adversely affected as somebody on a much lower wage who is called into work and then turned around and sent home.  He or she will not be as affected as those in a situation, as suggested last night, where ten people are called into work when the employer knows full well that it only has work for five and will give it to the first five who show up and to heck with the rest of them.  They are the ones who need to avail of the stronger provisions and that is what we will make sure we do.  It is also important to remember that the Bill deals with all employers and employees engaged in contracts of service, whether they work in the gig economy or any other part of the economy.  As is the case where an individual believes he or she is being deprived of employment rights applicable to being an employee, he or she may refer a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission where it can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication, leading to a decision that will be enforceable through the District Court.<\/p> <p> There is a section in my Department to which Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett referred.  If there is anybody who has a difficulty in establishing his or her employment status, he or she can make a case independent of his or her employer to the scope division and it will be adjudicated on.  If there are issues, they can be backdated.  An established practice will be established in the context of what the person's social insurance contribution should be, including whether he or she is self-employed or employed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500025#AA00200","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518704100,"counter":536,"content":"<p>What if they are vulnerable workers who are afraid?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500026#BB00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1518704100,"counter":537,"content":"<p>We need to get past that issue.

I am not saying the scary examples the Deputy gave are not true, but in that case I need to do more to make sure people are not afraid.  The penalisation measures included in the Bill, with what is in place in the scope division, will be complementary to make sure it is employers who should be afraid, not employees.<\/p><p>That is why we are going to pass this Bill.  I know the Deputies all want to make amendments to it and that is fine.  We can discuss it.  The reason for passing this legislation is to make sure that employees are treated with dignity and respect by the people they work for.<\/p> <p> Deputies have referred to the fact that employers have been yielding huge profits over recent years.  It would be remiss of me not to say that when a company is making money, the people responsible for its success are those who work for it.  Business owners who do not reflect on that are exceptionally foolish.  A happy workforce is an exceptionally productive one.  We all have people working for us in our local teams and in here and we all know that the more respect is paid to employees, the more they give back.  That is what this legislation will achieve, as amended by those who will make amendments in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p> Many have said that while this legislation will be great, if it does not have the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, inspectors to make sure it is implemented it will sit on a shelf and not be read.  We have spoken to the WRC which has told us categorically that it is well equipped and has enough inspectors to be able to manage this legislation.  It was brought to my attention last week that it set itself a target in the back of its annual report last year, expecting this legislation to be passed this year.  I welcome that.  As we should do with all legislation, if after a few months we reflect on it and find that it is not doing what we expected it to do, we will come back here to amend it.  That may involve something as simple as giving more inspectors to the WRC.  Our aim is to make sure employees feel comfortable making complaints and that those will be adjudicated on with respect for their dignity.  They will have a sense of self-worth by getting up every day to go to a job they like, that pays the wages, and that allows them to have financial stability and to be treated with respect by other human beings who are making money off their backs.<\/p> <p> I know the Deputies opposite will support the Bill because they want to do what I want to do, and we will come to a happy conclusion on Committee Stage and get a Bill that will protect workers.

I welcome many of the measures in this Bill, which is trying to bring about some measure of control over this problem for the sake our children and grandchildren.<\/p>  <p>  The drinks industry is lobbying hard for changes to this Bill.  We have to consider what it has done in recent years such as introducing alcopops which have a high alcohol content and, because they are very sweet and easy to drink, can be consumed in large quantities, leading to serious health issues.  It has made cheap drink available.  The industry might argue that it is the retail outlets that sell cheap but I think it is a combination of both.  I welcome the introduction of minimum pricing.<\/p>  <p>  There is a proposal to state on the label that alcohol can cause cancer.  It may cause cancer, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and other health problems.  Should we consider a label that states \"Alcohol seriously damages your health\", as opposed to specifying a disease such as cancer?  Should we look to the industry to fund the HSE and the Government to produce advertisements showing the harmful effects of alcohol?  People can then make up their own minds.  The alcohol industry will always be one step ahead of us when it comes to advertising.  It will always come up with a smarter advertising campaign that will grab the consumer's attention.  It might be a better strategy to have the ability and the money to fight back with advertising campaigns that show its harmful effects.<\/p>  <p>  We should also reconsider the restrictions on advertising.  If the industry has to move away from television, it will go to the Internet.  No matter how big we build the mousetrap, the mouse will always get bigger.  We really need to be as clever as the industry and inform people accordingly.  These amendments came in late in the day.  I would like the Minister to consider them.  If we can come up with a better way to inform our population about the harmful effects of alcohol, we should do that.  I understand that in France advertising of alcohol was banned approximately 30 years ago.  What effect has that had?  We could learn from the mistakes or otherwise of places that have banned advertising.  I urge that this Bill be passed speedily.  It is urgently needed to educate our population and stop it from continuing to overconsume alcohol and especially to stop the scourge of binge drinking among the younger generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500027#CC00800","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1518704700,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I support this landmark Bill.  It is a game changer in many respects.  It has the same significance as the smoking ban introduced in 2004 in the teeth of strong opposition from vested interests.  The time has come to confront our difficult relationship with alcohol.<\/p><p>As a society, we cannot ignore the problem of harmful drinking anymore.  The Bill is a major attempt to improve health, well-being and mortality in this country.<\/p> <p> There has been a delay in enacting this Bill.  It passed Second Stage in the Seanad in December 2015 so there has been an extraordinary delay in getting the Second Stage debate underway in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Again, this demonstrates the power of the drinks lobby in this country.  There has been extensive lobbying on this Bill.  I have been lobbied by a number of parties.  On 1 February 2018, I met with the chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance of Ireland, Professor Frank Murray, in Beaumont Hospital.  Professor Murray is consultant gastroenterologist and hepatologist in Beaumont Hospital.  He certainly presented to me the reality of the alcohol problem in Ireland in a very strong way.  We do have a problem.  It has been outlined by many of the speakers here.  The cost to our economy of the alcohol problem is estimated to be &euro;2.35 billion annually.  It is a fact that every major family event or celebratory occasion in this country is dominated by alcohol, be it First Holy Communion, a wedding, a graduation or indeed the festival of Christmas itself.  Alcohol is front and centre at these events and this attitude must change.  I detect a small change in public attitudes but, obviously, more work needs to be done in that regard.  It is estimated that three people die every day in Ireland as a result of alcohol.  We all know the problems associated with excessive use of alcohol - absenteeism, problems in our health care system, a strain on our health services, problems relating to crime, drink driving, assaults, domestic violence, broken families, accidents and anxiety and depression, particularly among young people.  Youth suicide is a particular worry.<\/p> <p> We all know what is in this Bill.  Obviously, the main part of it involves minimum unit pricing of alcohol.  This is a targeted measure designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  It is aimed at those who drink in a harmful and dangerous manner.  I am satisfied that this is an evidence-based measure and that it is a proportionate response.<\/p> <p> I have my own anecdotal evidence relating to young people.  It is very easy for underage drinkers to get their hands on alcohol.  From my observation, young girls are drinking far more spirits.  There is also the practice of \"prinks\" where young people consume as much alcohol as possible in someone's house before going out for a night on the town.  Again, these are attitudes that need to be confronted and need to change.  We have a problem with binge drinking.  The statistics are there, particularly relating to the 18 to 24 year old age group.  It is a league we do not want to be top of and we need to do something about that.<\/p> <p> With regard to the display and visibility issue, the issue regarding the separation of alcohol products in mixed trade retail outlets has been mentioned.  A concession is proposed here.  In the interests of practicality and the reality on the ground, I support the new agreements reached on this issue.  I did visit a supermarket in my constituency and saw the situation for myself.<\/p> <p> One last concern I have relates to those on low incomes.  There is the possibility that this Bill could be particularly hard on those on low incomes, for example, somebody who might buy one or two bottles of wine a week in their local supermarket or off-licence as a little luxury.  However, we do need to see the bigger picture.  We must see what the common good is.  At the end of the day, those on low incomes are the ones who will benefit most from these measures.  This is a pragmatic response to the problem.  We must reduce our alcohol consumption in this country.  I hope this Bill has a speedy passage through the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500027#CC00900","speaker":"1360","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518705300,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I welcome any restrictions that would help.  We have a problem with excess drinking in this country with problems such as underage drinking.  However, I worry about this legislation.  I am coming with a different perspective to that of previous speakers.  I think it is too excessive.  I am talking about measures to do with labelling.  No other country in the world has mandatory cancer labels on alcohol products.  I am talking specifically about cancer.  The word \"cancer\" is a very serious one.  It is a very serious word to put on a bottle.  I am a survivor of cancer myself.  Putting the word \"cancer\" on something that is a luxury that can be abused but which is not abused by 90% of the population is very serious and we need to think long and hard before we put it on a bottle.  The Scottish try to sell their Scotch whiskey worldwide while we are trying to sell our whiskey.  Many new companies and start ups are in the market.  We promote them and then we come along with this labelling and talk about putting statements about how alcohol causes cancer on bottles.  This is a step too far.  We could put some warning that alcohol can be abused but I am worried about using the word \"cancer\" because it has repercussions across society.  The introduction of Irish-only labels will result in significant additional costs of &euro;50,000 per label according to the EY-DKM report.  Somebody travelling to France or Spain on holidays might bring back a few bottles of wine.  Will they have put labels on them when they bring them back to Ireland?  This kind of thing must be looked at.  When we sell our whiskey abroad, we will have to remove labels stating that alcohol causes cancer.  This is unfair on companies all over the country and we need to be careful how we do it.<\/p>  <p>  The advertising restrictions will make it difficult for new distilleries and breweries to market their products and compete against established brands.  The Bill will stop product innovation in Ireland, which we are trying to grow to boost jobs and SMEs, and will reduce consumer choice and competition.  Furthermore, advertisements for visitor centres that contain the name of the brand will be severely constrained.  Over 2.5 million people visit breweries and distilleries annually.  This is why I am worried about the competition end of it.  I know we must take an overall view but I worry about that end of it as well.  It has been said that the restrictions on advertising could cost Irish media &euro;20 million in lost revenue.  This is a lot of money.  I know it is for their own good but will it be a big loss to sport in this country that it will not be able make up?<\/p>  <p>  I am also worried about structural separation.  These are very significant restrictions on small grocers in small villages.  I met one woman who showed me her store, which is a little store serving a small rural population.  She does not have room in her store but she must now put in these restrictions.  She does not have the room to do this and will have to build on.  All she is selling are bottles of wine.  She is not even selling beer or whiskey.  She is just selling bottles of wine.  People come in and buy a bottle of wine, particularly at the weekend and on Friday when they get their wage package.  They buy two or three bottles of wine to drink at home.  We are going to put this kind of cost on them.  I think this is prohibitive and I think we should think again about it.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to overall alcohol consumption, we never allow for the 8 million people who visit Ireland.  We are supposed to be one of the biggest consumers of alcohol in the world.  I think we have gone from consuming fourteen point something litres per year to nine point something litres but we do not allow for the 8 million people who visit the country.  They are all included in these consumption figures.  When I visited Spain last year, of course, I drank a few extra glasses of wine.  That is natural because people are on their holidays.  This is all included.  The 8 million people who come to Ireland drink more when they are here, particularly because we are known for our Guinness and our whiskies.  Of course, they will taste the beverages we have here.  This is part of the overall picture and I think this is not being taken into account.  While I welcome any restrictions relating to the abuse of alcohol, I think this could be a step too far and could destroy our industry and what we advertise ourselves as offering, which is the nice welcome from the people of Ireland with a sup of Guinness and a drop of whiskey.  Perhaps it is a step too far.  I think it is a bit too restrictive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500028#DD00200","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1518705300,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I want to make a short contribution to this debate and put it on the record of the House that I support this Bill.  I do not drink but I do go to pubs, clubs and hotels with friends and I can have a mineral or water.<\/p><p>One thing I see from time to time is the shocking abuse of alcohol.  At times, we, as politicians, must stand up, be brave and do the right thing.  If one visits, or has a family member in, an emergency department in any part of the country at the weekend, much of what one sees late on a Friday night or a Saturday night is down to the absolute abuse of alcohol.  In recent years, I have witnessed with my own eyes what the staff, the doctors, the nurses and the ambulance people, have to go through.  It is what families have to go through also.<\/p> <p> I do not know if Members have ever seen the family of a young lad or lassie who has excess alcohol in her or his system and it is an issue of life or death called to the hospital.  The worry and distress caused to those people are shocking.  Abuse of alcohol also causes accidents and broken families.  People talk about a shortage of money, not being able to pay the mortgage and breaking up families.  The abuse of alcohol has done horrendous damage to families.<\/p> <p> I refer to violence and poverty.  Often in the case of people who are well paid, much of their money goes on alcohol.  If they have a family, that leads to poverty for that family.  Ill health is also a huge issue.  I have spoken to consultants and doctors about supporting the Bill.  They will say the abuse of alcohol is costing the health service millions of euro.  We have to take that into account.  Most of all, I refer to the worry and distress caused to families, which is why I support the Bill.<\/p> <p> Before I conclude, I refer to a couple of things of which we need to be careful.  We are giving support to breweries and we all acknowledge these are lovely little businesses.  However, I spoke to a man developing a brewery in Lanesborough, County Longford.  He hopes to bring 25,000 visitors to that village if he gets his brewery up and running.  That happens because breweries are interesting places to visit in terms of the story being told.  Locke's Distillery in Kilbeggan attracts 70,000 people a year.  It is wonderful to hear that story.<\/p> <p> To some extent, attention needs to be paid to what breweries are stating.  I partly agree with Deputy Bobby Aylward about using the word \"cancer\" the labels on bottles.  Abuse of alcohol will cause cancer.  However, abuse of certain foods will also cause cancer.  Perhaps we might look at a label stating: \"Abuse of alcohol causes ill health\".  People in the business would not be against this.<\/p> <p> People in various parts of rural Ireland are developing breweries and the stories around them.  That will be good for tourism.  As some of the proposals on labels and advertising could affect them, perhaps the Minister might take that into account.  Overall, it is my duty to be upfront and say I want to support the Bill.  However, I would like to see the one or two reservations I have addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500028#DD00300","speaker":"1342","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518705900,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to speak about the Bill.  I support its main principles, but I have a few reservations which I hope to address in the next couple of minutes.  The main aim of the Bill is to have some control.  We have had an uneasy relationship with alcohol in this country over many years.  The aims of the Bill include a minimum unit price, new labelling and structure separation.  The overall aim is to reduce the adult consumption of alcohol.<\/p>  <p>  The first issue I want to address is the minimum unit.  This is the key issue in the Bill.  We have seen strong evidence that when the price of alcohol goes up, the level of harm goes down.  That has been proved time and again.  The main aim must be to target the cheap supply of alcohol.  We have seen time and again, especially the summer, large groups of young people - I am not picking on young people - going into places and walking out with slabs of alcohol, slabs of cheap beer, on their shoulders.  That issue needs to be addressed.  One can probably get 22 or 23 cans or bottles of beer for &euro;20.  That beer is being bought to drink in an uncontrolled environment.  In the past, when we were all that little bit younger and went out to have a social drink, we probably had it in the pub where it was controlled.  If a person drank too much, he or she was told to go home or, more to the point, was brought home.  We have a situation now where there is no control whatsoever.  Cheap alcohol is being produced and sold.  That is a key issue that needs to be addressed.  A main aim of the Bill is to have a minimum unit price.  It is a starting point but we are not going far enough.<\/p>  <p>  There has been much talk about the labelling issue.  It is to be mandatory for labels on alcohol products to include information on grams of alcohol, calories, dangers to women and so on, which are very important.  Like previous speakers, I have certain concerns about the word \"cancer\" being put on labels.  Cancer can be caused by a number of things.  I am not a medical person, but I have concerns about it.  <\/p>  <p>  Like previous speakers, I express my support for local breweries and distilleries which have been a good news story in the past few years.  We have seen them spring up around the country.  The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of which I am Chairman, produced a report on the future of the tillage sector recently.  One of the key drivers of and support for the tillage sector is the development of local breweries.<\/p>  <p>  The development of these breweries is very beneficial to the promotion of tourism in an area.  I refer to the opening of a new distillery in Carlow, Walsh Whiskey Distillery.  That is a &euro;25 million investment in a local area that is crying out for something different from a tourism point of view.  It exports to 45 countries around the world.  In order for it to comply with the regulations, the company will have to have two lines producing two labels for two bottles.  That is a huge cost but not only that once its bottle arrives somewhere in Europe, it will be put on a shelf beside a bottle with no label.  It will be a huge disincentive in terms of promoting its product around the world.  We must look at the European angle in that regard.  There is a need for a European label in order that we will all be playing on a level field.  That is a huge issue.<\/p>  <p>  I support the principle of the Bill, but the labelling issue and the cost involved need to be looked at again.  We are promoting these breweries and distilleries, but we should not tie their hands behind their backs as they move forward.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue is advertising with which I have a major issue.  I ask the Minister to look at it again.  Going back to my local distillery, Walsh Whiskey Distillery, the proprietor is a man called Bernard Walsh.  He is an ambassador in terms of the promotion of tourism in Carlow, a county that is crying out for it.  He is the face of that product in the area, but in the future he will not be allowed to use his or his family's photograph on whatever advertisements he may have and - correct me if I am wrong - he will not be allowed to advertise in an open space.  A tourist or tourist bus coming to Carlow to visit the distillery and the visitor's centre which Mr. Walsh is proposing to build, will not be able to find the place without Google maps.  It is an issue we need to address.  It is important that we do not tie the hands of people who are trying to promote and develop these products.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment the Minister on his engagement on structural separation.  This issue generated much debate and interest, but we have come to a reasonable compromise.  There are two issues, namely, the big multiples and the small corner shop.  We should not disadvantage the small corner shop in a rural area to the advantage of the big multiples.<\/p>  <p>  The final issue I want to bring to the Minister's attention is education.<\/p><p>We cannot emphasise enough that it is the key issue.  Culture is very important, but we saw the smoking ban come in.  Who would have thought, 20 years ago, that such a thing would be introduced?  Looking at a different area, there are safety belts in cars.  Some of us who may be a little older will remember hopping into a car with no safety belts.  One just drove on and everything was okay and there may have been six or seven in the back of the car.  I will probably exempt the Minister from this particular discussion, but culture has changed where these things are concerned.  The only way we can change the culture relating to alcohol in general is by educating people and children at a young age about the dangers of alcohol.  Drink can be taken in moderation.  I do not mean to be a spoilsport and do not think anybody does.  I enjoy a drink socially, but there are huge issues to be addressed.  The best way to do it is by starting to educate our people at a young age, when children go to school.  That would enable the change of culture that only happens over a generation.<\/p> <p> I welcome the general principles of the Bill.  There are a couple of issues which I have addressed.  I hope the Minister will take some of my concerns on board, but in general I thank him for his engagement on and support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500029#EE00200","speaker":"1268","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518706500,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I concur with Deputy Pat Deering about the Minister's work on the Bill and the path it has come along since its inception.  A huge amount of work has been carried out on it.  The Minister has listened to many sectors and business people who are struggling in rural areas.  I have a few concerns.  It is important that we stand up and take responsibility.  We have to lead as a country and accept the issues with alcohol in society.  It is important that we see key advertising to provide awareness about the difficult and harmful effects that excessive drinking can have on family life.  A recent advertisement was very poignant, stating the more a person drinks, the less time that person has to spend with his or her loved ones.  That is very true.  If a person drinks excessively, that person will do huge damage to those closest to him or her.  We have to mitigate that and ensure society is informed.<\/p><p>The key areas about which I am concerned are the craft brewery sector and distillery sector which have been growing in Ireland in the past few years.  There were four whiskey distilleries in Ireland prior to 2010 and there are now 18, with 16 more in the final stages of planning.  We are now working on the Intoxicating Liquor (Breweries and Distilleries) Bill 2016 in the House to try to allow those distilleries and breweries to sell their products to visitors, with the current system being out of kilter with other countries worldwide.  It is important that we carry forward that legislation.<\/p><p>My constituency has Kilbeggan Distillery, which was founded in 1757 and is the oldest distillery in Ireland.  There are currently 40 people employed in it.  Some 65,000 visitors go through its doors every year.  It has another 70 people employed in County Louth.  It has invested &euro;14 million in the past six years and invested &euro;4 million in Kilbeggan in my constituency to attract visitors and have sustainable rural jobs, which are vital to our society.  Blacksmith Ventures is in Lanesborough, another area which needs employment and sustainable business to operate in that environment.  It has received planning permission for an extensive distillery and visitor centre.  I do not want to see businesses like that being affected by this legislation.  They are businesses which are not really selling significant volumes to consumers.  These businesses attract foreign investment and tourists to see the businesses first-hand.  This sector has grown significantly in recent years.<\/p><p>I will address sections 12 and 13.  One of the distilleries is on the River Shannon, almost overlooking Lough Ree.  It needs to be able to tell the story about its business.  The Bill precludes from the storytelling any person or scenic views of Ireland.  It is hard for a craft brewery or new distillery to operate in that vacuum when trying to market a new product.  It can be very difficult to market a new product because a person is operating in a vacuum, so to speak, with tough competitors.  Those with well recognised labels will come to the fore but places like this new distillery in Lanesborough with new, sustainable jobs need to be able to market and sell its products.  If there is a situation in which up to one third of the label has to have a harmful warning, with cancer having been mentioned, that is very serious.  The alcohol industry has a responsibility with labelling to display nutritional values, include warnings for pregnant women and about harmful effects that it may have on health.  If we compound that with a reference to cancer, considering that we process foods, how far will we go with this?<\/p><p>I am interested in hearing what the European Commission has to state about this.  We all advocate free trade to be on one level.  I am sure someone will take a case relating to this if this aspect of the Bill is not looked at.  We are hampering free trade by, in effect, putting that label on it because we stand out among European countries.  That is a big move to make.  We have to support small manufacturing industries which are starting, including family businesses and companies.  That is what this industry has grown from.  They bring huge numbers of people into an area.  The distillery in Lanesborough has full planning permission.  If it is open two or three years after getting full planning permission and if, for argument's sake, a cr&egrave;che opens 50 m away, does that mean that business is no longer viable or will not be able to put its name in front of its door?  We need to look at sections relating to it.<\/p><p>Has the provision put forward relating to the cancer label been approved by the Cabinet or has the Cabinet assessed it?  It looks like a late add-on to the Bill about which I would be hugely concerned.  The groceries order was a huge issue which was talked about by many presenters.  There were shows about it and the harm that it was doing.  I think Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was the Minister when it was abolished.  One of the greatest failures at that time was that alcohol was not exempt from it.  What happened, in effect, in convenience stores and such was that alcohol was sold as the loss leader to attract people.  It left a situation where people could get vast quantities of alcohol at very cheap prices.  We have to be sensitive to Northern Ireland.  I know we are watching that as we bring the legislation forward.  We also have to ensure that cheap alcohol is not as accessible as it was before since it is very bad for society.  The people who had <i>ripoff.ie<\/i>and such programmes need to stand up to take responsibility too because they advocated that the groceries order be abolished, yet we faced huge social problems as a result of that.  I remember Eddie Hobbs said it would reduce the housewife's weekly basket but it had the reverse effect.  Being responsible, we need to call these things out.<\/p><p>Supporting business is very important.  My real fear in this legislation is that there may be unintended consequences and the societal benefit from one or two small provisions of this may not be as great as people think where labelling is concerned.  I would be grateful if the Minister considered that issue and assessed the late provision that was brought forward.  I have heard people advocating for why it has been included.  I am not trying to say we do not need some kind of nutritional values or warnings, but to require one third of the label to contain a serious, significant warning about cancer or something of that nature is too significant for business and the industry and I do not think there will be a benefit on the other side.  That is the main point that I would like to see looked at.<\/p><p>We need to be careful with advertising where it relates to the small industry that is setting up and that we are facilitating through the Intoxicating Liquor (Breweries and Distilleries) Bill 2016.  The owner standing in a distillery or craft brewery to promote it is not allowed to do so under this legislation.  It is regrettable that, if someone is employing people such as Kilbeggan Distillery which employs 40 people, it will be very difficult to advertise successfully or to promote a new product such as in Lanesborough.<\/p><p> I thank the Minister for coming to the House for the debate.  It is important that, as a society, we own up to the fact that we drink too much.  It is welcome that the drinks industry has come a long way in the code of conduct it has employed on advertising.  When finalising the legislation we need to be mindful of the sustainable businesses in rural Ireland that are providing vital employment, particularly the new breweries set up since 2010.  It is important when crafting legislation that we do not unintentionally damage the industry.  A visitor from overseas to the distillery in Kilbeggan is not someone who is engaging in excessive drinking.  It is a different market, but it provides vital employment in the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500030#FF00200","speaker":"1369","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518707100,"counter":555,"content":"<p>The next slot is for a Fianna F&aacute;il speaker who will be followed by Deputy Thomas P.

It is also welcome that the Minister for Health is present for this engagement.  <\/p>  <p>  Like my colleagues, I support the Bill and many of the measures contained in it.  Being conscious of the time, I will not speak about issues raised by other speakers.  There are three or four areas on which I would like to focus.  <\/p>  <p>  I am supportive of the minimum pricing proposal.  It is a positive move in that it will deal with the abuse of alcohol by young people and those who under age, in particular.  We need to do all we can to ensure they cannot access alcohol by creative and innovative means, including with the assistance of older people, which is wrong and often leads to abuse and anti-social behaviour and domestic problems.  The introduction of minimum pricing will, I hope, reduce the access of young people to alcohol which they can currently buy for a small amount of money, which is a huge problem in several areas, including my constituency.  We may also need to consider making it an offence for an adult to purchase alcohol for a person who is under age.  I have witnessed young people give money to adults to buy slabs of beer for them in an off-licence or a shop.  They then abuse the alcohol, which is a problem.  It might be worth considering making it an offence either in this Bill or in future legislation for adults to purchase alcohol for persons who are under age.  We need to send the message that the purchase of alcohol by persons who are under age is not permissible.  It should not be possible for them to access it by being creative, innovative or smart or by getting an older person to buy it for them, which causes a lot of social problems.  When the minimum pricing provisions come into force, they will impact positively on businesses that provide employment and operate in a proper way.  They will have a positive impact all round.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals related to separation and the segregation of alcohol also need to be re-examined.  I understand amendments will be brought forward on Committee Stage.  I accept that alcohol products needs to be separated from other products, but what is being proposed is drastic and a step too far.  The financial burden on the SME sector in doing what is proposed will be negative.  While alcohol products should be separated from other products, we need to engage with SMEs on how it can be done in the least cumbersome way possible.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals on labelling are also an issue.  While all labelling needs to draw attention to the negatives, the increased requirements in the labelling of alcohol are a concern.  I understand the European Union is working on guidelines in this area; perhaps, therefore, we should wait to see what it will propose and then compare it with what is being proposed here.  A label which carries references to cancer is alarmist.  There are lots of things we do every day in moderation.  A lot of people drink in moderation and only a minority abuse alcohol.  We must be mindful, therefore, of how we draw attention to the fact that over-indulgence in different things can cause sickness and ill-health, including the consumption of alcohol.  While there is a level of labelling that is necessary, we must be measured in our approach in how it is designed and put in place such that it will not impact negatively on what we are trying to achieve and will not be out of kilter with what is brought forward by the European Union.  Given we are pro-European Union and implement many laws and regulations driven by it.  Perhaps, therefore, we should wait and see what it will propose on labelling, into which we can then tie what is being proposed here.<\/p>  <p>  The abuse of alcohol is a huge issue in families and for individuals.  It causes lots of social issues and domestic problems.  That said, the abuse of anything causes problems and difficulties and impacts negatively on families.  In regulating to reduce the level of abuse and improve people's health and circumstances we must do so in a way that will not impact negatively on those who do not abuse.  We must be careful that we do not over-regulate for the minority such that we will spoil it for those who indulge in and enjoy alcohol in a responsible way.  While alcohol is being abused, there are many who enjoy it in a responsible way.  They do not over-indulge and are measured in what they do.  We must be careful not to send a message to people outside Ireland that will label us negatively.  There is lots to see and do in Ireland.  We are a people who are open to engaging with others and can enjoy ourselves in a responsible way without over-indulging in or abusing alcohol.  We have to balance this with what we are trying to achieve in this legislation.  Therefore, we need to step back from and review some of the measures proposed in the areas about which I have spoken.  We need to examine how we can achieve what we want to achieve in a way that will not be overly excessive, as in what is being proposed.<\/p>  <p>  As stated by other speakers, including on the Government side, breweries create huge numbers of jobs.  That feeds in positively to the local, regional and national economies.  We cannot always be driven and governed by lobbyists and the creation of employment.<\/p><p>I ask that, as part of a balanced approach with a view to having a balanced outcome, we be mindful of the positive contribution these businesses make to the economy by creating local jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500031#GG00300","speaker":"1324","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518707700,"counter":558,"content":"<p>It is welcome that the Bill is before the D&aacute;il and not before its time.  The previous Cabinet signed off on it in February 2015.  We must be realistic and acknowledge that there is a serious problem with drink and the drink culture in this country and that it must be addressed.  No one can argue against the facts, which are that an increasing number of people are presenting in hospitals with liver disease and that the average age of those presenting with it is becoming younger.  This is not coincidental but because of the availability of cheap booze.<\/p>  <p>  A welcome consequence of the Bill is that we will, straightaway, tackle below-cost selling of alcohol.  The availability of cheap drink encourages excessive drinking, particularly in poorer socioeconomic regions.  Collectively in this D&aacute;il, we should work together to ensure the legislation will proceed through the next Stages as rapidly as possible because the problem needs to be tackled.<\/p>  <p>  On advertising, it is welcome that the Minister is proposing to introduce a ban between 3 a.m. and 9 p.m.  That is all very well and would probably have worked a couple of decades ago when most people had access to no media other than RT&Eacute; One and RT&Eacute; Two and the stations they could receive on a transistor radio.  Given the advances in telecommunications, I wonder whether the initiative will have a real impact.  I do not believe it will.  On the flip side of the coin, it will cost Irish media companies millions of euro.  As I said, I do not believe it will make a huge difference.  Many people of my age and younger are accessing media through iPads and mobile phones and by streaming, etc.  Consequently, I wonder whether the advertising aspect of the Bill is worthy.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider the tourism industry.  Perhaps I am misinterpreting the legislation in believing that under it places such as the Guinness Storehouse will not even be able to advertise on the outside of their own buildings.  The Guinness Storehouse is one of the main tourist attractions in the country.  People do not go there to drink excessively.  One gets only one pint when one goes in and it is part of the Irish cultural experience enjoyed by tourists from abroad.  The same applies in a smaller scale to Locke's distillery in Kilbeggan, one of the only distilleries still in operation in all of Ireland.  I was surprised to learn recently that 70,000 visit it.  It will not be able to advertise on the roundabout outside Kilbeggan in order that people entering the town will know where it is located.  If I am wrong, the Minister can correct me.  If I am not, we need to address this issue.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that the Minister made concessions on the issue of separation.  It was common sense.<\/p>  <p>  Whose responsibility is it to have labels on bottles?  What is the position on small-scale distillers of specialist gins and brewers of craft beers that are predominantly for the export market?  Are we using a sledge-hammer to crack an egg in that regard?  Will we impose too many costs on small businesses considering that the majority of their products will be going to a market that may not require the proposed labelling?<\/p>  <p>  Most people who buy drink in duty free shops are on their way out of the country.  One very seldom sees people entering the country picking up drink in duty free shops.  What we are doing is placing an unnecessary burden on duty free shops which support large-scale employment where they operate, be it at Shannon, Knock, Dublin or Cork Airport.  Perhaps this issue might be examined.  Is there a need for labelling in that context?<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that excessive drinking is very harmful.  In that regard, I mentioned the increase in the incidence of liver disease, particularly in the younger age categories.  What we should refer to on labels is the abuse of alcohol.  Having a glass or two of wine per week or fortnight is not as harmful as having a bottle or two of wine per night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500032#HH00200","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1518707700,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak to the Bill which was first introduced in the Seanad by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Health in 2015.  While I often disagree with him and the Minister on many aspects of health, I warmly support the Bill.  I have received many emails during the years from constituents urging me to support such legislation.  If passed, it will be positive for the country.<\/p><p>There has been some misinformation circulated and intense lobbying by the alcohol industry on the provisions of the Bill.  I have been contacted by constituents who enjoy a drink at home, as many do, and have expressed concern that the cost of alcohol will rise for them.  In reality, however, there will be very little change for those of us who enjoy alcohol moderately and responsibly.  The general thrust of the Bill is to curb binge drinking and delay access to alcohol by children and young people.<\/p><p>We know from the website of Alcohol Ireland that the rate of consumption of alcohol in the State rose from approximately 4.9 litres per person aged 15 years and over in 1960 to 14.3 litres per person aged 15 years and over in 2001.  There was a slight decrease in the following years, but the rate still stands at around 11.6 litres per person per year.  Our target is to reduce that figure significantly.  It is estimated that three deaths per day are alcohol related.  The World Health Organization states alcohol is a factor in over 200 conditions, diseases and injuries, including heart disease and cancer.  Some 1,050 deaths per year, or 88 per month, are due to alcohol.  One quarter of the deaths of young men aged between 15 and 19 years are due to alcohol.  It is also an element in half of suicides and approximately 30% of incidents of self-harm.  There are alcohol-related cancers.  I welcome provisions included in the Bill to allow this sobering health information to be displayed at the point of sale.  <\/p><p>The issues of labelling and segregation have arisen.  To a large extent, the Minister has addressed the segregation issue.  We are all familiar with small shops throughout the country, including the west.<\/p><p>On labelling, we have reached the stage where we expect to find fairly good information, nutritional and otherwise, on all products we consume.  Perhaps it might be the same for alcohol. <\/p><p>The Minister already knows of my interest in and work on the issue of road safety.  Drink-driving is one of the major causes of death and serious injuries on the roads.  The Road Safety Authority has estimated that alcohol has been a factor in around two fifths of fatal road traffic collisions.  I argue that this is an underestimation as replies to parliamentary questions in recent years have shown that testing for alcohol is not always carried out at the scenes of collisions.<\/p><p><i><\/i>The harmful effect of alcohol is not only felt by the person drinking but also by his or her family, friends and society at large.  We have had this problem during the centuries.  Behind us in the Chamber is a statue of one of our great predecessors, Thomas Davis.  When he and members of Young Ireland, men and women, were writing in the newspaper <i>The Nation<\/i>in the 1830s and 1840s, alcohol abuse was a very severe problem.  It was the time of Fr. Mathew and the Temperance movement.  Society is, of course, changing and one of the biggest social changes in the past decade has been the development of coffee shops which have changed the social atmosphere.  In general, therefore, I support the Bill.<\/p><p>We will be able to see how the concept of minimum pricing works in Scotland when it is introduced in May.<\/p><p>The Scots have a very similar relationship to the Irish with alcohol.  We are sister nations with very deep associations.  Many of the effects and costs of alcohol related harm are mirrored in the two countries.  The Scottish Bill was long delayed following the legal challenge by the Scotch Whisky Association, but the Supreme Court ruled that European law had not been breached and that such legislation was constitutional.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500032#HH00300","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1518708300,"counter":561,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee","time":1518708300,"counter":562,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500033#JJ00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1518708300,"counter":563,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimate for Public Services for the service of the year ending 31 December 2018: Vote 13 - Office of Public Works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500033#JJ00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Broadband Procurement Process: Statements (Resumed)","time":1518708300,"counter":564,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500033#JJ00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1518708300,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak about broadband provision.  Last week before the adjournment of statements I made reference to a meeting I had had in Sligo with a UK company which was prepared and eager to set up a business in my home town of Ballymote.  We were looking at between eight and ten jobs being provided.  Unfortunately, we do not have a broadband service to allow the company to start up.  We have the premises, but we do not have the broadband service required.<\/p>  <p>  Rural Ireland needs a guarantee that it will have fair access to the social and economic services which are essential if communities and businesses are to thrive.  Whether it is the closure of post offices, the reduction of infrastructure funding or poor broadband coverage, rural Ireland is facing official policy which is making it tough to survive.  I recently asked the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, by way of parliamentary question the status of work to market counties Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Roscommon as job locations; the number of IDA Ireland site visits that had taken place in these counties in the past five years; and the other initiatives that had taken place to contribute to highlighting the north west as a destination for new businesses.  In her reply the Minister stated, as regards site visits, \"The IDA always does its best to highlight suitable sites in regional areas - including in counties Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Roscommon - to potential investors.  It is sometimes the case, however, that IDA clients will have specific requirements that may preclude certain locations.\"  The elephant in the room is that the Government refuses to acknowledge the importance of broadband or, more appropriately, the lack of it in many parts of rural Ireland.  Companies will not move to invest in or support rural counties if they cannot access high quality broadband.  Jobs growth in the regions is being stunted.  People have lost patience, especially in isolated rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  The World Bank found that a 10% increase in broadband penetration increased economic growth by 1.3% in the long term.  The facts do not lie.  Ireland ranks 42nd in the global rankings for the distribution of high speed broadband, while 40% of the population and 96% of the country geographically still lack commercial or fibre broadband coverage.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's national rural broadband roll-out programme is a shambles.  I do not blame the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, for this, as what has happened is unfortunate.  Since the tendering process started in 2015, two bidders have left and there is now only one bidder remaining, namely, enet.  The further delay in the roll-out of the national broadband plan will limit the number of jobs which can be created in the regions.  With rapid advances in technology, Irish households should not have to settle for moderate Internet speeds which will be overtaken by technological progression in the next five years.  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, must do better.  She needs to make it crystal clear that IDA Ireland's continued overlooking of rural Ireland needs to stop and, above all else, the two Ministers must impress on the Taoiseach the absolute need to deliver the national broadband plan.<\/p>  <p>  As a rural politician and a businessman, I am consistently disappointed, although not surprised, by the neglectful stance taken by the Government towards the provision of broadband for rural homes and businesses which are struggling to survive in an increasingly digital era.  In order to reduce rural isolation and ensure businesses across the country will have a fair opportunity to compete, we need to deliver fibre broadband to every home.  Black spots are costing jobs, threatening rural sustainability and creating an already large digital divide between urban and rural areas.  Broadband provision can help to open up a global market for rural tourism and small local producers.  The lack of broadband is directly harming business, as well as frustrating people in their day to day lives.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen multiple reports, Bills and regulations, but none of them has advanced the process.  The latest estimate for broadband to be rolled out is 2023.  It beggars belief that ten years after it was announced that it would be done by 2012, some 540,000 homes are still not connected to fibre broadband in the ground.  It seems extraordinary that the tender has not yet been put in place and it will take between three and five years to build the network.  This week we are talking about the national planning framework, Ireland 2040, and capital infrastructure investment, but it will be 2040 before every home in Ireland has fibre broadband.  When will the neglect of rural Ireland end?  I call on the Government to allow rural communities to reach their full potential and prosper, retain young people, jobs and businesses and give people a real future in their home towns and counties.  The project cannot be held up any longer.<\/p>  <p>  It is almost 12 months since I first raised the issue of fibre broadband provision on behalf of the residents of Castlebaldwin, County Sligo and those living off the N4 route through the village.  I have done so by way of parliamentary questions, emails and letters to the Minister and eir.  For several months I have been trying to resolve the matter with eir, or at least I have been trying to ascertain the position on the issue.  Progress has been nil and it is beyond frustrating.  However, it is nothing compared to the frustration of locals in the village of Castlebaldwin and the surrounding area.  That is just one example of a rural area without broadband.  Several letters and emails to the CEO of eir, Mr Richard Moat, have not even been acknowledged, let alone responded to.  I am extremely disappointed by the lack of response, competency and support offered by eir.  For almost two years it has had a fibre to the cabinet, FTTC, unit in the village to facilitate the provision of broadband.  However, the service remains unconnected.  The fibre broadband connection passes Castlebaldwin on the N4 but does not branch off for those residents or businesses who need it.  In recent months work has been done to rectify this and the points and boxes were upgraded but not connected.  One person, in particular, is affected in that he has been offered employment with Apple, as an at-home adviser, on the proviso that he has a fixed-line Internet connection with a speed of at least 10 Mbps, which he does not have.  I have written to eir, with a view to having the matter resolved on behalf of my constituents in the area who are, over a year later, still without broadband.  It is difficult to understand.  The box is in place, as is the fibre cable, yet the company will not connect it.<\/p>  <p>  More than 500,000 homes and businesses in rural areas do not have broadband.  They will not have commercial broadband and their service will not be enhanced by announcements on the roll-out of the tender process.  In 2016 Fine Gael committed to providing high speed broadband for at least 85% of premises by 2018 and 100% of premises by 2020.  It appears that the deadlines will be missed.  Almost one third of the population live in areas where commercial broadband is not available.  Elsewhere in Europe, between 15% and 20 % are in that position.  In certain parts of rural Ireland there are broadband speeds 36 times lower than those in Dublin.  That is not acceptable.  <\/p>  <p>  I accept that the Minister is in a difficult position.  He is a rural Deputy and knows how people are suffering and job creation has been delayed by the lack of broadband provision.  I wish him well in dealing with the company that remains in the process.  I hope it will reach fruition and that we can deal with the issue as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500033#JJ00600","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1518708300,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I am not convinced that the Minister's belief the sole bidder under the national broadband plan is \"really committed\" is enough on its own.  We need more than that; we need certainty.  There is a serious problem with broadband provision in the State.  At the end of 2017 Ireland was ranked 62nd for average mobile download speeds and 81st for upload speeds.<\/p><p>In the second half of 2017 the State was ranked 42nd in the world for average fixed-broadband download speeds, with an average speed of 38.81 megabits per second.  At 13.42 Mbps, the State was ranked 59th for upload speeds, placing it between Cambodia and India.  Ireland is 21st of 25 EU member states for broadband speeds, behind Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia and Jersey.<\/p> <p> Fingal is only out the road from here, but, as I said to the Minister's colleague during a debate on roads, sometimes it might as well be Timbuktu for all the notice that is taken of it.  There are major connectivity issues there.  The problem is particularly acute in rural Fingal, for example, in certain parts of Balbriggan and areas surrounding the airport.  The lack of availability of broadband is preventing Balbriggan and surrounding rural areas from achieving their economic and social potential.  This is having a devastating effect on residents.  People living in Fingal want to be able to Skype their parents or children or book tickets online to go see the Dubs play.  Regrettably, the connectivity problems restrict what they can and cannot do.  When I am driving to work in the morning I look to my left and right and see people who I know are in their cars because they cannot work from home.  Many of them come from my constituency and clog up the M1 in the morning.  If there was connectivity, they would much rather work from home, but it is simply not an option for some.<\/p> <p> There have been problems with broadband and telecommunications in the country for many years.  The genesis of the sharp side of these issues was the forced liberalisation through the European Commission of telecommunications infrastructure.  As technology developed, the Commission and private interests saw an opportunity to make profit and forced liberalisation had to follow.  Forced to open up the sector to private operators, the State had to privatise Telecom &Eacute;ireann in 1999.  It was madness at the time and the forced marketisation is still madness.  It should be resisted.  We should now look at the possibility of progressing the national broadband plan under State ownership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500033#JJ00700","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518708900,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I thank all colleagues who contributed to the debate.  I know that some of them disagree with the approach we are taking with the ownership model.  We held a debate on the matter in the House in 2016.  However, I believe everyone in the House agrees with the primary objective, that is, to bring high speed broadband to every home, community, business and farm in Ireland.<\/p><p>I appreciate the frustration being expressed by colleagues.  I, too, am experiencing it, not only as a public representative but also as someone who was born, bred and reared in rural Ireland.  I know its extraordinary potential.<\/p><p>I have always likened this debate to conversations I had on numerous occasions with a former Member of the House, my late father.  He spoke about the impact the rural electrification scheme had had in our village of Ardkeenan.  People living in communities throughout rural Ireland wanted to have electricity in order to have a lightbulb in the kitchen in order that they could read the newspaper.  However, they soon found out about the extraordinary potential the supply of electricity offered in cooking, listening to the radio, watching television and operating milking machines.  The scheme transformed the economy of rural Ireland and the lifestyle of women.  It gave them great opportunities at the time.  Broadband will do the same.  We should remember that this was the first country in the world to bring an electricity supply to every home and it will also be the first to provide high speed broadband for every home.<\/p><p>I understand and appreciate the sense of frustration.  That frustration has been compounded by the fact that some people are gaining access to broadband.  The commitment agreement into I which tied eir is delivering high speed broadband to approximately 300 farms per week and 40,000 premises every quarter.  That is some achievement, but it makes it even more frustrating when people see a neighbour at the end of or half way up the road or half-way being provided with pure fibre high speed broadband, while they are left with absolutely nothing.  That is why I was determined, in tandem with the commitment agreement, to make progress on the issue under the broadband and mobile phone task force.  There are ways by which we can encourage the roll-out of wireless, as well as 3G and 4G, broadband in the short term.<\/p><p>Mobile broadband is a sticking plaster.  The point was well made in the article in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>by Adrian Weckler, who is not a strong advocate for me.  If anything, he has probably been one of the biggest thorns in my side.  However, I acknowledge that throughout the process he has called a spade a spade.  He has set out the idea clearly.  I have heard people the length and breadth of the country say on radio that those of us living in rural Ireland should damn well accept 4G mobile broadband, that it is good enough for us.  It is not.  A 3G mobile broadband service was rolled out under the national broadband scheme.  I recall that the former Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was involved at the time.  The day it went live, it was already obsolete.  Mobile broadband will never meet our needs.  It is a stop-gap measure, albeit a welcome one.  I will assist in that regard, but it is a mobile, not a point-to-point, service.  The reality is that over time people will not use broadband simply to watch a range of television channels or surf the Internet using a range of devices.  I am engaged with several companies and what we are looking at is a pilot scheme to improve health outcomes for people living in rural communities.  There are major opportunities for small post-primary schools.  For example, if children want to take applied mathematics but the option is not available in their school, they can take it using online tools.  The opportunities are endless for Irish ingenuity and business.  I urge everyone to work with me.  I will work with Members, too.  I will give one commitment.  I will engage with Members both here and in the Upper House.  We will keep them briefed and updated on what is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500034#KK00200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1518708900,"counter":569,"content":"<p>May I speak briefly to make one brief comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021500034#KK00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1518708900,"counter":570,"content":"<p>The Minister has spoken.
