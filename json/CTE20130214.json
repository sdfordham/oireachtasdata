Argentina is vying with us to some extent.  The thoroughbred horse sector is a remarkable story.  Over 40% of the EU output of thoroughbreds is produced in Ireland, and we have by any standards a remarkable record in producing many of the world's greatest winners on a consistent basis.  We also have a remarkable record in attracting stallions to stand here.  It is a sector that demonstrably has a global capacity to compete.  Sectors with a global capacity to compete on a level playing field are few enough in the Irish economy.  Why else would it be the case that we have one of the greatest horses, Sea the Stars, owned by a Hong Kong business family, who spent his formative years at the Irish National Stud, won many of the world's most prestigious races from an Irish training yard, and then retired to a stud in Ireland owned by the Aga Khan?  It is a truly international sector with a high profile and image.  Nobody disputes the broad importance and the international credibility of the sector.<\/p><p>  The key discussion point of today's meeting is why there is a need for an Irish National Stud, our view of it and what its place is in a modern Ireland.  The committee will then have to decide whether I am a fit person to hold such a prestigious position.<\/p><p>  The mission statement is simply to promote the interests of the Irish bloodstock industry by providing the services of high quality stallions to as wide a range of breeders as possible but the act of setting up the stud or at least assuming ownership of it, as the State did in 1946, is much more comprehensive than might be supposed.  It is worth noting that until 1943, the farm at Tully was in fact part of the British National Stud.  Ireland in 1946 was not a rich country but even then the Government recognised that a thriving national thoroughbred stud was important and it made available &pound;60,000 sterling for the purchase of its first stallion, Royal Charger, equivalent to almost &euro;2 million in today's terms.  In 1952 it made available &pound;250,000, an enormous sum at the time, for the purchase of Tulyar.<\/p><p>  The committee will be only too well aware of the inevitable choices that must be made in fulfilling a necessary mandate to be profitable and commercial while reconciling that with the desirability and duty to take a wider national imperative into account.  The wider remit than pure commercialism is encapsulated in sections of the Act which give among its objectives to put into operation special schemes for the improvement of horse breeding and to locate high class stallions and if necessary to make them available at reduced prices and also to provide an advisory service for breeders in regard to the mating of their thoroughbred mares.  Its permitted role under the Act is wide, including to raise or borrow money or to receive subsidies from the State and even to provide living accommodation for the company's directors, which is worthwhile as a precedent.<\/p><p>  The stud also has a thriving tourism business from the County Kildare perspective as distinct from its international impact in trading the service of stallions.  The Japanese Gardens, St. Fiachra's Garden and the Irish Horse Museum are nationally important tourism attractions, which are important for the generation of employment in Kildare.  They also tend to be a destination in Kildare rather than being visited on the way to somewhere else.  They have in excess of 115,000 visitors a year and have reached as many as 140,000.  The intention is that we will continue to build on this.<\/p><p>  The National Stud is important in terms of the quantity and quality of the foals it produces.  In 2011 the National Stud's sires produced 800 flat foals, 20% of that year's flat foal crop.  That might surprise members.  This is an extraordinary figure and forces one to revise the view that the country has more than sufficient stallions and stallion farms to meet the needs.  Standing a stallion is an expensive, risky business and the numbers of stallion farms has dropped significantly in recent years.  While the Coolmore and Maktoum operations grab much of the headlines I firmly believe that it is very much in the national interest that access to stallions of a range of qualities is available to breeders outside a very restricted grouping of specialist stallion studs.  Even from the perception of the industry by the ordinary taxpaying public a range of participants is highly desirable.<\/p><p>  Ireland has a number of real advantages in producing world-leading horses that are encapsulated in the record of the National Stud itself.  It is no accident that recent world beaters spent their formative growing years growing here -  Frankel among them.  The key ingredients that have driven many to look seriously at the horse industry from all over the world are land, including the limestone base of soil - I can go into it in detail - climate, and labour in the broadest sense, including innate skill with horses.<\/p> <p>With this set of national advantages, the National Stud was the first in the world to recognise the need for a formal educational structure in stud management.  Since 1970 it has fulfilled a role that has become a template others have followed.  This course has produced many of the current leaders of the industry worldwide and is something I would be keen to see built on.  In this year of The Gathering, approximately 1,000 graduates from the National Stud course have been invited to come to lunch at the stud during the Derby weekend, which should become a focal point for them and us.<\/p><p> With the growing perception of the quality of the Irish thoroughbred horse, my view is that the stud could usefully carefully extend its brief to one specifically allowed for in the Act, that is, to provide specific thoroughbred breeding advice.  Obviously, that would be of most use to farmer families on suitable land who might see diversification into selective thoroughbred breeding as a worthwhile additional enterprise.  As it is, the stud provides opportunities in partnership with other farms for National Stud stallions to stand around the country - there are two in Wexford and one in Laois.<\/p><p> In today's Ireland the National Stud must be a commercial success.  It must stand on its own feet commercially and be in a position to have a range of stallions, with at least one representative at the very top of the quality pyramid.  We are fortunate, following Lady Chryss O'Reilly's term, that we have a capable and skilled chief executive in place, a strong balance sheet, an excellent complement of stallions and a growing complement of mares.  I intend to chair a board that will build on this favourable inheritance.  The next key requirement is to source a top class stallion that will in time replace the outstandingly successful Invincible Spirit.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to set before the committee this unique institution that is the Irish National Stud, its associated tourist enterprises in the form of the Japanese Gardens and its sizeable commercial farms, and its importance as an employer of skilled staff in both the equine and tourism sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Dempsey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360834800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dempsey.

Even though they are both chairmen designate I congratulate them on their appointment.  Mr. Dempsey's CV is impressive and a cursory glance at his background, commitment and active involvement in the agricultural area and agricultural science tell us that this country is blessed to have somebody of his calibre who is prepared to take on a public position such as this one.  I wish him well in that regard.<\/p><p>  I am not an expert.  I am an ordinary member of the public who looks on at the activities of the National Stud.  It is an awesome phenomenon that Ireland has developed over decades.  The background Mr. Dempsey has provided in how it all started was very informative for me and, I am sure, other members.<\/p><p>  I have one or two questions but I will be brief because members with more expertise than me in this area may want to raise matters with the witnesses.  First, I get the impression that it is important we have quality standing stallions.  Mr. Dempsey referred to one or two from the beginning including Tulyar.  I am old enough to have Tulyar in the back of my mind.  When Tulyar was purchased it must have been a major national story at the time.  Mr. Dempsey said the amount of money involved in 1946 was &pound;60,000, which equates to &euro;2 million.  I wonder what &pound;125,000 in 1952 equates to now.  It cannot be anything less than &euro;84 million or &euro;85 million.  That is an extraordinary amount of money for what was a time of deep economic difficulty.<\/p><p>  In terms of Mr. Dempsey's commitment and going forward, how does one develop a unique stallion because while he mentioned the figures for the foals and the standing stallions, one or two appear to stand out.  What is the importance of that internationally in terms of the National Stud, and how will Mr. Dempsey go about developing that?  Does it happen randomly or is it done by science?<\/p><p>  Second, I am very interested in the tourist dimension, which Mr. Dempsey outlined.  This is the year of The Gathering.  The Queen visited the National Stud.  Has Mr. Dempsey found from talking to people or from his involvement in other areas, and living in Kildare, that there has been a spin-off from that?  What are the demographics in terms of the people who visit the National Stud and the Japanese Gardens?  Are they \"horsey\" people or people who are part of a tourism package?  How does Mr. Dempsey hope to develop and increase that figure?  He mentioned that he hopes to do that.  I wish him continued success in what is an important role for this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400004#C00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1360834800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Dempsey to the committee.  I wish him well in taking on what will be a challenging but important role for the racing and breeding industry, not to mention the tourism aspect.<\/p><p>  As a TD for Kildare South I am very much aware of the importance of the National Stud and Japanese Gardens from a tourism point of view.  The figure of 115,000 visitors does not surprise me because it is the first port of call for any tourist visiting the county and leads to spin-off tourism in that people come to the National Stud and then visit other areas.  The National Stud and the Japanese Gardens were the initial draw, however, and they are extremely important.<\/p><p>  In that regard, The Gathering event that will happen on Derby weekend, which Mr. Dempsey touched on, is very exciting.  He mentioned it in terms of inviting former students of the stud management course to attend.  The stud management course has been run since the 1970s and is viewed as being prestigious throughout the world; I believe Mr. Dempsey said it draws on students from 32 countries.  What is his view on how that may be developed in the coming years?<\/p><p>  Ireland is a very different country now, and our breeding industry is very different from that which pertained in the 1940s when the National Stud was purchased.  How has that change impacted on the requirements of the industry now?  Does the role of the national stud need to develop somewhat to take cognisance of that?  I have no doubt about the importance of its place in the industry, but adapting to changing times and the changing needs of the smaller breeders was always its target.<\/p><p>  The National Stud as a landmass is a very large piece of land.  Obviously, the focus has always been on the thoroughbred sector.  Is there a dimension that Mr. Dempsey sees in terms of diversifying into sports horses?  Such potential would be welcome.  Is there any angle in that respect that Mr. Dempsey believes could be advanced?<\/p><p>  Mr. Dempsey said the stud must be financially viable.  Much concern was raised when one of Colm McCarthy's reports listed it as a potential site to be sold.  Many of us made sufficient noise to the effect that that would not be a good idea but it is important that it trades profitably because it has the potential to do so.  Mr. Dempsey might indicate the current trading position and the way that is looking for 2013.<\/p><p>  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the role of Mr. Dempsey's predecessor, Lady O'Reilly, who did a fantastic job in giving a major personal commitment to the National Stud and expressed that along the way.  The chief executive officer, John Osborne, also saw it develop over recent years, including the ongoing development of the facilities at the stud.  The Queen's visit definitely helped to enhance the tourism aspect and raised the profile of the stud for Irish visitors as much as for foreign tourists.<\/p><p>  I wish Mr. Dempsey well.  His CV makes him eminently qualified for this position.  I look forward to working closely with him in his new role and wish him every success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400004#C00400","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1360834800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Dempsey and wish him all the best as chairman designate of the National Stud.

Is there a limit to what the Irish National Stud can borrow, even for the purchase of a stallion?<\/p><p> The stud management course is very interesting.

I am not a member of the committee but when I saw that both delegates were presenting their case and cause this morning, I said I had to come along.  As the Chairman stated, this is not an exam.  We are not giving the delegates marks.  Mr. Dempsey is probably safe enough regarding the job.<\/p><p>  Knowing Mr. Dempsey's background and his innovations in agriculture in journalism, I wonder what catches his eye this morning.  I was very interested when he mentioned the possibility of extending his brief to provide thoroughbred breeding advice, which would be of use to farm families on suitable land.  Under the Act, such a dimension to the stud's work is allowable but it may not have been concentrated on much in the past.  Will Mr. Dempsey expand on it?  The core role of the Irish National Stud is being fulfilled very successfully, as outlined.  Anybody with an interest in the broader horse-racing industry must always have the aim of trying to involve an increasing number of people in selling the racing and breeding industries' attractions to as broad a public as possible.  We need to get new people on board.  I would like to hear Mr. Dempsey elaborate on his role in this regard.  His role will be very interesting and key.  I look forward to hearing his thoughts.<\/p><p>  Some 115,000 visitors go to the Japanese Gardens annually.  We must admit that figure is impressive.  However, one should consider that thousands of people visit Kildare Village every weekend to spend good money there.  Over the course of 12 months, therefore, millions of people pass by the stud.  While 115,000 is very impressive, it is a figure that Mr. Dempsey could almost hope to double during his term in office.  Some 12 months or two years ago, there were interesting television advertisements for the Irish National Stud.  I have not seen them; perhaps I am watching the wrong channels.  Will Mr. Dempsey talk about this?  We should not be satisfied with the figure of 115,000 as we could increase it very significantly given the road network and the geographical position of the stud.<\/p><p>  I wish Mr. Dempsey well and I look forward to what he will bring to the table.

While I was aware of the legal position, I would have been very disappointed if the committee had unanimously recommended to the Minister that he reconsider my appointment.  That was all I meant by my remarks.<\/p><p>  With regard to Senator Mooney's point, there are two aspects to the development of a stallion.  The book fee of our current stallion, Invincible Spirit, is &euro;60,000.  Presuming that he serves 120 mares, that gives an earning capacity of over &euro;7 million per year.  From the pure arithmetic, one realises the considerable impact that one successful stallion can have on an operation of a very significant size.  This holds true right across the stallion business in the country.<\/p><p>  The amount of money that accrues from a successful stallion can be very significant.  On the other hand, the losses from a misplaced investment can also be very large.  It is quite a risky business.  Happily, the record of the Irish National Stud in sourcing good stallions of various categories and grades has been very successful.  In that context Invincible Spirit has been a real find.<\/p><p>  How does a stud develop?  One is dependent on the skill of the manager and his team, coupled with the advice of some of the specialists on the board.  Part of the manager's job is to be aware of what is happening worldwide, how various two year olds and three year olds are performing, what animals are likely to be for sale, and how well disposed existing owners are to seeing a stallion stand at the Irish National Stud, or have the stud as a customer.  It is quite a restricted world at that end of the stallion spectrum.  One is competing with world players in the same market.  A combination of expertise and goodwill is required and one must be in the right place at the right time and meet the right people.  The chief executive manager of the Irish National Stud, Mr. John Osborne, has a pivotal role in the success of the operation.  Part of the board's role involves some of the more specialist members providing Mr. Osborne with a sounding board for his views and opinions and assisting with whatever introductions are required and the knowledge available worldwide.  It is also a question of what mares one gets, how successful the stallion is in the first few years, and how it develops from there.<\/p><p>  Consider the spin-off effect in the Japanese Gardens and the 120,000 visitors, which figure was raised by a number of members.  The gardens are obviously a very significant tourist attraction.  The bulk of the visitors are domestic.  There is widespread interest in gardening internationally, however, and most Japanese tourists who come to Ireland make it their business to see the Japanese Gardens.  There is a very extensive collection of international plants in the gardens, so keen botanists come regularly, as do families for a day out.<\/p> <p>The intention is to build on that.  I take the Senator's point on advertising in recent years and whether it should be augmented.  Obviously, this will be examined and we will be discussing it.  The Queen's visit had a major spin-off with much interest expressed in the stud.  The horse facilities at the stud are available to public viewing so empathy can be created between the ordinary taxpaying public and one of the State's institutions.<\/p><p> It is hoped a profit of &euro;500,000 will be made in 2013.  Last year, the stud under Lady O'Reilly and John Osborne did a bit better than break even.  This year is looking more promising and the minimum expectation is that a profit of &euro;500,000 will be earned.  Regarding the question on syndication and sharing of stallions, this is an active part of the stallion business.  It is highly desirable that a number of rights in good stallions would be held by individual breeders from across the spectrum that would be purchased by the stud.  This is part of the normal thoroughbred life and the National Stud is an integral part of that on a strictly commercial basis with breeders who wish to participate.  The sums involved in purchasing a high-class stallion can be very significant.  The National Stud has no great desire to be looking for funding from the Exchequer.  A borrowing limit of &euro;30 million has been set by the Government but it is hardly used at this stage as the debt level is very low.  There is a legal capacity to buy but we want that to be matched by a commercial reality.<\/p><p> I must admit the question on sports horses is an interesting one.  Professor Patrick Wall has been designated the chairman of Horse Sport Ireland.  These are really two different businesses.  Certainly before committing that that would be my policy, I would prefer to get a feeling from the board and from John Osborne.  I would be surprised if I could detect an overwhelming enthusiasm to get involved in the sports horse sector when there is so much ground to be covered on the thoroughbred side.<\/p><p> The best land for horse breeding is a combination of the brown earths and the grey-brown podzolics.  While I loved my time opening Manorhamilton show, the amount of those particular soil series in Leitrim is pretty limited.  The depth of soil across most of the limestone plains of the west, except for odd pockets, is not in my view conducive to training the highest grade three year olds with the potential to be classic winners.  A neighbour of the stud near Kilcullen recently invited us to lunch.  Within four miles of that estate, the classic winners Sea The Stars, Frankel and Camelot had spent some time in their formative years on this land.  There is a clear association between definite soil series and land type.  This is what has attracted international investors to parts of Cork, Kildare, Kilkenny and isolated pockets elsewhere.  I say that without denigrating any other part of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400005#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Dempsey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360836000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Does the National Stud offer stallion discounts to certain breeders or is there a set fee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400006#E00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360836000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>There is normally a set fee but there would be some degree of negotiation at the same time.

There is no doubt that at times there will be a need to ensure a high-quality standard stallion is purchased to be available to breeders and as a revenue earner for the National Stud.  The situation is slightly more comfortable when one has one or two of those high-quality stallions in place.  It is also important at the same time to have a range for the broader spread of mares that may not be suitable to go with those high-quality stallions.  At this stage the stud owns six stallions and 23 brood mares.  The number of mares has increased over the past three years.  Talking with John Osborne, there is a certain degree of optimism that there would be good sales revenue coming from the yearlings they produce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Dempsey"},{"type":"speech","time":1360836000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Are all the six stallions flat racers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400006#E00600","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360836000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>No, four of them are flat racers and some of the national hunt ones, in addition to the six, are in Wexford and Laois.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400006#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Dempsey"},{"type":"speech","time":1360836000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Are the fees all &euro;60,000?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400006#E00800","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360836000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>No, the fees go down to &euro;2,500.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400006#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Dempsey"},{"type":"speech","time":1360836000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Regarding partnerships, we know Coolmore and the Maktoums move their stallions around the world.

For the smaller stallion owners, however, it would seem that there are tax incentives for artists and others, but I will be totally politically incorrect here and state that there should have been one if one wanted to nurture the sector - this goes across all owners of stallions, not only thoroughbreds.

However, for small breeders a corporate structure is a different kettle of fish.<\/p><p>  I would agree entirely with the Chairman.  The sale from yearlings was always fully taxable.

I went to Belvedere College.  Mr. Dempsey just reminded me that in 1954 I went on a school trip to the National Stud where the excitement of seeing Tulyar was fantastic - everyone was so proud.  I had not thought of it for years until Mr. Dempsey mentioned it.  After Belvedere College, I went to the College of Commerce, Rathmines, for two years and then I joined the family company in 1963.<\/p><p>  Keelings is a multinational company focused on growing, sourcing, shipping, marketing and distributing fresh produce from sources around the world for Irish, United Kingdom and European consumers.  Keelings started producing fruits and salads in the 1930s, supplying its produce to the local Dublin markets.  The 1970s saw the growth of supermarket retailing and importation of fresh produce from around the world.  The company, as it operates today, was founded in 1973 to meet this change in demand.<\/p><p>  Keelings is proud of its growing expertise and to this day is still an accomplished commercial grower.  Our products include fresh fruit, salads, vegetables, flowers and logistical services.  We are experts in our business with over 60 years experience in the fresh produce sector.<\/p><p>  I have led the development of Keelings, from a fresh produce grower in the 1970s through to today's business which employs 1,600 people in Ireland, England and Holland.  On 1 March, I will stand down as CEO of Keelings.<\/p><p>  I started attending the races at the Fairyhouse Easter meeting 60 years ago.  I was a director at Fairyhouse in the 1990s and also a committee member for the past three years.  Keelings has sponsored the Keelings Strawberry Hurdle on Easter Monday for the past five years.<\/p><p>  My first racehorse was Irish Firs, which was bred by my father-in-law and owned by my wife, and was trained by Mr. Willie Byrne who trained at the Phoenix Park.  He won his first race in October 1982 and went on to win at a Cheltenham April meeting.  Mr. Mick O'Toole trained Irish Firs and 20 winners in total for me.  Fourth of July was the best of these.  Other successful horses include Alone He Stands on the flat and Blueberry Boy over jumps.  They both won six races and were trained by Mr. John Hayden and Mr. Paul Stafford, respectively.  Blueberry Boy won a grade 2 at Punchestown.  Mr. Dermot Weld trained Teach Nua to win two races for me at Galway and Elusive in Paris, trained by Mr. Michael Grassick, won three races on the flat in 2011-2012.  I am a small breeder and have bred ten winners between Ireland and England.<\/p><p>  I refer to the economic importance of the racing and breeding sector to the country.  The horse racing and breeding sectors are of significant importance to the rural economy in Ireland.  Irish horses, trainers and their riders have consistently won races at the highest international level and act as positive ambassadors for the country as the following points will illustrate.  The sector employs approximately 16,000, almost all in rural areas.  On average, three horses equals one job.  Studies have shown the value of the sector to the economy at approximately &euro;1 billion per annum.  Ireland is the fourth largest producer of thoroughbreds in the world.  Ireland produces over 40% of thoroughbreds born in the EU.  Irish horses are exported to race and breed to over 35 countries worldwide.  Our major racing festivals are significant contributors to their local economies.  Both Galway and Punchestown have done studies to show that the value of their festivals is approximately &euro;60 million and &euro;80 million, respectively, to their local economies.  The industry is a significant source of foreign investment into Ireland by international owners and breeders - high net-worth individuals.  Horse racing accounts for approximately 80,000 tourist visits to the country each year.<\/p><p>  Horse racing and breeding is exactly the sort of industry to help Ireland recover.  It is labour intensive, based in rural areas throughout the country, environmentally friendly and export driven, and creates a positive international image for the country.<\/p><p>  During my time as chairman, I would see the following areas as key priorities to develop and secure the thoroughbred and breeding sector in Ireland.  We must achieve a long-term secure funding base arising from changes in the betting tax.  We need to increase prize money to ensure that owners have an incentive to keep horses in training in Ireland.<\/p> <p>We must reduce the costs of the sector, in particular from streamlining the activities of HRI and the Turf Club.  We must focus on racecourse development.  Many of Ireland's racecourse facilities are old and not on a par with facilities available at other major sporting venues in Ireland or other racecourses in the UK.<\/p><p> I am very grateful for the opportunity to meet the committee today and I pay tribute to the outgoing chairman, Denis Brosnan, who retires after a remarkable 22 years as chairman of HRI and its predecessor organisations.  I pay tribute to HRI's chief executive, Brian Kavanagh.  It is a very well-run business and I was very happy when the opportunity arose for me to consider the position.  The passion of all the people in HRI has made a great impression on me and I look forward to being chairman for the next few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400007#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Keeling","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360837200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Keeling and wish him well in his new role, which is of vital importance to the overall industry.  We are all very supportive of him and are here to help in every way we can because we all want to see our position as world leaders in the breeding sector and our fantastic worldwide reputation as great horse people and a country that excels in that sector maintained.  I worked in Punchestown racecourse for four years and know all too well the importance of and the impact that racing, both national hunt and flat, has on the local economy.  We always got the half day from school for the Punchestown festival.  It is something that everyone in Kildare is raised with and aware of.  Come the summertime, the flat season kicks in at The Curragh.<\/p><p>  I have a slight concern about the numbers attending races.  What are Mr. Keeling's views on that?  Obviously, there are economic circumstances in the country that are beyond the control of HRI but how can we ensure we increase the number of people attending races?  I completely agree with his point that we need to achieve a long-term, secure funding base arising from the change in the betting tax regime, but it is also key that people attend races for the industry to flourish.  It is up to us here to implement the change in the betting tax regime sooner rather than later and secure that funding in some way to ensure the industry can grow and make the return it does.  Too often, people refer to this as a sport.  This is why the move back to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was so important because this is an industry.  The figures stand up.  Between 16,000 and 17,000 people are employed in the industry, 4,000 of which are based in Kildare.  I am aware of how crucial this is with a value to the economy of over &euro;1 billion.<\/p><p>  What are Mr. Keeling's views on the commercial nature of the industry and the HRI given his business background?  It is very exciting to have someone coming from Mr. Keeling's background where he has grown a business into a multinational.  I am sure he has ideas about how HRI can become more commercial and build on the great work done in the past by those before him.  I know work is proceeding regarding the overall cost savings between the Turf Club and the HRI.  While we need changes in the betting regime, we also need to ensure we do things as efficiently as possible.  That is a two-pronged approach that Mr. Keeling must oversee.  There is no doubt the funding regime is important but we must be able to show that we are getting maximum efficiency and bang for our buck.  The Minister needs to be able to stand over that to deliver the State funding.  That has been the case up to now and the Minister deserves great recognition for having secured horse and greyhound funding over the past couple of years in extremely difficult financial times.<\/p><p>  The Indecon report set a roadmap for the future.  I am interested in hearing Mr. Keeling's views on the recommendations therein or what the report showed up.  He said this industry is key in helping the country to recover.  I always say that we do not need to reinvent the wheel in getting our country back on its feet.  We need to concentrate on things we are good at.  This is an industry in which we have expertise and for which we have the skills, climate, soil, horses and, most importantly, people.  We need to ensure we protect that and do not take our position in the world, particularly in breeding, for granted.  Mr. Keeling mentioned high-net-worth individuals who invest in and keep this industry going.  Does he have any concerns that we depend on very few of them?  How do we ensure the new batch of high-net-worth individuals invest in Ireland and not somewhere else?<\/p><p>  What are Mr. Keeling's views on the tote and whether there is much that can be done to increase its outcome?  I agree with his comments about his predecessor, Denis Brosnan, and the role he played.  His commitment to the industry in excess of 20 years has been phenomenal and he is well deserving of a break.  I wish Mr. Keeling well in his role.  The committee will support him and will him on during what will be a very exciting and challenging time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400008#G00200","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1360837200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.

I wish Mr. Keeling all the best.  I am very impressed with his CV.  He is coming into an industry when the economy in this country and horseracing face major challenges.  I remember going to the races at Gowran Park as a child.  Even as a teenager, when my parents were not going, I always made sure I got a lift.  It is other people coming through the gates and showing an interest in racing.  We see promotions and extra family days at many racecourses but it is not sticking.  We are not getting younger people to come to races.  People will go to Galway, Listowel, Punchestown or Fairyhouse because it is a bit of fun, but we are not getting people through the gates for the one-off day meetings.  The majority of race meetings, even those at my own track at Gowran Park, are running at a loss except for two or three big days they have per year.  Fees from television stations are keeping the tracks going.  I was watching racing in England yesterday and they were running in snow.  I know it was an all-weather track but it was covered in snow and they were running in it.  It is important for the industry because the betting industry is a major part of it.<\/p><p>  How many staff are employed by HRI?  Does the majority of funding come from profits from Tote Ireland?  Do the racetracks have to pay HRI a levy?  I acknowledge the presence of Mr. Brian Kavanagh.  I know he has a Kilkenny connection and I wish him all the best.  Trying to get younger people to come to races and to keep coming back is a major challenge for Mr. Keeling or anybody involved in HRI.  They might go for a week's racing for fun but how do we get these people to go to one-off days on the country tracks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400008#G00400","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1360837200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I wish to follow up on and support what Senator O'Neill said about attendances.  Mr. Dempsey spoke from a breeding perspective.  For the industry to thrive, one needs owners but also spectators and fans because without crowds, one does not have excitement.  It has become a profound problem.  It is not just the lack of numbers.  It also relates to the profile of racing fans.  As Senator O'Neill said, we do not, regrettably, see younger people going racing.  While we are diverting slightly, the greyhound industry has been relatively successful.  It is a different scale and it is probably easier to be impressed by 2,000 people in Shelbourne Park than 2,000 people at The Curragh, but greyhound racing certainly repackaged itself and people who never had an interest in it will now go along for a night's entertainment.  The horseracing industry needs to look seriously at why people are not switching on.<\/p> <p>I recall being at an awards function a number of years ago at which a recipient spoke about what he felt was the exclusive language used by racing people talking about their sport.  He said that if one did not feel comfortable with that language or know the terminology, one did not feel part of the club.  Anyone can go to a greyhound race and enjoy a small bet on a randomly chosen dog, but people who are not big fans of horse racing sometimes feel excluded.  They do not know the language of the industry and feel the people at the races know all the secrets.  It is hard to break into that.  We must sell racing from a mental point of view to the broader public.  If we do not bring additional people through the gates, we will not succeed.<\/p><p> I raise the issue of ownership and syndicates.  During the Celtic tiger period, every pub and club at every crossroads had a racing syndicate.  Economic reality then set in.  We need to get syndicates up and running again and that probably requires a new policy on the rules on numbers to form a syndicate.  I have been involved in a few myself and know that the concessions to syndicate members are modest.  We should be a bit more generous.  We need more owners.  We cannot depend on the flagship owners, although we desperately need them to remain <i>in situ.<\/i> Good luck to them, but my great concern is about the people who do not go racing.  Are we failing to knock down the mental wall surrounding the industry?  When I use the word &quot;exclusive&quot;, I am not talking about wealth but about the difficulty for people who do not understand racing.  If one does not know the difference between national hunt and flat racing or all-weather and turf racing, one can feel uncomfortable and decide simply to not go along.  We need a major marketing package.<\/p><p> The cost of going racing is also an issue.  Race courses have made efforts in their special packages and Mr. Keeling might well point out that there are certain days when there is no entrance fee and it still does not enhance the attractiveness of the product.  Perhaps two years ago, I went to the big Deauville racing festival in France in August where the admission was &euro;2.  It was not for the upper stand or the lower stand, it was just &euro;2.  That is the admission fee during the month of the racing festival.  On entering the track, the facilities were top class.  It was not a question of having massive stands, but of straightforward facilities such as enough seats and benches for people to sit on.  That is difficult to find at Punchestown or Galway.<\/p><p> Some of the answers to our problem are probably simple while others require deeper responses.  We need to get more people going racing.  It is our sport and if it was an Olympic event, we would win all the gold medals.  It is a pity we cannot get more young people involved.  I am very worried at the lack of young people going racing.  It must be addressed as a primary project by Horse Racing Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400008#G00500","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360837800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.  I will keep my questions for Mr. Joe Keeling extremely brief.  I welcome Horse Racing Ireland to the committee.  We are all excited about Mr. Keeling taking the chair and looking forward to all the innovations and changes he is going to introduce.  Legislation on betting is about to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are living in a very different time to the period during which the tax on betting was reduced to 1%.  I would be very interested for Horse Racing Ireland to educate us as we head towards debate on the legislation.  What does Mr. Keeling think the percentage should be?  I refer in the context of the Internet to Senator Paul Bradford's comments.  It is all very well to say that people should go racing and get involved, but that all costs money.  In December when the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, was here to discuss the budget for 2013, I made a statement on the race courses.  Horse Racing Ireland has spent a great deal of money on the country tracks and, as Senator Paul Bradford said, if the Olympics of horse racing involves breeding we can say we are one of if not the best.  However, what has been spent on Leopardstown and the Curragh and what do they look like from the perspective of England or France?  I want to hear what Mr. Keeling has to say on plans for world class facilities.<\/p><p>  Most people who breed good horses go to Newmarket to sell them.  What can we do?  How can Mr. Keeling educate us and how can we legislate or incentivise breeders to sell their horses here?  We must think of the money, tourism and visits sales here would bring.  While it is better for me to get sterling for my horse, it is unfortunate that when a horse is sold in Newmarket instead of Ireland it means we start to water down what we are good at.  People want Irish horses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400009#H00200","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1360837800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Joe Keeling.  I have had to jump between meetings and I ask him to forgive me for not being here for all of his presentation.  I echo the comments which have been made and wish him well on an important aspect of our industry.<\/p><p>  I want to focus on funding.  Mr. Keeling said one of his priorities will be to achieve a long-term, secure funding base arising from changes in the betting tax regime.  Does he have any comment to make on the background to the taxation?  My understanding of the history is that originally the Fianna F&aacute;il Government when Charlie McCreevy was Minister for Finance suggested a betting tax of 10% which was subsequently reduced to 1%.  When the late Brian Lenihan attempted to increase the tax to 2%, the betting industry reacted very badly.  It seems when one considers the share price of some of the betting companies that someone believes they are a good investment.  It is somewhat churlish, notwithstanding that everybody wants to reduce his tax bill, to object to a modest increase to 2% when the original proposal was for 10%.  Does Mr. Keeling have a view on that?  I acknowledge that it is a question of fiscal policy, but Horse Racing Ireland is saying that one of its priorities is to secure long-term funding.<\/p><p>  Proposals have been made in respect of online betting and some of the companies involved are already lobbying members of the committee.  Interestingly, the companies are in favour of regulation which they believe is the best way to operate.  They are relatively happy with the 15% that has been proposed.  When I hear that an industry is relatively happy about taxation levels, my antennae go up.  I have started asking why we are not looking for more money since online betting is proving to be even more popular than on-track betting.  More and more people are gambling, whether that is a good or bad thing, and a lot of pressure is being put on people who turn on their televisions.  Increasingly, betting companies are sponsoring major sporting events.  They make it very easy for people to access their sites at the press of a button.  They say  that if a person presses their button, he or she will get &euro;10, &euro;20 or &euro;30 to start them off.  We all know there is no such thing as free money.  The betting industry can cough up more money than it wants to.  Is Horse Racing Ireland mandated to make suggestions to Government in that regard?  It may be that it is totally outside its mandate.<\/p><p>  My understanding is that the Minister has not committed himself to ring-fencing the money which will flow from changes in the betting regime.

The taxation is ridiculously low.  I remember a time in the 1980s when it was 20% in a bookie's shop and 10% at the track.  It is inconceivable how it got to the stage it is at now.  It all starts with taxation because that answers many of the other questions.  We must be properly funded.  Initially it will be 1% but we hope that over time that will go much further.  If we want to secure a good racing industry it must be ring-fenced.  One cannot make long-term decisions to invest in facilities if every year we are wondering what will happen in the budget.  We need a five or ten year plan on funding so that we can plan.  We need to invest huge money in the Curragh and Leopardstown.  We can only do that if the funding is secure.  We are addressing this issue and will be pushing it but it will be a difficult process.  That is not going to affect the betting.  We are not talking about 20% but it will generate a huge amount of money.<\/p><p>  Since 2007 the attendance has gone down from 1.4 million to 1.2 million.  That is a drop of 15% which is not a bad achievement considering the state of the economy and that we had three bad summers which affected attendances.  It could be worse.  There is not enough interest among young people.  Most of those who go racing are over 50.  Fairyhouse and some of the other courses are bringing schools in.  There is a great deal of work to be done to encourage young people to go racing.  We will address that.<\/p><p>  I would like to improve the experience for someone who goes racing.  I am passionate about the food which is very poor at many of the race courses.  The experience in Galway is altogether different.  The minute you walk in you feel welcome.  Everybody will talk to you.  If you sit down for a cup of tea or something to eat the person next to you will talk although you might never have met that person.  Everybody shares whatever information they have.  We would like to expand that.  Punchestown is similar but Galway is unique.<\/p><p>  We could do a lot to make the high net owners feel more welcome in Ireland.  I have been meeting them.  We need to make the experience unique for them because many of these high net worth people can be lonely.  Whether a person keeps a horse in Ireland is down to people, not just the economics.  This is particularly so in the national hunt.  That depends on the skill of our trainers and facilities and the whole experience these people have here.  I will be putting a great deal of effort into that.<\/p><p>  We have to address the problem of selling horses in Ireland by encouraging people, by whatever means, to feel welcome.  They need to feel that they will be well looked after and will get a proper price for their horse here.  We would like to get far more sold here.<\/p><p>  Have I addressed everything?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Keeling"},{"type":"speech","time":1360838400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The number of facilities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021400010#J00400","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360838400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>That is a very good question but often when one looks at the smaller tracks they are actually making money.

While the reaction of Members today to the audiovisual presentations has been to laugh and smile obesity is a serious national problem.  <\/p><p>  The next point on our plan is entitled \"Fit at School, Fit for Life\".  We know that if we can get children active while in primary education the chances are they will stay fit for life.  The current recommendation on physical education is one hour per week.  We know that many children are not even getting this.<\/p><p>  Members saw the hero-teacher concept in the video presentation.  Our concept this year is recognising those in schools who make a difference, who go above and beyond the call of duty and over and beyond their required hours to get their pupils moving and healthy.  Every child in Ireland does not, unfortunately, have access to a hero teacher.  We do not believe they should.  What we are promoting is one additional hour of physical education on a weekly basis for the 3,300 national schools across Ireland, using 100 primary school physical education teachers.  We believe this would have a lasting affect at a health and national level.  More important, if we can get primary school pupils moving the chances they will continue to do so in second and third level.  <\/p><p>  We have a huge problem in secondary level schools because as children move through the curriculum physical education becomes less important.  I ask Members to think back to the time of their leaving certificate examination.  If at that time they had been offered 20 bonus points if they passed a particular level on a bleep test, how would they have reacted?  Would they have taken the opportunity to get those points, or not?  Professor Niall Moyna of Dublin City University, DCU, believes that awarding points for fitness in the secondary education system will ensure physical education remains important throughout that system.  Students at leaving certificate level could be offered bonus points if they pass a particular level in a bleep test.<\/p><p>  As a nation, we once had a problem with honours level mathematics.  This was addressed by way of giving extra points to those students who took honours mathematics.  We believe the same incentive should be put in place for physical education.  On last week's show, we carried out a bleep test on a fourth year class in Athlone, the results of which were shocking.  The students' fitness levels did not come anywhere near the EU recommendation.  We offered the incentive of &euro;1,000 if they could pass the test eight weeks later and they did.  The results were above the EU recommendation.  The return on this investment - a bleep test, for which a CD and CD player is required - at school level, which is one of the most stressful times in anyone's life, will be healthier students whose results will be better.  It will also prolong the physical education system.  Chances are that students at third level will be active if they were active at leaving certificate level.<\/p><p>  We believe points for fitness is a key, simple and effective message.  From an exercise perspective, the Step-it-Up campaign and Points for Fitness, are simple, key tools, which are cost effective and easy to implement and will deliver real results.  We have shown through the audiovisual presentations what can happen.  We have shown the results.  The ball is now in the committee's court.

We began this three years ago when we saw how it was working in America.  It is very simple.  Beside the price on a menu one can see the calories in an item.  With food chains, it gives people the chance to make informed decisions about what they are buying.  Right now, somebody is buying a muffin but that person has no idea that the item contains a quarter of their recommended food intake for the day.<\/p><p>  The Food Safety Authority has surveyed people and those in the industry, and 96% of people wanted calorie posting.  That is how clear it is.  The Food Safety Authority promised action on this 12 months ago and we are still waiting.  There is talk of a soft approach, where chains can make their own interpretation of calorie posting.

I welcome the delegation.  This has been an exceptionally interesting morning for the committee.  The delegation has made one of the most compelling cases that any of us have ever heard.  I congratulate each of the five leaders.  They have not spoken yet but they have spoken to us in other ways to each and every one of us.<\/p><p>  Many of us here, myself included, could be where the participants are.  We must build awareness of the appropriate weight for anyone of us.  That is one of the lessons that came out of the message this morning, particularly for parents.  The case of the mother and the young boy of 12 years is a little more obvious than many cases that would equally merit address.  We must pay more than lip service to the problem.  We must examine what we can do and not only in terms of encouragement which is important.  We must explore the possibility of legislative changes but it will take more than this committee to do so.  It will require an across-the-board holistic address comprising the Department of Health, Department of Education and Skills, <i>safe<\/i>food Ireland, who have an important role to play, the HSE plus the contribution made by the show.  It is important to continue improving when the show wraps.  It is a little like the pre conversation that we had before the group arrived, and Dr. Murphy made the point, the participants are in the business of change.  None of us are more aware of that than I having looked at the faces of those who appeared on the current programme.  When I look around at the committee members this morning there are only two of us who could possibly have signed up three years ago for the &quot;Count Me In&quot; programme.  I was one of them and I had an opportunity to appear briefly on the group's previous television presentation.  Change is very much a part of political life too.  <\/p><p>  One of the things that the committee could leave as its legacy is a little bit of leadership, like in political life, and what can be done to follow on the example given when the programme concludes.  It would be terrible to lose good habits learned from the programme.  Many of those people from political life who participated in the video presentation made by the group would acknowledge that the best practice that they had adopted over the period started to dissipate as time moved on.  Old habits easily return.  We need to encourage people to continue the good habits learned.  A seven point plan was provided by Dr. Murphy, Dr. Orsmond and Mr. Henry and I thank them for their powerful presentation.  We must recognise the common denominator between their plan and the <i>safe<\/i>food recommendations.  There is much that we can do but it must be a collaborative job of work.  I thank the group again.  The five participants have been powerfully courageous and they have done us all a great service.  I wish them good luck in the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013021400007#F00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1360835700,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank the delegation for the presentation.  I wish to express particular thanks to the team leaders who are Ms Charlotte O'Connell, Mr. Gavin Walker, Ms Deirdre Halford, Mr. Gregg Starr and Ms Monica Percy.  I also wish to thank the boy named Aaron.  With my children's rights background I am particularly passionate about childhood obesity.  His mother and him were very honest.  The challenge of childhood obesity is being faced in many households in Ireland.  The presentation is a wake-up call for all of us.  That is why I welcome the seven point plan outlined to us today.<\/p><p>  I welcome the approach taken by \"Operation Transformation\".  Unlike its contemporary programmes in the UK and US which have winners and are so competitive, \"Operation Transformation\" is about lifestyle changes and our health.  The honesty of the leaders in facing some of their life issues in a public sphere gives heart to the rest of us and encourages us to face up to our own challenges.  We can never underestimate the power of handling issues in a non-judgemental manner.  <\/p><p>  I welcome the \"Step it Up\" campaign.  The best bit for me was the pride in the young people's faces as they sat in their classroom and declared the number of steps each had taken.  It shows the possibility and potential of the campaign.  The project can build the self-esteem of young people and they learn that they can be part of their own solution.  Often we look at children as problems rather than leaders and I welcome that development.  I also welcome the involvement of parents.  <\/p><p>  I agree with the delegation's promotion of having fruit at checkouts and healthy prompts which we all know about.  Recently I spoke to transition year students participating in a cross-community project in Howth and Sutton.  During the workshop we had a coffee break and they surprised me by producing fruit cups and a plate of biscuits.  The fruit cups were in plastic cups and two-thirds of the boys and girls chose them to eat.  It was amazing to see how easily a healthy option can be made available and incorporated into their lives.  I have also been to a school located in a disadvantaged area which has a breakfast club.  The school realised that the children's lunches were bad.  A new initiative was prompted when a child was found standing over a bin eating dry pot noodles.  I am not a pot noodle fan but I found the idea of eating dry pot noodles disconcerting.  The teacher decided to deal with the matter.  The school invited the parents in with their children and informed them about the types of lunches they could make.  That child now makes her own tuna wrap for school.<\/p><p>  That brings me to another issue.  There are figures which state that one in four or five children, depending on which research one reads, go to school hungry.  All of us think that is due to austerity and poverty created by the recession.  In fact the reason many of those children go to school hungry is due to the wherewithal of their parents and it is not always a monetary issue.  Clearly there are some poverty issues.  It is also a matter of having the right foods in a household to allow children eat a breakfast in the morning and therefore are better prepared for school.  <\/p><p>  I welcome the \"Count Me In\" initiative and when I visited New York last summer it influenced my eating.  Being able to see the  calorie content does have a direct effect on the food choices that one makes.  It encourages us to choose a healthier option.  <\/p><p>  The programme has given the Irish nation a challenge.  It has given politicians an even greater challenge because me must see how we can implement the seven step plan and what role we can play.  I thank the delegation for its leadership. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013021400007#F00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1360835700,"counter":98,"content":"<p>The final speaker in this section is the committee's rapporteur on our report on childhood obesity, Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013021400007#F00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1360835700,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I welcome the experts Dr. Murphy, Dr. Orsmond and Mr. Henry.

We could save money through the measure of improving people's health.  Type 2 diabetes care is costing the Government millions of euro.  By reducing the incidence of diabetes by 10% we could save &euro;145 million in the health budget.  I see this regularly.  It is not only early diagnosed diabetes but also diabetes that has lasted well over five years.  People are on insulin medication which is costing the Government a fortune.  We would have to incentivise people if the disease is due to lifestyle.  The threshold for the medication could be increased.  We should have some sort of incentive to stop taking the money from the vulnerable people whose lifestyle can be changed.<\/p><p>  I am not in politics but my comments are based on my surgery and the patients I see.  I have patients whose medication costs the Government &euro;400 per month.  Once patients lose the weight they basically only spend &euro;20 or &euro;50 per month on medication.  This is all realistic.  Obviously, not everybody has the will power or the resources at present.  However, if one was given the funding to set a trial or show something like that, I am sure we could increase these numbers.  We are talking about &euro;145 million for a 10% reduction.  One can look at the list of prescription drugs and what drugs are most often prescribed.  Statin drugs are prescribed like sweets at present.  They are based on trials showing there is a huge decrease in the cardiovascular risk factor profile, but many people are on these medications because they are told they have a genetic background for this disease.  In reality, it is an environmental problem.  Their parents were already overweight, they were eating in a certain way and they created the cardiovascular disease, not because it was genetical but due to their lifestyle.  These people did not get it from their genes but from their environment.<\/p><p>  We need to start looking at where we can save money.

During the programme my two children and I have been cooking at home and they love it.  Perhaps we could facilitate something like that in national school.

It is a difficult challenge even where we are presented with obvious health reasons to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013021400009#H00200","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speech","time":1360836900,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I thank the experts.  The leaders look great.  I love the seven-point plan and I am trying to mull over it.  Can the medical witnesses comment on birth weight?  People say that it is genetic and that they cannot lose weight.  With regard to the psychologists, I come from a teaching background and always found it very difficult to talk about weight in a classroom because of the possibility of pinpointing and embarrassing one or two overweight children.  The teacher worries about bullying and psychological effects on the child.  I am also interested in the points made about mood and depression.  Are helpful figures available on that?<\/p><p>  Reference was made to stepping up.  What did children do to go from 2,000 steps to 15,000 and 30,000 steps?  Can we get the message out to parents?  As someone who has done every diet in the book, even though I thought I knew everything about food I had to get someone to help me to lose a stone and a half.  One reads all the diet material and the calorie count but one forgets to balance foods and to eat protein and carbohydrate.  We have very poor knowledge of food and cooking.  I am not great at the latter.  How do we get the message out to people?  I have read that teenage girls drop off at 16 or 17 years of age and do not get involved in exercise from that point on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013021400009#H00300","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1360836900,"counter":121,"content":"<p>How many of the family members of the witnesses have changed their lifestyles since they enlisted in the programme?  Have they changed their lifestyles because of the participation of the witnesses in the programme?  In going to schools, did the witnesses find children in poorer areas were more obese than those in more affluent areas?<\/p><p>  My third question concerns parenting and the responsibility of parents.  Do the witnesses think parents are being let off the hook if we expect schools to take on that role?  There are 84 waking hours in the week of a child and, of that, only 25 hours are spent in school.  The witnesses referred to the importance of education and fitness in school, yet the first reference was always to school rather than parents, who seem to be second or third on the list.<\/p><p>  I grew up in a big family in a working-class area.  I was in the attic the other night looking for a photograph for a book.  I came across a box of photographs of children, including myself, who used to go on club holidays with Sunshine House.  I did not see one fat kid in the photograph.  I was 18 years old at the time and I was a size 6.  The difficulty is that parents depend on everyone else outside to do things for their children.  We have lost the value of what it is to be a family and to sit at home.  Children do not bring the basket to the supermarket counter; adults do.  We are responsible for what we put in it.<\/p><p>  I happen to be a good cook, and I am not afraid to say it, because my mother was a good cook.  We had basic meals.  There was always bacon and cabbage and home baking.  Brown bread or biscuits were always being made at home.  We did not have money.  We got a cake from Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien with a little cherry on top on our birthdays.  People were not buying cakes for &euro;50 for their children.  The most important point is that we have a responsibility when we bring a child into the world.  From day one, no matter what else we do, we have a responsibility to teach them to be sensible adults and grow up in good health.  Now, we are depending on outside influences, including the \"Operation Transformation\" programme, which encourages parents to take more of a back seat.  I do not agree with that and I think parents should be more proactive and get involved with their children.<\/p><p>  I have one son who never played football because I was always on the sidelines screaming at him.  I have four daughters, none of whom play sport, but they are all conscious of their weight and what they eat.  That came not from outside but from being around the kitchen table.  We always have our meals sitting at the kitchen table.  None of my children, who are grown adults now, would have been allowed to have their meals sitting in front of the television.  There is a lesson for all of us.  One of the witnesses referred to plain, good old-fashioned eating.  Most of us were reared like this and we need to go back to that and place more responsibility on parents when they bring children into the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013021400009#H00400","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1360836900,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I thank those who have presented to the committee.  Recently I heard a statistic of which we should all be conscious.  This is the first generation of children whose life expectancy is shorter than that of their parents.  There is an onus on all of us to tackle that.  Dr. Eva Orsmond made an important point on obesity.  We are in straitened economic times but there is money to be saved.<\/p> <p>The obesity problem is costing the health sector alone &euro;5,700 every single minute of every single day.  There is plenty of money to be shaved off and invested in other sectors of the health service. <\/p><p> Dr. Eddie Murphy touched on the issue of mental health that is continually ignored.  The five leaders from &quot;Operation Transformation&quot; are a good example.  The attitude change, with the leaders making dramatic changes in their outlook and perspective on life during the course of the programme has a significant benefit from the mental health perspective. <\/p><p> We are raising the challenges relating to suicide in society.  I think we can assist society if we focus our investment on mental health.  It is about an attitude change.  As Deputy Catherine Byrne said we must try to give parents the tools so that they can assist their children<b><\/b>and thereby change that statistic.  We all wish that children will have a longer life expectancy than their parents.<\/p><p> It was only after it was mentioned here this morning that I recalled that in some supermarkets one must go out of one's way to find the fruit and vegetable section.  Other supermarkets are designed in such a way that one is forced to go through the fruit and vegetable section.

They have saved significant sums of money in terms of nudging people to make better choices and it answers the questions on the role of parents.  People thought that fewer would cycle in Ireland when the cycle scheme was introduced in Dublin, but it turned out that it became the social norm and bicycle sales increased.<\/p><p>  We need to create new social norms in order that we need to distinguish between entertainment and eating.  Sometimes we eat in front of the television.  We need to provide structure so that people are eating with the family around the table.  There is an increased incidence of obesity in poor children and in working class areas.  Senator Colm Burke raised the discussion on weight with health care professionals.  It is almost that obesity has become the new stigma.  It is a bit like talking around suicide and mental health.  We need to drop the diplomacy and have honest and real conversations and give people the capacity and the language to have conversations that engage people to say \"This is where I think you are at\".  Rather than lecturing people, we must invite people to change and they may come on board.  If one lectures people, they will step back and go back into child mode and rebel against the advice.  One needs to change the process and invite people to take help to engage in the process of change.  \"Operation Transformation\" remains on the website throughout the year.  It is a free programme and people can commence the food and exercise programme and engage in change.  The programme raises awareness and gives them a focused awareness so that they understand the process.  At present being overweight and obesity are seen as the norm.  Young people of 14 years weight 3 stone 7 lbs more than their grandfathers did at the same age.  I think that is incredible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013021400010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eddie Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360837500,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I conducted research on the need for weight management among hospital staff members in Loughlinstown hospital in 2000-2001 with Dr. Donal O'Shea.  I assessed 260 out of 350 members of staff, including doctors, nurses and hospital staff members.  I showed that the hospital staff members were not doing any better than the rest of the population, which is totally understandable.  From a public health perspective, these people are going to be the starting point for change because they are the ones who make the first intervention.  They are the ones who get advice from a public health perspective.<\/p><p>  I am from Finland and worked and lived there for many years.  The Scandinavian countries have good public health outcomes and money is spent on prevention.  I am not here to look at the weight of doctors, but they are living in this society and their overweight levels are similar to the rest of the population.  It is very unlikely overweight and obese doctors will raise in their professional capacity an issue of weight or lifestyle if they themselves do not feel they are a good example.  It is very difficult.  We need to provide the knowledge and education on nutrition to help hospital staff members and medical professionals.  This is the point I was focusing on - knowledge and education.  At present, doctors have very little if any nutritional education as part of their curriculum.  Children do not learn anything about nutrition or food unless they take home economics.  Even if we are raising awareness of the numbers, we all know we have an obesity epidemic so we do not need to do more research on that.  We know it already but what step follows highlighting the problems?  Who gives the advice and what advice is given?  Even if we put the calories on the menus, people still need to understand that calories on their own do not mean anything, one needs to look at the protein, vitamin and mineral content of the menu.  My concern is that concentrating on counting calories without considering the nutritional content could lead to other problems.  In the end I believe in the fact that everything starts from the family.  I am the mother of two children, but we need to have the professional giving support to families.  That is what I mean by support from doctors, nurses and teachers.  Anybody who has children knows how difficult it is to bring up children.  Once they go out their front door they are standing against the world.

I keep apologising to him and say that is just the way it is and to get used to it.  Our families and the whole town has changed.  Everything has changed.  People's attitude has changed.  A group of people who walk during the day, walk every night also as a social activity.  People are getting out of the pubs and are beginning to talk to each other.  We live in a very small community, Borrisokane, which has a population of just over 1,000 people.  There are people there who did not know each other.  That would not have happened years ago.  When we were younger, everybody knew everybody.  Children got out, climbed walls, ran through the fields, swung off trees and did whatever children were supposed to do but children do not do that any more.  There is a huge responsibility on parents.<\/p><p>  My son, Eoin, is in the primary education system.  The success of the \"Be safe, be seen\" campaign, is due to the wearing of high visibility jackets which are everywhere.

Their success lies in educating the children and educating the parents, as primary schoolchildren bring everything home, good and bad, to the parents.<\/p><p>  I had no idea of proper diet or proper control before the show started.

We have to monitor ourselves, weigh ourselves and our children and educate children and parents on what we are eating.  There is so much rubbish in processed foods.  When one eats fresh, one stays fresh and one's life is fresh.  I believe a good national campaign, which does not have to cost a lot of money, would help educate primary schoolchildren in moving and eating correctly.  The children will bring home the message and the parents will move with them and will realise that what they are feeding their children is wrong.

There is a concern because in the new structures in the child and family services there is an amount of psychology.  In Ireland we train 35 clinical psychologists per year, which is a very low number.  In terms of the new configuration in the health service, there is a concern that the activity for children in primary centres will change because there is a risk that psychology will be plucked from primary care and put into the new child agency with a child protection focus so they will not have the professionals on the ground to support teachers and give them messages.  There are some very good programmes that can take place in the school environment, such as the friends programme which looks at building school resilience in the primary school setting and can support the conversation about increasing the children's resilience and self-esteem.  One of the areas of concern about bullying is to try to impact on the bystander, to increase the role of the bystander to intervene.  If that happens, it would reduce the amount of bullying and the consequences on the self-esteem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013021400011#K01600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eddie Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1360838100,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Are Members aware the restaurant here, as a consequence of politicians taking part in \"Operation Transformation\" a few years ago, has an \"Operation Transformation\" option on the menu?

In regard to the restaurant, I do not think the issue is the calorie count but to go light on the portions put on one's plate.  It takes discipline to say that.<\/p><p>  As one who has run 100 to 120 miles per week to achieve whatever goals I had in my sport and being very conscientious about proper diet in order to achieve excellence, I was fortunate to be reared in a family that educated me in exercise, running around the streets of Drimnagh.  I am fortunate that my children and nobody in my family has health issues, such as obesity.  I am fortunate that my little grandchildren of one and four years of age are already developing literacy skills.  This is where we have to nip it in the bud going forward.

The Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport all do wonderful things in many different areas around the country.  We need synergy, with everyone coming together.  There is an old clich&eacute; about obesity.  Sometimes I look at people and wonder how they could have allowed themselves become so overweight.  We are what we eat.  What one puts in and what one puts out makes the difference.

I will come back later to the Points for Life initiative and where it is at now.  When I visited schools I met the principals the physical education teachers and one of the questions I asked was where physical education sits in terms of priority on the syllabus in primary school.  It is at the bottom.  Where does the physical well-being of the children who are going to school sit in terms of priority?  It is at the top.  Why is physical education not taken seriously in schools?  It is not really taken seriously in schools.<\/p><p>  Karl mentioned the points for fitness.  My Points for Life initiative was the subject of a motion in the Seanad, November 12 months ago, and on foot of it a committee was set up and it met representatives of schools.  Professor Niall Moyna, Professor O'Shea and one representative from five Departments were on that committee.  We met month after month and discussed the exact same issues at our meetings as we are discussing here today but the question is how we bring about change.  I was getting completely frustrated with it at one stage and I said \"Forget about it\".  Coming from my background in sports I understand how simple it is to implement these changes.  We did that with the children in my running community from a young age and they have now become adults and parents themselves and they understand the benefits they got through education.  <\/p><p>  If we consider the education side, Senator Catherine Byrne referred to parents.  This must be parent-led, schools-led, national governing bodies-led and community-led and they also must come together.  However, everybody wants to go to the schools, whether it is to deal with the issue of cyberbullying, physical fitness or obesity.  The notion is put forward that in order to deal with every issue we must approach the schools.  However, the biggest problem I have in implementing the Points for Life infinitive, and it is points for life as opposed to points for college, are the school teachers, the various unions and the training colleges.  The reason for that is that from my research and the meetings I have had, I have discovered that in terms of physical education delivery in primary schools, there is no real qualifications for delivering simple programmes because physical education is basically to play a little bit of ball here and play a little bit of ball there.  We have to nip it in the bud and instill fundamental skills, not only physical literacy skills but movement skills in young children because I have seen the benefit of doing that.  If we can instil those fundamental skills in children they will become secondary school students and later parents and ten, 15 or 20 years down the road they will instil those skills in their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013021400013#N00400","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speech","time":1360839000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  It is great to meet all of them.  I have watched the programme when I get to do so and it is fantastic.  There are so many issues I would like to discuss that I do not know where to start.  On the parenting issue, I agree with the previous speakers.  The parenting issue is important.  We do not only need more education for children in this area in primary schools but parent education is also needed.  There are parenting courses in existence but it is very hard to approach that subject without being somewhat patronising.  We need to embrace the whole area of food education and parenting education generally for parents at large, pardon the pun.  In general, childhood obesity cannot be blamed on society or on the child.  It must be the parent who is primarily responsible for that.  We need to extend the witnesses' points on education in primary schools to parenting education.<\/p><p>  I would also be interested in this issue in terms of when students leave secondary school.  That is when I felt I fell out of touch with physical education.  It is then one becomes somewhat focused on other things but I know that depends on the individual.  <\/p><p>  The Count Me In idea is a great one.  Is that one the witnesses' would envisage for fast-food type commercial enterprises?  It would create practical difficulties for restaurants and their owners to adopt given that they may change their menus every day.  I heard a good deal about that from the restaurants associations, etc.<\/p><p>  On the issue of low fat products, and this is probably a question for Dr. Eva, one hears of the fat and low fat content of products but when I see a product with a low fat label, I think chemical explosion and I do not want to eat that food.  I am at a level where I am nearly over-educated about food and I need to relax a bit.  I am probably a bit obsessive which is another issue.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of GPs, in which I am interested, educating GPs is fine, but we need a stricter code whereby if somebody presents with these certain levels at a certain stage, the GP should be compelled to put the person into a programme, although that might be a bit harsh, but there should be some onus on GPs to address the issue.  On the nutrition point Dr. Eva raised about GPs, I have four, five or six friends who are GPs and they do not have a clue about nutrition.  They are the very ones who will go on crash diets and advocate ideas that are bonkers.  Nutrition is something GPs do not know about and many speakers have addressed that point.  <\/p><p>  The difficulty in speaking at this stage is that previous speakers have made the points that I intended to make.  There is also the psychological issue and I do not necessarily mean mental health but mental health can be very much enhanced by exercise.  I mean the psychological issues as to why somebody is overweight.  I have very personal experience of this and that is something that needs to be addressed.  It is easy for Dr. Eva, with the greatest of respect, to say that we should take a person off medication but there are reasons, deep-rooted psychological reasons sometimes, as to why people are overweight.  That is an issue we would also need to address.<\/p><p>  Healthy food choices are difficult to get.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013021400013#N00500","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1360839000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Thank you, Senator.

As someone who has struggled with her weight all her life I had to think twice about coming to today's meeting.  I find it very difficult to talk about it.  That is unusual because I am a politician and the only woman who stood in two elections in a male-dominated area.  I usually cast it aside.  As women politicians we are often scrutinised about our appearance.  The online chatter when we make a television appearance is often about what our hair or double chin looks like rather than about what we say about the politics of the day.  A lot of Irish women struggle with their appearance.<\/p><p>  I agree with much of what has been said.  I am a mother of a young daughter.  We all struggle to try to manage our time.

My daughter is actively involved in the local hockey club and the local GAA club.  We get notes home about the crazy driving behaviour of parents bringing their children to sporting activities.  People are driving who live five or ten minutes away, including me.  We must think about that.<\/p><p>  Another issue was raised about young teenage girls.  I was active as a teenager.  I was involved in basketball and athletics but the focus was always on winning, not on taking part.  That is a problem because not everyone is going to be an Eamonn Coghlan.  We need fitness.  The emphasis in this country is always on competitiveness and that is a problem.<\/p><p>  Another issue of concern to me as the mother of a young daughter is that as a punishment if one misbehaves in school one is told to sit out from PE.  What kind of message is that sending to children?  That happens on a regular basis.  Children misbehave.  Anyone who has children knows that.  My child is a bit of a chatterbox.  I am sure she is a bit of a nuisance at the back of the classroom from time to time.  Her punishment is to sit out from the 40 minutes of exercise provided in a week.  We must examine the message we are sending to children in terms of the competitive behaviour displayed by parents on the sidelines and also as a result of the fact that the focus of clubs is always on winning and not on taking part.  In defence of some clubs, the GAA has been excellent in trying to get women in particular involved by encouraging mothers to train alongside their children when they bring them to training sessions.<\/p><p>  A worrying revelation is that the number one reason young teenage girls give for not wanting to do exercise is that it would make them sweat.  That is the reality.  What kind of society are young women growing up in that they are afraid to sweat in front of their peers?

The one thing that has emerged in the oncology literature in recent years is that in addition to the other well-recognised health implications of obesity and overweight there is also an increased risk of cancer.  Not only that; there is an increased risk of the return of cancer if one has had it.  That makes it a real and practical issue.  I spend time taking dietary histories.  It has forced me to the conclusion that we all need to know: it is not all about good food versus bad food.  It is sometimes too much of the good foods.  In fact, frequently it is too much of the good foods.  If one talks to an average middle-aged or elderly person who is obese, they are not eating crisps or cakes but they are having a great big feed of spuds every night with their dinner.  They sometimes cannot understand why they are not losing weight.  As well as the quality of food we must focus as well on the quantity.<\/p><p>  There is a whole parcel of things related to education in the medical curriculum.  One of the most powerful interventions for the treatment of smoking or weight gain is for a doctor to sit down with a patient and talk to him or her.  That is powerful and carries a weight that many other interventions do not have.  One must incentivise doctors for all the reasons Dr. Orsmond has told us about.<\/p><p>  The most extraordinary example of muddled health economics is going on currently.  It can take six years to get bariatric weight reduction surgery in this country.  The aggregate waiting list to see someone in the obesity clinic and then the waiting list following the clinic for those recommended for surgery can be six to seven years.  It is desperate.  During that time, the cost of treating those people, many of whom will die, for diabetes and sleep apnoea, which is unbelievably expensive to treat, is high.  It could be cost-neutral if we could shorten the waiting list and offer more people nutritional counselling.<\/p><p>  Dr. Orsmond referred to the unhealthy lives of Irish doctors compared to those in Finland.  There are approximately four times as many hospital specialists in Finland as in this country.  She referred to a specialty.  In oncology the figure is 6:1.  We have a bizarrely understaffed medical structure in this country, which is not good for the health of doctors or their patients.  It means there is no opportunity to sit down and have a ten-minute or 15-minute conversation with someone about his or her weight when the waiting list is full of another 120 who are waiting to come in to see one, who in turn might save the health service money if such a preventative intervention is made.

The television was not put on until 6 o'clock in the evening, and there were no video games.  There was not a lot of money and many mothers worked in the home.  In general, when one came home from school the dinner was meat, two vegetables and potatoes.  There were no fizzy drinks.  Biscuits were a treat perhaps once a week.  Cake was for birthdays or an occasional treat.  There were very few fast-food outlets.  People did not have a lot of money.  Fast food and ready meals were not available.  Our lifestyles have changed and everything has shifted.  People went out to work and time became important.  People were doing shift work and unsocial hours.<\/p> <p>Fast food such as pizza was always the best option for parents rushing to work, but we must reverse that, and the only way we can do it is by working collectively through education.  We must start in schools by educating the children, and the children will then educate their parents.

The Count Me In initiative is essential.  If there were calorie counts on a menu I was reading I would think twice about what to order, and I believe many people would do the same.

The Step it Up programme is essential, but we must make it fun for people to participate because not every child is interested in sports.<\/p><p> I take on board what Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor said about weighing in at school.  We must take account of children's feelings because if it is not done sensitively, they could be bullied.

We have an opportunity to address it collectively and perhaps bring forward legislation that will give people a chance.  Most of the points were covered but I want to say \"Well done\".

For those people who are time-poor, it is about structuring society and the way we engage with our environment to nudge people towards healthier choices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013021400015#P00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eddie Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360840200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>From my perspective, I will tie in with what both Dr. Murphy and Dr. Orsmond said.  We are here to represent \"Operation Transformation\" as a brand, an entity, and something that in the past six years has got the nation moving in an increasingly bigger way every year.  We have seen that in terms of the responses to the information we put on the website, which is available all year round.  We have seen it also in terms of the viewing figures for the show, which are now close to 600,000.<\/p><p>  \"Operation Transformation\" has been so successful because we keep it simple.  That is one of the key components we came here today to discuss with members.  It is fantastic to get to talk at a forum but often the message gets lost in translation, picking on one element of society or another.  The reality is that our seven-point plan is a multi-factorial process to get people fit and healthy.  <\/p><p>  On \"Operation Transformation\" we looked at children, and Step it Up is the campaign we used.  We kept it simple and got the results.  It was nothing to do with sports.  It was giving children a goal and a method to achieve that goal, measured by the teachers or the parents, and they succeeded in reaching it.<\/p><p>  With regard to adult obesity, we built a website and showed people how to cook food and exercise.  We asked them to walk three times a week.  We gave them a goal of a 5 km run in eight weeks and a training plan with which to achieve those goals.<\/p><p>  The show has 600,000 viewers.  It is the single biggest health programme Ireland has ever had, and it is getting more popular every year for one reason - we are more unhealthy and heavier than ever before.  People want help.  They want the message and the knowledge.  We do not get lost in translation.  We promote simple messages that work.  That is the reason the show is successful.  We believe our seven-point plan will be successful for the same reason; it is simple, effective, and easy to implement and measure.  We are giving people the tools to succeed on a multi-factorial level.  It does involve the schools and the parents.  <\/p><p>  Everybody in society has to change through whatever structure.  We believe that children are the key to this change.  They will be the Senators and TDs ten, 20, 30 or 40 years from now.  They will be sitting in committees such as this one.  Will they be heavier than the people we see here today or not?  That depends on the legislation we put in place in the coming years.  <\/p><p>  We are here to present our seven-point plan on behalf of the show.  It will work.  We have shown members footage.  They may have sat through presentations in the past and listened to fantastic statistics.  We did not do that.  We kept it simple and visual.  We showed members the results of our progress.  We have five fantastic leaders who have literally transformed the nation through their progress by using simple techniques and tools.  They cooked healthier and better food.  They set goals with Dr. Murphy and, from my perspective, they moved a little more.  <\/p><p>  This is not a quick-fix solution; it is a long-term solution.  We have proved that it works, and we used visuals today to show members that.  The proof is on the screens.  The key aspect is not to get caught up in too much talk because the message gets lost in translation.  By keeping it simple we have proved this works, and we have shown that to members.  We hope that because we are keeping it simple, one or more of our seven-point plans might be in place by this time next year when we can come back here and pat all the members on the back for the fantastic job they did in implementing one or more of those measures.  If we get one of those over the line we believe we will have healthier, happier children but also a healthier, happier nation.  If members want proof of that I ask them to come to our 5 km run next Saturday week, where they will see 5,000 people who were sitting on the couch eight weeks ago.  We gave them a goal and the tools to achieve that goal.  Members should come along on the day to see the feeling of pride and emotion when those people cross the line, and how happy they have become over the course of an eight-week timeframe.  The results are there for all to see, and we hope members take something from that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013021400015#P00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Karl Henry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360840200,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I would like to respond to the comment about the very long queue for bariatric surgery.

On the effect of \"Operation Transformation\", because I was part of a group last year and lost a great deal of weight, and then wanted to step it up to become a leader this year to continue my weight loss, we saw our group grow.  We now have over 100 members.  Twenty-four of them are under the age of 18, some as young as eight years of age.  Some are heavy, some are not.  Some are involved in it for the physical fitness and social side of it.  We never discussed individuals' weight with them but what was discussed was how much they were losing per week.<\/p><p>  With the younger children, especially, it became nearly a competition among themselves and they thrived on it.  Obviously, the heavier children were losing a bit more and they were winning.  The children loved it.  They were focused, not on their weight but on how well they were doing each week because, as anyone who works with children will know, they do not have a very long attention span.<\/p><p>  I help coach the under eights in rugby and I have seen children of all sizes and shapes coming to us.  It is having an effect on them.  Obviously, the first week they came down because they wanted to go on television, but we are getting increasing numbers of children in and getting them out running.  It has just been fantastic.  Even if they stop after \"Operation Transformation\" or if the group dies off, it is two months' exercise a year that they were not getting last year or the year before.

Under the proposed regulations, a fines and penalty points system will be introduced.  Perhaps Mr. McGuinness might elaborate on the problems he foresees in this regard.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of offences, the Minister has stated this process will apply retrospectively to the taxi industry.  He has also mentioned that almost 6,000 registered taxi drivers have some conviction.  This means that in some cases taxi drivers will have their licences suspended or revoked.  The legal advice I have obtained on that issue is that this cannot be done.  While I propose to pursue the matter, it will also have to be taken up by someone involved in the taxi industry.  As I have repeatedly said, under the Good Friday Agreement, there are people who should be exempt from these so-called offences.

On taxi ranks, in Dublin alone there are approximately 680 taxi spaces-standing areas.  These taxi spaces-standing areas cater for approximately 10,500 taxis.  At any given time of the day there are probably 4,500 to 5,000 taxis on the road.  One of our main bones of contention with the demerits scheme is that it will leave taxi drivers queuing for a position on a taxi stand open to prosecution.  A person caught in such a position by an enforcement officer will receive one demerit point.  A person who accumulates eight such points, through no fault of his or her own but because of a lack of taxi waiting areas, can have his or her licence suspended for up to eight weeks.  This is a draconian measure for a minor breach of the regulations.  We also note a duplication in the fixed charge penalties and demerits scheme.  The authority, enforcement officer or garda imposing the penalty determines whether a person is to be charged under the fixed charge scheme or the demerits points scheme.<\/p><p>  On the demerits points scheme, we have queried with the Department of Social Protection whether a taxi driver suspended under the scheme should be entitled to social welfare benefits.<\/p> <p>So far we have not received any answer.  That leaves taxi drivers in a position where, if they are suspended, their families would be in a precarious situation.  Some of the demerit points are draconian and our industry, in particular, should not be singled out for such a scheme.  We can already receive penalty points through the Road Traffic Acts, leading to suspension of a licence.<\/p><p> Criminal offences have been mentioned.  The Minister has stated on a number of occasions that he wants the public to feel safe getting into a taxi and he is trying to create an environment in which the public will use taxis because people will know they are safe.  There was a figure in a number of news media indicating that 6,000 taxi drivers have criminal offences.  The next sentence in the report may have mentioned rape, murder and drug dealing.  That will tar all taxi drivers with one brush.  Many of the criminal offences relating to the 6,000 drivers would be minor and come from a number of years ago.  The statement in the media discourages people from getting into a car, and as a taxi driver, I was shocked to hear that message.  People getting into a taxi would think the driver could be one of the 6,000 with a criminal offence, and he or she could be guilty of a major criminal offence.  The statistic has not served its purpose and has instead put it into the mind of the public that the majority of taxi drivers have serious criminal offences, which is far from the truth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013021400003#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360836600,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of the industry.

They are serious aspects which must be examined by the Garda, regardless of whether the matter is heard in the D&aacute;il next week.  The issue will probably have to return to us.<\/p><p>  A couple of weeks ago I met a deputation of taxi drivers belonging to a different organisation.  There are a number of organisations representing taxi drivers so are they all singing from the same hymn sheet?  Is that part of the problem?  I suggested that we should introduce a system of taxi marshals, as there are in other major countries, especially at some of the more problematic taxi ranks, such as the rank at the top of O'Connell Street and Dawson Street at night, as well as Heuston Station, which operates in a very unsatisfactory manner from the customer perspective.

The majority of the organisations agree on 90% of the issues being raised today.  As a result of a meeting last Tuesday, we made representations to the secretary of the committee for other organisations to send a member here today.  The proposed legislation has focused the minds of all the organisations to work to the benefit of members and leave personal differences behind.  There is greater co-operation as a result.<\/p><p>  The Senator mentioned the O'Connell Street rank, which has been ridiculed throughout the country in the media and everywhere else.  There was a problem in the location up to approximately two years ago.  Our organisation set up meetings with the local superintendent and sergeant in Store Street Garda station, making a number of recommendations on how the rank could work better.  A year and a half ago the recommendations were put in practice by the drivers on the rank, and it now operates successfully.  There have been race related issues at the rank but a number of our members are from outside of Ireland and work on that rank.  Some of the stories are urban myth at this stage and what used to happen does not really happen any more.<\/p><p>  This is an example of taxi drivers working with the Garda to sort out issues as they arise.  We worked with garda&iacute; in Store Street station to resolve issues relating to the Sackville Place taxi rank at the side of Clery's shop.  We contacted the Garda and it was in its interest that we were allocated more spaces as a holding area for taxis, as there had been illegal activity in the area.  The illegal practices have now ceased as there is a constant flow of taxi drivers going through the area.  It was an area where one may not have ventured before but taxis are now parked waiting for work.  The garda&iacute; in Store Street station worked with us and Dublin City Council in making that holding area.<\/p> <p> The marshalling of ranks is a good suggestion.  There was also a suggestion that taxi drivers should pay for it.  As the National Transport Authority takes in a lot of money every year from the taxi industry perhaps it could fund the provision of marshals on particular ranks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013021400004#C01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360837200,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation.

Reference was made to illegal activities, some of which have thankfully been eliminated.  What type of illegal activities was the delegation referring to?  The Taxi Drivers Alliance indicated to us that there could be upwards of 5,000 illegal taxi drivers operating nationally.  The TDA could not be more specific but it did give us that figure.  We were not able to establish the type of illegal activities.  Mr. McGuinness referred to them earlier.  What type of illegal activities are involved?  How do they impact on the legal industry?  <\/p><p>  One of the issues that arose during the discussion in the Seanad related to the regulator and I shall put the question in context.  Everything that we discussed with the TDA related to enforcement.  I am sure that the TTnH shares the same view with the TDA that there is a need for enforcement.  Unfortunately, only seven enforcement officers can be appointed by the regulator.<\/p><p>  Another question arose about the role of the Garda.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, shepherded the Bill through the Seanad and I compliment him for being on top of his brief.  He said that the conclusions articulated or reflected in the Bill arose out of the review group which includes the Garda.  He also said that the Garda are quite happy to see a transfer of powers.

I am a person who uses taxis a fair bit around Dublin and there is a lot of anecdotal evidence, and taxi drivers will say it, that it is getting hard to make a living here.  I am not sure that it is just one problem nationally.  There is one problem in the big cities and larger towns but there is a different problem in rural areas like the one that I represent.  For example, the TTnH suggested that PAYE workers should not be taxi drivers.  If PAYE workers were prevented from being taxi drivers then there would no taxis in rural areas.  I do not know, and I am seeking advice, but should we closely examine the taxi versus hackney concept?  Should there be a different set of rule for a taxi <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> hackney?

Most of the illegal activity happens within the rental sector.  Focus should be placed on that sector in order to stamp out illegal activity.  The Bill contains a recommendation for closer co-operation between Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the National Transport Authority which will probably go some way to resolve some of the issues.<\/p><p>  The portal was mentioned earlier.  If it is to be used properly then a renter of a taxi vehicle would not be allowed to take that vehicle on to the street until the NTA has confirmed that he or she has a PSV licence, for a start, and that he or she is a legitimate drive.  Better use of the technology that will enter the industry would also sort out some of the illegal activity.<\/p> <p>There should definitely be more enforcement.  We have always campaigned for the Garda to be the primary enforcement agency in the taxi sector.  There are only seven people for the whole country.  We have had many dealings with the enforcement team.  Much of the time its members are caught up in clerical work, so they do not spend a great deal of time out on the streets.  If the Garda traffic corps was the lead enforcement agency, it would lead to better enforcement.<\/p><p> The vehicle branding is a controversial issue.  There is no more information on the vehicle than there is on the roof sign.  Our proposals initially were that one's PSV licence number and one's taxi licence number should be combined.  That would lead to a slimmed-down version, and the Garda or enforcement agency would only have to check one number rather than two.  The issue for taxi drivers is that the vehicle is a private vehicle.  With regard to putting the branding on it, one of our members recently had his vehicle damaged when the licence installer installed the branding incorrectly.  He failed the SGS test, went back to the branding licence operator and when he took it off, the paint work was removed from the vehicle.  Taxi drivers are concerned that it will lead to a devaluation of their private property.  There are suggestions of how that can be fixed but I do not believe the country can afford it at present.  There could VRT or VAT reduction on taxi cars.<\/p><p> On the branding in general, we initially believed that it would probably be the SGS, where we are licensed, that would install the branding.  At present, in Dublin city there are 30 or 40 different people branding the cars, all to different standards.  It increases price competition but probably 20% to 30% of the drivers who have got their cars branded since branding was introduced were refused a licence when they went to the SGS, because the branding either had not been installed properly or was of insufficient quality.  It is a huge issue within the industry.  People are getting the branding done but are still being refused licences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013021400005#D01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360837800,"counter":299,"content":"<p>What is the SGS?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013021400006#E00200","speaker":"1019"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360837800,"counter":300,"content":"<p>The SGS issues the taxi licence.  It is a Swedish company, SGS Ireland.  There was huge concern within the industry about the nine year rule, but the change whereby people licensed before 1 January this year are allowed operate their cars for up to 14 years has removed a good deal of pressure.  However, there is an issue for people who have to change their vehicles.  There is no access to credit from the institutions.  The money that is given to the National Transport Authority probably could be used to give low-cost loans to taxi drivers.  The drivers' credit rating has probably been ruined over the last few years, as has happened to many people in the country, so they have no options.  The money that is received by the National Transport Authority from taxi drivers could probably be used to fund some of the vehicles that need to be changed.<\/p><p>  There is a big issue coming down the tracks with regard to wheelchair accessible vehicles.  Many of those vehicles were acquired ten to 15 years ago, when the separate wheelchair licences were introduced, and they are now reaching the end of their lives.  To put a new wheelchair accessible vehicle on the road costs &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000.  Labour Party policy was that the taxi fleet should be 100% wheelchair accessible by 2020.  In the last three years the percentage of wheelchair accessible vehicles went down from 8.6% to 4.3% of the fleet.  That will deteriorate further over the next year because many of those vehicles that entered the taxi fleet are coming to the end of their lives.  Originally, the wheelchair accessible taxis were to be exempt from the nine and 14 year rules.  It was to be the end of life of the vehicle.  However, that has been changed, so that will further deplete the fleet of wheelchair accessible vehicles.<\/p><p>  Regarding the oversupply in the industry, initially we had a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, in his office.  He indicated that the industry needed separate regulations for urban and rural areas.  That did not appear in the review body recommendations.  On the issue of PAYE workers - and we can only talk about the people we represent - our evidence is that at weekends the people who have a job and an income are destroying our members' livelihoods.  According to the last available figure, there were 6,500 PAYE workers with taxi licences.  If this issue was tackled in dealing with the overall problem within the industry perhaps people from rural areas might get into the industry, because it would be sustainable if firemen, council workers or whoever else were not operating taxis in rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013021400006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1360837800,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I wish to return to the issue of transferability.  It has been a major issue for the industry.  The taxi review group indicated that it would not happen, but there appears to have been a change of mind.  Will the witness indicate how he thinks that could work?  With regard to the taxi review group that drafted the document, the big disappointment from the taxi drivers' point of view was that the ordinary taxi driver was not represented on the group.  Others were represented on it, but the individual taxi driver did not seem to get much of a say.  The issue here is that the vetting procedure was not properly examined and recommendations were not given in that regard.  People are talking about it.  In Spain one must be a citizen to become a taxi driver.  In other countries, one must be resident for three to five years.  That should have been examined.  As one of my colleagues mentioned, we should be talking to the Garda as well as the Department about the vetting procedure.  It is a big issue for everybody.  Will the witness elaborate on the issue of transferability?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013021400006#E00400","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360837800,"counter":302,"content":"<p>The recommendation that the licence become non-transferable is seen as unfair within the industry.  Most of the people in the industry have paid for the licence.  It was always considered an asset, something one might invest in further.  However, now that the licence has become non-transferable, one will think \"It is not worth anything to me, so I will just plod along.\"  There will never be any extra value put into the investment and there will be no return for it.  The big issue with non-transferability is the family situation.  In rural areas the taxi is a family business.  If non-transferability goes ahead as proposed, the taxi will become defunct on the death of the licenceholder and the individual who works the taxi will have to start the process again, although at present there is a prohibition on the licensing of taxis.  I do not know if the Minister or the review body have got it right.  They indicated that the non-transferability of the licence is also related to the vetting procedures.<\/p> <p> We requested a Deputy to table a question on the non-transferability of the taxi licence and the Minister of State's response was that the underlying principle for this proposal is that a licence should determine a person's suitability to carry out a function and it should not have a monetary value or be traded on the open market.  It is not the taxi licence that determines ones suitability to drive a taxi, it is the PSV licence.  The PSV licence never had a monetary value nor could it be traded on the open market.  If that is the reason the legislation is being introduced, it will not achieve its stated objective.  The PSV licence in conjunction with the vetting procedures determine suitability to drive a taxi.  It is not a requirement to have a driver's licence nor a PSV licence to own a taxi.  One can accumulate multiple licences without owning a PSV licence.  The reply to the parliamentary question in the D&aacute;il refers particularly to the PSV licence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013021400006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360838400,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGuinness, chairman, and Mr. Brennan, secretary, of Tiom&aacute;na&iacute; Tacsa&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann.
