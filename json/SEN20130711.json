His appointment is in the tradition of George Mitchell's magnificent contributions to the peace process.  Will the Leader invite Mr. Haass to the Seanad in view of his decision to invite the Orange Order to the House.  The Seanad has a role to play in this regard.  For the information of those on the opposite side, one of Mr. Haass's books is entitled, <i>The Power to Persuade: How to be Effective in Any Unruly Organization<\/i>, which was published in 1995.  He is also the author of <i>The Reluctant Sheriff: The United States after the Cold War<\/i>.<\/p><p>  I also express regret about a cross-Border issue that has arisen, namely, the impasse concerning the proposed Narrow Water bridge, which Senator Terry Brennan has so strongly promoted.  The project progressed on the basis that it would cost &euro;17 million but when the tenders were opened this figure had increased to between &euro;26 million and &euro;40 million.  This very worthwhile project, which is supported by Danny Kennedy, MLA, Margaret Ritchie, MLA, the Northern Ireland Executive and Senator Brennan and his colleagues from County Louth, gives rise to wider questions.  The construction industry tells us there are bargains available as a result of the recession.  How did the cost of this project virtually double?  We must examine alternatives, such as the construction of a tolled bridge by a private sector company which would assume the risk.

In this context, I note that farmers become accustomed to weather and deal with it and, for example, they dealt with a fodder crisis this year.  However, one thing that really affects farmers is when they receive notice that they are to be inspected by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  They do not know whether they have everything in order and even if this is the case, they are extremely worried.  Members are debating two highly sensitive issues in this House over the coming days, namely, the Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution (Abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann) Bill 2013 and the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.  In the context of the latter, an issue has arisen in respect of the suicide laws in section 9.  While I do not suggest that people facing inspection have suicidal tendencies, it does cause worry because there is a loss involved and there has been an increase in penalties of 500% and over the past four years, &euro;4.7 million has been taken back in penalties from farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100004#C00300","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1373535600,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Does the Senator seek a debate on this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100004#C00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1373535600,"counter":66,"content":"<p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine should come into the House to clarify a matter because it is stated here-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100004#C00500","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1373535600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>The Minister can clarify this for the Senator when he comes in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100004#C00600","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1373535600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I want him to come into this House to clarify a statement made by some of the inspectors to the effect that they have been told to issue penalties.

I ask the Leader to facilitate, as early as possible in the next session of this House, while it still is in existence, a debate on the subject of rural Ireland and rural affairs.  I am concerned there appear to be attempts, both historically and at an accelerated rate on the part of the present Administration, to show prejudice to rural Ireland through the closure of Garda stations or small schools, two of which in my locality have been closed during the summer holidays, cutbacks in home helps and so on.  In particular, I believe a debate on all these issues would be justified.  Some effort should be made in order that in future, legislation should be rural-proofed to ensure that rural Ireland is not being deprived further.  My colleague, Senator O'Neill, mentioned the difficulties facing farmers and I note fishermen also are experiencing difficulties in fishing.  As so many restrictions have been placed on them, they no longer are in a position to fish.  Consequently, such a debate is absolutely necessary and I ask the Leader to give this subject priority during the next term.<\/p><p>  I suggested a matter on the Adjournment yesterday regarding the withdrawal of a bus service to one of the finest beaches in County Cork, namely, Garretstown, the Old Head of Kinsale and the village of Ballinspittle for no reason.

The Minister responsible should come to this House to explain the reason this service was withdrawn unilaterally without any discussion.  Given the weather we are having at present, this bus to Garretstown, one of the finest beaches in Cork, would be overflowing each day with visitors to the beach.  I will go further, although I am loath to be parochial, by proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister responsible, Deputy Varadkar, should come into this House today to give me an explanation for the valid point I have raised concerning another deprivation of rural Ireland of rights and obligations by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100004#C01000","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1373535600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Is the Senator proposing an amendment to the Order of Business?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100004#C01100","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1373535600,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I am proposing an amendment regarding the withdrawal of the bus service to Ballinspittle, Garretstown and the Old Head of Kinsale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100004#C01200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1373535600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I will not comment on what happened yesterday with regard to the debate on the Seanad, other than to state that a number of the contributions were excellent.

They were about retaining the presidential term at seven years, reducing the age for a presidential candidate from 35 to 21 and reducing the voting age from 18 to 16.  While this is pretty anodyne stuff, I did manage to get onto the programme a debate on the question of whether the people should have a real say in the nomination process for the presidency of Ireland.  A full debate was held and 94% of those attending agreed to this.  The response was absolutely overwhelming, despite strenuous efforts to guide affairs in a particular direction.  Some of the recommendations that have been accepted or voted through by 52%.  The Government will ignore a result of 94% and will only take those measures that suit it and those which were predicted.<\/p><p>  A statement was made on the other side, I believe in good faith, that the convention could not have considered this matter.  Yes, it could because we tried to table a motion asking the convention to write to the Taoiseach to do certain things that would permit this issue to be discussed.  However, we were inhibited from even writing a letter to the Taoiseach.  It was the most extraordinary example of management I have ever seen in my entire life.

The appointment of an independent charities regulator is important to the sector and for public confidence in it in terms of their ongoing generosity to charities.<\/p> <p>We must ensure that the State funding invested in this area is used for the purpose for which it is intended, namely, to help people in need.  I would welcome it if the Minister could attend the House to outline both the timeframe for establishing and the structures relating to this office in respect of which he has finally reached agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100005#D01500","speaker":"1143","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373536800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I welcome the increased scrutiny of the charity sector.  It is important, however, that in increasing the level of such scrutiny, we do not put additional bureaucratic hurdles in place.  That is the challenge the Minister for Justice and Equality is going to be obliged to meet.  This is because, after a time, bureaucracies seek to justify their own existence by imposing all kinds of extra strictures.<\/p><p>I echo Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's call for the Minister for Health should attend the House to clarify the appalling situation relating to discretionary medical cards being limited, in the case of cancer, to patients whose diagnosis is terminal.  I never use the word &quot;terminal&quot; and I care for more cancer patients than pretty much anyone else in the country.  I would not use the word &quot;terminal&quot; except in the case of someone who is literally on his or her deathbed and in that last, sad day or two of his or her journey through life.  There are many patients who are incurable.  The entire philosophy relating to cancer treatment is changing and that is why I am just stunned by the ignorance of the Department of Health in drawing up this new regulation.  I am concerned about patients with secondary or metastatic breast cancer.  Thankfully, most patients with breast cancer are cured following an operation and a course of radiotherapy but the one third who go on to develop secondary cancers are, with few exceptions, not curable.  They are, however, very treatable and they will live for years.  In the past, those with secondary breast cancer used to live three to six months but now the average patient lives for up to five years.  Sadly, however, most still succumb to the disease.  When I give somebody bad news about his or her condition, I say &quot;This is not curable but then neither is diabetes.  We treat it, you will live with it and we will do our best to keep you alive and well for as long as we can&quot;.  The position is similar with regard to rheumatoid arthritis and a host of other conditions.<\/p><p>I am very upset by what has been done in this instance.  I am of the view that it goes to the core of the problem in this regard.  I am not referring to it being the Minister's fault but rather to the incompetence that exists within the Department of Health.  When he comes before the House, I would like the Minister to clarify where stands the Bill introduced by Senators, van Turnhout, Daly and I in respect of smoking in cars with children.  We were promised that this legislation would be passed prior to last summer's recess and we were then informed that it would be enacted before January of this year.  However, there has been no progress in respect of it.<\/p><p>There is a need for a code of conduct within the precincts of this building.  That code should be based around not closing bars but rather on the notion that it is not acceptable to drink alcohol before entering either House.  In the same way that it became unacceptable to have martini-laden business lunches ten years ago or for drug representatives to bring wine to lunches with young doctors 30 years ago, it is not acceptable that Deputies and Senators should debate critical issues with a blood alcohol level of anything other than zero.  I am not advocating that we should close the bars or breathalyse anyone but a change of culture is certainly required.  I ask the Leader to contact the party Whips and the representatives of the Independent Senators and impress upon them that there is a real need - in the context of the decorum, good name and reputation of this House - for people to start complying with a code of practice such as that to which I refer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100006#E00200","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1373536800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I am beginning to believe that the good weather is having some adverse effects on a number of colleagues.

Most people in Donegal have brothers, sisters or cousins in New York, Washington or Boston who cannot return home as a result of their immigration status.  The T&aacute;naiste will today meet those Republican Members of the US Congress who perhaps need convincing in order that the relevant Bill approved by the Senate might complete its passage, thereby ensuring that legal status will be granted to Irish citizens.

I have referred to training in defibrillators recently.  How about swimming lessons?  Should they be considered as a possibility?  The number of young men who die from injuries related to drowning is horrific.  The proposal would not solve all the problems because a large number of children aged between one and four years die from drowning as well.  Clearly that problem would not be solved by teaching them how to swim in transition year.  However, there is a possibility that we could add to the transition year.  I call on the Leader to add that to the list because many transition year students have the time and the opportunity.

We are all shocked by the figures that emerged overnight about the number of drownings.  However, I take this opportunity to congratulate Irish Water Safety.  I come from a small town in the west.  We have an outdoor heated swimming pool.  My family has been heavily involved in Irish water safety for decades, going back 20 or 30 years.  The organisation carries out a comprehensive system of training throughout the country, including in my colleague's county, Cavan, and in other parts of the country.  The same is true nationally.  The organisation uses lakes that are safe for swimming.  Usually at this time of year it carries out two to three weeks of water safety classes to ensure people are able to swim.  Notwithstanding that, I fully support what Senator Quinn said but I took the view that I should put that much on the record.<\/p><p>I share the concerns in respect of the medical card situation.  Although it has been stated that the medical card will be withdrawn from those who are not terminally ill, I have had experience of people who have been terminally ill and who have been refused medical cards.  I have had to intervene because of red tape and bureaucracy.  The bureaucracy has required doctors to sign death warrants for patients rather than give an analysis or diagnosis of their condition.  Still, it has resisted sending out the card.  In one tragic case, by the time the bureaucracy got around to granting the medical card, the individual had passed away.  It is totally unacceptable that there is now a suggestion that we will take it away from people who, as Senator Crown pointed out, are diagnosed as being terminally ill. I support that call and it is important that the Minister for Health should come to the House to clarify it.<\/p><p>A report appeared in this morning's newspapers which, I believe, will cause shudders throughout the nation.  It stated that omega-3 supplements could lead to aggressive forms of prostate cancer.  This was a follow-up study to a 2011 study.

I am sure he will repeat those points in the health committee when it is reconvened and I would hope a detailed response will be given to the Senator at that meeting.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the question of sovereign debt.  In that regard I have the utmost confidence in the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in securing another significant deal in the coming months.  <\/p><p>The matter of discretionary medical cards for cancer patients, which has been reported in the newspapers, was raised by a number of Senators.  To withdraw discretionary medical cards would be a dreadful step, especially as over 2.1 million people, or 48% of the population, will have a medical card by the end of 2013.<\/p><p>Senator O'Keeffe called for an update on the Grid West project and a progress report on the broadband plan.  I will ask the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to come into the House after the recess to give us an update on that.<\/p><p>Senator Walsh raised job creation measures.  There is much more work to be done in that regard but people might consider that 2,000 jobs per month are being generated.  It is a success story, especially as we lost 250,000 jobs in the private sector in the three years prior to this Government taking office.  It has started.  It is beginning to turn, and let us hope that progress will continue into the future.<\/p><p>Senator Whelan welcomed the Minister for Justice and Equality's announcement of his intention to appoint an independent charities regulator, pointing out that on several occasions in this House Members sought the Minister to appoint such a charities regulator.  The House can take a bow in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Crown raised the question of discretionary medical cards but he also raised the conduct of individual Members' in the House.  The majority of Members conduct themselves in an exemplary manner in the House and the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach ensure that the decorum in this House is upheld at all times.<\/p><p>On the issue raised by Senator Quinn, we send our condolences to the families of the two people who died by drowning recently.  The question of water safety and the need for caution in that regard was raised by the Leas-Chathaoirleach only yesterday.  I note Senator Mooney's comments about Irish Water Safety and the excellent work it does throughout the length and breadth of the country in having swimming lessons and so on at this time of the year.  It is to be complimented in that regard.  <\/p><p>I note also Senator Quinn's point regarding transition year students.  Senator Quinn has come up with so many good suggestions we might get him to set the curriculum for transition year.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins called for a progress report on Leader funding.  We will ask the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to come into the House in that regard.  Regarding moneys not being used, the Minister has diverted funds from Leader areas that have not spent the money allocated to them to people who have passed projects, and he is to be complimented in that regard.  I will ask for an update from the Minister.<\/p><p>Senator Daly called for a debate on SI 325.  That could be raised on the Adjournment when the Minister can come into the House to respond.  The leader of the Opposition raised a question about the ambulance service yesterday in Senator Daly's absence, which was addressed.  Postal codes probably will help in regard to the problem of ambulances and other emergency services going to the wrong address.  I hope that will be one of the major benefits of the introduction of postal codes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100009#H00400","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1373538600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>They should not have introduced the ambulance service before the postal codes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100009#H00500","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1373538600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Senator Conway raised an important point about the rise in prank calls to the Irish Coast Guard and other emergency services.

In addressing these issues, we have to continue to meet and exceed all of our fiscal targets under the EU-IMF programme.  We must continue to push forward the reforms that are necessary for the country to recover its economic sovereignty.  The Government remains committed to balancing the books while introducing positive and prudent reforms to ensure scarce resources at our disposal are directed towards delivering well-managed and well-targeted public spending.<\/p><p>During this Government's short time in office, we have introduced a number of important budgetary reforms aimed at enhancing the openness and transparency of the budgetary process.  We have introduced the following: a modernised and reformed annual Estimates process; performance budgeting which builds performance related information into the heart of the budgetary documentation; and an enhanced role for evidence-based policymaking.<\/p><p>These reforms are in keeping with the broader Government commitment that performance information should feed into the decision-making process at all levels, and that active performance management should be a key feature of how projects are delivered and continually evaluated within the public service.  It goes to the heart of parliamentary oversight that Ministers and public service managers should be held accountable against clear targets set out in the budget.<\/p><p>The medium term expenditure framework was first introduced in the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014, published in December 2011 by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It established multi-annual ministerial gross expenditure ceilings on an administrative basis and now forms a key component of fiscal management.  The Bill will put these ceilings on a solid statutory footing.<\/p><p>Last November, the Minister for Finance introduced the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 which came into effect on 31 December 2012.  It imposes a duty on the Government to ensure compliance with the budgetary rule and the debt rule, which were introduced as part of wider EU fiscal reforms.  It also puts the role of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council onto a statutory basis.  We had a very good discussion in the House concerning the composition of the council at the time.<\/p><p>Aside from these domestic reforms, Ireland is committed to adhering to the wider fiscal reform measures that have been introduced across EU member states.  In this European context, this Bill operationalises the expenditure management component of the so-called six-pack of five directives and one regulation which introduced, among other things, an expenditure benchmark.  The purpose of the benchmark is to limit the growth in general government expenditure to a sustainable level.<\/p><p>I will now discuss the sections of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for Government expenditure limits for the following three years to be set down by the Minister for Finance each year, having consulted the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will then establish, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, ministerial expenditure ceilings.  Once the Government expenditure limits for each of the subsequent three years are agreed by Government, the Government will then agree upon an apportionment of these overall limits into ministerial expenditure ceilings on the basis of a proposal from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>In the Bill, &quot;Government expenditure&quot; is defined in practical, operational terms as the amount of expenditure that is voted by the D&aacute;il each year, along with the annual expenditure from the social insurance and national training funds.  The Bill provides that the Government and ministerial expenditure ceilings must be laid before the D&aacute;il as soon as may be after the decisions are made.  The subsequent annual Estimates of expenditure, setting out the detailed expenditure proposals for the coming year, must not exceed in aggregate the Government expenditure ceiling for that year.<\/p><p>Taken together, the effect of these various provisions is as follows.  The expenditure benchmark is the core expenditure rule with which the Government and the State are legally obliged to comply in the annual and multi-annual budgetary processes, by virtue of the direct effect of the regulation and the supremacy of EU law.  The Government expenditure ceiling will place a limit on the level of our annual voted expenditure. <\/p><p>While clearly it is different from the expenditure benchmark, it must be fully compatible and compliant with the benchmark, and this compliance will be demonstrated in the annual budgetary documentation.  The ministerial expenditure ceilings are an apportionment of the Government expenditure ceiling, and they may not in aggregate exceed the Government expenditure ceiling.  The annual Estimates of expenditure for a year may not legally exceed the Government expenditure limit for that year.<\/p><p>In the past, expenditure growth was, at times, allowed to outpace the economy's underlying ability to finance it.  This new approach radically changes the Estimates process and introduces a major reform by setting out clearly in advance the Government's medium-term budgetary plans and overall spending allocations, thereby allowing Departments to plan their budget structure in advance.<\/p><p>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform introduced a new section, section 2, on Committee Stage when the Bill was before the D&aacute;il.  This new section allows for the provision of information necessary for the proper and effective operation of ministerial expenditure ceilings.  The section proposes that public service bodies shall provide to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform such information as is necessary for the purposes of the proper and effective operation of ministerial expenditure ceilings.  This is a permissive section to allow public service bodies supply the necessary aggregate information to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to enable the Minister and Department to properly monitor and operate the expenditure ceilings set out in the Bill.  Personal information, as defined by the Data Protection Acts, would not form part of this.<\/p><p>At the current time, many Departments and offices gather information on details of their grant spend.  When the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform seeks information to enable a better estimate of expenditure to be made over the medium term, it has been the experience that the lack of a specific power to receive such information can occasionally cause delays in providing information due to a lack of clarity regarding the legal position.  That has been dealt with in section 2.<\/p><p>Section 3 is also a new section introduced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on Committee Stage when the Bill was debated in the D&aacute;il.  It amends the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 to assign to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's statutory responsibility for endorsing the macroeconomic forecast on which Ireland's budget and stability programme will be based.  The assignment of this endorsement role is a requirement of the two pack regulations, which are now EU wide.  The endorsement entails the council endorsing the macroeconomic forecasts upon which the stability programme and budget are based.  This means the council would endorse the macroeconomic forecast on which budgetary proposals are prepared, on which the Government then decides.  In the interests of independence, the council cannot be required to endorse.  Instead, it is required to fulfil the endorsement function and, should it find it appropriate to so decide, can announce it will endorse the forecasts.  Section 4 states the Short Title of the Bill  and provides for the commencement of the Act.<\/p><p>This Bill will provide in statute for the medium term expenditure framework.  This will underpin confidence, at home and overseas, about the soundness of the Government's overall budgetary plans.<\/p> <p>The framework will help to restore Ireland's public finances to a strong and sustainable position.  In addition, it will facilitate greater structural planning based on core Government priorities, and will reinforce the Government's commitment to return Ireland's economy to a position of growth while ensuring sustainability of the public finances.  This new framework is both sensible and practical while representing a responsible and necessary change in the approach to budgeting.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100014#N00600","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373541000,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I again welcome the Minister of State to the House, it is like he never left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100015#O00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1373541000,"counter":231,"content":"<p>It feels like it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100015#O00300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373541000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>He must have done something wrong in a previous life.<\/p><p>I and my party support the Bill.

In this House, and in the other House under the previous Government, I have called for a more open budgetary preparation process.  We should have a series of focused debates in preparation for a budget.  When a Government produces a budget, the Opposition produces an alternative budget and each side disagrees with what is in the other's budget.  Having such a series of debates without votes in the D&aacute;il and Seanad would allow the Houses seek alternatives to measures such as the property tax or the pensions levy.  I have asked the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, for a debate on how to better spend our resources on child benefit.<\/p><p>We can be helpful in this regard and I speak in a non-partisan manner.  We can put forward good ideas which the Minister of State, the Minister and the Department could take on board well in advance of the budget so we do not have four or five weeks of kite-flying prior to it.  In fairness this did not happen last year to the same degree as it did the previous year.  It would allow the Government to seek buy-in from the Opposition, and put it up to the Opposition to come up with real costed alternatives and take on board such suggestions.  Rather than having our normal run-of-the-mill economic debates, I call on the Minister of State to speak to his senior colleague about setting down a series of focused debates without votes where parties and Independent Members can bring forward alternatives or potential solutions in certain areas of expenditure in tax.<\/p><p>We all acknowledge there was in the past an urgent need for additional spending in key areas, and on capital spending in particular, much of which has been criticised from time to time.  An element of the criticism with which I agree is that public expenditure grew far too much between 2000 and 2007, but not all of this money was wasted.  All of us would agree that particularly in the public service and Civil Service, salaries needed to catch up.  I make no apology for the capital investment also, particularly after fixed-term and fixed-price contracts were introduced which meant we could not overspend.  I agree with the Minister of State the Bill will assist in this because we will be able to track it.  When we consider the expenditure between 2000 and 2007, if this mechanism had been in place alarm bells would have gone off that too much was being spent.<\/p><p>I caution against the Government's approach on simple and easy decisions to cut capital programmes in recent years.  The Government is over-compensating in this area so it will not have to reduce day-to-day expenditure.  IMF reports have stated the cuts in capital expenditure have been too severe.  Yesterday I listened to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, speak to Dublin Chamber of Commerce about seeking further investment in capital projects which would create the famous shovel-ready type projects and jobs.  I fully support such measures.  The Government will have a job to do this, but the real surgery needs to happen in current day-to-day expenditure because savings on capital expenditure are only made for one year.<\/p><p>As part of this all projects need a full and rigorous cost-benefit analysis.  I will draw the attention of the Minister of State to one particular project.  With regard to capital expenditure we must ensure proper cost-benefit analysis is done through local authorities before the green light is given.  We have had some disastrous examples, such as the Limerick main drainage scheme which was a &euro;12 million project that ran over budget and cost almost &euro;90 million.  The Committee of Public Accounts could not fully investigate it because local authorities are not answerable to it.  The Government should consider this.  The local government auditor cannot do the job as well as the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Comptroller and Auditor General should be allowed audit individual local authorities and not just the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>With regard to cost benefit analysis. I wish to discuss a project in the Government's capital programme, which is the greater Dublin drainage scheme.  A site has been selected, and I will not get into the nuts and bolts of it, but no cost benefit analysis has been done.  A 200 page prospectus was issued on the greater Dublin drainage scheme-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100015#O00400","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1373541000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>By the local authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100015#O00500","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373541000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>-----with only half a page on costs.

No Government, including this one, has had a proper handle on what local authorities spend their money on and how they support local economies.  Our local authorities have a big role to play in stimulating economic development and growth.  The Government and all future Governments should be far more hands-on in this regard.  Perhaps the Government is working on something in this regard and I ask the Minister of State to update me if this is the case.  I support the Bill, as does my party.

The Bill allows the Government to anchor its already operational multi-annual expenditure limits in national law.  This is a requirement under the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland.  Specifically, the Bill amends the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011, and in doing so provides for medium-term expenditure management in Ireland through expenditure ceilings.  We have climbed a mountain, in economic terms, in recent years.  When we came into government we inherited a broken economy.  We have worked hard to turn it around.  It has been a slow process but progress is being made.<\/p><p>We continue to meet or exceed all of our fiscal targets under the EU-IMF programme.  We must continue to push forward the reforms which are necessary for the country to recover its economic sovereignty.  While we are making significant progress, the Exchequer deficit so far this year stands at more than &euro;4 billion.  This is not a sustainable level of borrowing and the Government remains steadfast in its commitment to balance the books while introducing positive, sensible and prudent reforms.<\/p><p>I admire the savings made by the Minister of State with regard to procurement.<\/p> <p>Millions of euro have been saved there but one must ask why that was not done years ago.  <\/p><p>We need to be smarter in how we deliver public services and to treat every cent of taxpayers' money as if it was our last.  Hardworking taxpayers expect no less.  We need a system which is focused on equality and fairness, where waste is a thing of the past.  <\/p><p>This Government has been in office for more than two years and during this short time, we have introduced a number of important budgetary reforms aimed at enhancing the openness and transparency of the budgetary framework and improving expenditure management across Departments which had throughout the good times been allowed to lapse into disorder, although it was not just Governments.  I think every household in the country, in some form, got carried away with budgetary matters.  In short, we are making progress but we realise we have a long way to go to clean up the mess we found on entering Government.  We have completely modernised and reformed the annual Estimates process, built performance-related information into the heart of the budgetary documentation and brought evidence-based policymaking to the forefront of public service delivery.<\/p><p>This Bill when enacted will put the ceilings established in the medium term expenditure framework on a solid statutory footing through the amendment of section 17 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2012.  This Bill logically follows on the introduction of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 which gives full effect to the rules contained in the Treaty on Stability, Co\u00adordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union passed by the people, otherwise known as the fiscal stability treaty.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister of State on his efforts in regard to this Bill and offer my support on same, although I might have one or two queries.  I concur with much of what Senator Darragh O'Brien said in that during the Celtic tiger years, if there was an overspend in Departments, they just borrowed more.  If one's car broke down, one just bought a new one or if the woman of the house demanded decking, one just got it.  There was no budgetary process in households and it was the same in government.<\/p><p>Our colleague, Senator Sean Barrett, always looks for cost-benefit analyses and value for money reports, which is one of his strong points.  We get many value for money reports but a cost-benefit analysis is a completely different animal, and for a long time Senator Sean Barrett has been pushing that.  <\/p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien mentioned capital spending and much good work was done but where is the millennium clock?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100015#O00700","speaker":"1163","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373541600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I hope it is in a dump somewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100016#P00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1373541600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I think it is in the Liffey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100016#P00300","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1373541600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>It has been taken out of the Liffey but do not worry about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100016#P00400","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1373541600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>The floozie in the jacuzzi.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100016#P00500","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373541600,"counter":241,"content":"<p>What is not the time in the slime?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100016#P00600","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1373541600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>There was an old style of budgeting.

I also endorse pretty much everything the two previous speakers, Senator Darragh O'Brien and Senator Tom Sheahan, said.  The case study today is the Narrow Water Bridge.  I gather the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, is having a meeting about it at 1.30 p.m.  How did the cost double in such a short amount of time?  Is it a try-on by the construction industry?  How did it reach a situation where it looks like the estimate is double the original one?  It will be stalled until we find out what went wrong.  The only solution, of which I can think in response, is if we make it a toll bridge and the builder has an equity stake in building it at low cost and in generating a use for it.  There is a toll on the Dublin to Belfast road, which is not that far away.  It shows us a construction industry which tells us it has spare capacity and that it is a great time for stimulus but when we get involved in a project, an extra &euro;20 million is required for a bridge.  It illustrates what the Minister of State is trying to do here.<\/p><p>I pretty much endorse all the sections of the Bill and will support it.  The Minister of State said it is to limit the growth in general Government expenditure to a sustainable level.  Expenditure ceilings were mentioned, which are a good idea.  I support the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister of State in the proper and effective operation of ministerial expenditure ceilings.  The Minister of State referred also to the fiscal advisory council.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State will know, this is a widespread problem in most countries.  Debt to GDP ratios are far too high and lead to the kind of programmes we are now having to endorse.  For spending Departments, their goal is maximising the budget.  The Minister of State, along with the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure, must say that for them it is about the outputs, that maximising the budget is about inputs and that they want to know what they will get.  The cost-benefit analysis, to which Senator Tom Sheahan referred, is whether the benefits exceed the costs.<\/p><p>There has been a disequilibrium between the power of the spending Departments and the ones which have to raise the revenue, such as the Minister of State's Department, and measures such as this Bill redress that.  Why has it taken so long?  That is not a rebuke in that the old health boards had to be abolished because it was impossible to control their budgets as the banks, which we subsequently had to rescue, were always giving overdrafts, even though the Department of Finance could issue edicts about their limits.  Maybe we should have been more draconian.  If the budget was gone on 15 November, we should have said there is nothing left, although the Minister for Finance would probably have faced media pressure from the spending Departments and so on.<\/p><p>We have to get it across that, in terms of debt to GDP and taxes, we are maxed out and that the bulk of the adjustment the Minister has been making has been on the tax side in that public expenditure is still rising.  All the spending Departments will give one a million good reasons that should be but we need to set things up completely differently and this is a start.<\/p><p>In terms of the capital programme, all projects should be analysed and the cost-benefit analyses published about a year in advance to see what is going wrong.  One could see how the &euro;20 million for the Narrow Water Bridge became &euro;40 million.<\/p><p>There are problems with lobbying.  I refer to the IMF list and Vito Tanzi, the retiring director, who was mentioned previously.  In his very interesting book on this issue he asked why this is happening everywhere.  Bureaucracies cannot stop growing.  That is a huge pressure on expenditure.  The Government is going to deal with lobbying but lobbyists have huge power.  <\/p><p>I refer to the kind of misguided Keynesian model which the fiscal council has warned against.  The multiplier effect in an open economy like ours is pretty small.  I mention the tax termites who undermine the tax base but who are always looking for extra public expenditure and the kind of entitlement culture that the Government owes everybody everything no matter how well off people are.  <\/p><p>Why is there medical inflation?  Why can that sector not generate efficiencies like lots of other sectors?  To whom are income distribution programmes redistributing the incomes?  Can we have efficiencies measures for that?  Brookings in the United States has done a lot of work on that and I hope the Government's new economic service might link up with it to make sure that when we have income distribution programmes, they actually accomplish the goals we want and that we do not have programmes which are monopolised by the producers rather than the consumers and think cash is better than goods.  Who produces the goods and are they available at prices which represent value for money for the Government on behalf of the taxpayer?  <\/p><p>I would go for a central office of project evaluation called COPE and probably a new culture as well.  Professor Ronan Fanning gave a lecture at the Kenmare conference some years ago and referred to the austere era in the Department of Finance, where former Secretaries General Joseph Brennan and James McElligott wore overcoats and turned off the heat in case the budget ran over.<\/p> <p>Professor Colm McCarthy, in his inimitable way, has said bring back Brennan and McElligott so that we can live within budgets.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State mentioned the forecasting role for the fiscal council.  Is that the best role for a fiscal council?  Senator Tom Sheahan referred to a household.  A household cannot say this is the budget for next year but that it assumes it will have a certain amount of growth and, therefore, it will balance.  Why not get the money in first and then spend the surplus, if there is one?  It is said economic forecasting was invented to make weather forecasters feel a bit better.  It is not the most reliable part of our subject but resource allocation is, so I would have the fiscal council give more advice on resource allocation and efficiency.  If forecasting works out, it is a bonus.  As Professor John FitzGerald said yesterday, forecasting is difficult, especially when one is trying to forecast the future.  There have been some years when we have had to revise GDP estimates several years back, so trying to forecast the past has created problems as well.  However, those are small points.  If this Bill illustrates a new approach to old-fashioned household management in the public finances and not doing things which do not represent value for money, it will, as my colleagues said, be strongly supported.  <\/p><p>The banks caused us dreadful problems but there was an underlying public finance problem.  I recall the OECD report on Irish public finances in 2006 saying that our rate of public expenditure growth was far faster than Germany's, which is our benchmark country in the new arrangements we are in.  People said that social partnership may have been a little easy on public expenditure.  That era is gone and we live in a new one.  We must reverse the situation where there is high unemployment among people.  Some 300,000 people have emigrated.  A new cost effective public sector, as promoted by the Minister of State in this Bill, deserves and I think will get widespread support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100016#P01000","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373542200,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

I think everyone will agree with what this Bill is trying to achieve.  It will underpin confidence at home and overseas in the soundness of the Government's overall budgetary plans.  That is important from the point of view of domestic and foreign direct investment.  Unless there is confidence and the people who invest money in the country know the Government is managing it properly and in a planned way, these people will not invest in the economy.  <\/p><p>Structural planning is very important and Senator Darragh O'Brien mentioned his own area.  County Donegal also needs capital funding and structural funding which will provide local jobs.  One project, the Bonagee bypass of Letterkenny, has been agreed.  It is a 2 km stretch and a cost-benefit analysis was done in which it scored top marks, but the funding is not there.  The main road into Letterkenny from Derry and Strabane serves not only Letterkenny, but the whole of north Donegal.  Should an accident take place on the Port Bridge, it could be closed for 24 hours which would hinder economic and social activity in north Donegal and Letterkenny.  It will happen some day because it is one of the busiest roads in the country, not to mention the north west.  Letterkenny is now larger than Sligo town.  Local people would welcome any move to show we have a strategy to spend money correctly, having done a cost-benefit analysis.  <\/p><p>Over the years all Governments and not just the previous Government spent money coming up to by-elections or general elections.  I am blame all Governments for saying they would fund a road or a school but did not do so.  All parties in all Governments were guilty of that.<\/p><p>Our domestic economy and our public service have taken a major blow in the past few years and we must readjust.  If we did not get our house in order, Europe and the rest of the world would say that they could not help us anymore and that they gave us the facilities to borrow money but that they cannot keep baby-sitting Ireland until it starts to look after itself.  This is a step forward in that regard.  <\/p><p>As Deputy Sean Barrett said, perhaps 12 months in advance, counties Donegal, Cork or Mayo should know &euro;50 million, for example, will be spent on roadworks and that cost-benefit analyses is done on the work.  I will write to the Minister of State specifically about the Letterkenny bypass and perhaps he will speak to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, about it because there is no dispute about the importance of the bypass.  The route has been agreed and land has been bought.  I think it will cost &euro;15 million or maybe less, based on current construction costs.  <\/p><p>This Bill is very important in terms of overall confidence in the country but the public must see the country is coming back from the major adjustment it has been through and see a practical advantage.  Bypasses, sewerage schemes and so on benefit the public.  I commend the Bill to the House.  I hope the Minister of State will be in Donegal for the opening of the bypass in Letterkenny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100017#Q00400","speaker":"1144"},{"type":"speech","time":1373542200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I agree entirely with what Senator Harte said.

I would be delighted to hear some good news from the Minister of State.  <\/p><p>There must be a move away from the secrecy of the past.  In an age of transparency, this is the sort of thing we should examine much more closely.  We could have pie charts and bar charts, and we would be able to see exactly what type of Government expenditure is taking place.  If we are serious about keeping track of Government expenditure limits the citizen must know exactly where his or her tax money is going.<\/p><p>As we have seen recently, journalists are often better that politicians at performing this type of oversight.  We need more transparency to aid our democracy.  I cannot understand any opposition to this idea.  It sounds simple because it is.  It is possible to have such a system.  I see a glint in the eye of the Minister of State which suggests he will give me good news in regard to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100018#R00300","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1373542800,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, the Bill and the interesting suggestion made by Senator Quinn.  It is fair to say that this Bill, in tandem with other proposals on public expenditure and reform and planning and development matters, is part of the Government agenda of not simply trying to modernise our economic planning and development but to ensure taxpayers get value for money.<\/p><p>Traditionally, Irish Governments have been very good at spending money and have sometimes spent money they did not have.  From a Revenue perspective we have been quite good at collecting money.  The question of planning, development and using our resources most effectively have been a weak point.  It is fair to say that only one Government since the foundation of the State had a Department of economic planning and development, namely, Minister Martin O'Donoghue in the 1970s.  Not everything worked as planned on that occasion but the concept of long-term economic planning and development was a good idea.  Just because it failed, for various political reasons, on that occasion does not mean it is something which we should completely disregard. <\/p><p>Private citizens plan their finances and expenditure, as do households and businesses, and so should a nation.  That is why the Bill is so welcome.  It will put a greater onus on the Government to plan.  It will also, I hope, which is important in the broader debate about political change and reform, put a bigger political onus on all Deputies and Senators to talk about expenditure, planning, investment and how we spend taxpayers' money.<\/p><p>We have not yet truly moved away from the concept of the budget taking place in November or December, as has been the case for the past decade or so.  It previously took place in January.  There was a one or two-day debate on the budget which was the only detailed analysis one had on Government expenditure and financial proposals.  The changing budgetary structures, debates, the new laws we are putting in place and the Fiscal Responsibility Act create an obligation not just on Government.  Rather, there will be an obligation on the all sides of the Oireachtas to try to contribute to the solution.  The public is demanding of everybody, including the Government and Opposition, that in putting the country first we consider big ideas and problems, and take whatever measures are necessary.  In so far as this forces politicians to be more mature about the economic debate, it is very welcome.<\/p><p>A deep-rooted analysis of our spending and economic planning cannot but be of long-term benefits to the country.  That is why what Senator Quinn spoke about is a valuable addition to the debate.  It is to be hoped the Minister of State will have something positive to say in response. <\/p><p>The billions of euro spent in this country come from taxpayers as well as being borrowed.  At the core of spending we must have absolute value for money and spend in proper areas.  The Bill puts obligations on us in that regard, which is to be welcomed.<\/p><p>The Minister of State and his Government colleagues are at the latter stages of planning for the October budget.  The D&aacute;il and Seanad will go into recess shortly and will return in September.  The budget will be around the corner.  We are not getting sufficient time, as individual Members of the Oireachtas, to give a prebudget view on the expenditure side and make suggestions.  When the Houses return in September there will only be one month before the budget will be finalised.  <\/p><p>I ask for a debate on the choices facing the country.  The public expects all of us to be realistic about budgetary and fiscal matters.  The day of the Government making announcements on budget day and the Opposition opposing everything is pass&eacute;.  It is bad politics and we need to move on from it.<\/p><p>I look forward, if possible, to having a debate in September on the budgetary choices facing the Government and all of us.  I again thank the Minister of State for introducing the Bill.  It is very helpful and is part of the broader reform agenda.  It is good for the taxpayer and politics, and makes us all face up to our responsibilities in a more meaningful fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100018#R00400","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1373542800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will respond in two minutes.

There is a view questions whether the Fiscal Compact Treaty was a treaty for austerity into the future.  How much of a straitjacket is the Government going to find itself in regarding its priorities?  The Minister of State stated that it would facilitate greater structural planning based on core Government priorities.  Perhaps he might outline where those priorities will lie.  Will they lie in equality, public private partnerships or capital development?  It is important that this is spelled out because the people cannot take many more austerity measures and this seems to suggest that the Government is in some sort of straitjacket.  I know this is something that has been imposed on Europe, ironically by countries that breached deficit targets and benchmarks during the Celtic tiger years when we were generating budget surpluses.  It is a bit rich for those countries to be putting Ireland in a straitjacket at a time when, as the Minister of State knows more than anybody else, we could do with more money to expand our economy and create more jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100019#S00100","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1373543400,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I thank colleagues for their positive remarks concerning this legislation.  In its simplest terms, it puts general Government expenditure over a three-year period and Government ceilings on expenditure, Minister by Minister, Department by Department, on a statutory basis.  That is very useful because colleagues will know what they have to spend over a three-year period and the Government knows what it needs to spend over a three-year period.  It is important that this is set out in law.<\/p><p>In respect of the last point made by Senator Mooney, we must take responsibility for our problem.  Yes, there is an international component to it.  We cannot spend money we do not have and at the moment, we are spending money we do not have, which is not sustainable.  One thing that struck me during the course of the referendum on the fiscal compact treaty was that people are not stupid.  They understand economics and that one can only spend what one has and they want a more sustainable basis for public expenditure.  We as politicians across the political spectrum need to engage with the public on this issue.  This is about us taking responsibility for our problems and addressing them in the best way we can.  <\/p><p>The dilemma was well put by Jean-Claude Juncker, the long-standing Prime Minister of Luxembourg, who is in a bit of trouble at the moment.  I was at a Eurogroup meeting chaired by him two years ago.  I was standing in for the Minister for Finance.  The issue of VAT and tax fraud came up and a representative from one of the countries around the table said that we must always do the right thing - the moral thing - in terms of tax fraud.  Mr Juncker said that, of course, we must always do the right and moral thing but that sometimes elections get in the way.  It explained perfectly the cyclical political problem faced across Europe in terms of politicians spending money they do not have and another parliament then having to make up the deficit.  That is the problem we face.  <\/p><p>We must deal with the runaway train of public expenditure.  We have managed to do that.  I have consistently said that we were caught in a perfect storm.  In 2008, our tax base went from &euro;51 billion to &euro;37 billion over a period of months.  Within a year, our tax base collapsed at a time when huge numbers of people were coming on the live register and the number of medical cards virtually doubled.  At a time when taxes were coming down, expenditure was going up because of this existential crisis.  Obviously, we must get the deficit down.  It is worth pointing out that this Bill is effectively creating a statutory basis for making sure our public expenditure system is put on a long-term sustainable basis.  That is something that is very important. <\/p><p>It is important that we have a debate on long-term economic planning.  I understand this was touched on by Senators Bradford and Barrett.  Having these three-year ceilings in place, which is more medium than long-term, will help public discourse and will certainly help us to take a more prudent approach to public expenditure given the crisis the country has faced in recent years.  <\/p><p>I fully agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien about openness and transparency.  The Government has a very open view about debates in this and the other House about alternatives for the budgets.  It is also worth saying that we have put in place a new budgetary approach to annual budgets for committees and Departments whereby they are encouraged to have a discussion in advance of the debate and have some input into that and Ministers will take responsibility for replying to those proposals at committees.  I wish to be frank about this.  This is not just big bad Government tagging off committees.  We have seen lots of ways to spend money but very few ideas about bringing in money either through tax or cutting back.  We need to have an honest discourse about this at committees.  Rather than producing wish lists of things we need to spend money on, we need a frank engagement about the things we need to stop spending money on if we are really honest about this.  Yes, we want an open and transparent debate once it is honest for everyone and once Opposition parties and Independents are frank about what needs to be done rather than pretending that one can find &euro;500 million by better management without actually specifying what it is.  That is just hocus-pocus.  Nobody actually believes that.  <\/p><p>I do not mean to attack Sinn F&eacute;in but the problem it has every year is that it opposes all the cuts we must implement and in the following year's pre-budget submission, it does not compensate for those decisions it proposed so it takes our figures as the baseline figures despite the fact that it objected to all the cutbacks we have made.  It is a fundamental lie because if it is going to change all the things it is opposed to, it means the hole it must fill is twice as large as the one we must fill.  I know we will come back to this issue in September and October.  I apologise.  I do not mean to pick on Senator Reilly.  <\/p><p>We need openness and transparency and for all of Parliament to be involved in this.  Senators Barrett and Darragh O'Brien spoke about capital expenditure.  If I can be frank, we are building bog standard stuff now.  We are putting money in roads; social housing, for example, retrofit schemes; and primary health care centres.  The day of the dramatic big project is over.  I will follow up the point made about Narrow Water Bridge.  My understanding is that it is PEACE money.  I know some of the funds are coming from our Government and from the Northern Ireland Executive but most of the money is EU PEACE money.  I will find out about the &euro;20 million.  I did not know about that and I thank the Senator for bringing it to my attention.  <\/p><p>The point was made that we need cost-benefit analysis by my colleagues here and Senator Barrett.  Yes, we need rigorous cost-benefit analysis and local authorities should be doing the same.  I have a very simple arrangement in my own Department for the OPW.  We have a model for all applications from local authorities to spend public monies on minor grants.  One puts the information into the model and gets the benefit from it.  If one hits the target, one gets the money and if one does not hit it, one does not get the money.  The question of whether I have an involvement with it is irrelevant.  The local authorities know where they are coming from when it comes to applications to us.  There is an objective model, which we need to see across the system.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett made the point that if one does not have money, one should not be spending it.  A friend of mine has a business.  He told me that in December of every year, nobody travels because the budget is used up.  His point is that if the money is not there, it is not there.  We need to have the same attitude, particularly in those Departments that overspend every year.  A total of 80% of all Government expenditure is in three Departments so we must keep a very close eye on them, which is why the new Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is there to make sure we have that oversight.  I agree with the Senator that we must reduce the size of Government.  We have done it.  Three years ago, we had a public sector of 330,000.  Now, we have a public sector of 290,000 and within two years, we will have a public sector of 280,000.  We have taken 20% from the cost of running Government.  We have gone from &euro;20 billion to &euro;17.5 billion and it will be &euro;16.5 billion by the end of 2015.  I am a Minister in three Departments but I am paid once.  In previous Governments, there would be three Ministers of State so I am doing three jobs for the price of one, which is not bad.  <\/p><p>In response to Senator Barrett's comments about the fiscal council, it results from the Two Pack.  Under the Two Pack agreement signed off in May 2013 by the ECOFIN and the council, a country must have an outside body which endorses the model upon which its forecast for the future is made.  We thought it logical that the fiscal council, which is independent of Government and is in statutory form, would effectively give that endorsement, not so much to the Commission but to the Irish Government.  It will be producing a piece of work between now and the budget to determine whether our forecasts are prudent and right or wrong.  That is good because can undertake rigorous academic analysis on the basis of the profiling of the models that are made.<\/p> <p>I have good news for Senator Feargal Quinn.  The Senator thinks nobody listens to him but that is utterly wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100019#S00200","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373544000,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I would never think that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100020#T00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1373544000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>A very fine public servant in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who was listening to the Senator sent me a text to let the Senator know that Ireland Stat, a new website, was recently established on a pilot basis.

We have it on pilot form in four Departments which have given us all the information.  During the next 12 months all the other Departments will put that information there.  I agree with the Senator, there is no need to ask any parliamentary questions in future because all the information will be on the website.<\/p><p>  Following our discussion I will organise a special briefing for the Senator with officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the public sector reform unit to show what we have done in this area.

Ultimately, I agree with the Senator, it is getting down to what my hospital and local school are spending on A, B and C.  Why is that one hospital is so much better at doing hip replacements than another?  Why is it that the accident and emergency unit in Kilkenny is better than the accident and emergency unit in Donegal?  I am not sure if that is the case, I am just using it as an example.

There should have been a proper debate over a period with the public as to what type of Seanad, if any, they want to have in future.  <\/p><p>I subscribe to the notion that we have to reduce the burden on the Exchequer but there are many ways of doing so.  Abolishing one of the democratic institutions of the State is simply a political gimmick that is too easy to use when money is tight.  If that were the case, why did Governments from the 1930s to the 1980s not end the Seanad in those decades when there was less money available to the State?  It was because they did not want to attack democracy as a cost-saving exercise.  <\/p><p>Before the last general election, the leader of Fine Gael bemused many of his own party membership and members of the parliamentary party by announcing at a dinner that he was going to abolish Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

There will be other sections on which I can contribute, but many Senators referred to the issue on this section last night.  I have examined the costs.  The figure being used by the Attorney General was about &euro;13.2 million.  When it is just broken down to the cost of salaries and expenses, it comes to about &euro;9.2 million.  That figure was given to an Oireachtas committee, but it is not even &euro;9.2 million.  When one factors in the taxation that is paid by Members of the Seanad, at a conservative estimate, it is 30%.  Some 30% of &euro;9.2 million is about &euro;2.75 million, so the actual net cost to the Exchequer would only be about &euro;6.45 million.<\/p> <p>That is what the saving will be by eliminating a Chamber of democracy that scrutinises legislation, delays the enactment of legislation and gives the people an opportunity to contact us on certain issues.  If that is what is to be achieved, there are other and similar ways of going about saving &euro;6.45 million.  I will not go into them now because I will have an opportunity to do that when dealing with various sections.  After what happened in the other House last night, the public may wish to save &euro;6.54 million from that House rather than from this House.  Reducing the number of Deputies in the other House would easily save &euro;6.45 million because the cost of a Member of the other House is three or four times greater than the cost of a Member of this House.  We would like to ask the members of the public today, by way of a referendum, which House they would like to keep and which House they would like to abolish.  It would be interesting to see the result of an opinion poll or a referendum on that question.  If we want to base the argument down to the costs, and I listened to what the Minister said last night, let us examine the true costs, or give every Member of this House an accurate breakdown of the figures because the figure of &euro;20 million which is being talked up by the Taoiseach - &euro;100 million over five years - does not stack up according to the Attorney General's figures which were provided to an Oireachtas committee when only the salaries and expenses are taken into account.  <\/p><p>If the Irish people decide to abolish this House, so be it, but it is not something with which I would agree and I will be campaigning against that in the referendum.  However, irrespective of what happens to us, the staff associated with this House will be, and should be, redeployed in any event and I would subscribe to that.  The members of staff of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, be in any of the offices or otherwise linked to this House, are second to none.  They should be redeployed and they will be deployed, therefore, there will be no cost-saving in respect of staff.  When the Taoiseach talks about a cost-saving, he is misleading the public and he is also misleading us.  He should come into the House to explain himself on that issue before this Bill is passed, if it is to be passed.  He should not be forcing the Minister of State, for whom I have the greatest respect, to come in and justify his actions.  It is his actions and words that have been put out, but we need to have the opportunity to question that element of the argument during the course of this debate.<\/p><p>I hope the Taoiseach will oblige the Leader and membership of this House by coming in here to debate certain sections of legislation either on Committee Stage or on Report Stage next week.  He should come in here and justify his remarks because he and he alone is the man who is walking the plank in terms of getting rid of this House, a House which was established and supported by a man, for whom I have great respect, Michael Collins.  I will always have respect for what he did for the country, but the Taoiseach is showing disrespect for the work he did as a result of what he is trying to achieve here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100021#U00900","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373544900,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, back to very familiar surroundings.  It is a sad afternoon that we are here discussing this Bill.  I will be brief in my contribution on this section.  In essence, what we are being asked to do here is to vandalise our Constitution.  Shortly after coming to power in Germany, Hitler quickly set about tinkering with the constitution of that country and we all know what the end result of that was.  To tinker with a constitution and with democracy is dangerous.<\/p><p>Over the last eight hours or so very valuable contributions have been made, mainly from this side of the House, on how the Seanad came about and the historic figures who were Members of this very proud institution, and that was worthwhile.  If a contractor who is in the business of demolition is given a contract to demolish a building of any substantial size, the first thing it does is to take a look at how that building was constructed before setting about demolishing it.  The contributions that have been made during the past eight hours or so have been very valuable.<\/p><p>I am grateful to Senator Zappone for outlining in her contribution yesterday what the term &quot;abolish&quot; means.  It is worth considering a few of those words again.  It is to nullify, to destroy, to abrogate or to do away with.  That is in essence what we are being asked to do here in this legislation.  Many people have put forward the case for this question being discussed at the Constitutional Convention and Senator Norris put forward a very strong argument that this should happen, but unfortunately he did not get very far.  The reason he did not get very far is that the Government ensured that he could not and that he would not.  While issues, important in their own right but far less important than our Constitution and our democracy, were discussed including the reduction in the voting age, the reduction in the term of the Presidency among other things, this issue should have been the No. 1 item on the agenda of the Constitutional Convention before we got to the point of asking the people for their opinion.  <\/p><p>The effect of the abolition day, which this section is about, will have on our democracy is unthinkable.  This House, as others have pointed out, has put more than 500 amendments to legislation since January of this year.  If this House were not here, that legislation would now be law and by virtue of the fact that more than 500 amendment were made, it would be bad law.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill alluded to the fact that the abolition of this House will result in purported savings of between &euro;8 million and &euro;50 million, depending on whom one listens to or what one reads.  However, it has been admitted by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, that there will be no savings by abolishing this House because it will be replaced by a committee of experts who will examine the legislation and make any recommendations for amendments that they consider to be necessary.

Standford for 25 years, at a time when the majority political and religious opinion was still fairly monolithic.  He also defended the State from unfair political criticism from unionist co-religionists in Northern Ireland.  Historically, the Seanad will be seen to have played a significant role since in the opening up of Irish society.  <br \/><br \/>  While a great deal has changed since then, this State, unlike most of its smaller counterparts in Europe or further afield, is situated in a divided island, with, north of the Border, still very divided allegiances.

Democracy is like a three legged stool in that once one breaks off one of its legs it becomes unstable.  This is what will occur if the people opt to abolish the Seanad.  It is nothing short of reckless that the Taoiseach and the Government propose to ask the people by way of referendum to abolish the Seanad and not to offer the alternative of reform of the Seanad.  It is audacious and ludicrous that this issue was not even considered by the Constitutional Convention.  It is ludicrous that the convention will consider issues such as a reduction from 35 to 21 in the age at which a person may become President and a reduction to 16 years in the age at which people can vote, which I think is madness.  These issues were given indepth consideration by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, of which I was previously a chairman.  Much of the work undertaken by that committee is being replicated by the Constitutional Convention.  The All-Party Committee on the Constitution was the brainchild of former Taoiseach, John Bruton.  Its first chairman was former Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, who was a colleague of mine from south-west Cork.  However, he was chairman for only a short while because of general election in 1997.  The committee was also chaired by the late and great Brian Lenihan.<\/p><p>During its second tranche, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which was established by a former Fine Gael Taoiseach and Government, carried out a progress report on the viability of the Seanad.  The chairman of the committee at that time was, as I said earlier, former Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, an eminent member of the Fine Gael Party and perhaps one of the longest serving Members in the D&aacute;il.  It was unfortunate he did not progress further up the ranks of Fine Gael.  While I do not propose to read the full report, I would like to put a few extracts from it on the record.  Before I do so, it is worth noting some of the members of the committee included former Deputy Austin Curry, who was a presidential candidate, former Deputy S&iacute;le de Valera, a subsequent Minister of State, current Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, former Senator Ann Gallagher, the late Brian Lenihan, the current Minister of State for Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, former Deputy Derek McDowell, former Deputy Michael McDowell, Deputy Willie O'Dea, former Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and former Senator Michael Kennedy.  The committee undertook a great deal of research and consulted with a wide range of people and reports.  I will not bore the House with all of the submissions made.  However, it is important to reflect on a few of them.  As I said earlier, I propose to say what I have to say now and to not repeat it later on other sections.  I will probably not even contribute again.<\/p><p>One of the most significant submissions was from one of the greatest public servants of this country, T.K. Whitaker.

Murphy, Justin Keating, Tom Fitzgerald, a long-standing Member of this House who recently passed away, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, and a group of Fianna F&aacute;il Senators, among others.<\/p> <p>I do not wish to take away from the work done by Mary O'Rourke and others but this is probably the most significant report on the viability and future of the Seanad ever compiled.  I wish to read a few paragraphs into the record, the first of which states:<blockquote><br \/>The Committee is persuaded by the argument in Coakley\/Laver that the Seanad does make a useful contribution to the democratic life of the state.  The savings achieved if it were abolished - it costs about &pound;2.8 million [the figure which obtained at that time] per annum to run - could be illusory because some of the functions it carries out would need to be reallocated to other parts of the political system.  Furthermore, there would be a serious loss to the D&aacute;il because the disappearance of senators would make the task of manning the committee system extremely difficult.  The Committee also agrees with Coakley\/Laver that the Seanad is a resource that could be deployed to far greater effect if it were reformed.<\/blockquote>It is important that this point should be borne in mind.  The report also states:<blockquote>Seanad &Eacute;ireann should be a consultative body where people with knowledge, experience and judgment over the whole spectrum of public affairs should be available in a broadly non-partisan way to help the D&aacute;il to carry out its function more effectively and more efficiently.<\/blockquote>I take this opportunity to nail a particular lie which has been circulating during the debate on this matter and which is extremely unfair.  I listen to Pat Kenny's radio show quite frequently and I heard this lie repeated on it on a particular morning.  I refer to the kite that has been flown to the effect that it costs &euro;200 million to run the Seanad.  As we now know, that is completely incorrect.  The Library and Research Service of the Houses estimates the actual cost at just over &euro;8 million.  As the second progress report indicates, in 1997 the cost was estimated at &pound;2.8 million.  The lie which has been circulating must be nailed.  It does not cost &euro;200 million, &euro;50 million or &euro;30 million to run this House.  It is unfair that certain people are allowed to utter nonsense to the effect that it costs &euro;200 million to run the Seanad on Pat Kenny's programme on RTE Radio 1.  Such comments sow the seeds of disdain among members of the public who listen to Mr. Kenny's programme, particularly when they believe that it costs &euro;200 million per annum to run the House.  If the latter were true, it would mean that it would cost &euro;1 billion to run the Seanad during its five-year term.<\/p><p> The second progress report also states, &quot;The nomination, electoral and appointment procedures for senators should aim to produce gender balance in the Seanad&quot;.  The latter is an issue of major significance.  Such a balance is fairly accurately reflected in the House, particularly on the Government side.  It is also reflected among the Taoiseach's nominees.  I recall campaigning with the late, great Erskine Childers when he ran for the Presidency in 1973.  I am of the view that the Taoiseach stands as the bravest among those who have held his office in the period since 1973 in the context of the 11 individuals he nominated for membership of the Seanad.  The Taoiseach stood aside from the norm in that he did not divvy out positions to people as a reward for political loyalty.  He went beyond that, was very brave and appointed some excellent individuals to this Seanad.  I am very proud to work with those Senators.<\/p><p> The second progress report further states:<blockquote>The Committee believes that the legislative function of the D&aacute;il could be greatly improved if legislation were either:introduced in the Seanad, brought through its first three stages, sent to the D&aacute;il with the Seanad's observations and taken from a third stage in the D&aacute;il to final decisionorhaving been introduced in the D&aacute;il and taken to its third stage there, sent to the Seanad for its observations, returned to the D&aacute;il, and brought to decision there.The facility should remain with the government of expediting urgent legislation through the D&aacute;il with only formal reference to the Seanad.<\/blockquote>The importance of this is that since the report was published, many Ministers have taken the opportunity to introduce legislation in the Seanad.  Senator MacSharry indicated that the figure in this regard is as high as 34% to 35% on average.  This reflects some of the work I carried out in compiling a report for my party during the past 12 to 18 months.<\/p><p> The second progress report was produced by some very capable and learned men and in it they also state:<blockquote>The Committee believes that the Seanad could play a major role in ensuring that this important task is carried out.  Provision could be made to have MEPs take part in debates in the house, although without voting rights.  [In fairness, I fully endorse the moves the Leader has made in this regard].  Relevant EU commissioners and senior commission officials could be invited to the house for discussions on the EU's legislative programme and the Seanad should monitor EU regulations and directives and produce reports for the D&aacute;il on the impact of, and trends in, that legislation.  It seems to the Committee that, if the Seanad tackled such a task with imagination, energy and high critical power, it could convey to the people in clear realistic terms what the European dimension adds to our lives and offer sound advice on how the state should seek to shape EU policies.<\/blockquote>The House should have more of an input in this regard.  I understand that something of the order of 75% of all laws and regulations introduced in this country currently emanate from Europe.  Very little debate takes place in respect of EU directives, which are imposed without this or the Lower House really teasing out the benefits or otherwise of them.<\/p><p> The second progress report also comments on matters relating to statutory instruments, policy reports, etc.  In the context of policy reports it states, &quot;Such reports should be debated by the Seanad in such a way that the medium and long-term perspectives are developed and sustained which would provide the proper intellectual context for the critical appraisal by the D&aacute;il of the policies contained in Bills&quot;.  I am of the view that if this had been done by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments which held power from 1997 to 2011 - which I blame for the lack of action in this regard - particularly in the context of economic direction and policy, then the boom might not have developed in the way it did and might have been less expansive in nature.  In such circumstances, the subsequent crash might not have been quite so severe.<\/p><p> I have no wish to delay proceedings but I am of the view putting on record some of the conclusions to the second progress report would be a worthwhile exercise.  I will conclude my contribution thereafter.  I was in the Chair during some of the debate yesterday and I am conscious of not engaging in a filibuster.  It is important, however, to place on record the thinking of the then All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which probably also informed the work done by the committee chaired by Mary O'Rourke.  The committee to which I refer included among its members a number of former and current Ministers.  Former Taoisigh such as Garrett FitzGerald, John Bruton, Jack Lynch, Liam Cosgrave and others were of the view that the Seanad had an important role to play.  I regret that my party did not have the courage, the initiative or the imagination to implement Seanad reform.  However, that is no excuse for the current Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, a person for whom I have great respect, deciding in a moment of madness to abolish the Seanad.  The abolition of this House will weaken rather than enhance democracy.<\/p><p> The Government has a huge majority in the D&aacute;il at present.  I could almost see a dictatorship emerging by virtue of the fact that an inner politburo of three or four individuals within this Administration is dictating what happens.  Members of this House and backbenchers in the Lower House have become increasingly less important to the political system.<\/p> <p>Such Members are only fodder for the votes when necessary as happened last night and today when Members were whipped into line.  Croppy, my boy, must sit down and do what he is told.  He has no impact on policy but he is there to vote in order that the Government can drive through its policies and legislation.<\/p><p> I will put my conclusions on record.  It is important that this be done.  I am coming close to the end.  Page 92 reads: &quot;Each of the options outlined in the previous section has considerable merit, although introducing the more 'radical' changes will require, as we have seen, some fundamental political decisions.&quot;  However, these were not taken.  The report continues:<blockquote>Our review of the ways in which the powers and functions of a future Seanad might interact does, however, enable us to make some general points in conclusion.  In these we take into account both the comparative dimension and the history of Ireland's second chamber.<\/blockquote>In this regard, the current Taoiseach is forgetting the history of Ireland's second Chamber and the comparative dimensions and the significant work it has done, especially at this time.  I am not trying to put a halo around the head of Senator Maurice Cummins.  I rarely do that and he knows me well enough.  However, I acknowledge that he has given a meaningful role to the Seanad in his role as Leader.  Perhaps that was lacking in previous Seanaid.  As Members, we all went along in the slipstream.<\/p><p> Page 93 of the report reads:<blockquote>We feel that the case for the abolition of the Seanad has not been strongly enough made by its 'elite' critics, while there is clearly no groundswell of popular opinion in favour of abolishing the upper house. Given the contribution that the current Seanad does in fact make, even if much of this is outside its 'core' role as a legislative chamber, we can see little to be gained by abolishing it.<\/blockquote>That was a unanimous decision of the committee only a few years ago.  The second paragraph on that page reads:<blockquote>We also feel that the mainstream critique of the current Seanad carries considerable force.  Having so little real power, and operating so much in the shadow of the D&aacute;il and government, the Seanad is certainly not fulfilling the aspirations of the 1937 Constitution.  Those who defined a role for the Seanad in 1937 anticipated neither the powerful government control of the legislature brought about by a combination of standing orders and the whip system, nor the arcane system of nominating and electing senators put into place by subsequent legislation.  <i>This leads us to go along with the view that, while the Seanad should not be abolished it should indeed be reformed.<\/i><\/blockquote> Page 93, paragraph 3 reads:<blockquote>Once we are in the business of reforming what in theory is one of the most important political institutions in the state, it scarcely seems worth fiddling around at the edges of the matter. <i>Thus we do not feel that there is a case for tinkering with the existing arcane legislation that defines the composition of the current Seanad, but rather for rewriting this from scratch to define the composition of a Seanad that will best equip it to make a real contribution to Irish political life in the twenty-first century<\/i>.<\/blockquote>We are currently in the 21st century.  The important point is that all of what has been suggested - it was the nub of Senator Quinn's Bill as well - could be achieved by a legislative programme of reform rather than having a referendum at all.  That was well-captured in the Bill produced by Senators Quinn and Zappone.  Let us be honest.  There are 60 Members, including the Cathaoirleach.  If we are to be truthful, if we let our hearts speak rather than our heads and rather than be whipped into line, all 60 Members would in some way like to avoid the Armageddon or the famous guillotine.  We should find out what is happening.<\/p><p> There is a famous story which I will tell about the guillotine.  I will be brief.  It is somewhat humorous but it shows where we are at the minute.  The guillotine was introduced at the time of the revolution in France in 1796.  An Irishman, a Frenchman and an Englishman were facing the guillotine for some razzmatazz they had in Paris and they were all sentenced to die.  There was a rule at the time that if, for any reason, when the string was pulled and big blade of the guillotine came down, the head was not sliced off, then the convict was pardoned.  The Englishman was first up.  He said his prayers and his head was put down on the block.  The operator of the guillotine pulled the string.  For whatever reason, when the blade was two inches above his neck, it stopped and he was pardoned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100023#W01600","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373546700,"counter":313,"content":"<p>On a point of order, this is an amusing historical anecdote, but we have had eight hours of debate on section 1 on Committee Stage.

We have already pointed to some of the peculiar features of this body.  It is important, however, also to recall the history of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This body came into existence as part of a formal agreement in 1922 between the new Irish government and representatives of southern unionists (though, of course, it might well have come into existence in any case even without this pressure).  At least in its early years, it played an important representative role in reconciling this minority to life in independent Ireland. <i> There is therefore a case for looking carefully at the capacity of the Seanad to act as a voice for special groups that might otherwise be kept at a distance from Irish political life, such as representatives of the Irish abroad, of marginal groups within Irish society and, depending on certain very delicate constitutional and institutional matters that it would be dangerous to prejudge, of the two communities in Northern Ireland<\/i>.<\/blockquote>Unfortunately and regrettably  the principle set out in the report was never actually realised.

Some of the tribunals that cost hundreds of millions of euro with little or no results could very well have been dealt with in this Chamber.

The report also states:<blockquote>The net result could well be an Irish political system that was more transparent and accountable, which almost everyone (at least almost everyone outside the core executive) would regard as a good thing.

It seems to us that a radical shift to direct election is not merited unless the Seanad is also given enhanced powers in the legislative process.

He is right in saying it was an excellent report.  I will speak about the O'Rourke report in a moment because I have some knowledge of that but what was interesting in the Senator's observations was that the recommendations they made in respect of the new way in which the D&aacute;il and the Seanad should do business is exactly what the Government is proposing.  In the proposals we are making, in circumstances where there is not a Seanad, that will lead to significant checks and balances and to a new D&aacute;il system, which will require a four-day week and a change in the way the D&aacute;il does its business.  For instance, there will be a new heads of Bill Stage before the publication Stage, which is the First Stage.  We will have a Second Stage, a Committee Stage and a Report Stage as normally happens.  We will then have a pre-enactment Stage which was proposed by the former Deputy from Cork South-West, Jim O'Keeffe, in the report the Senator mentioned.  It is a carbon copy of what the Government wants to do.

It reminds me of <i>Animal Farm<\/i>, where, after a while, the pigs started standing up on their trotters and by the end of the book, they were indistinguishable from Farmer Jones, the oppressor of the animals.

The university seats are the only elements which have constituents outside the Republic of Ireland.  We have tens of thousands of people in England, Northern Ireland, the United States, Australia and elsewhere.  These Irish citizens are entitled under the Constitution to vote.

Why is he objecting, for example, to showing the Irish people what the Government is doing?  He said he is defending the Constitution.  How the hell can one defend the Constitution by tearing it into flitters?  Proposing 71 changes to it is not defending it but mutilating it.  I challenge the Government to put down on the ballot paper what those charges are.  It is afraid to do so.

If the people want to teach the elite group of politicians running this country into the ground a lesson, this is their one chance.  Abolishing the Seanad will not be noticed.  It will make no difference whatsoever.  It would make a difference if we have a chance of reforming it and if we get that chance, we will hold to it and force through reforms.

We sent him more material about our other project and sent some material to Brussels.  We are reforming the banking system so we have a lot in common even if we differ fundamentally on this issue.  I cannot understand why the Taoiseach wants to abolish this House.  As I said previously, I think it is quite a splendid House and I am inspired every day.  This morning, Senator Crown's comments about the difference between terminal and treatable cancer were wonderful.  Unlike the Taoiseach, I learn here every day.  The Taoiseach spent more time on a bicycle last weekend going around the Ring of Kerry than he has spent in the House in the entire past two years.  Maybe that is an appropriate metaphor.  If this Seanad is saved, the Fine Gael men in suits will say &quot;on your bicycle&quot; to the Taoiseach; he got plenty of training last weekend going around the Ring of Kerry.<\/p><p>  In his description of his last day in the Seanad in his biography, one of my predecessors, William Bedell Stanford, paints a picture of what awaits everyone of us if this legislation is passed.  He spoke of giving a brief valedictory speech on the last day of the session, receiving kind remarks from subsequent speakers and saying goodbye to friends and colleagues in Leinster House.  He wrote of how he cleared out his mahogany locker in the ante chamber like a departing schoolboy, gave a last glance at the pictures of Yeats and Emmet and the carved mantel fireplace of the Irish regiment, went out to what he described as the strange jetty-like granite platform that had replaced the massive statue of Queen Victoria that had been explained to him as a place for anchoring the ship of State in a storm, passed what he described as the always genial and obliging ushers at the gate and turned onto Kildare Street to be a don again and not a Member of Parliament.  <\/p><p>  Everybody I have met here has been absolutely splendid and I pay tribute to all of the staff, including those who stay until midnight.  This is a wonderful place.  I believe that if the Taoiseach came here more often, he might appreciate the work done.  However, he has chosen to stay away.  He promised that when Ireland no longer held the Presidency, he would come but he has not kept that promise either.  <\/p><p>  Seeing as the Taoiseach does not keep in touch, let us look at some recent events.  The Minister for Finance from that chair praised me for doing &quot;the heavy lifting&quot; on bank regulation, something on which the Minister of State and I have worked hard.  The Minister for Education and Skills praised Senator Clune and I because we found more errors in the mathematics papers than the State Examinations Commission had apologised for.  The Seanad intervened on behalf of 116,000 young people doing the leaving certificate examinations.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources was in the same chair last week and in agreement with me, asked for the first time in public why we reduced the rate of interest on little old ladies' savings in An Post simply to satisfy the banks.  I told him that my view was that solvent organisations like An Post should be able to pay savers more interest as a reward for being well run unlike the banks which, of course, caused so many of us so much bother over the years.  He said he agreed with me but lost out at the Cabinet.<\/p><p>  Here was a man willing to discuss ideas which I do not think surfaced anywhere before.  Presumably, they would have been in the newspapers if they bothered to cover the House.  I agreed with the Minister and this gave him the forum in which he could express his exasperation about being outvoted on that issue.  As the Minister of State knows, the irony was that the Irish Banking Federation said that it was in favour of fair competition, yet there was none between outfits which destroyed the country and ones which run their affairs properly.  The Minister for Health accepted an amendment here that the audit committee of the HSE should have people trained in auditing and accounting.  I think that makes a total of 530 amendments - Senator Quinn keeps the scoreboard on that.  <\/p><p>  That is the tradition that has always been there.  In his great book entitled <i>The Irish Free State and its Senate<\/i>, Donal O'Sullivan mentions Paddy Hogan, who was probably the best Minister for Agriculture we ever had.  This was 1923 during the very early days of the Seanad.  In one debate, he said that a Bill left the Seanad much improved, especially in section 24, which he considered a very important section.  He said the Seanad realised that the Bill did need improvement in that direction and that he considered it a big improvement.  He thanked the Seanad for the consideration they showed to him during the discussions.<\/p><p>  On 9 August 1923, W. T. Cosgrave  expressed his and his colleagues' deep appreciation for the co-operation and assistance of the second Chamber and the useful and constructive criticism given by it to the legislative proposals of the Ministry.  Right from the beginning until the past few days, we have been playing a constructive and valuable role in the running of this State.  I am proud of it.  It is galling that a man who never comes here thinks we do not do anything worthwhile but there we are.  To put it mildly, I am far less impressed by the Taoiseach's wonderment and enchantment at seeing second Chambers being abolished 50 or 60 years ago in Denmark, New Zealand and Sweden.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach spoke recently at the European Parliament.  That was democratised in 1979.  That is a development that deepened and widened our democracy just like this House does every day.  He was in Derry the weekend before last at the British-Irish Council summit.  In his company were the new representatives of the parliaments of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.  I hope the Minister of State talked to and learned some lessons from them.  Other people appreciate parliamentary democracy -  widening and deepening it.  <\/p><p>  Looking at the Taoiseach's original statement, we will leave out who caused the Celtic tiger to collapse.<\/p> <p>He is the only person who blames the Seanad for that.  He is unimpressed because this is an institution of 19th century British democracy.  Would he like to know the number of voters when the 19th century began in the UK and when it ended?  There were massive increases.  That parliamentary system reformed and he might to refer to the fact that many of the great reforms were introduced by Irish men: Edmund Burke, Henry Grattan, Charles Stewart Parnell, Isaac Butt and Daniel O'Connell.  In Ronan Fanning's new book on how the Irish parliamentary party developed into independence, he said, to use a phrase by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, they did the heavy lifting.  We were so good in the Westminster Parliament they wanted to shunt us out and, unfortunately, due to the intervention of the First World War and the failure to get the Orange community on side, it did not happen.  He paints the picture that they could not give the key quick enough to Michael Collins in Dublin Castle because our parliamentarians were so good at holding the balance of power and annoying both the Conservatives and the Liberals, that was what got Ireland its independence.  It is somewhat at variance with the more militaristic role, but I do not think the Taoiseach, on deeper reflection, should run down the 19th century parliamentary institutions on which this one is based.<\/p><p> We are both fans of Grattan's parliament and I enjoyed the Minister of State's reference to it.  The teaching about Henry Grattan, and it is in <i>Grattan: A Life<\/i>by R.B. McDowell, is that he was never a Minister.  He relied on his oratory.  It was so good that people outside called it Grattan's parliament.  He never held office.  That is what this House does.  It is the talking shop, the centre of ideas, as has been stated, and we do not seek power but we do seek to inject into it ideas, like Skeffington said, such as that one should not beat children.  What a pity we did not listen to him 50 years before we did-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100029#CC00600","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373549700,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100030#DD00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1373549700,"counter":428,"content":"<p>-----because the Minister of State has to raise the finance for all the dreadful things that happened.

I will say in a while the reason they should have been consulted.  We brought in here as a guest Professor George Huxley, an Englishman and a founder of the Northern Ireland civil rights movement who was recently awarded an honorary degree in Maynooth.  He has seen the old Northern Ireland and is trying to build the new one.   I think it was Andy Warhol who said every person deserves a quarter of an hour of fame.

We get them every day and the Minister of State is welcome to share in them all.  This brings me to the great J.M. Keynes who said:<blockquote><br \/>I am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas.  Not ... But, soon or late, it is ideas, not vested interests, which are dangerous for good or evil.<\/blockquote>This country surely needs ideas as we attempt to rebuild from the disasters of 2008.  That is why I came here.  We have worked every day on that and to be rebuked by one's own Taoiseach and to see what he is doing to his own party is a very strange experience indeed.  I think it really does require him to reassess the situation.  Article 2 of the Constitution, since the referendum of 10 April 1998, reads:<blockquote>It is the entitlement and birthright of every person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, to be part of the Irish Nation.  That is also the entitlement of all persons otherwise qualified in accordance with law to be citizens of Ireland.  Furthermore, the Irish nation cherishes its special affinity with people of Irish ancestry living abroad who share its cultural identity and heritage.<\/blockquote>I will return to this article in a moment.  Article 3.1 reads:<blockquote>It is the firm will of the Irish Nation, in harmony and friendship, to unite all the people who share the territory of the island of Ireland, in all the diversity of their identities and traditions, recognising that a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island.  Until then, the laws enacted by the Parliament established by this Constitution shall have the like area and extent of application as the laws enacted by the Parliament that existed immediately before the coming into operation of this Constitution.<\/blockquote>Our constituents in Northern Ireland had voting rights before 10 April 1998.  They are being denied them by this.  This was their say in the Oireachtas and they value it hugely.  I have spoken to both Unionists and Nationalists in Northern Ireland and they said there has been no consultation on that aspect.   The Northern Ireland Peace Agreement, Article 1, paragraphs (v) and (vi), reads:<blockquote>(v) affirm that whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland, the power of the sovereign government with jurisdiction there shall be exercised with rigorous impartiality on behalf of all the people in the diversity of their identities and traditions and shall be founded on the principles of full respect for, and equality of, civil, political, social and cultural rights, of freedom from discrimination for all citizens, and of parity of esteem and of just and equal treatment for the identity, ethos and aspirations of both communities;<br \/>(vi) recognise the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose, and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland.<\/blockquote>They are Irish citizens entitled to vote in Oireachtas elections and that right is being taken away.  The Agreement also reads:<blockquote>The participants also note that the two Governments have accordingly undertaken in the context of this comprehensive political agreement, to propose and support changes in, respectively, the Constitution of Ireland and in British legislation relating to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.<\/blockquote>The Government is amending the Constitution to undermine people who live in Northern Ireland, having given an undertaking that it would support their situation.  The rights they had before we signed the Good Friday Agreement on 10 April 1998 are being undermined by the way the Government is conducting itself.<\/p><p>  I want to find other sections in the Agreement that may be of interest.  Another section reads: &quot;the Irish Government, to develop consultation, co-operation and action within the island of Ireland - including through implementation on an all-island and cross-border basis - on matters of mutual interest within the competence of the Administrations, North and South&quot;.  There has been no such consultation on this issue, which is a serious one for people who want to carry Irish passports and want to vote in Seanad elections.  The Agreement, on page 14, reads: &quot;Other arrangements for the agreed co-operation will also commence contemporaneously with the transfer of powers to the Assembly.&quot;  We should have been co-operating with the Assembly on this.  It goes on to read:<blockquote>The implementation bodies will have a clear operational remit.  They will implement on an all-island and cross-border basis policies agreed in the Council.<\/blockquote>We always agreed before now that residents of Northern Ireland could vote in this election.  This Bill changes that.  The Agreement also reads: &quot;Any further development of these arrangements to be by agreement in the Council and with the specific endorsement of the Northern Ireland Assembly [this Bill has been nowhere near the Northern Ireland Assembly] and Oireachtas [while it is here], subject to the extent of the competences and responsibility of the two Administrations.&quot;<\/p> <p>They had votes and we took their votes.  We brought them into the NUI in Merrion Square and down to Trinity.  We counted them and they elected people here, but that is now being undermined.<\/p><p> On page 14 of the document, it states<blockquote>It is understood that the North\/South Ministerial Council and the Northern Ireland Assembly are mutually inter-dependent, and that one cannot successfully function without the other.<\/blockquote>I do not have a legal training but I am reading this into the record, as Senator Byrne is also.  He believes that we have valid points.  It is a case of having leaped before we looked.  <\/p><p> On page 29, it states<blockquote>If difficulties arise which require remedial action across the range of institutions, or otherwise require amendment of the British-Irish Agreement or relevant legislation, the process of review will fall to the two Governments in consultation with the parties in the Assembly.  Each Government will be responsible for action in its own jurisdiction.<\/blockquote>I understand, therefore, one has to get the agreement of the Northern Ireland Assembly to withdraw those voting rights.  One might get it from people who are as partitionist as the Taoiseach.  They might be very pleased.  Those of us who support closer links between the two communities, however - as most of my Northern voters do - will be extremely disappointed.<\/p><p> Annex 2 states:<blockquote>The British and Irish Governments declare that it is their joint understanding that the term &quot;the people of Northern Ireland&quot; in paragraph (vi) of Article 1 of this Agreement means, for the purposes of giving effect to this provision, all persons born in Northern Ireland and having, at the time of their birth, at least one parent who is a British citizen, an Irish citizen or is otherwise entitled to reside in Northern Ireland without any restriction on their period of residence.<\/blockquote>I have raised this point before.  Even from the point of view of good neighbourliness, we should now take up these discussions with the people concerned.  If the Government side wins - and I do not believe the Minister of State is neutral - they are being deprived of voting rights they currently have and which are protected by this agreement of 10 April 1998, and the two new Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  They will be deprived of those rights in a referendum in which they will have no vote.  That should quickly bring the Government to its senses.  It should realise the harm it is doing not just in my constituency but also in the other constituencies.<\/p><p> On this morning's Order of Business, we welcomed the appointment of Richard Haas as the US peace envoy to Northern Ireland.  We need more and better links with Northern Ireland.  We also need to show some respect for people who are Irish citizens there and who vote in the NUI and TCD Seanad constituencies.  <\/p><p> I am proud to speak against the abolition day because I do not want it to happen.  Abolition day will be a tragedy for this country.  It has not been properly thought out and will do serious damage to the constitutional rights of people living in this State.  In addition, it will undermine the constitutional rights of people living in Northern Ireland who thought their rights were protected by the agreement of 10 April 1998.<\/p><p> The Minister of State should seriously reconsider the matter.

If the opinion polls are correct, there will be a new Taoiseach and a different government, and they should be entitled to convene a new Seanad.  The Seanad should not be abolished at midnight before the next D&aacute;il sits and a new government is appointed.  Abolition day should therefore be changed to allow voters to sweep out the abolitionists and bring reformers back into office.  We should not be bound by the proposed abolition date.<\/p><p>I was very angry to read the text of this Bill but now I am just sad that anybody would waste political capital, Government time and parliamentary time on this matter.  With so much unemployment and emigration, we have enough to do without wasting our time abolishing the Upper House, along with all the attendant evils that will bring. <\/p><p>I appreciate what the Minister of State said about the costs involved.  According to the numbers circulated to us on 4 July, a Deputy earns &euro;87,258 per annum, while a Senator earns &euro;65,000.  That is 134 indexed at 100.  The Bill aims to abolish all Senators with an index of 100, and 4.8% of the people who cost 34% more.  Even as a cost-saving exercise, with those numbers, it becomes less and less impressive. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100031#EE00500","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1373550300,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I have not made that argument.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100031#EE00600","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373550300,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I know that is not the main point.

I thank the Minister of State for his intervention which proves what I said earlier about him being a worthy opponent.  I do not necessarily want to re-argue that point because Senator Norris might cough or the Minister of State might resist that statement.<\/p><p>The Minister of State argued that the Government had promised to put the choice before the people.  There is nothing that I should be opposing there, I suppose, because it is to let the people decide.  However, in presenting this Bill, the Minister of State is putting out two messages.  One is to let the people decide, but the other is to abolish the Seanad.  That is the second message.  <\/p><p>The Title of the legislation is the Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution (Abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann) Bill.  I have discussed the Title with colleagues and we noted that it could have referred to the future of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, instead of which it refers to the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is therefore sending out two messages: &quot;Let the people decide&quot;, but also, &quot;We want you to abolish the Seanad&quot;.  That is what I wish to oppose.  That is the first point on which I want to take issue with the Minister of State following his very worthy intervention.  I have three other points. <\/p><p>The second point concerns the Minister of State's argument that much of what we have been saying here should be left for the campaign trail, because we are saying the Seanad should be reformed.  He says we should not be debating reform because we cannot hold a preferendum; that would be unconstitutional due to Article 47.  Many of us have our blue book, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, with us today.  I read Article 47 a couple of times, which referred me to Article 46.  I have read both articles.  The Minister of State is arguing that we cannot put three options to the people - that is, reform, retention or abolition - because that would be unconstitutional.  <\/p><p>However, my understanding, particularly of two amendments that have been tabled to this Bill, is that they do not call for a preferendum.  They are simply amendments to add additional text to the referendum that will be put to the people. <\/p> <p>Both of those amendments have been overruled.  The first amendment - amendment No. 1 - which I tabled with my colleague, Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, effectively argues that if the constitutional amendment falls and the people vote not to abolish the Seanad, then the Taoiseach is obliged to enact reform.  That is simply adding text to the amendment to the Constitution.  It is not putting a preferendum to the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100031#EE00800","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373550900,"counter":440,"content":"<p>We are on section 1 and that relates to section 3.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100032#FF00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1373550900,"counter":441,"content":"<p>We may not get there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100032#FF00300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373550900,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I am responding to the Minister of State&rsquo;s intervention.

I refer to amendment No. 12 which I tabled with Senators Quinn, Crown and Barrett, which effectively adds text to the amendment to the Constitution that is being put to the people.  It states that if the Oireachtas enacts Seanad reform prior to this term being over then there should be no abolition.  That is effectively the gist of the amendment.  It is based on reform and a number of criteria.  What I am saying to the Minister of State is that I do not think those amendments should have been overruled.  They are not about a preferendum; they are simply adding text to the amendment that will be put to the people.  I am responding to the Minister of State&rsquo;s argument that we should not be talking about reform.<\/p><p>That was my second point.  The two other points I wished to make were in response to the Minister of State&rsquo;s intervention about costs.  I accept we have talked a lot about costs.  The Taoiseach is the one who first raised the issue of costs, which is why we then rebutted those arguments which, in effect, are now dead in the water.<\/p><p>The last point I wish to make about what the Minister of State put forward is the different types of D&aacute;il reform that will be introduced subsequent to the people abolishing the Seanad.  He listed in his intervention, as he outlined on previous occasions and in press releases, that the reform includes a pre-legislative phase, a legislative phase and a post-legislative phase and that the Minister will become involved in the latter.  It is not just about the time for scrutiny.  It is about who is involved in it.  In the plan, as outlined, the same people are doing the scrutiny, as distinct from our plan where different people with different expertise would carry out the scrutiny.<\/p><p>One could ask whether we need D&aacute;il reform.  I am sure we are all aware of the tweet and the video with the tweet that is going around the country currently about what happened in the D&aacute;il last evening when a male Deputy pulled a female Deputy onto his lap.  The comment with the video is largely about whether D&aacute;il reform is necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100032#FF01500","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1373550900,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Not at 5 a.m. in the morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100032#FF01600","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373550900,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Three speakers are offering.

I wish to follow through on something that was said previously.  My point is exactly the same as Senator Zappone made.  My concern is that the same people will be doing the scrutiny if we only have one House.  I have a deep concern about the issue.  I will not spend time on it but the Minister of State might have heard me speak previously about two particular instances I remember in this House.  The reason I am influenced by them is that I counted 540 amendments to legislation that had passed through the D&aacute;il and came into this House.  Some of the changes were not of substance but others were quite substantial.  They related to issues that had been missed in the D&aacute;il.  The example I remember best is from some years ago and it occurred when the D&aacute;il had gone into recess for the summer.  We were discussing the ban on opinion polls on Committee Stage of the electoral (amendment) Bill.  The Government had introduced a ban on opinion polls being issued by newspapers for three weeks before an election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100032#FF01800","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1373550900,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I remember that one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100032#FF01900","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373550900,"counter":458,"content":"<p>The Bill had gone through the D&aacute;il and it had not been noticed that anything was wrong with it.  The D&aacute;il had already gone into recess and the point was originally picked up by the then Senator, now Deputy Shane Ross, that polls could be released at midnight before the election.  That would have meant there were three weeks without opinion polls and then at midnight before an election television stations, radio stations and newspapers could announce there had a been a big swing, for example, from one party to another.  At approximately 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. at night the Leader of the House telephoned the Minister who told him to drop the Bill.  It had gone through the D&aacute;il but it was too late for it to go back to be changed and the Bill did not reappear.<\/p><p>I remember well that a second Bill came through the House, the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Bill, that had gone through the D&aacute;il.  It was a very worthy Bill enabling people to come from North America to study peace in Northern Ireland.  The Bill stated that they should be allowed to spend money &quot;in this State&quot;.  I pointed out to the Minister at the time that surely if they were going to study that they must go across the Border.  He said that was not possible but then he changed his mind and accepted the amendment.  The Bill had then to go back to the D&aacute;il to be changed.  They are two minor instances in the past but they happened in the Seanad after the D&aacute;il had passed the Bills.  It seems to me that the Government has pledged to reform politics but the abolition of the Seanad is most definitely not reform.  If we take a day on which the Seanad will be abolished we will not have a balance and a second opinion on legislation.<\/p><p>I will give some examples which relate to me because they are matters with which I am familiar.  In this House in recent years I have been able to introduce a ban on passports for sale.  The Minister accepted the Bill but decided to introduce his own Bill.  At least I achieved my aim.  The D&aacute;il had never introduced such a measure.  I introduced a Bill on presumed consent for organ donation, which has now become law in Wales.  I gather the Government is now considering the matter but it is taking some years.  The initiative did not come from the D&aacute;il; it came from the Seanad.  Last year, I introduced a Bill on work permits. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, said he understood what I was doing.  He accepted the Bill on Second Stage but said he would incorporate it into his work permits legislation later on this year.  I also introduced a Bill on defibrillators, which the Minister accepted.  I hope it will become law soon.<\/p><p>None of those Bills was initiated in the D&aacute;il.  They came from this House and one person in this House.  I also introduced a Bill on construction contracts, which as the Minister of State is aware, we hope will become law next week.  However, I am not sure that is the case any longer with what is happening in the D&aacute;il but I hope the Minister of State will convince me that the Bill will become law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100032#FF02000","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1373550900,"counter":459,"content":"<p>We will get it through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100032#FF02100","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373550900,"counter":460,"content":"<p>It is a worthy Bill and the Minister of State has put his heart and soul into it.

That is the point Senator Zappone made.  In terms of a double scrutiny, the same people will be doing the scrutiny.  We need somebody to give a second opinion and for checks and balances.

I hope that in a Chamber where we encourage debate there would not be a restriction on Members' interventions.  We have a great opportunity between now and referendum day to reflect more fully.  Ten minutes to make Second Stage contributions was not sufficient and I have not been able to engage in the Committee Stage debate but I want to comment briefly on what I have heard about the alternative opinion.  The Minister and I, and everybody knows, that there never has been such doubt, concern and lack of faith in politics and in decision-making, and we should not pretend otherwise.  As each day passes more people are growing concerned about handing over major decisions to a small selected group of people.  Many years ago Government and politics was very different.  Collective Cabinet responsibility meant something, and every member sitting around the Cabinet table seemed to have an equal voice.  Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann actually made decisions, and the democratic process was open and transparent.  In the past five to ten years we have a new system of politics where a small number of Cabinet Ministers, with their advisers, almost dominate the Cabinet agenda.  They meet in advance of Cabinet and produce decisions that are then rubber-stamped.  We are arriving at a different centralised form of democracy.  Debate, dialogue and discussion are being squashed and that is beginning to seriously concern the public.  I could refer to the Cabinet sub-committee, which apparently does most of the decision-making.  I am not sure about the constitutionality of that in terms of the concept of collective Cabinet responsibility but we heard reports of decisions going to the broader Cabinet having already been decided by the Cabinet sub-committee.  I am not sure what that means for the constitutional provision of collective Cabinet responsibility.<\/p><p>Between now and referendum day we must decide the question of checks and balances, and alternative proposals.  Senator Quinn, Senator Zappone and many others Senators have spoken at greater length and depth than I, but we must not fool ourselves that there is an alternative to having two Houses.  The concept of a mini-Seanad lasted about 30 seconds until everybody recognised it was so ridiculous, undemocratic and frighteningly politically patronising that the idea would have to be dropped.  We are hearing about experts and pre-legislative committees and so on.  It is a question of whether elected politicians are to be allowed to engage in debate and make decisions as we are supposed to do for all our faults - for all our strengths and weaknesses, that is  what we were elected to do - or the power is to be handed over to a super-committee of so-called wiser people.  That is something on which we have to deeply reflect.<\/p><p>The purpose of a second House or Chamber is to offer a second opinion, to improve, enhance and reflect on debate.  That must be at the core of the referendum proposal.  Do we hand over the power and all decision-making to a D&aacute;il of 166 Members, 158 or whatever the number will be?  However, it is the handing over of power to not only the Cabinet but to a small group of people within government that concerns me.  I have got a satisfactory answer to a question I have asked previously, namely, is there any example not only in Europe but worldwide of where less democracy is better and that less intervention and less debating produces better results?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100033#GG00600","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1373551500,"counter":467,"content":"<p>There are examples of many small countries moving from having two parliaments to one parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100033#GG00900","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373551500,"counter":468,"content":"<p>There are examples and let us consider those countries.

I  agree with some of the points he made, but his and the Government's biggest failure is that they have not constructed a credible argument for not putting the options of reform to the people.  They still have not put forward to me a credible argument as to why we cannot have that.<\/p><p>I was also going to raise the issue of the possibility of a preferendum, but the Minister of State has dealt with that.  He referred to the various Articles in the Constitution which he said prevents an preferendum from being held, but that is precisely why we should not rush into making decisions to abolish something without properly thinking things through.  What the Minister of State is essentially saying is that we would like to put the option of reform and for people to have that option but it cannot be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100033#GG01900","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1373551500,"counter":478,"content":"<p>No. I am not saying that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100033#GG02000","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373551500,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I am not saying that the Minister of State would argue that but some people would argue that line.<\/p> <p>I am saying some people argue that line.  There might be people within the Fine Gael Party or in government who take the view that it would be great if reform could be put to the people, but, really, they have no choice but to put a simple proposition, that is, to keep what is there or get rid of it, and they cannot do anything else.  That is where the Government has failed but there is a way around it.  If the Government put reform to the people, and only reform, then the choice of abolition would be gone.  That is the problem the Government is left with.  This is why a mechanism such as the Constitutional Convention would have been the perfect opportunity to tease out all of these issues properly and fairly.<\/p><p>The Minister of State referred to the Constitutional Convention.  I sit on the convention and I value it.  I believe it does great work.  Those on the secretariat have done fantastic work to ensure that every issue set down by the Oireachtas under the remit of the convention has been given absolute and proper scrutiny.  They have done a fantastic job.  On every issue we have been given presentations from experts and political scientists, including on gay marriage.  We have heard from people for and against.  The participants of the Constitutional Convention were given all the information and could then make an informed decision.  They made informed decisions on reducing the voting age to 17 years, on changes, minor though they are, to the electoral system, on same-sex marriage and on other important issues as well.<\/p><p>The point is that we did it right.  We set up the Constitutional Convention.  We asked people for their views.  We allowed the experts to come in.  We discussed properly and forensically all the issues that would be involved in those discussions.  It was careful.  Then, we ended up making sure-footed decisions.  We know what we are doing and it is done on the basis of proper analysis.  That is how we should have dealt with the issue of the Seanad.  That is the point we are making.  The Government's greatest failure is that it has not done that.  By not doing that it has ended up rushing us into a situation whereby we cannot have a &quot;preferendum&quot; and we can only put one option to the people.  The Minister of State referred to choice.  That is not choice and it does not represent giving people a choice.  The Government is only giving people the option of abolition.  It is not giving people a real choice.<\/p><p>My genuine view is that the mood of the people at the moment is for radical reform of the House.  Many people, including myself, believe it is elitist, undemocratic and unfit for purpose, but it is not the cause of all of our problems.  People agree that reform of the D&aacute;il is as important, if not more important, but they agree with reform.  If an opinion poll was carried out asking people what they would go for if they were given the option of reform or abolition, I believe the Minister of State would be surprised that people would go for the option of reform and proper checks and balances in our system.  Anyway, the people are not being given that choice.  That is the great failure.<\/p><p>The Government is not being neutral.  Senator Zappone make the same argument.  The Minister of State made the point that the people will decide.  I have constructed an argument outlining how the people will not be given the full opportunity to decide.  They are been given one option, that is, to abolish what many see as a rotten borough, something that is undemocratic and elitist, but they are not being given the option of reform.  The Government is not being neutral because it will campaign and canvas for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote and campaign for abolition.  That is not being neutral and that is not neutrality.  My party could end up in the same position.  The Sinn F&eacute;in position is to abolish the Seanad in its current form.  If that is the only proposition put to the people, then we may argue for people to vote &quot;Yes&quot; in the referendum, but the Ard Chomhairle will made that decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100033#GG02100","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373552100,"counter":481,"content":"<p>The army council will decide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100034#HH00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1373552100,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Gerry will look in the mirror.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100034#HH00300","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1373552100,"counter":483,"content":"<p>We can have all these smart comments from Fianna F&aacute;il.

I simply do not believe it.  We would be getting rid of one undemocratic institution, but we would not be strengthening our democracy because we are not properly reforming the one Chamber that would remain.  Senator Bradford made the point that if we are to compare single chamber systems, then we should compare like with like.  We should examine countries with a single chamber and the checks and balances they have.  They have regional structures and robust local government.  In some cases, they have a separation of power with the executive and the legislature.  They do not have a country that is run by four or five Ministers.  That is not how those countries operate.  This will not improve democracy.  In fact, I believe it will make it worse.<\/p><p>I wish to make a final point on this section on a matter the Minister State raised as well.  It is an issue of fundamental importance.  Since the Government has bounced itself into a referendum on this issue, it is now looking at cosmetic D&aacute;il reform.  The Government has not considered the consequences, the out-workings or what it will mean.<\/p><p>The Minister of State referred to four-day week D&aacute;il sittings.  I genuine believe that would be a mistake.  The D&aacute;il can do its business in three days.  It is a mistake because we spent a good deal of time in the Chamber talking about wanting better and more representation from women and people generally, including parents, men and women.  There was a Bill in the House yesterday relating to child care, maternity and paternity care.  I do not see how a four-day week sittings will attract working mothers from rural parts of the country.  They would have to spend four days and three nights here, rather than two nights and three days.  I do not see how that would entice more women into our political system.  The Government should consider that.  I believe when women's groups consider this proposal, they will be outraged that the Government is making it more difficult rather than less of an impediment for women and parents.  I am not only talking about women.  I am a father of two young children and I do not see enough of them.  If I was elected to the D&aacute;il and I was here for four days and three nights, I would see less of my children.  That should be a consideration as well.  I do not see why three-day sittings are not enough.<\/p><p>I agreed with some of the points made by the Minister of State.  I agree that this House is not fit for purpose.  Even the people who have put forward the reform Bills have agreed as much.  The Taoiseach has said that there is no consensus and that since we cannot agree on the nature of the reforms we should go for abolition.  However, I return to the point I made earlier.  If the Constitutional Convention had been given the opportunity to examine the issue in a thoughtful way, then we might have had a different outcome.  The convention might well have come back with the view that there should be one chamber.  However, I imagine that if it did, it would have done so having asked all the experts as it did in the case of all the other issues it examined.  It would have considered what improvements should be made to the D&aacute;il and how to make the single Chamber more effective, robust and fit for purpose.  We would have attained a far better outcome for everyone.  Unfortunately, that opportunity has been lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100034#HH04300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373552700,"counter":523,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an cheist: &quot;Go bhfanfaidh alt 1 mar chuid den Bhille&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"vote","time":1373552700,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That section 1 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 29; N\u00edl, 18.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden; N\u00edl, Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Diarmuid Wilson.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100035#JJ00150","aye":["1148","1121","1138","1150","1114","1165","1151","1124","1158","1130","1166","1117","1144","1172","1131","1152","1173","1135","1161","1132","1174","1134","1118","1153","1129","1125","1163","1171","1143"],"nay":["1157","1133","1159","1119","1149","1128","1136","1139","1169","1127","1142","1122","1123","1145","1155","1126","1164","1176"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373552700,"counter":525,"content":"<p>Faisn&eacute;iseath go rabhthas tar &eacute;is glacadh leis an gceist.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373553000,"counter":526,"content":"<p>ALT 2<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373553000,"counter":527,"content":"<p>SECTION 2<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373553000,"counter":528,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an cheist: &quot;Go bhfanfaidh alt 2 mar chuid den Bhille.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"vote","time":1373553000,"counter":529,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That section 2 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 29; N\u00edl, 18.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden; N\u00edl, Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Diarmuid Wilson.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100036#KK00300","aye":["1148","1121","1138","1150","1114","1165","1151","1124","1158","1130","1166","1117","1144","1172","1131","1152","1173","1135","1161","1132","1174","1134","1118","1153","1129","1125","1163","1171","1143"],"nay":["1157","1133","1159","1119","1149","1128","1136","1122","1123","1139","1169","1127","1142","1145","1155","1126","1164","1176"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373553000,"counter":530,"content":"<p>Faisn&eacute;iseadh go rabhthas tar &eacute;is glacadh leis an gceist.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373553300,"counter":531,"content":"<p>ALT 3\r\n\r\nSECTION 3<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1373553300,"counter":532,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 in the name of Senators Katherine Zappone and Mary Ann O'Brien is ruled out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100037#LL00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373553300,"counter":533,"content":"<p>N&iacute;or tairgeadh leas&uacute; a 1.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373553300,"counter":534,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1373553300,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Can I speak on the section?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100037#LL00300","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1373553300,"counter":536,"content":"<p>The Senator can speak on the section but the amendment is ruled out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100037#LL00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1373553300,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I am aware of that.

What will be presented to the people on the ballot paper?  Will the question require a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer to the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann under the Thirty-second amendment of the Constitution?  A little bit more than that is needed.  There will be considerable change with this.  It is very misleading.  What type of information campaign does the Government plan so that the considerable detail of this will be explained?<\/p><p>I wish to highlight two issues of major concern to me.  We live in a democracy and the Seanad is a limb of democracy.  In the proposal we will present to the people, the safeguards provided by this House are not being added to the other House.  I refer, in particular, to legislative delay.  If this House is abolished, a Bill could go through the other House with one reading.  The Standing Orders of the D&aacute;il could be amended in time so that legislation could go through with one vote.  This is very serious.  There is no other unicameral parliament in Europe with such poor democratic safeguards.  For example, Finland has a three month delay while other countries have the ability to refer legislation to a referendum.  Legislative delay is critical and it must be built into the D&aacute;il.  It is something on which I plan to campaign if this proposal is put to the people in a referendum.  The people will not have the safeguard of legislative delay built into the D&aacute;il.  Legislative delay ensures better review of legislation.  At the end of the day, legislation has far-reaching implications for people's lives.  It changes their lives in many fundamental ways.  It is quite normal for a money Bill to have up to a 21 day delay and for a non-money Bill to have up to a three month delay.  That must be built into the D&aacute;il but there is no proposal for that to happen.<\/p><p>The second issue is the very serious deletion of Article 27 by the abolition of this House.  Article 27 gives the people the opportunity to petition the President for a referendum on an issue of vital national importance.  That is a wonderful safeguard that is rarely used but at least we know it is there.  In the context of the abortion debate, some sectors of Irish life have spoken about petitioning the President on that issue.  It could be the abortion issue today and another issue tomorrow.  Let us be careful and not eradicate a House of democracy, although indirectly elected and little understood, until we replace with at least the same.<\/p><p>I would like the people to be offered the opportunity in the referendum to choose reform.  I understand we cannot offer reform or abolition but this is still in the hands of the Cabinet and the Taoiseach and they could look at that type of wording.  Obviously, if the response to reform is &quot;No&quot;, that gives another message.  I am very disappointed and I would like the Minister of State to address the issues to which I refer in regard to the very important democratic safeguards built into the Seanad which are not being proposed for the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100039#NN04300","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1373554800,"counter":626,"content":"<p>This is a very important section of the legislation.  I am glad that Senator Norris and his colleagues have drawn our attention to that fact.  This relates to the nuts of the debate, which is effectively a total redrawing of the Constitution.

It further points out that the article refers to felony and the terms of the Bill do not change this.  According to it, the distinction between felony and misdemeanour was abolished by section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1997 and further clarification on whether felony is now interpreted according to this proposed piece of legislation as \"arrestable offence\" - one that carries a five-year prison sentence or more - is now required.  That is not provided for in the Bill or explanatory memorandum.  The independent Oireachtas Library and Research Service has raised a question here and I think we need clarification on that point before the House is asked to vote on this section.  There may be a constitutional question here in respect of that.  Before I go any further, I would like clarification but I think the amendment proposed by Senator Norris is really sensible and outlines the point made by a number of political parties, including my own.<\/p><p>This is a grave issue of national importance.

The first point is that section 5 is the citation of what this Bill will be called.  Obviously, it will collectively be known as the Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution (Abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann) Bill 2013.  This is a normal section in any Bill that is proposing a referendum.  What will follow this is a statement for the information of voters that will be brought before the Seanad next week, as is the case with every referendum.  When the referendum Bill goes through, there then follows a resolution passed by both Houses as to the statement that would occur to be put to voters.<\/p><p>A copy of the Bill, which relates to Senator Norris's point, will be available at all post offices and on the Internet.  That matter will be taken up by the Referendum Commission.  The question is posed as to whether the Government will spend money.  The Government will not spend a brass farthing on this.  In the normal course of events, the Referendum Commission takes responsibility for informing voters of this and that will happen in this case.  The Government will not be carrying out a public information campaign.  It will simply be the normal event where the Referendum Commission is asked to do this.  We will not have a responsibility in respect of this.  Needless to say, political parties will take a position on this and argue accordingly.<\/p><p>The issue of petitions raised by Senator Healy Eames relates to Article 27.  We can have a debate on the sections but the sections are not where the meat is.  The actual meat is in the Schedules.  The Bill effectively says that if it is accepted by the Irish people, the collective references to the Seanad are effectively removed from the Constitution on abolition day.  Some of them are just references because if the thing is abolished, it is abolished and, therefore, one must remove the name of the Seanad.  There are some issues that Senators might like to come to which one could argue might be of some consequence in terms of the constitutional provisions.  One of these is the question of Article 27.  <\/p><p>The Bill proposes to delete Article 27 of the Constitution.  The procedure under this Article applies only to a Bill, other than a Bill to amend the Constitution, a money Bill or a Bill where the Senate's time for consideration has been average under Article 24, which is deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas under Article 23.  Article 23 applies only to a Bill not passed by the Seanad within 90 days or passed by that House where amendments have been rejected by the D&aacute;il and where on foot of a D&aacute;il resolution, the Bill is deemed to be passed by both Houses.  Therefore, Article 27 only applies to a Bill where there is a fundamental disagreement between the Seanad and the D&aacute;il in respect of it.  I am not aware if that has ever come into being because there is no reference to it ever having happened.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100040#OO01000","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373554800,"counter":636,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100040#OO01100","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1373554800,"counter":637,"content":"<p>It was a theoretical problem relating to what would happen if the D&aacute;il or Seanad refused to accept each other's word on this.

If he reads Article 18 of the Constitution, which is the principal Article dealing with Seanad &Eacute;ireann, he will see that it makes it clear that the question of the franchise and the rights of voting, particularly within the universities mentioned in the Articles, are a matter for law.  They are a matter for this House and the other House to determine.  On the argument, therefore, about what takes precedence, it is fair to say that constitutional law takes precedence over statute.  Article 18 is very clear that the question of the franchise dealing with the two universities concerned, the National University of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin, are matters for the Legislature as to the way they are composed and what is done to them.<\/p><p>There is a broader definition, to which the Senator referred and to which I want to refer also, namely, Article 2, which speaks about the Irish nation.  One of the things the much maligned Government has done, which I believe everyone now accepts, is the establishment of the Constitutional Convention, and it is examining this issue, particularly in terms of the Presidency, about whether voting rights would be extended to people who are part of the Irish nation.  The Irish State is the Irish State.  The Irish nation is a much broader concept.  It deals with people living inside the Irish State and those living outside it.  One could argue whether people in Northern Ireland who have an Irish passport and therefore are Irish citizens, and belong to the Irish nation, are entitled to vote.  To take the Senator's case, my understanding is that one must be a passport holder to vote.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the national staffing schedule for the relevant school year and the specific pupil enrolments in the school in question on the previous 30 September.  The staffing schedule sets out in a very fair and transparent manner the pupil thresholds for the allocation of mainstream classroom posts for all schools.<\/p><p>Special arrangements exist for island schools and these arrangements take account of the circumstances that arise in providing education in an island setting.  This special provision means that unlike the generality of schools, in the event a reduction in the pupil numbers of an island school will result in the loss of the second or third classroom teaching post in the school, the post may be retained subject to certain pupil retention levels.  In the case of the second mainstream post, the total number of pupils must be at eight or above and the school must be the only primary school remaining on the island.  In all other two-teacher schools the number of pupils required to retain a second teacher is 17, which is significantly above the number which applies to island schools.  This shows the favourable staffing arrangements already in place for primary schools which are the only school on an island.<\/p><p>The pupil enrolment in Scoil Cholmcille on Tory Island for 30 September 2012 was nine pupils.  This compares with six pupils in both 2010 and 2011.  Under the published staffing schedule the staffing level in the school for the 2013 to 2014 school year will remain at one mainstream teacher.  In addition, the school also receives part-time teaching support of five hours learning support per week for its nine pupils.<\/p> <p>In addition, the school also receives part-time teaching support of five hours learning support per week for its nine pupils.  At a time of great strain on our public finances, we must ensure the very valuable, but limited, resources available to us are used in the best way possible.  Unlike most other areas of the public service, teaching vacancies are being filled in accordance with published Department criteria.  In fact, we are recruiting almost 900 new teachers this year alone.  Within the constraints of the employment control framework, schools are permitted to fill teaching vacancies that arise within their approved staffing allocations and island schools have received special consideration historically when enrolment levels fall below thresholds which mean the loss of that second teacher.  Those special considerations remain in place and those arrangements have not changed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100047#VV00400","speaker":"1042","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373559000,"counter":835,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it.

It is a noose around one's neck to have to get a car loan to get a car to go to work and not a luxury.  All of a sudden the PCRS has scrapped allowing people to write off car loans.  Recently, it seems to have scrapped allowing people to write off home improvement loans.  During the good times, these loans were thrown at people willy-nilly by the banks.  People were sucked into a false sense of security but they still have to repay these loans.  I also noticed the &euro;50 car allowance granted to people with a car for the purpose of going to work is gone.

They are being deprived of medical cards from health and financial perspectives.  I do not know who is making the decisions.  Is it the Minister or the HSE?  Does the Government realise the damage it is doing to these people?  If somebody is on social welfare, he or she will qualify for a medical card even though the social welfare rate is in excess of the medical card guidelines.  However, when one factors in all of the payments middle income earners have - cars for going to work, car loans, home improvement loans, mortgages and creche fees which the PCRS has played around with in that it does not accept certain types of childminders - they are taking home less than those on social welfare.  They are really being hit by decisions such as this.<\/p><p>I have no doubt the Minister of State's reply has been written by the HSE and it will probably state that 43% of the people have medical cards but I can tell him that in 1980, some 40% of the people had medical cards.  The figure was always been around 40%.  It is not much of a change.  <\/p><p>We heard today that cancer patients who had discretionary medical cards will now be deprived of them.  This is an issue on which I have campaigned for years.  I recall writing to the former Minister for Health, Ms Mary Harney, on the issue because I felt she might show some compassion to people with cancer.<\/p><p>Whether the reply I get from the Minister of State is one I like - I assume it will be the usual type that I do not like - I urge him to bring these concerns to the  Ministers in question and to ask them to respond to me but not through the HSE.  I want to know who is making the decisions because people are really hurting.<\/p><p>As I said, the HSE proposes to give medical cards only to those dying of cancer.  It wants to hand a person with cancer a death certificate in that if one gets a medical card, one will know one has six months to live. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100048#WW00400","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1373559000,"counter":839,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for primary care, Deputy Alex White and I thank the Senator for raising it.  As the Senator pointed out, changes were made earlier this year to the medical card means test and to the income thresholds for over 70s medical cards.  Those changes were made on foot of budget 2013 which identified a wide range of savings that were required across the health services.  The General Medical Services, GMS,  scheme was one of a number of areas identified in which savings were required.<\/p><p>A number of measures are being taken to reduce the cost of the GMS, which costs approximately &euro;2 billion per year.  At the end of 2012, there were approximately 1,986,000 qualifying people under the GMS.  Medical cards make up the majority of this number, amounting to approximately 93% of the total.  As part of budget 2013, the Government has made provision for an additional 200,000 persons to be covered by the GMS.  Nonetheless, it is important that we prioritise the use of scarce financial resources in the current budgetary position.<\/p><p>Among the budget 2013 savings measures announced was a reduction in the income limits for over-70s medical cards.  It should be noted that the overwhelming majority of medical cardholders aged over 70 years are unaffected by that change.  For the wealthiest 5% who are affected, those cardholders under the old income limits will continue to be provided with a free GP service.  The Health (Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2013 was enacted on 28 March 2013 to give effect to the revised eligibility arrangements.  Last December, at time of the budget, it was also announced that the rules on a person's expenses that are taken into account in calculating their net income for medical card purposes would be tightened.  The Senator referred to this in his contribution.<\/p><p>The changes recently introduced by the Health Service Executive mean that payments on a home improvement loan and a &euro;50 per week allowance for a car are excluded from the standard means test assessment.  These changes took effect from April onwards.  <\/p><p>For clarity, the exclusion from travel to work costs relates to removing the weekly amount of &euro;50 allowed to cover standing charges, such as depreciation or other running costs, used when considering travel to work costs as an outgoing where public transport is not available or suitable and a car is required.  This means that the HSE will continue to consider the standard mileage costs or public transport costs when assessing eligibility.<\/p><p>The Senator may be aware that there are a broad range of allowable expenses under the means test assessment for medical cards that have not been affected by these changes.  I would like to assure him that the changes were identified with a view to mitigating the impact on the assessment process, while also yielding savings.  In so doing, the new assessment arrangements continue to fully take account of a person's mortgage or rental expenses.  In addition, other allowable expenses were protected budget 2013. The need to reduce the income limits for medical cards was avoided in budget 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100048#WW00500","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"speech","time":1373559600,"counter":840,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the response, which contained everything I expected to be in it.

There is no doubt he will be a great asset to the Department given his vast experience in farming and politics.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on his work on the recent Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, negotiations and the great results he secured for the country in his endeavours.  Not only has he shown leadership but he is also protecting Irish farmers and their livelihoods, and that deserves to be commended.<\/p><p>The matter I raise on the Adjournment this evening is one most would agree is a serious and pressing issue for the farming community in this country.  It deserves to be highlighted.  Not alone that, but there is a need for a plan to be put in place in order that an ongoing campaign focused on farm safety would continue throughout the next few months.  According to Teagasc&rsquo;s safety survey findings, this country has one of the highest incidences of farm accidents in Europe.  It is more than twice the European average.  Farm deaths accounted for 45% of all workplace deaths in 2012.<\/p><p>By the Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s own estimate, during the period 2000 to 2010, 30% of child deaths on farms were caused by drowning in slurry pits.  During the same period, 8% of deaths of elderly farmers over the age of 65 were caused in similar circumstances.  The risks associated with slurry pits have regrettably been highlighted by the tragic deaths of the members of the Spence family last year, which we all remember.<\/p><p>Slurry pits represent a wide and varied danger to the safety of farmers, their families and livestock.  The possible causes of harm range from drowning to suffocation from poisonous gases.  As the Minister of State is well aware, a high level of gases can be released when slurry is agitated and one breath or a lungful can cause instant death but can, equally, be highly dangerous for people within close proximity if noxious fumes are allowed to linger and are not diluted by a strong wind.  The reliance on wind and other factors for safety is an archaic discipline and not particularly suitable to modern day farming practices.  We need ideas to address this silent killer.  It is imperative that the Ministers in the Department would direct the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to summon the necessary chemical experts before it reports on the potential for development of a chemical that might go some way towards breaking up the slurry and relieving the farmer and his family from having to engage in this highly dangerous agitation process.<\/p><p>I welcome the Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s educational programmes, especially for children, on farm safety, as it appears that the farm competition for primary schools is having a positive impact on children by raising awareness of the danger that exists on site.  However, I would like to hear what the Department is doing to further improve safety standards for farmers and whether it provides support to farmers for ongoing safety training.  We must remember that farms are family homes as well as workplaces, so it is incumbent on the Department to ensure each and every farmer in the country realises that safe farming is about protecting themselves, their families and businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100049#XX00600","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1373559600,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins for giving me the opportunity to come to the House to clarify the Department's position on the issue raised.  I also thank her for her good wishes to me.<\/p><p>We all agree that the tragic deaths of three members of the Spence family shocked the entire community and every effort must be made to avoid a repetition of such a dreadful accident.  My Department has been in contact with colleagues in the Health and Safety Authority to understand the circumstances behind the dreadful events of that day last September.  I am fully committed to the need to increase farmers' awareness of health and safety and to the need to influence the behaviour of farmers to act on this knowledge.<\/p><p>It is a fact that farming is the most dangerous occupation in the country with more people killed on farms than all other workplaces combined.  To a large degree the nature of a farm is at the core of the problem.  A farm is, to a great extent, seen first and foremost as a family home.  This means it is seen as a place of security and welcome for family, friends, neighbours and visitors.  However, a farmyard is a very dangerous place of work with large modern machinery and other dangers such as animals and extensive slurry storage areas.  The difficulty is to marry the family home part of the farm with the very dangerous farmyard and other dangerous areas of the extended farm.  Last year, 21 fatal accidents were reported on farms, while so far this year there have thankfully been just two, but still two too many.  I sincerely hope that this is the start of a positive trend and not just a short-term reduction, as we have seen previously.<\/p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, HSA, under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, has primary responsibility for health and safety in the workplace.  The HSA is also the enforcement agency for workplace safety.  It carried out 3,000 inspections in the agriculture sector in 2012 and plans to continue with a high level of engagement during 2013.  These visits are aimed at advising and educating farmers on the dangers that are ever present in the farm environment.<\/p><p>The Health and Safety Authority is carrying out a farm safety survey, which aims to identify the behaviours farmers engage in while working and the underlying factors influencing them, with a view to making recommendations concerning how best to make farms safer places in which to work and live.  The survey questionnaires are being posted to more than 3,000, randomly selected, farm households beginning this week.  The survey has been designed by agricultural sector experts and further shaped by interviews with farmers at a number of marts around the country earlier this year.<\/p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is represented on the farm safety partnership advisory committee, which is a sub-committee of the Health and Safety Authority.  The committee advises the board on the direction the HSA should take on farm safety.  The farm safety action plan 2013-2015 follows on from the previous farm safety action plan 2009-2012 and it has been developed in conjunction with the farm safety partnership advisory committee.<\/p><p>I fully support all the measures that are being taken to raise awareness of this serious problem.  For the second year running, my Department included a farm safety message with the single payment application packs that were sent to more than 130,000 farmers in March.  The leaflet this year focused in particular on the dangers of slurry gases and the safe procedures for handling slurry.  That was a joint initiative between the Department, the Health and Safety Authority and the farm safety partnership committee.<\/p> <p>It is only one example of co-operation between various agencies to remind farmers of the importance of following safe farm practices and the potentially fatal consequences for them, their families and other farm visitors of lowering their guard.<\/p><p> In November last year, my Department, in conjunction with Teagsac, published a two-page article in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal<\/i>on how to inspect cattle slats on top of slurry tanks in a safe manner.  The article highlighted the importance of regular monitoring of the condition of cattle slats and the safe procedures for entering a slurry tank to undertake such an inspection.<\/p><p> My Department has detailed specifications for the design and construction of all types of slurry stores and these are the minimum standards to which such stores must be constructed.  Not only do the specifications deal with the minimum construction standards but they detail the required safety procedures for the construction and safe operation of these stores.  The first section of the specifications is about safety.  All the specifications are freely available on my Department's website to anyone who is undertaking work on the construction of a slurry store.  These specifications are kept under continual review and any developments in safety or construction techniques are incorporated.<\/p><p> Senator Higgins may be aware of the advertisements on television, radio and in the press featuring farmers who have been seriously injured in accidents.  They gave an account of their experiences and showed their injuries at first hand.  The Health and Safety Authority, which produced the advertisements, has also incorporated the six testimonials in a thought-provoking DVD which is now being used in all training undertaken by the Department.  A copy is available to download from the HSA website.  This DVD was shown on screens in marts throughout the country in the past year.<\/p><p> There is no one solution to this problem.  I am confident all relevant agencies will work with the HSA and the farming representative organisations to continue to tackle the issue.<\/p><p> This is a good time to be a farmer.  We are keen to do everything we can to get individual farmers to take care of their safety, their family's safety and the safety of all others on farms, including visitors.  If anyone has any ideas I am sure Department officials and staff in Teagasc would be only too willing to accept any simple ideas that could help what is a major problem for the Department and others involved, especially when it comes to the bad news hitting a community or family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071100049#XX00700","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373560200,"counter":848,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

All possible consular assistance is being provided to the respective fathers.<\/p><p>On 4 April 2013 the consular assistance section was contacted by the father of the older child who reported the possible abduction of his son by the child's mother.  He was advised to report this to the Garda and he confirmed that this was his intention.  The limits of consular assistance in such situations were outlined to him.  It was explained that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has no power to remove a child from a foreign jurisdiction.  He was informed that if the child's mother was unwilling to allow the child to return to Ireland, then the matter would have to be resolved through the local courts.  He was also informed that the country to which the mother was understood to have taken his son is not a party to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.<\/p><p>The convention is an agreement to ensure the return of a child who has been removed from the country where he or she normally lives to another country without the consent of one of the parents.  Under the terms of the convention, children abducted in this manner are returned to their country of habitual residence in order that the courts there can decide on issues regarding custody and guardianship.<\/p><p>On 12 April 2013, the father of the older child contacted officials at our embassy and informed them that he understood that the mother had also taken a second younger son of a different father out of the country.  He stated that the father of the younger son had reported this to the Garda and that both fathers were co-ordinating their efforts for the safe return of the two children to Ireland.  On the same date, Garda officers confirmed to the consular assistance section that they had been informed of both cases by the fathers and that they were following up through Interpol channels.<\/p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade understands that at the time of the abduction the father of the older child had, and continues to have, a court order granting him custody, with visitation rights granted to the mother.  The court order stipulates that the child &quot;not be removed out of the jurisdiction of the court without leave of the court&quot;.<\/p> <p>A court hearing relating to custody of the younger child had already been scheduled at the time of the abduction.
