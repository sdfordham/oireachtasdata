The best way to address rents in the long term, and benefit the entire sector, is to increase the supply of rental accommodation and accelerate also the delivery of housing for the private and social rented sectors.  However, I acknowledge that there is a need for short-term measures also.   <\/p>  <p>Pillar 4 of the Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness commits to developing a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector.  The strategy will include measures to address immediate issues affecting the supply, cost and accessibility of accommodation.  In addition , the strategy will consider measures to increase security of tenure and, in particular, the potential of new mechanisms for both setting and reviewing rents.  There will also be a focus on maintaining existing levels of rental stock and encouraging investment in additional supply. <\/p>  <p>  The strategy will provide a vision of the role that the rental sector will play in the short, medium and long term in the context of the Government&rsquo;s overall objectives for the housing sector.  I expect it to be finalised before the end of the year.   <\/p>  <p>  Some of the measures in the rental strategy will require supporting amendments to be made to the Residential Tenancies Act.  However, other legislative changes are being accelerated for early enactment in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016, which commenced Second Stage in the Seanad yesterday.  Tenants and landlords alike will therefore see a number of improvements in place arising from these legislative provisions.   <\/p>  <p>  The key challenge is to ensure the development of a viable and sustainable rental sector that can provide choice, quality, value and security for households together with secure, attractive investment opportunities for rental providers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700056#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Building Regulations","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700056#WRA03350"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[35433\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700056#WRA03400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the standards in place or the guidelines provided by his Department to local authorities to ensure that all new social housing new builds funded through the Exchequer meet the highest possible energy efficiency, water efficiency and environmental sustainability standards.","asker":"1309","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>It is important that the public sector continues to show leadership in the areas of energy efficiency, water efficiency and environmental sustainability, including in the provision of social housing.

The independent Pyrite Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated unless or until they exhibit significant pyritic damage.

Activity by institutional and professional residential sector investment specialists such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) in purchasing housing and engaging in the building out of part completed schemes and commencing new housing projects is a positive signal of investment beginning to flow back into the housing sector to provide the housing that people need.  The acquisition and management of properties by professional Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) is one component part of a more sustainable, long-term property rental market for both investors and tenants.  While commercial property investment has been a key focus for some of the REITs launched to date in Ireland, residential property also forms part of the sector's interest and exposure.  It is expected that the sector will continue to develop over time and in so doing to increase the supply of professionally managed, good quality, secure and affordable rented accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  Historically the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation.  However, a more diverse sector, which includes institutional investors specialised in providing and managing larger scale residential rental projects, is more stable and less exposed to property market risk and volatility.  Institutional investors can also help provide the range of tenancy options that households need across their lifecycles.  Attracting large-scale investment in property has an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high-standard rental sector that tenants deserve.   <\/p>  <p>The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive sets out the requirements for the collection, treatment and discharge of waste water from urban areas\/agglomerations.  Compliance with the requirements of this Directive is reported annually by the Environmental Protection Agency in their Urban Waste Water Treatment Report.

An additional letter of formal notice issued from the European Commission in September 2015.  <\/p>  <p>  In January 2016, my Department, assisted by Irish Water, and in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, responded to the Commission in relation to the infringement.  The response set out the plans in place, including timeframes, to ensure compliance.  This was followed by a 6 monthly progress update which was sent to the European Commission in July 2016.   <\/p>  <p>  In September 2016, a reasoned opinion on this infringement issued from the European Commission.  My Department, with the support of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Irish Water, is currently preparing a response which will be completed before the end of November 2016.

As well as creating a more rational and comprehensive structural arrangement, the new system enables more effective and community-focused decision making and implementation.  Under the new arrangements, there is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms. <\/p>  <p>  More effective democratic representation and local decision making is provided by the new system in which a wide range of local functions are devolved to the elected members at district level with more strategic matters decided by the plenary county.  Unlike the uneven patchwork of separate town councils with outdated boundaries which it replaced, this is a comprehensive sub-county system, with membership in common between district and county levels, rational allocation of functions between levels, and a single administrative and operational structure.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, which was the first full year of the revised local government structures, a broadly based Advisory Group was convened to carry out a review of their operation, in conjunction with a Local Government Forum for engagement with the Association of Irish Local Government.  Feedback from these deliberations and the results of surveys of local authority members and chief executives, indicate that the revised structures are generally operating well but will need more time to bed down fully.  The results of this operational review will provide a key input to the consideration of issues in the preparation of a report for Government and the Oireachtas by mid-2017, pursuant to the Programme for a Partnership Government, on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability and to ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy, including the issue of town or borough council status.<\/p>  <p>  Initial scoping work in relation to this report is being undertaken in my Department, and will identify in greater detail the specific issues and options which will fall to be addressed and the approach to be followed in relation to consultation.

It is up to each student to make the best use of that opportunity.  If their academic achievement is high, then Ireland offers opportunities to students to stay on as graduates, researchers, or high skilled employees.  In other words, student permission gives the person concerned a chance to qualify for an enhanced immigration status on the basis of their academic achievement.

Vetting checks are conducted by the Garda vetting bureau for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available are taken into account.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Vetting Disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process. <\/p>  <p>  There are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  Section 12(3)(A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of an person to undertake relevant work or activities thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.

In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is very largely obviated.<\/p>  <p>  This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-Vetting system  which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations.

The Policing Authority has met on several occasions with the Commissioner and her senior team, as a follow up on its consideration of the O&rsquo;Higgins Report and related matters. A number of these meetings have been held in public to reassure the community about the performance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

It has also determined the policing priorities for 2017 which will inform the content of \tthe 2017 Policing Plan to be published before the end of the year.

Section 12 deals with the appointment by the Authority of persons to the ranks of Assistant Garda Commissioner, chief superintendent and superintendent.  Sections 39 to 42 deal with appointments and secondments between the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the procedures to deal with disciplinary matters in relation to persons comprehended by those sections. <\/p>  <p>  The commencement of these sections is dependent on the regulations governing promotion and discipline in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being amended to reflect the envisaged role for the Authority. In accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner and the Authority must be consulted on any proposed changes to these regulations. In addition, the Garda representative bodies must be consulted and that process is well underway.  Work on the preparation of the proposed regulation changes is nearing completion with a view to the appointment and removal functions being transferred to the Authority in the coming weeks and in any case before the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to be aware that the establishment of the Policing Authority has no bearing on promotions to the ranks of sergeant and inspector.

In that regard, section 784A of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, provides that income or gains arising while the funds are invested in an ARF are exempt from tax. Withdrawals from an ARF are generally taxable at the owner's marginal rate of tax. ARFs are managed by Qualifying Fund Managers, mainly insurance companies, banks and stockbrokers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under the Double Taxation Treaty between Ireland and the United Kingdom, in common with double taxation agreements generally, a taxing right in respect of income and capital gains from immovable property is given to the Contracting State (Ireland or the UK as appropriate) in which the property is situated. As there is no specific exemption for ARFs in the treaty, ARFs with investments in UK property are liable to tax in the UK on the income and gains arising from such property. However, Article 14A of the treaty provides an exemption in relation to income and gains derived by a resident of one Contracting State from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State in certain circumstances. This arises where the competent authority of the first State certifies that the income and gains are tax exempt in that State \"by reason of the provisions in the laws of that State which afford relief from taxation to charities and superannuation schemes, as such, or to insurance companies in respect of their pension business \". \u00a0An ARF must, therefore, be either a superannuation scheme or pension business of an insurance company in order to qualify for the exemption under Article 14A. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined above, ARFs are not superannuation schemes and, therefore, it is only where they come within the scope of \"insurance companies in respect of their pension business\" that they are covered by Article 14A. I am advised by Revenue that subsection (5) of section 784A of the TCA 1997 specifically extends the scope of references to the pension business of insurance companies to include ARFs provided by such companies. However, it should be noted that such ARFs are exempt under Article 14A not because they are ARFs, but because they form part of the pension business of such companies. I understand from Revenue that HM\u00a0Revenue and Customs considered whether they were in a position to extend the benefits of Article 14A to all ARFs, but concluded that as ARFs are not superannuation schemes, per se, they are outside the scope of the treaty other than where they fall within the \"insurance company\" element referred to above. <\/p>  <p>  As regards Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs), the 2016 Finance Bill contains provisions to stop PRSAs being used for tax avoidance purposes. The avoidance concerned involved benefits never being taken from a PRSA so that it never \"vests\" with the result that certain taxes never applied and a more favourable tax treatment was afforded the PRSA assets on the death of the beneficial owner. To counter this avoidance, the Finance Bill provides that where PRSA benefits have not commenced by the date of the owner's 75th birthday (as envisaged by the TCA 1997), such benefits are deemed to commence (i.e. the PRSA is deemed to vest) on that date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700064#WRJ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers Grant Eligibility","counter":334,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700064#WRJ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":335,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[35556\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700064#WRJ00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will review the criteria to obtain a primary medical certificate regarding Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax Concession) Regulations 1994; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Ombudsman has expressed concern that the scheme, as currently framed, is overly rigid and inflexible and may be causing inequity (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":336,"content":"<p>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and VRT (up to a certain limit) on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, payment of\u00a0a fuel grant, and an exemption from Motor Tax. <\/p>  <p>  To qualify for the Scheme an applicant must be in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate.

Following this report, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) appointed Promontory Financial Group to further investigate these allegations.\u00a0 Promontory's work along with the involvement of the FCA, led RBS last week to announce redress for certain SME customers.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously answered, Ulster Bank Ireland Limited undertook an independent review into the relevance of these allegations to its corresponding division, namely the Global Restructuring Group Ireland (GRGI). \u00a0On the 19th December 2014, Ulster Bank published the findings of the independent review by Mahon Hayes Curran into practices at GRGI.\u00a0The investigation found no evidence to support the allegations and suggested that GRGI's driving policy was to manage its customers through the cycle, supporting them where possible to return them to viability.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is the statutory body with responsibility for the investigation of any such allegations in an Irish context and I consider this\u00a0a matter\u00a0for the Central Bank.\u00a0 I am confident that legislative changes since the financial crisis have equipped the Central Bank with an array of investigative, regulatory and enforcement powers to ensure that regulated financial service providers adhere to the requirements of financial services legislation.\u00a0\u00a0These changes include significantly enhanced powers for the Central Bank to gather information under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 which broadened the Banks' information gathering and authorised officer powers.\u00a0 It is evident that the Central Bank is properly undertaking its enforcement role by the recent sizeable settlements in enforcement cases.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this enforcement role, the Deputy may be aware that the Central Bank is proactively regulating the financial system and has issued regulations aimed at protecting SMEs when dealing with regulated and unregulated firms as set out below. \u00a0These strengthened regulations include the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation for regulated lenders (other than credit unions) on 1 July 2016 and in the case of credit unions, will come into operation from 1 January 2017.\u00a0 These revised SME Regulations introduce specific requirements for regulated lenders, including: <\/p>  <p>  -  Contacting SME borrowers who have been in arrears for 15 working days; <\/p>  <p>  -  Warning SME borrowers if they are in danger of being classified as not co-operating; and <\/p>  <p>  -  Expanding the grounds for appeal and setting up an internal appeals panel.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to unregulated firms, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted on 8 July 2015. It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm. The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.\u00a0 Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the SME Regulations noted above) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700064#WRJ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Ombudsman Data","counter":343,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700064#WRJ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":344,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[35669\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700064#WRJ01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total amount of funding allocated to the Financial Services Ombudsman in 2015 to 2017, inclusive, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":345,"content":"<p>At the outset, I must point out that the Financial Services Ombudsman is independent in the performance of his statutory functions.<\/p><p>The\u00a0Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act, 2004 provided for the establishment of the Financial Services Ombudsman Council.\u00a0 Under Section 57BE,\u00a0the\u00a0Financial Services Ombudsman Council may impose levies and fees to enable the Financial Services Ombudsman\u00a0to perform the functions assigned to him and to exercise the powers conferred on him by statute.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

Recruitment to apprenticeship is therefore driven by employers rather than by SOLAS or by education and training providers. <\/p>  <p>  The 2014 Review of Apprenticeship in Ireland acknowledged that the number of women employed in craft apprenticeships is low as they operate in sectors that have traditionally low levels of female employment.  SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage women to take up apprenticeships in these areas. Despite this the number of female apprentices remains low.<\/p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers. 25 proposals have been prioritised by the Council for development. In recent months, we have seen the first of these new apprenticeships with the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship launching in September and the Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship recently commencing. Further new apprenticeships will get underway later this year and early next year. Many of these new programmes are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace and I am confident that this will lead to a strong increase in female participation when these new apprenticeships are launched in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  Accompanying the renewal and expansion of apprenticeship in Ireland will be a new branding and marketing campaign.

The increased target of 47,000 new social housing units by 2021 is backed up by &euro;5.35 billion funding.  My Department is engaged on an ongoing basis with all local authorities concerning their plans and programmes for the delivery of those targets.  I have met directly with the local authority chief executives and assured them that funding is available to advance new projects and to urge the swiftest possible progress on their overall programme of projects.<\/p>  <p>  Our efforts to significantly ramp up social housing construction nationally are taking effect.  In 2015, only 74 units were constructed by local authorities.  In 2016, circa 1,400 units will start or have already started on site.  More than 3,000 additional units will start on site in 2017.  The continuous contact between my Department and all local authorities is focused on both the existing projects and on bringing forward additional, new proposals through a range of delivery means.  This contact also includes a focus on housing acquisitions, which are providing a strong and immediate stream of delivery.

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under that scheme.  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory.  One of the conditions of the State pension (contributory) is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim. <\/p>  <p>  The State assists those with caring roles to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  Given the valuable nature of the State pension (contributory), those who qualify under the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme still need to fulfil the eligibility requirements for that scheme, and have at least 520 paid contributions over the course of their working lives. <\/p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of the Homemakers scheme in 1994, there was no provision for the recognition of periods of homemaking.  This scheme introduced such recognition of periods going forward from that date, but had it been backdated, the costs would have been very considerable.  I am advised that if the Homemakers scheme was to be backdated to all dates prior to 1994, for payments from January 2017, the net cost to the Exchequer could be expected to amount to approximately &euro;290 million in 2017, and this annual cost would rise at a faster rate than the overall cost of State pensions. <\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration in the first half of next year.  It&rsquo;s worth noting that this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700068#WRN02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":506,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700068#WRN03000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":505,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700068#WRN02900"},{"type":"question","counter":506,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[35636\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700068#WRN03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the initiatives he proposes to undertake with the new Administration and Congress in the United States in relation to regularising the status of the undocumented Irish; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":507,"content":"<p>Achieving relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US and agreement on a facility for future legal migration between Ireland and the US have been and will remain key objectives for the Government.

In the meantime, we will avail of all opportunities during the transition period to sensitise the incoming Administration to our concerns on immigration related matters.

I am acutely conscious of the pressure farmers are under at present, and I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to exploring all of the appropriate options for providing assistance to the farm sector through current difficulties. <\/p>  <p>  After a prolonged period of price volatility in dairy markets, there are some tentative signs of recovery. However, volatility will continue to be a feature of global dairy markets. There has been significant progress in terms of responses from all stakeholders across a number of areas, with EU measures, initiatives by processors and a new flexible loan fund for dairy and other farmers announced in Budget 2017.<\/p>  <p>  On the market front,\u00a0since taking office I have\u00a0led trade missions to Asia and to North Africa, with a view to increasing the profile of Ireland as a producer of quality food products, particularly dairy products. This work on market diversification is a critically important element in mitigating market volatility and is particularly important in the context of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  On-going efforts within industry to move dairy production up the value chain wherever possible are also critically important and continue to be supported by Government. These efforts are supported by investment by my Department and its agencies in research and innovation. By providing financial support for Teagasc, ICBF and Animal Health Ireland, and for knowledge transfer groups, we continually invest in the provision of advice and education to farmers, which facilitates technology adoption and improves profitability at farm level. My Department is also providing support for investment at farm level through the TAMS scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Dairy Quality Assurance Scheme is also critically important in developing a unique selling point for Irish dairy products on\u00a0EU and international markets. Dairy processors make a substantial contribution to cover some of the costs of audits under the scheme, but of course the question of price incentives for participation is a matter for the industry.<\/p>  <p>  Where appropriate, we must continue to focus on appropriate national and EU measures that can play a role in supporting the sector. It is vital that we continue to work closely with the Commission and all other key stakeholders in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission, in many instances based on suggestions from Ireland and other like minded Member States, has already deployed a range of market supports including intervention and Aids to Private Storage, and a financial package of &euro;500 million for liquidity assistance was agreed at the Agriculture council in September 2016, with Ireland topping up its allocation to provide a total assistance package of approaching &euro;27M to Irish farmers in late 2015 and early 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission also announced a further &euro;500m support package for EU farmers in July 2016. The first &euro;150m was reserved for an EU-wide scheme compensating farmers who reduce their milk output over certain reference periods towards the end of 2016. This was very well subscribed to in Ireland and, should the commitments for reduction be adhered to, will be worth over &euro;10M to Irish dairy farmers in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  For the other element of the Commission package, &euro;350m is set aside for Member State initiatives with fixed allocations per MS. Ireland&rsquo;s allocation under this scheme is &euro;11m. I have decided to provide an additional &euro;13 million national aid in that in order to optimise the effectiveness of this measure\u00a0and to use it to support\u00a0 the development of a &euro;150 million fund for low interest loans for farmers.<\/p>  <p>  A further measure that has assisted in reducing\u00a0the burden on all farmers, including those in the dairy sector, was the negotiation and agreement of advanced payments for the Basic Payment and the RDP schemes, allowing us to pay out 70% and 85% respectively from 16th October.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work closely with the dairy sector, with\u00a0EU colleagues and International counterparts to ensure the development and maintenance of a sustainable dairy sector in Cavan, Monaghan and elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700072#WRR00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":629,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700072#WRR00850"},{"type":"question","counter":630,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[35657\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700072#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to ban wild animal circuses here on the basis of cruelty to animals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1301","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":631,"content":"<p>The conditions under which circus animals are kept and managed come under the scope of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which contains rules relating to the welfare of all animals and requires a person having an animal under his or her control to safeguard and not endanger the health and welfare of the animal.

The website also provides information on the Reconstitution Scheme (Chalara Ash Dieback) which is available to assist owners of forests planted under the Afforestation Scheme which have suffered from the disease to restore those forests, as well as information on research projects into the control and management of the disease, in particular projects to identify trees that show strong tolerance and or resistance to the disease. There is also a national distribution map and summary table of all confirmed findings up to the second quarter of 2016 (i.e. 30 June this year). This table and map will be updated with the figures for third quarter of 2016 in the coming days.<\/p>  <p>  To summarise the current situation and to speak to the long term outlook, at this juncture it is important to note that notwithstanding the positive effects at local level of the eradication actions undertaken to date, both by affected landowners supported by the Reconstitution Scheme or directly by the Department itself, the annual systematic surveys and targeted surveys as well as follow up inspections by Department Inspectors have indicated year on year that there is a continuing rise in the number and geographic distribution of confirmed findings nationally. By June of this year, at a time when the targeted and systematic summer surveys were still underway, the initial results were already such as to confirm the presence to a greater or lesser extent of the disease in all 26 counties.<\/p>  <p>  Another factor is that initially the findings were in imported ash trees. Later\u00a0 the disease was found  in native hedgerows beside infected imported ash trees. The Department is\u00a0now finding the disease in native hedgerows where there is no obvious introduced source of infection nearby. In addition over half the recent findings in forest plantations are in ash trees of native Irish origin. It is also worth noting that in \u00a0Britain the disease has spread quickly and widely in the natural environment over the same time period.<\/p>  <p>  As already noted, the Department is actively supporting a number of research projects into disease, in particular projects with a key long-term focus of developing an ash tree breeding programme to identify trees that show strong tolerance and or resistance to the disease and the genetic basis for tolerance.

Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.<\/p><p>  In July this year, I launched the first annual progress report of Food Wise 2025: Steps to Success 2016.  Food Wise Steps to Success showed that, of the 330 detailed actions which were due to commence in 2015 or 2016, 28% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken; and a further 67% have commenced and are progressing well. I believe that this is a good start and I will press on to get as many actions as possible completed within the next year.<\/p><p>  Environmental sustainability is at the heart of Food Wise, which states that &ldquo;environmental protection and economic competitiveness are equal and complementary: one cannot be achieved at the expense of the other&rdquo;.  An Environmental Sustainability Subgroup was established under the auspices of HLIC to monitor and drive the sustainability actions outlined in Food Wise 2025.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s whole of Government approach to sustainability includes development of coherent and cost-effective policies to meet the twin challenges of sustainable food production and climate change in the agriculture and land use sector.  The EPA report will help to inform the development of coherent and cost-effective policies to meet these challenges.  The national policy position is based on an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.  Officials from my Department work very closely with other Departments and in particular, with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment which is the lead in this area.<\/p><p>  Through the deployment of innovative and efficient practices at farm level, combined with the application of emerging scientific knowledge, Ireland is taking the necessary steps towards addressing the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions in the Irish agriculture sector.  The Rural Development Programme, worth almost &euro;4 billion over 7 years, is strongly targeted towards environmental benefits, including knowledge transfer programmes, which will bring the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers.<\/p><p>  My Department is also contributing to the National Mitigation Plan, which is being prepared under the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act.  The work on the national plan is overseen by Government through a hierarchy of committees and sub-groups, with independent advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council.  These committees and groups include the Cabinet Committee and the Senior Officials' Group on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action, a Technical Research and Modelling Group and a Domestic Climate Finance Group.<\/p><p>  DAFM is a key stakeholder in the implementation of the National Regulations referred to as the Nitrates or the Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) Regulations.  These regulations protect water through the implementation of specific controls and are aimed at minimising the loss of Nutrients from Agriculture.  Substantial investments has been made both by my Department and the farming community to implement the GAP measures under the Nitrates Action Programme since their introduction in 2006.  Additionally, under our Agri-environment scheme, GLAS, farmers in areas of high water status and vulnerable water bodies have priority entry to the scheme whilst measures such as 'Fencing of Watercourses' within the scheme are designed specifically to enhance water quality.  The scheme is therefore very much targeted at improving water quality and this objective is supported by both the Knowledge Transfer and the Targetted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes. <\/p><p>The effectiveness of the Nitrates regulations is monitored by the Agricultural Catchments Programme.  This is an integrated research\/advisory programme established in 2008 with over 300 participating farmers in six catchments, funded by my Department.  The Nitrates Regulations provide a considerable environmental baseline which all Irish farmers must achieve.  The next review of these regulations will take place in 2017.<\/p><p>  With regard to the economic viability of farms outlined in the EPA report, this analysis is based on research by my Department and Teagasc.  The overarching emphasis of Food Wise is to support increased competitiveness and profitability on farms with a view to delivering sustainable growth.  In that regard the three pillar strategy I announced as part of the recent Budget - comprising payments, agri-taxation measures and the innovative Agri Cashflow Support Loan Fund - is designed to alleviate the difficulties caused to farmers by current market difficulties and the uncertainty engendered by the UK decision to leave the EU, and to provide them with longer-term financial stability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700073#WRS02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Data","counter":686,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700073#WRS02150"},{"type":"question","counter":687,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[35686\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700073#WRS02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total number of farmers enrolled in the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, whose contracts will end in 2018, by county, in tabular form; if he will permit such farmers to join GLAS under a fourth round; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":688,"content":"<p>The third\u00a0tranche\u00a0of GLAS was recently launched with a view to bringing\u00a0participation in the Scheme to at least 50,000 farmers and to utilise the full budget allocated to the Scheme.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)statistics, published in September 2016, illustrate Ireland&rsquo;s current progress towards meeting EU waste targets including WEEE. The most recent WEEE statistics are with respect to 2014 and demonstrate that 7.2 kg of household WEEE was collected per person in Ireland, compared to the EU target of 4 kg per person, and that\u00a0Ireland is also meeting recovery rates of 80% and 90% across different recycling processes. This information is available on the EPA&rsquo;s website .<\/p><p>These statistics are tangible proof of the positive response to the implementation of the WEEE directive in Ireland. Since the introduction of the Irish WEEE legislation, some 100 million waste electrical items have been collected and over 300,000 tonnes of WEEE diverted from landfill. The Irish public have supported the WEEE system and have fully utilised the network of free collection facilities and take-back options available to them. In so doing, they have played an important\u00a0role in eradicating the visible blight on our countryside and towns caused by waste fridges and washing machines and other electro-scrap.<\/p><p>More than 300 people are employed in Ireland in direct connection with WEEE collection, recycling and treatment activity and 65% of all WEEE collected in Ireland is recycled by treatment facilities in Ireland. The introduction of the WEELABEX requirements into Irish WEEE legislation requires producers with obligations in Ireland to work with recyclers that are certified to the highest standard in the WEEE industry. This has had the effect of raising standards in the WEEE system in Ireland generally with domestic processing plants for small mixed WEEE, lamp recycling and television and monitor recycling in operation all of which have achieved WEELABEX certification.<\/p><p>While repair and re-use of WEEE is already well developed in Ireland, particularly in the social economy sector, the key to re-use organisations developing further is access to quality product, a fact acknowledged in the Irish WEEE legislation. Our legislation provides for such access in a co-ordinated and efficient manner for approved re-use organisations, who under our domestic WEEE Regulations now have a legal right to access WEEE from producer&rsquo;s designated collection hubs.<\/p><p>There are a number of key social, economic and environmental benefits to be gained from the development of a strong re-use marketplace in Ireland and re-use of WEEE is consistent with EU and Irish strategies, policies and directives towards a more sustainable future and circular economy. I am satisfied that we have created the appropriate regulatory environment \u00a0to facilitate WEEE re-use and look forward to working with all stakeholders who wish \u00a0to play a full and active role in realising the potential of this market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700074#WRT01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Semi-State Bodies Remuneration","counter":720,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700074#WRT01950"},{"type":"question","counter":721,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[35882\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700074#WRT02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"to set down in tabular form the details of all pension top-ups paid in respect of chief executives of semi-State companies under the aegis of his Department, including the name of the organisation, the name of the chief executive, the amount of the top-up, the date of payment and whether the top-up was approved by his Department, in each of the years 2011 to 2016 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As part of the organisation&rsquo;s resource plan, Enterprise Ireland launched a Voluntary Leaving Programme in November 2014, which closed in January 2015.  Fifty-one staff availed of the Voluntary Leaving Programme in 2015 and 2016.  The reform agenda included an ongoing process to analyse the skills and capabilities of the organisation.  Recruitment has been ongoing within the agency to address critical gaps in the management structure and current skill gaps in emerging and future sectors to reflect the needs of Irish industry.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, I secured additional pay monies which will provide for 50+ new posts for the Department and its agencies to respond to Brexit and to work with companies to help them respond to the challenges and opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has a critical contribution to make in my Department&rsquo;s overall strategic response to Brexit.  Therefore, Enterprise Ireland will create 39 new posts in 2017 in targeted overseas markets including in the UK and also in Dublin, to prepare companies at home and in market to manage the challenges that arise as a result of Brexit.  This immediate need is aligned with Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing strategic objective to diversify Ireland&rsquo;s export trade by supporting clients to continue to sustain and win new business in existing markets while exploring opportunities in new markets.<\/p>  <p>  New posts will be created in a number of overseas markets where Enterprise Ireland and their client companies see strategic opportunities.  It will be hugely important to intensify export growth to other markets, to reduce reliance on the UK, re-orienting companies towards North America, Canada, Asia and the Middle-East.  On foot of 2015 export figures, there is immediate opportunity and potential for strengthening our foothold in existing established markets and for diversified export growth.  Last year sales to North American grew by 27%, Northern Europe by 8% and Asia-PAC by 11%.<\/p>  <p>  The additional staff placed in the UK will provide market expertise in support of clients dependent on the UK market, to help them sustain existing sales and to win new business.  Some 1500 Enterprise Ireland client companies have recorded exports to the UK and it will remain a priority market for many Irish exporters, particularly first-time exporters.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to additional staff in Dublin, the experience of the Department, through Enterprise Ireland, is that those clients who are more prepared before entering the market and engaging with in-market Enterprise Ireland teams, have a greater chance of sustained success.  To maintain and grow market share in the UK and broaden the global exporting figures, companies need to be more competitive and innovative.  For Enterprise Ireland, that means proactive engagement with clients in delivering their suite of programmes, such as LEAN, innovation and R&amp;D projects, management and leadership capability as well as sales and marketing and export diversification strategies.  This suite of supports will help companies reduce supply-chain costs and increase efficiencies as a means of improving operating margins, building market share and creating new market opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  Enhancing EI&rsquo;s Irish based team will increase client preparedness before they enter the market and ensure that the resources in market are being used strategically and to best effect.<\/p>  <p>  Other key elements of the 2017 Enterprise Ireland strategy include an enhanced programme of trade and investment missions and other trade promotional events and the rollout of EI&rsquo;s new &lsquo;Global Ambition Campaign&rsquo; which will promote Irish companies and their products and services to international buyers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700075#WRU03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Law","counter":767,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700075#WRU03500"},{"type":"question","counter":768,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[35665\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700075#WRU03600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will extend the expiry date as provided under section 279(2) of the Companies Act 2014 to enable qualifying companies to use the United States of America's generally accepted accounting principles financial reporting standard here following the recent public consultation; if so, the timetable for this; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":769,"content":"<p>Section 279 of the Companies Act 2014 provides that in limited cases for a particular transitional period, US Accounting Standards may be used by certain companies.

That ambition must be maintained despite any turbulence in international developments.  If anything, the result of the UK referendum has placed an increased emphasis on re-doubling our efforts. At the same time, I know that the UK referendum result requires specific policy responses in parallel with the implementation of Enterprise 2025. My Department and others across government are taking action. The enterprise development agencies are working closely with companies to provide the support and advice needed. As part of Budget 2017 I secured additional resources for the Department and its agencies, with up to 50 additional staff to be provided to secure our ambitious indigenous exports, inward investment and jobs growth targets. My focus remains on achieving the Government&rsquo;s ambition of having an extra 200,000 at work by 2020. Details of action taken to date were provided in my earlier reply to a related question (REF 34327\/16, question number 332 of November 10th 2016). <\/p>  <p>  In light of the foregoing, and notwithstanding the challenge facing us, I do not anticipate any revision to Enterprise 2025, or its ambition, at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700076#WRV00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement","counter":777,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700076#WRV00550"},{"type":"question","counter":778,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[35701\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700076#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her plans to ensure a full debate takes place in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in relation to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, trade deal with Canada with special focus of the investor state dispute settlement, which permits and empowers foreign companies to sue sovereign governments when laws are enacted nationally which interfere or restrict such companies projected unearned profits; if the Government is rejecting this private court system; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

CETA is a comprehensive and progressive trade agreement between the EU and Canada.  It removes over 99% of tariffs that currently hinder trade between the EU and Canada.  It is expected to increase bilateral trade by &euro;12 billion per year, and to generate growth and new jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the position taken by Ireland and other Member States, the Commission submitted CETA to the Council for decision as a mixed Agreement.  That is one requiring both EU and individual Member States ratification.  As this process may take a number of years to complete the Agreement provides for provisional application.  The Agreement has now been signed so the next step is the ascent of the European Parliament. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that investment protection and investment dispute settlement provisions have been excluded from the provisional application of the Agreement.  This means these provisions will not come into being until voted for by the D&aacute;il and every other Member State according to their constitutional requirements.  <\/p>  <p>  The EU and Canada have also agreed a legally binding Joint Interpretative Instrument that has been added to CETA to provide further assurances in relation to public services, labour rights, environmental protection and investment.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government does not propose to seek an opinion from the European Court of Justice on the legality of the Investment Court System in CETA under EU law.  The Deputy will be aware that the opinion of the ECJ has already been sought in relation to the EU Singapore Free Trade Agreement and the outcome of this case is awaited.  <\/p>  <p>  CETA and the EU&rsquo;s other trade agreements help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.  Ireland stands to gain substantially from this Agreement and I am looking forward to Irish firms enjoying the benefits and new opportunities as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700076#WRV00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Semi-State Bodies Remuneration","counter":781,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700076#WRV00825"},{"type":"question","counter":782,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[35885\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111700076#WRV00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the details of all pension top-ups paid in respect of chief executives of semi-State companies under the aegis of her Department, including the name of the organisation, the name of the chief executive, the amount of the top-up, the date of payment, and if the top-up was approved by his department in each of the years 2011 to 2016 to date, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":783,"content":"<p>Enterprise Ireland is the only Semi State Company under the aegis of my Department to pay a pension top up to it CEO during the period in question.
