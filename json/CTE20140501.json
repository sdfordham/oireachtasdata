We have now received a response from all of the public bodies which provide funding to Rehab.  In summary, the position of the public bodies concerned is that other than where data protection provision applies, the information is deemed commercially sensitive or a legal arrangement has been entered into which contains confidentiality clauses, they see no impediment, legal or otherwise, that would prevent all public bodies from supplying full information they hold to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Those letters will be published on our website today.<\/p><p>  In addition, the committee wrote to Mr. Flannery and Ms Kerins seeking their voluntary co-operation with the committee in its ongoing examination of the expenditure of the public funding that goes into Rehab, which in 2013 amounted to &euro;95.5 million.  A reply was received from the solicitor acting for Mr. Flannery and the solicitor acting for Ms Kerins late yesterday evening.  These have been circulated to members and are before the committee today in order to deal with them.  I do not have to go into the detail of these letters except to say that the committee will issue a reply rejecting the allegations contained in both letters.  While Ms Kerins has stated that she has not ruled out appearing again before the committee, it is clear from the tone of both letters that they do not accept the Committee of Public Accounts has a right to examine any matters relating to Rehab or the expenditure by it of public moneys, which in 2013 amounted to in excess of &euro;95 million.  They also wrote that we should confine ourselves to examining the public bodies that supplied the funding.  They are entitled to their views, but we see the expenditure of public money as falling within our remit.<\/p><p>  In that regard, and as it now appears that the committee needs the powers of compellability in order to conclude its examination, I propose that we agree to proceed to that stage by placing a request before the D&aacute;il Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, in accordance with Part 7 of the 2013 Act.  The clerk to the committee informs me that a draft of the application has been prepared and is with our legal advisers.  Once that submission has been subjected to legal scrutiny, it can then be submitted.  Members may wish to comment on the two letters received.  However, I wish to get agreement that we should proceed immediately to compellability on the basis of the draft proposal for CPP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014050100004#C01300","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1398935100,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I fully agree with the Chairman.

On the letter received from Dore &amp;amp; Company Solicitors on behalf of Mr. Flannery, all I can say is it contains allegations that some members of the committee, which could include me, have acted without lawful jurisdiction and abused their powers.  I take offence to that remark that I may have ever done that at this committee.  As I have said previously in regard to the correspondence from this individual, it has amounted to the most blatant attack on the powers of an Oireachtas committee by any person of standing in Irish society to block an Oireachtas committee in its work.  The allegations against us, individually and collectively, are a disgrace and I reject out of hand that at any stage I have abused my power as a member of this committee.  I am sure other members will feel the same, but I must state that for the record.  I have never seen such an effort by an individual in Ireland to go to such lengths to not appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.

I fully support what was said in this regard.  It is utterly absurd for us to get a letter of this sort when we are simply seeking to make people who have handled public money come in to us and account for it.  We are not seeking to witch-hunt anybody at all.  As Deputy O'Donnell said, it is not personal.

Some of that money went to deal with the issues that arose and that we dealt with over the last two meetings.  We have a right within our remit to pursue the &euro;95 million referred to and how it was spent.  It is as simple as that.

It is a matter that needs to be dealt with and we need to conclude our business on it.  <br\/>The matters that have been brought to our attention through the legal process are just delaying that.

As regards the compellability powers we are seeking - I know it is not for any named individuals - are we looking into Rehab or the entire charities sector?  About two months ago, I asked for a letter to be issued to each of the 25 other charities that have each received over &euro;5 million in funding from the HSE, to find out details about senior executive pay and related matters.  I understand from the last meeting that most, if not almost all, of those have been received.  We have not had sight of those 25 letters back yet.  It is quite possible that there might be nothing in them but it is also possible that there may be some things in those other organisations of a scale, nature or on the same lines as happened in the CRC or Rehab.  I do not know.  I would not like us to go for compellability in respect of Rehab.  We should also ascertain if, in respect of the 25 letters referred to, there are two or three for which we would like similar powers.<\/p><p>  We are not here because of Rehab.  We started with the section 38 hospitals and moved on to the section 39 organisations that received substantial funding for contracts for work done.

We are looking at the full charities sector, as Deputy O'Donnell said.  I would like to get to the end of that even if it takes a while.  We started with a lot of good work shining a light where it had never been shone before in some of these organisations.

Around two-thirds of the expenditure was funded by the Exchequer through the Vote for Social Protection, and one third by social insurance contributions.  Chapter 16 presents a consolidated view of the expenditure funded by the Vote and the Social Insurance Fund, as well as the trends in the main categories of expenditure.  The Department has undertaken that, in future, a consolidation will be published with the appropriation account of the Vote.  This will improve the transparency and accountability about the cost of schemes.<\/p><p>  PRSI contributions provide the main source of income for the Social Insurance Fund.  Since 2008, the contributions received each year have been insufficient to meet the annual expenditure of the fund.  Initially, surpluses accumulated over a number of years were used to fund the deficits but since 2010, the Exchequer has met the shortfall.  This Exchequer subvention is provided through the Vote and amounted to just over &euro;2 billion in 2012.  In addition, as provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012, a sum of &euro;300 million was advanced from the Central Fund in December 2012 to meet a temporary cashflow shortfall arising from the timing of PRSI receipts.  This advance was repaid to the Central Fund before the end of 2012.  <\/p><p>  I have given a clear audit opinion on both the appropriation account of the Vote and the financial statements of the Social Insurance Fund.  However, I have drawn attention to a number of matters in each certificate. <\/p><p>  Note 6.5 of the Vote discloses four cases of possible misappropriations by staff of the Department, with a total estimated loss of &euro;1.3 million.  My audit certificate draws attention to the Department&rsquo;s response to those cases which is outlined in the Accounting Officer&rsquo;s statement on internal financial control.  The response includes the assignment of additional staff to the Department&rsquo;s internal control support unit and more rigorous monitoring by the unit of controls at local level.  The 2013 audit will examine the extent to which these enhancements have been implemented. <\/p><p>  In my audit certificate on the Social Insurance Fund, I have drawn attention to ongoing control deficiencies in relation to bank reconciliations and the procedures for confirming balances due to An Post.  These issues have been referred to in the audit certificates for recent years and were previously examined by the committee when it considered Chapter 39 of the 2010 report.  The statement on internal financial control for the fund outlines the actions being taken by the Department to resolve these issues.  <\/p><p>  The issue of the level of irregular scheme payments is referred to in the audit certificates for both accounts. Irregular scheme payments arise where welfare recipients are paid amounts to which they are not entitled or which exceed their entitlements.  Such payments can arise from administrative error by Departmental staff or from claimant error or fraud.  Fraud and error surveys of welfare schemes carried out by the Department potentially provides a basis for estimating the level of irregular payment.  Based on the results of the surveys, I consider that there was a material level of payment in excess of entitlement in 2012 on the Vote and on certain Social Insurance Fund schemes.  <\/p><p>  Chapter 17 presents the results of the latest fraud and error surveys as well as the findings of an examination of the survey process applied in the four most recent surveys.  These related to disability allowance, one-parent family payments, child benefit and jobseeker's benefit.  As well as an estimate of the overall scheme loss, these surveys now also provide an estimate of the overall net loss to the Department, which takes account of the fact that claimants found to be in receipt of excess payments on a scheme may instead be entitled to payment under a different scheme or may become a dependent on another person&rsquo;s entitlement.  The estimated net Departmental loss for three of the schemes was significant at 4.1% for disability allowance, 2.7% in the case of one-parent family and 1.6% for jobseeker's benefit.<\/p><p>  The fraud and error survey process is resource intensive but the results provide valuable information about the underlying level of payments in excess of entitlement and the risks associated with particular schemes.  For this reason, they should be developed and enhanced.  The examination of the survey process found that, in general, the surveys were carried out in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s procedures.  There were, however, a number of technical areas identified where improvements could be made that would improve the efficiency of the process and increase the reliability of the results. <\/p><p>  Chapter 18 examines the trends in recorded overpayments, as well as the level of legal action related to debt recovery.  Overpayment debt outstanding amounted to &euro;375 million at the end of 2012.  Overpayments of &euro;97 million were recorded in 2012, some of which related to excess payments spanning more than one year.  Overpayments of &euro;54 million were recovered in 2012 which represented 13% of the debt recorded for recovery.  We found that the Department&rsquo;s overpayments recording system is not effective as a debt management tool and cannot produce all the information necessary to monitor the effectiveness of debt management.  I understand that the Department expects to have a new debt management system in place before the end of this year.  <\/p><p>  Chapter 19 presents the results of an audit of the domiciliary care allowance scheme.  The allowance is payable to carers of children under 16 years who have a severe disability and require constant care and attention,  substantially in excess of that required by another child of the same age.  Responsibility for administration of the scheme transferred to the Department from the Health Service Executive in 2009.  Total expenditure in 2012 was &euro;102 million.  In addition, recipients of the allowance have automatic entitlement to the respite care grant resulting in associated expenditure of a further &euro;45 million.<\/p><p>  At April 2013, the average time taken to process an application for domiciliary care allowance was eight weeks.  Around 5,000 applications for the allowance are received each year.  For the period 2010-12, the initial decision on applications was to disallow over 60% of cases.  A high proportion of cases disallowed are appealed with around 2,100 appeals each year.  In just over 60% of the appeals cases resolved in 2012 the allowance was granted either as a result of a decision by the appeals officer or a prior revised decision by the deciding officer.<\/p><p>  Around 70% of the cases in payment were originally processed by the HSE.  The Department did not receive case files from the HSE for the transferred cases and has little information on the medical eligibility of those cases.  Medical review of cases is a key control in determining ongoing eligibility but no programme of reviews for those cases had been put in place.  An examination by the Department in early 2012 of a random sample of the transferred cases found that up to half could be ineligible.  Around 50% of cases put in payment by the Department and reviewed in 2010 and 2011 were also found to be no longer entitled to the allowance.  A review of the scheme policies and processes was announced in May 2012 and all medical reviews were suspended pending completion of that scheme review.<\/p><p>  The recommendations of the review group were brought to Government in April 2013 and their report was published.  The recommendations are set out at Annex A of the chapter.  The Department is implementing the recommended administrative changes and the policy recommendations will be considered in forthcoming budgets.  The Accounting Officer will be able to brief the committee on the current status of the recommendations and on the recommencement of medical reviews in domiciliary allowance cases.<\/p><p>  The results of an audit of the invalidity pension scheme are set out in Chapter 20.  Invalidity pension is payable to those who are incapable of work because of illness and who have sufficient social insurance contributions or credits.  In 2012, &euro;603 million was paid to around 50,000 claimants.  In 2012, there were 11,500 applications for the pension which is almost 50% more than in 2008.  Over 60% of claims decided in 2012 were either disallowed or withdrawn.  The number of appeals received doubled between 2011 and 2012 to 4,700.  Three quarters of appeal cases resolved in 2012 resulted in a revised decision.<\/p> <p>A person may no longer be entitled to invalidity pension if they recover the capacity to work.  Therefore, medical review of cases is a key control.  Departmental procedures require that a medical review status is assigned to all approved claims.  That status indicates whether or not the claim should be reviewed in the future and, if so, when that review should take place.<\/p><p> Some 5,800 or 12% of the claims in payment were found to have no review status recorded.  The Department has indicated that due to resource constraints it has not been possible to review all cases as scheduled.  The Department examined a sample of 170 cases to assess the risk of ineligibility.  At mid 2013, it estimated that approximately one in ten of the sample cases were no longer eligible for payment.  The Department indicated that it is examining ways to increase its capacity to carry out medical reviews.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014050100010#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1398939300,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Thank you.

As well as examining the Appropriation Account for the Department of Social Protection and the Social Insurance Fund statutory account for 2012, I understand that the committee wishes to examine the five chapters relevant to the Department that were in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Annual Report for 2012.  As requested, last week I provided the committee with an update on the recommendations contained in the five chapters, together with up to date expenditure figures, the provisional outturn for 2013 and estimates for 2014.<\/p><p> When I last appeared before this committee in July 2013, I briefed it on the three key functions of our Department - income support, activation of those of working age and control of fraud and abuse.  Our work continues on all three streams.  In seeking to realise our ambitions in each of these areas, we are mindful that this is, and will continue to be, a balance in terms of engagement with our customers and deployment of our resources.<\/p><p>  The Department's Customer Charter and Action Plan 2013-2015, published in 2013, sets out our commitments to delivering an excellent standard of service to all our clients.  The issue of delays in processing claims has been a cause of concern to some members of the committee.  Over the course of the past year we have worked to ensure that backlogs are cleared and that services are delivered to a high level to customers of the Department, particularly in the areas of illness and disability related payments and family income supports.  I am also pleased to report that the Department now has 44 Intreo offices in place.  These are one-stop shops for jobseekers with access to both income and employment supports.  It is planned that the full Intreo service will be rolled out to all of the Department's offices by the end of 2014, which I know will be challenging.<\/p><p>  The Intreo service is a new way of doing business for the Department.  The service offers employment services and supports for jobseekers and brings together income support and activation in a meaningful way for customers.  In the context of the Intreo service, we have made significant efforts to develop our relationship with employers, particularly through offering practical assistance and support in regard to the recruitment of staff from the live register.  This is an area of business that we will continue to grow and develop over the coming years.<\/p><p>  I will now move on to the chapters in the report.  As chapter 16 of the comptroller's annual report outlines, the Department spent &euro;20.1 billion in 2012 on welfare and employment schemes.  The comparative provisional spend for 2013 is &euro;19.6 billion and the estimate for 2014 is &euro;18.9 billion.  These figures exclude expenses incurred on the administration of the schemes which was in the order of &euro;600m in 2012.  The number of recipients of weekly payments from the Department at end 2013 was 1.47 million which was at the same level as in 2012.  This was because increased pensioner and employment support claimants balanced the fall of 40,000 in working age income support claimants.  An increase of 7,000 claimants was also recorded in the illness, disability and caring programme, mainly due to elimination of backlogs in these schemes in the period 2012-13.<\/p><p>  A range of measures are employed by the Department to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised and that its control activity is focused appropriately.  Over the past number of years, fraud detection and control systems have been refined and enhanced.  The progress and achievements include the roll out of the public services card, PSC, which acts as a key tool in the prevention and detection of identity fraud and provides an enhanced level of assurance as to a person's identity.  To date, approximately 660,000 cards have been issued, including 140,000 PSC free travel variants; a number of legislative provisions have been introduced to strengthen the Department's capacity to tackle abuse; systematic and regular data matching exercises on both internal systems and with external agencies are ongoing; and the Department is now in a much better position to recover overpayments through increasing the contribution from persons on social welfare and by way of notice of attachment to earnings and money held in a financial institution.<\/p><p>  Looking to the future, the Department published its new compliance and anti-fraud strategy for 2014 to 2018 last week.  A copy of the new strategy has been provided to the committee along with my briefing paper.  A key aspect of the new strategy is the harnessing of the potential of risk analytics to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our current control activity.  This will involve the statistical analysis of large amounts of data to uncover complex patterns which will be used for predicting future risks.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Department's requirements in regard to debt management have evolved and expanded significantly in recent times particularly with the enhancements in debt recovery legislation.  It is now in the process of developing a new, more robust and reliable system to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the Department's debt management functions.  Development of the new system will enable the Department to deliver its debt management objective, which is an integral part of our overall deterrent approach.  In addition, the Department has committed to deliver the requirements in relation to debt management identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p>  Chapter 19 deals with domiciliary care allowance, DCA, and I know that this support is a very important one for the parents and guardians who currently receive it in respect of some 27,400 children.  The comptroller's recommendations in regard to obtaining evidence in support of claims and the need to have a standard medical review process are accepted.  The Department is making the necessary preparations to ensure that medical eligibility and entitlement reviews recommence in Quarter 2 of 2014.  The committee will be aware that the Minister initiated a review of the operation of the DCA scheme in 2012 and the new review arrangements take cognisance of the administrative recommendations included in that report.<\/p><p>  In chapter 20 the comptroller recommended that medical review status should be assigned to all invalidity pension cases and that as far as possible medical reviews should be carried out as scheduled.  The Department is conscious that there is a need to increase the numbers of medical control reviews carried out on invalidity pensioners in order to ensure that they continue to meet the medical criteria for the scheme.  The ability to achieve this is dependent on the capacity of medical assessors to carry out this control work.  The committee will be aware from the briefing I provided that the Department is continuing its efforts to increase its capacity to carry out medical reviews and that this is a particular challenge for us.  In this context and in an effort to maintain customer service levels, priority has been given to new claim assessments, reviews of new claims disallowed on medical grounds and appeals against decisions to disallow new claims.<\/p><p>  I wish to acknowledge the support and co-operation of all staff of the Department of Social Protection in our efforts to deliver and continually improve our services.  It is through their ongoing commitment to customer service that we have successfully implemented so many positive changes to date.  I am very happy to discuss any issues or proposals raised by the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014050100011#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1398939300,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Thank you.

There was some media coverage last year about the Department of Social Protection providing information on pension payments, which enabled the Revenue Commissioners to examine the tax compliance of people in receipt of those payments.  Similarly, in 2012, we received new data from the Revenue Commissioners on people who had money on deposit in financial institutions which attracted a payment of interest that certainly indicated that those deposits were substantial.  We received that information in respect of people who were in receipt of means-assessed payments from the Department of Social Protection.<\/p> <p>Through that matching exercise we were able to focus on, identify and send for investigation cases in which it appeared means had not been disclosed to us.

We have been enhancing our ability to do this in recent years.<br\/>The high level group established four or five years ago set up a sub-group to see if there were other data sets we could exchange regularly.  We exchange significant data, for example, when somebody takes up employment and the employer or employee registers for tax, we receive notification of the commencement of employment which enables us to match and minimise the risk of overpayment.  We have considerably enhanced our ability internally to take that data and match it on a real-time basis across all of our means-assessed payment schemes.

Is Ms O'Donoghue in a position to indicate the number of jobs that have been created for people who went on this scheme?  What percentage of such individuals return to the live register?  There is a specific issue with T&uacute;s in that when one accepts a placement on it, one becomes an employee.  As a result, one is obliged to pay employees' PRSI.  There are people who are married with children and who are in receipt of larger social welfare payments of &euro;400 plus per week.  If they go on T&uacute;s schemes - many of them have the urge to do so when asked - they receive an additional &euro;20 per week but they actually come out with less money because they are obliged to pay the universal social charge, USC, and PRSI.  That is unfair and it would not happen if they were on community employment, CE, schemes.

The application of the taxation system to individuals such as those to whom she refers is no different than it would be to people in public or private employment who are earning that amount of money.  This comes down to a decision made by Government previously in respect of PRSI and the disallowance relating thereto.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, JobBridge is an internship programme.  It is designed to give people work experience, in the first instance, and encourage employers to consider the appropriateness of creating new jobs.  An evaluation carried out by Indecon shows that progression rates from JobBridge into employment are extremely high in comparison to those which obtain in other European states.  In the region of 51% of interns move directly into employment.  After a period of five months, this increases to 61%.  Those jobs may not necessarily be with the employers with whom the people involved served their internships.  Obviously, however, the objective behind JobBridge of providing work experience has legitimate currency in the labour market.<\/p> <p>If one looks across Europe, that is a hugely positive outcome for JobBridge when compared with the types of internship programme that exist in other countries.<\/p><p> The Deputy's third question pertained to the Gateway scheme.  There is no doubt that Gateway has been much slower in terms of the Government's intention to provide for a significant number of placements.  I believe the original target in 2014 was 3,000 placements.  New arrangements now have been put in place, as well as new dialogue regarding governance of that scheme to try to remove any impediments that might have existed or any confusion regarding access to the scheme.  I am pleased to report that as of today, 177 participants are employed on the scheme and more than 250 job offers are pending.   The target we had was to have 1,200 placements by mid-year, and with those numbers, this obviously is extremely ambitious.  However, we are working hard to try to achieve that.  Obviously, it involves working with partner local authorities and trying to ensure that all the different parameters are teased out in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014050100015#O04200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1398942300,"counter":358,"content":"<p>While I appreciate the Department might not achieve its target by the middle of the year, is the Secretary General hopeful that it will be achieved by the end of the year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014050100016#P00200","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398942300,"counter":359,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

This was particularly in the context of jobseeker payments.  Part of the reason was that there was greater assurance with regard to the presence of the individual in the country, and there was the potential for better identity checks.  The payments that go to people via EFT primarily tend to be what would be considered low-risk payments.  More often than not, they are pensions - that is, contributory State pensions - child benefit in many but not all cases, disability payments and invalidity payments.

The Deputy may appreciate that up to about two years ago we operated on the basis of what was called an employment action plan where there was a mechanism for referral of people who presented for unemployment that after three months on the live register they were referred to F&Aacute;S at the time and consideration given to whether employment support or training was required.  That was a very blunt instrument in so far as that referral was done after three months regardless of the skills, background or experience of the individual who presented.<\/p><p>  What has changed in the last couple of years is that we have introduced what we call a profiling model.  This is a model that was developed with the ESRI to actually look at what are the kind of indicators of the potential for somebody to exit the live register of their own volition or what degree of support.  It is probability of exit from the live register.  It is called a PEX score.<\/p><p>  In 2012, we started profiling new applicants and, really, the thrust under the original Pathways to Work document and mandate that were given by Government was to try and prevent a drift into unemployment by engaging with people early and looking to identify people who needed support to a greater extent, and referring them early for such support.  What Pathways to Work did was shift the emphasis somewhat to the long-term unemployed.  I am glad to say that in the course of 2013, working with the ESRI, we have profiled the entire stock of long-term unemployed that exist on the live register and we are now engaging through the Intreo service with this cohort.  The whole thrust of that is to find out what their previous experience and vulnerabilities and needs are and to develop a personal progression plan with them that is absolutely tailored to their particular needs.  It is a combination of engaging with them, as part of a group in the first instance, to give some basic information about the process and structures and then, on a one-to-one basis, develop this plan.  Whether it is referral for soft-skills training or whether it is referral into a structured training programme, all of those opportunities exist.  Our case officers - we have substantially increased the number of case officers within the Department - have some funding available to them to allow for those kind of interventions, particularly for those who are in vulnerable situations or who need additional support over and above somebody who has, maybe, a professional background or work experience in the not-to-distant past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014050100017#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1398942900,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I am hearing that the integration of the F&Aacute;S side into the Department of Social Protection has embedded and is working well.

It is right.  Can the Department give me a figure for the value of the arrangements it has put in place?  Definitely in recent times I have encountered many cases in which the Department settled for a bit less than the 15% it was looking for.  Aside from what it actually collected in 2013, or its target, what was the value of the overpayments in respect of which the Department has arrangements in place for collection?  In other words, the Department might have an agreement with a person to take &euro;20 per week over two or three years to clear a debt.  The Department is happy with that.

The Department's system has obviously identified people who have been overpaid, for various reasons.  In the past, when the Department could collect only &euro;2 per week, it was not bothered going after it and it sat there.  I now see that when somebody is to receive a new payment, the Department checks immediately to determine whether any arrears are due.  That is fine.  I have dealt with cases of people who received overpayments, perhaps through FIS or another scheme, or perhaps because their spouses got some part-time work that would have made them ineligible.  I have seen cases where, although X thousand euro might have been due during an individual's working life, the Department waited until he or she applied for the State contributory pension before reclaiming it.  An individual might be identified by the Department as owing &euro;3,000, yet it does not recoup it until the individual hits pension age, at which time he or she is on a reduced income.  Individuals ask why the money was not taken from them by the Department when they were working and could afford it rather than when they reached 66.  One can believe what one likes about whether the overpayments were forgotten about or whether it was hoped the matter would not be noticed.

These workers say they are registered tradesman but cannot work on a particular site.

When the legislation relating to the local property tax was  introduced, arrangements were put in place where it could be deducted through a person's employer.  Employers are required under legislation to give a statement at the end of the year regarding the amount deducted.  There are arrangements in that legislation that specifically say that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is obliged by law to give a statement at the end of the year to people who make their payments for the local property tax from moneys received from the Department.  When it comes to the 22,971 people who pay through the Department of Social Protection and who are probably by definition people on the lowest income level, there is no requirement in the legislation for a receipt or statement to issue automatically to these people at the end of the year.<\/p><p>  I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance some time ago relating to the cases I mentioned.  I was informed that this decision was made after consultation with the Department of Social Protection so I want to know why the 22,971 people who are paying &euro;6 million through the Department this year are the only people in Ireland who are not getting an automatic receipt for their local property tax.  I think this was bad service on the part of the Department.  It probably felt there was a cost involved and that people could request a statement of what they had paid.  That is not the point.  Everybody else gets it automatically from Revenue, their employer or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Everyone else is covered.  The Department of Social Protection was involved in the decision not to give the receipt to its customers unlike every other customer in Ireland.  The Department was not treating its customers fairly.  I would ask Ms O'Donoghue why this is the case and whether the Department would not reconsider at least giving people an annual statement because people forget.  Three or four years on, a person might die, the question of whether he or she paid the local property tax arises, people scramble around the place and there is no evidence, proof or receipt in the box or cupboard at home while a receipt or at least an annual statement is issued for every other payment of the local property tax.  Could Ms O'Donoghue comment on that because I have felt that it is unfair and have said that I would raise it with her?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014050100019#S00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398944100,"counter":453,"content":"<p>As part of putting arrangements in place for the local property tax, we were asked to act as agents for the Revenue Commissioners in terms of collection.

There is no doubt that particular difficulties arise in certain areas of the country, but these difficulties have more to do with the supply of housing than the level of rent supplement provided.  At one stage the Department was heavily criticised for the level of rent supplement in that it was driving rents and playing a disproportionate role in the rental market.  Approximately 78,000 people are in receipt of rent supplement, which shows that it is at least working in these cases.  There is no doubt, however, that in particular areas of the country supply is a huge issue.  I am not sure that increasing rent supplement would necessarily address the issue.  It would possibly drive rents upwards in these areas.  The supplement is reviewed on a regular basis.  It was last reviewed in the middle of 2013 and the current arrangements are scheduled to remain in place until the end of this year.  We are aware of the particular difficulties that arise.

Ms O'Donoghue probably does not have the relevant information to hand, but I will indicate the figures that I would like her to supply.<\/p><p>  There has been a reduction in the standardised maternity benefit payment.  It goes without saying the individuals affected are female.  Perhaps Ms O'Donoghue might outline the numbers and amounts involved in respect of the reductions in child benefit since 2012 and how many recipients of this payment were male.  I imagine 80% to 90% of recipients of the one parent family payment are probably female, but Ms O'Donoghue might give us the actual figure.  The one parent family payment was reduced in two respects.  The age of qualifying children has changed, which means that fewer people will qualify for the payment.  I ask for a breakdown between males and females in this regard.  The inclusion of the age of the youngest child in the equation also has a knock-on effect in that some people are not eligible for the one parent family payment, depending on the age of their children, and they are transferring to jobseeker's allowance.  I encountered several cases last summer where the income disregard for the one parent family payment was higher than the income disregard for jobseeker's allowance.  I estimated that some people had lost &euro;50 per week just by changing the title of their payments.  I understand a transition arrangement was put in place, but I ask for a breakdown of the figures, including the numbers of males and females.  The carer's respite grant was cut from &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,300.  Most of the carers I know are female.  How many males and females are in receipt of that grant?<\/p><p>  Changes were made recently to eligibility rules for the State pension in respect of the total number of contributions required over an individual's career and the average annual contribution.  These changes discriminate against women who left the paid workforce to do unpaid work.  I ask Ms O'Donoghue for an estimate of the numbers of males and females affected.  The only cases I have dealt with in my office involve women.<\/p><p>  There have also been changes to the household benefits package, including the telephone and fuel allowances.  As women live longer, there are more older women and widows in society.  More power to the women present for having a longer life expectancy than the Chairman or I might have.  However, I will not get into that debate.  All of the aforementioned changes have affected women more than men.  <\/p><p>  In respect of each of the budgets and the options for changes and impact assessments - I am leaving aside policy decisions - were gender proofing exercises conducted on these changes?  If such exercises were conducted, can we have the relevant documents?  I do not know what to say to the witnesses if gender proofing was not used in assessing the impact of cuts on different groups.  I presume these changes could have not been made in the absence of some proofing of their impacts.  I was surprised that most of the people who had come to me to complain about budgets and cuts in the Department of Social Protection were women.  Other cuts apply to men, but I am singling out the aforementioned areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014050100020#T00500","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398944700,"counter":496,"content":"<p>We will supply the data the Deputy requested.

What is of interest to me is how we got to this position, how the massive under funding of the Waterford Crystal pension scheme was allowed to happen, how we will deal with the numerous other under funded pension schemes that are discussed regularly, which probably amount to billions of euro, and how we deal with the governance of these schemes, for example, how the trustees acted and so on.

Workers, therefore, were caught by a double insolvency and the question arose in respect of the State's liability to protect their pension rights in that instance.  The court made findings that the State had an obligation and had failed in its obligation in regard to a particular directive to establish a rate at which such protection could be offered.  In terms of how that would be addressed, legislation was passed last year to address the gap that was identified by Europe.  The mechanism is now in place in terms of future proofing to ensure there is some protection for workers but, obviously, a number of companies, including Waterford Crystal, are caught in that gap between the directive and last year's legislation.  Given that it is the subject of a court case, I cannot comment on it except to say the court case is ongoing but the predominant group is the workers n the Waterford Crystal case.

Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 relate to a better focusing of the secondary purposes in the Bill.  Consequently, I propose to take them together.<br\/>Currently, in the Bill, one of the permitted secondary purposes as per paragraph (d) of the definition of secondary purposes is the carrying out of health research that is governed by an enactment or a European Act prescribed for the purposes of that paragraph.  Consistent with the objective of focusing the use of the IHI and its dataset, the intention had been that the provision should cover research that had been the subject of research ethics approval under national or EU law, for example, clinical trials or clinical investigations into medical products and medical devices.  In addition, in the future, paragraph (d) was also intended to encompass other health research that would come through the voluntary but governed research ethics approval arrangements to be provided for in the proposed Health Information Bill.<br\/>However, the legal view was that the wording was too broad to achieve the intended objective.  Hence, amendment No. 3<b><\/b>makes explicit reference to the carrying out of health<b><\/b>research that is the subject of a research ethics approval, or any cognate expression, under an enactment or European Act where the Minister has prescribed that enactment or European Act for the purposes of paragraph (d).  Amendment No. 4 relates to paragraph (g) of the definition of secondary purposes which currently refers to &quot;any processing of personal data that is in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003&quot;.  Paragraph (g) is potentially very broad and could allow the use of the IHI and the disclosure of identifying particulars beyond what is intended.<br\/>Again, consistent with our desire to control and limit the use of the IHI and its dataset, it is proposed to replace the existing paragraph (g) with a more specific provision allowing the processing of the IHI and its dataset under the Bill where required to protect or prevent injury or other damage to the health or safety of an individual; where required under the law or by order of a court; where the processing is in accordance with the Data Protection Acts; and where required for the purposes of obtaining legal advice, the purposes of legal proceeding or the purposes of, or in the course of, alternative dispute resolution procedures.<br\/>In recognition that some flexibility may be desirable, the Minister will be able to prescribe other health related processing of the IHI and its identifying particulars not already covered under secondary purposes should experience show that to be necessary.  This would only be done where, as per amendment No. 7, the Minister is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so and he or she has also consulted the Data Protection Commissioner.  Both amendments Nos. 3 and 4 have been positively discussed with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12014050100003#D01300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1398934800,"counter":606,"content":"<p>The Minister has gone some way to answering some of my concerns with regard to amendment No. 3.

I, too, have a concern about the matter which I have been very clear about and that is why we ran it by the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p><p>  I do not want to mention names but recently we had a very sad case concerning somebody who passed away.  People will know who I am talking about.  It has turned out that 113 people listed with the primary care reimbursement service share the same name.  There would not have been the same amount of hassle over the individual's medical care if she had a health identifier because the service would have known straightaway who she was and whatever.  An identifier number can remove many of the problems that people encounter and will be hugely important.  It is also a patient safety issue.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in pointed out, it is important for one to be able to look at the right file for each person.  It is the nature of any country that areas have people who share a name because families spread out.  This leads to confusion so correct identification is critically important.  For example, Toomevara is home to the O'Mara surname.  In other words, a lot of O'Maras live in the region and, therefore, an individual health identifier will greatly help to identify people.  This is also a patient safety issue.<\/p><p>  With regard the gathering of information, the patient's name, address and date of birth will be the only information on the individual health identifier register.  It simply identifies particulars.  There is no medical information and researchers will find little of value to them on the register. <\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the specific issue about private companies and pharmaceutical companies.  The law, as it stands, will not change the right to access information and it is very clear about the ethics associated with research.  Those laws will still pertain and the Data Commissioner will be very much involved.  There will be no clinical data on the register and it will only deal with identification issues.  It does not provide any rights on the usage of patient information not currently enjoyed under the legislation on data protection.  It is important to clarify that the Bill will introduce a framework for using the individual health identifier number but it does not change the existing law on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of personal health data, or the creation of medical record databases.<\/p><p>  The processing of personal health data continues to be governed by the Data Protection Acts.  The Bill has been fully discussed with the Data Protection Commissioner and is designed to ensure that individual health identifiers are associated with an individual's medical records and related medical correspondence.  This will help ensure that the individual can be uniquely and quickly identified during each engagement with the health system thus leading to better care and safety.<\/p><p>  That is the official note, but I have already said in my own words that this is about patient safety.  There is no data on the register other than identifying data; there is no medical data whatsoever.  People are right to be concerned about the matter.  I support their concerns and they are supported in the Bill.  The failure in other jurisdictions has been the idea that Big Brother can access an individual's information.  That is not the case here because we have an identifier which simply identifies a person and nothing else. <\/p><p>  I am aware about the controversy in England over the national record database belonging to the NHS, the use to which the data can be put to and the persons to whom the data can be disclosed.  This Bill is not about such databases.  The only national register to be created by the Bill are the registers to hold individual health identifiers, the providers' identifiers and related identifying particulars such as name, address, etc.  It is specifically provided in the Bill that the identifying particulars on an individual's IHI cannot contain clinical data on the individual.  I hope that I have made the issues very clear.  <\/p><p>  Further, the persons who can access the register, the purposes for which they can access the register and use the individual health identifier, and the identifying particulars in the register, are set out fully in the Bill, as indeed are the persons to whom they can disclose such information.  Therefore, I believe that there is adequate and clear protection for people.  They do not have to worry about their medical information being available on the register because no clinical data will be held on the register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12014050100004#E00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1398935400,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I wish to ask the Minister a brief supplementary question.  I do not doubt what he has assured me to be the case.  Like him, I must confidently assuage people's fears and, therefore, ask him the following again.  The Minister's amendment No. 3 is a substitute for an almost two-line provision that already exists on page 10 which states: \"[T]he carrying out of health research that is the subject of a research ethics approval ... under an enactment or European act prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph.\"  He has told me that the clinical data will not be accessible to those who are not the intended accessors to our individual needs.  How can anything other than the information be of value in \"the carrying out of health research\" as provided for in his amendment?  I am a little stumped by the amendment and did not purposely intend to labour the issue.  Today's meeting is the appropriate opportunity to get as much clarity as we possible can.  The Minister has acknowledged that he shares my concerns and that of Deputy Buttimer.  Will he consider any other provision, amendment or strengthening mechanism that would give a greater assurance to public concern about this area?  I do not doubt his intent which he explained.<\/p> <p> The Minister has read the official note.  It would be remiss of me if I did not focus on the fact that we are providing for access for health research purposes and without the clinical data I am at a loss to understand how that could be of any specific assistance.  I am sure there is an answer.   As it is not just for me, but for every citizen I ask the Minister to come back to it again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12014050100004#E00400","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1398936000,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I know that we can all have a reputation for being difficult.  I do not believe for one moment that the Deputy is being difficult.  I appreciate that he has a duty of care to the people who elected him to reassure them and I am delighted to have the opportunity to do so for the people who elected me.  The only value in this from a researcher's point of view would be to be assured they have the right person's clinical data which they could not get unless they already had consent from the person concerned.  That is the only way I see this being of any value to them, where they can be absolutely assured that this clinical data relates to a particular person.  It does not change anything under the law on research.  The current pieces of research that are ongoing, which people have a right to, is all based on the premise of having the consent of the person concerned and that does not change in any way.  Therefore, the only value this would have from a researcher's point of view is a further reassurance that they have the right person's information, that they are not looking at somebody else's information.  Let us call a spade a spade, we have had mix-ups in people's files in the past.  Who is to know, when one goes back, what one is looking at.  The system is only a further protection in many respects and it is only of value from a researcher's point of view in reassuring them.  I have the list of what is on the register - name, address, forename, date of birth, place of birth, gender, all former  surnames, mother's surname, address, nationality, personal public service number, date of birth in the case of a deceased individual, signature, photograph, and any other particulars prescribed, excluding clinical information.  It is really only an extra layer of reassurance for research purposes but from the clinical patient point of view this is hugely important for a whole host of reasons that we have already mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12014050100005#F00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1398936000,"counter":613,"content":"<p>We are on Committee Stage and still have to deal with Report and Final Stages.

Eventually the Bill disappeared.  It was supposed to clarify and update the provisions relating to eligibility to health and personal social services.  We have no such legislative provision.

This would have major cost implications and it might also compromise the privacy of the system.<\/p><p>  I have no issue with the principle of what Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is suggesting in terms of the right of people to know their IHI.  That is an absolute given.  However, to put the onus on us to ensure that everyone knows their IHI - people may not wish to know, may not need to know or may not be interested in knowing - would put additional costs upon the State which I do not believe are warranted at this juncture, especially given that we are still struggling to continue our economic recovery.

Indeed, the optimum way to convey the IHI to a person is in the health care setting, where health care workers can verify the person's identity and take the opportunity to explain the uses and value of the IHI.  It is also important to note that the Bill explicitly provides in section 11 that no one will be denied a health service to which he or she is otherwise entitled simply because they do not know their IHI, do not have an IHI or have no wish to provide their IHI or identifying particulars.<\/p><p>  This is purely a register.  It does not confer any rights or take away any rights.  Let us be clear: there is no intention in any way to discourage or prevent interested persons from being advised of their IHI.  If there are difficulties then the Minister can invoke section 5(4)(a) and introduce measures to deal directly with the specifics of any problems to enable persons to obtain their IHIs.

Presumably, the general practitioner network will need to know although I am unsure about other areas like hospital access and other health care providers.  How do we undertake to disseminate the information?  The individual health identifier will not only apply to those who are medical card holders, for example.

Specified persons include health professionals, their employees and agents, health organisations, their employees and agents, and also other bodies.  The potential number of specified persons is, therefore, very large.

While the PPSN, for example, should be a searchable element in establishing an individual's IHI, it should not be something that is universally available to any specified person accessing the register.Accordingly, the purpose of amendment No. 10 is to allow for the making of regulations to limit access to the information in the IHI register.  Such regulations will require consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner and a public interest dimension as per amendment No. 7. <br\/>Amendment No. 11, which is an amendment to section 11, arises from the same principle as the amendment to section 10.  Section 11 deals, among other matters, with the processing by the Minister and specified persons of the IHI and the related identifying particulars in the IHI register, and the disclosure by them of such information to another specified person for relevant purposes or to an authorised disclosee for secondary purposes.  It is proposed to allow the possibility, through regulations, of restricting the processing or further processing by specified persons of certain information in the IHI register and the disclosure by them of such information to other specified persons for a relevant purpose.  The notion of restricted disclosure is being additionally strengthened in respect of disclosure by specified persons to authorised disclosees by providing for the possibility that it may also extend to restricting the use of such information in regard to certain secondary purposes.  Regulations made pursuant to amendment No. 11 would involve, as per amendment No. 7, consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner and having regard to the public interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12014050100007#H01300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1398937200,"counter":651,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1398937200,"counter":652,"content":"<p>Section 10, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1398937200,"counter":653,"content":"<p>SECTION 11<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1398937200,"counter":654,"content":"<p>I move amendment No.  11:<blockquote><br \/>In page 15, to delete lines 25 to 36 and substitute the following:&quot;(b) The Minister may provide an individual's relevant information (individual) to an authorised disclosee in order to enable the authorised disclosee to process that information for a secondary purpose.<br \/>(c) Subject to <i>paragraph (d)<\/i>, a specified person may, for a relevant purpose, process or further process an individual's relevant information (individual) that the specified person has obtained pursuant to, and in accordance with, a provision of this Act, including by providing such information to the Minister or another specified person in order to enable the Minister or other specified person, as the case may be, to process the relevant information (individual) for a relevant purpose.<br \/>(d) Subject to <i>section 3(7)(a)<\/i>and <i>(8)<\/i>,<i>paragraph (c)<\/i>does not apply to any relevant information (individuals) that falls within a class of relevant information (individuals) prescribed as a class of relevant information (individuals) to which that paragraph does not apply.<br \/>(e) Subject to <i>paragraph (f)<\/i>, a specified person may provide an individual's relevant information (individual) that the specified person has obtained pursuant to, and in accordance with, a provision of this Act to an authorised disclosee in order to enable the authorised disclosee to process the relevant information (individual) for a secondary purpose.<br \/>(f) Subject to <i>section 3(7)(b) <\/i>and <i>(c)<\/i>and <i>(8)<\/i>, <i>paragraph (e)<\/i>does not apply to any, or any combination, of the following:<blockquote>(i) any relevant information (individuals) that falls within a class of relevant information (individuals) prescribed as a class of relevant information (individuals) to which that paragraph does not apply;<br \/>(ii) a secondary purpose that falls within a class of secondary purposes prescribed as a class of secondary purposes to which that paragraph does not apply.&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12014050100007#H01700","speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1398937200,"counter":655,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1398937200,"counter":656,"content":"<p>Section 11, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1398937200,"counter":657,"content":"<p>Sections 12 to 19, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1398937800,"counter":658,"content":"<p>SECTION 20<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1398937800,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 12:<blockquote><br \/>In page 22, line 39, after &quot;service&quot; to insert &ldquo;or relevant communication&quot;.<\/blockquote>This is a drafting amendment which is designed to align section 20(1) and (2) in terms of the references they contain to relevant communication.  The purpose of section 20 is to provide that a health service provider who has been issued with a provider identifier must associate that identifier with the record of a health service provided for an individual and also use it in any relevant communication such as, for example, a referral letter from a GP to a hospital.  In that respect, the section complements section 11 which requires the IHI to be similarly applied.  This allows us to circumvent the terrible problem which sometimes arises in the context of individuals being obliged to revisit files after five or six years and not being in a position to figure out which doctor wrote what because the signatures are illegible.  On foot of this section, the provider identifier will have to be supplied and it will, therefore, be easy to determine who wrote what note and who provided particular care.<br\/>A policy objective behind the Bill is to avoid unnecessary duplication.  Accordingly, it provides that a health service provider who is a health practitioner already required under other legislation to use the registration number given to him or her by his or her professional regulatory body can instead use that number, rather than the provider identifier, in the record made of the health service provided and related correspondence.  Such a scenario would arise, for example, under section 43(8) of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 which provides that:<blockquote>A registered medical practitioner shall, as soon as may be after the person has received the certificate [of registration] referred to in subsection (5), cause the registration number stated on that certificate to be included on all medical prescriptions and all other documentation and records, whether in paper or electronic format, relating to that practitioner&rsquo;s practice as a registered medical practitioner.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12014050100008#J00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1398937800,"counter":660,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1398937800,"counter":661,"content":"<p>Section 20, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1398937800,"counter":662,"content":"<p>Sections 21 to 39, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1398937800,"counter":663,"content":"<p>Schedules 1 and 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1398937800,"counter":664,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1398937800,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for their time and courtesy.
