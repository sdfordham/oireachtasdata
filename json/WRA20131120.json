","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":29,"content":"<p>The Local Property Tax (LPT) was required to be introduced before the end of 2012 due to our Troika commitments, which meant it had to be passed by the Oireachtas before the end of the year.  The introduction of the LPT was the largest extension of the self-assessment system in its history and represents a very great legislative, logistical and administrative challenge for all concerned.  Any charge to tax has to be legislated for, and the legislation has to be in place in good time to give clarity and certainty to taxpayers and to allow for an effective administrative system to be put in place.  The task was given to the Revenue Commissioners because the Government decided that, as the body with experience in administering a wide range of taxes, Revenue was best placed to ensure that the tax was introduced successfully in a short timeframe.  <\/p><p>  Although the tax was not payable until 1 July 2013, lead-in time was required to enable Revenue to develop new systems and processes, to enable taxpayers to file returns in good time and to select a payment method which suited their circumstances, and to enable phased payments to be implemented in time for a July 2013 start.  The Government was anxious to ensure that taxpayers had the widest possible range of payment options, including phased payments, to assist them in meeting their LPT obligations. Stakeholders such as Government Departments, employers and payroll software companies who have a role in operating phased payments also needed certainty to develop their IT systems.<\/p><p>  Since the State had no comprehensive register of residential properties, it was an absolute pre-requisite that legislation was in place early to ensure that Revenue could properly obtain data from various organisations including the Local Government Management Agency, utility companies, the Property Registration Authority and various Government departments<\/p><p>  Once the legislation was in place, Revenue was able to begin in earnest the very important task of informing the public about LPT early in 2013, by explaining how the tax would operate and how it would impact on the various property owner types.  <\/p><p>  It was always a possibility that there would be some issues needing correction, and at the time of the introduction of the initial legislation I stated that I would take on board suggestions I heard during debates.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 was enacted in early 2013 which incorporated a number of changes suggested by Deputies and Senators, as well as issues which officials of Revenue and my Department advised me of.  These included more favourable treatment for certain disabled persons, for properties badly damaged by pyrite and for certain properties owned by charities, local authorities and social housing providers. Deferral of LPT was provided for additional categories of property owners  &ndash; personal representatives of deceased persons, those covered by a formal insolvency arrangement and those suffering excessive financial hardship.  In addition, the power of Revenue to enter on a person&rsquo;s property was clarified<\/p><p>   I feel the Amendment Bill gave Oireachtas Members time and opportunity to suggest changes to the legislation.  <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is fully aware, drafting errors in legislation do happen from time to time.  In the case of the exemption which was intended only to benefit first time buyers who purchased in 2013, this error, although unintended, is beneficial to a clearly definable group of taxpayers which Revenue will be able to identify.  When the error was made known to me, I decided to allow non-first time buyers to avail of the exemption, as I considered that the cost is not likely to be significant as part of the overall yield, and could provide an additional boost to the property market. <\/p><p>  I do not believe that the legislation was unjustifiably rushed, and I am satisfied that, where issues have arisen, these can be taken care of administratively, in a cost effective manner, and in the main without the need for further legislation.

The Government recognises this and has provided &euro;500 million in funding to support the stability of credit unions through restructuring and resolution. <\/p><p>  The Commission on Credit Unions provided its Report which makes recommendations on the strengthening of the regulatory framework of credit unions, including more effective governance and prudential requirements.  These recommendations are currently being implemented in the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank is continuing to work through a portfolio of approximately 100 credit unions on a case by case basis.  The programme of work to engage with such credit unions is informed by the following matters: levels of arrears, inadequate bad debt provisions, high fixed asset to total asset ratio and other supervisory concerns including weak lending practices.  The Central Bank's statistics, based on data submitted by credit unions as at 30 September 2013 show that some 20 of these 100 credit unions have reported regulatory reserves below the minimum requirement of 10 per cent of assets.  This gives rise to a capital shortfall in the region of &euro;11 million in total.  Following engagement with these 100 credit unions the outcomes can include governance changes, risk mitigation programmes, lending and other business restrictions and\/or requirements for credit unions to seek capital support. <\/p><p>  In such cases capital support may be sought through a restructuring solution under ReBo or from resources available within the credit union sector itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000071#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Corporation Tax","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000071#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[49255\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000071#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he intends to ask the corporate sector to make any extra tax contribution to assist economic recovery, particularly in the area of funding, training, education and employment programmes for young persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>My Department published updated macro-economic and fiscal forecasts with Budget 2014 on October 15th.  These projections show that Ireland remains on track to meet its obligations under the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), with an underlying general government deficit of 7.3 per cent forecast for 2013, improving to 4.8 per cent in 2014 &ndash; both figures within the deficit ceilings set by the ECOFIN Council in late 2010. Current projections show we remain firmly on track to bring our deficit below 3 per cent by 2015.<\/p><p>   Nominal GDP &ndash; the metric used for calculation of both our debt and deficit ratios &ndash; is expected to increase by 1.2 per cent this year, with the rate of growth set to pick-up to 2.9 per cent next year and to 3.7 per cent in 2015.  These growth forecasts are obviously subject to a number of risks, emanating from both external and internal sources.  However, I have been encouraged by developments of late on both fronts.  High-frequency data for the Irish economy over the third and fourth quarters so far are broadly positive and we are beginning to see increasing signs of recovery in key trading partners, with growth accelerating in both the US and UK in the third quarter.<\/p><p>  Regarding house prices, it is worth remembering that residential property prices in Dublin fell by around 60 per cent from peak to trough and residential property prices in Dublin are still 51 per cent lower than at their highest level in February 2007.  It is against this background that the recent appreciation in house prices in the capital must be assessed.  Although strong growth has been seen in recent months, it is coming off a low base.<\/p><p>  It should also be noted that the previous housing bubble was accompanied by a dramatic increase in mortgage lending.  The same cannot be said of the recent appreciation in house prices, with a large percentage of transactions taking the form of cash purchases.  Figures from the Irish Banking Federation show the value of mortgage lending for house purchase over the first three quarters of the year standing at just &euro;1.5b, or just 7 per cent of the value of mortgage lending over the same period in 2006 for instance.  The same figures also show that lending for house purchase is essentially flat over the first three quarters of this year, when compared with the same period in 2012.<\/p><p>  However, as I said in my Budget Day speech, I am aware that there are some supply limitations in certain urban areas.  In light of this I introduced several measures to help increase the supply of suitable residential housing stock as part of Budget 2014.  These included &ndash; subject to State Aid approval &ndash; the extension of the Living City Initiative, to include Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin and the broadening of eligibility criteria to include all buildings built prior to 1915.  I also introduced the home renovation incentive, which provides an income tax credit to homeowners who carry out renovation and improvement works on their principal private residences between October 25th 2013 and December 31st 2015.<\/p><p>  Finally I would point out that it is NAMA's expectation, at this juncture, that its funding will contribute about 4,500 houses and apartments in terms of new supply in the Dublin market in the period to 2015.  This is a significant output in the context of current house completion levels in Dublin. In 2012 just over 1,200 new houses and apartments were completed in Dublin.  In addition, NAMA is overseeing the rental by debtors and receivers of close to 10,000 residential properties nationally &ndash; mainly apartments in Dublin.  NAMA is also overseeing the sale of houses in Dublin by NAMA debtors and receivers and has made over 1,200 properties available to local authorities to meet demand for social housing in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000071#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Reductions","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000071#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[49073\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000071#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in the view of efforts made to make Ireland tobacco free by 2025, if he will consider lowering the VAT rate on items such as nicotine replacement therapies, and other items which aid persons giving up smoking, to a new special rate, lower than the currently affixed 23% (details supplied).

To date 79,357 primary dwelling houses (PDH) mortgages have been restructured as of June 2013 of which over 60,000 of restructured PDH accounts were deemed to be meeting the terms of their arrangement. The Central Bank has informed me that updated data for September 2013 is due for publication by the end of November.<\/p><p>  Separately from Central Bank quarterly reports, my Department is now publishing monthly data on primary home mortgage restructures put in place by the six main lenders covered by the Central Bank&rsquo;s MART.  This will place more timely information in the public domain in relation to progress by the main banks to sustainably resolve mortgages in difficulty.  The recently published data for the end of September shows that the number of PDH mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days has fallen from 82,624 to 81,156, a drop of 1,468 accounts.<\/p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for Justice has informed me that there was an initial spike in the number of Civil Bills before the courts following the passing of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 in July. However the Courts Service has indicated that, since the initial spike in issuing of Civil Bills, the situation has stabilised and there has been no further spike in the issuing of Civil Bills.  It is however important to point out that the issuing of a Civil Bill does not automatically lead to a repossession, for example a borrower who has not been engaging with his lender may reengage following the issuing of a Civil Bill and this may lead to an alternative outcome.<\/p><p>The mortgage arrears problem is a major problem that needs to be resolved for the long term economic and social health of the country and the Government has now put in place a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem  .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000072#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Data","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000072#WRC01450"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[49257\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000072#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the role he and his Department have in determining the distribution of the local property tax revenue in 2014; the reason a decision was taken to postpone the retention of 80% of the property tax in the local authority area in which it is collected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1186","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>Section 157 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, provides that, in each financial year commencing with 2014, the Minister of Finance shall pay from the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax, including any interest paid thereon, paid into the Central Fund during that year.

While significant debt was accumulated as a result of financial sector support, large underlying primary deficits (that is, the deficit net of interest payments and financial sector support) have been recorded in every year in Ireland since 2008.  These deficits were as a result of both an over reliance on construction-driven revenue which resulted in a large hole in the public finances when the property market collapsed and through increased public expenditure including on income supports.  A credible fiscal adjustment strategy was required to ensure that debt was not put on an unsustainable path. The Government fully recognises the negative short term effect on output that fiscal consolidation has and that it is a difficult balancing act between the need for consolidation on the one hand and the need to support the emerging recovery on the other. However, I believe we are getting the balance right.<\/p><p>  Through the fiscal adjustment measures that the Government has implemented, stability has been restored to the public finances, the economy is growing and jobs are being created.  Having met and exceeded all of our deficit targets to date, we remain on track to bring our deficit below 3 per cent of GDP in 2015.  A second consecutive year of growth was recorded in 2012 and the economy is predicted to grow at a modest 0.2 per cent this year. Employment grew by 1.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2013.  In line with these developments, the Live Register based unemployment rate continued to fall to 13.2 per cent in October, having peaked at over 15 per cent in early 2012. <\/p><p>  Irish sovereign yields are now at about 3&frac12; per cent, a fraction of the highs of nearly 15 per cent reached in summer 2011. This is due in no small part to successful re-negotiation of the terms of the EU-IMF programme and the promissory note deal, as well as the overall confidence in the future of economic and monetary union. However, the improvement in yields is also down to the Government&rsquo;s fiscal strategy which has seen the consistent deficit reduction. A reduced cost of borrowing for the Government reduces the interest bill which has to be paid by the taxpayer, and, over the long term serves to keep economy-wide interest rates low in order to stimulate investment. On foot on this progress and prudent debt management policies, Ireland&rsquo;s debt ratio is now expected to decline in 2014 and remain on a downward trajectory thereafter. Budget 2014 also forecasts a modest primary surplus next year. This means that, excluding debt service costs, revenues are sufficient to meet expenditures.<\/p><p>  On the issue of the cost of the banking crisis, I would ask the Deputy to note that the State has already recovered a significant portion of the cost of financial supports provided to the Irish financial sector with almost &euro;10 billion recovered to date. This has come from many sources including the disposal of ordinary shares in Bank of Ireland to private investors, the sale of contingent convertible notes that had been issued to the State by Bank of Ireland, the sale of Irish Life, coupons received on preference shares and contingent convertible notes, and fees received under both the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme and the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000073#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":83,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000073#WRD01500"},{"type":"question","counter":84,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[49196\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000073#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will establish an independent investigation into the handling by the Central Bank and the special manager of the situation at Newbridge Credit Union.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":85,"content":"<p>I am satisfied that the transfer of the assets and liabilities of Newbridge Credit Union to Permanent TSB was the correct course of action in the absence of a willing and suitable credit union transferee.

This transfer also means that Newbridge Credit Union members can be assured that they can continue to operate their loans and savings accounts as normal.

These documents provide full disclosure on the process including the many efforts made to find a credit union-based solution over an extended period of time, as well as the regulatory history and financial details regarding Newbridge Credit Union.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank papers document in exhaustive detail the level of bad practice at Newbridge over many years, which created this serious situation and which can be illustrated in the following key lending statistics:<\/p><p>  - An individual loan of &euro;3.2 million, which was in excess of the Credit Union Act restriction of a max of 1.5% of the total assets;<\/p><p>  - 52% of the loans exceed five years duration, as opposed to the maximum set out in the Credit Union Act of 20%;<\/p><p>  - The average loan in Newbridge Credit Union was &euro;17,281 as compared to the average Credit Union loan which is &euro;7,764;<\/p><p>  - There were 26 loans of an average value of &euro;550,000, which were seriously distressed.<\/p><p>  These figures illustrate that Newbridge Credit Union was operating in a very different way from a normal credit union.

","asker":"953","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p>Officials from my Department were in regular contact with the Central Bank  regarding the transfer of assets and liabilities of Newbridge Credit Union to permanent tsb, and I was kept informed of events throughout the process. My role, as Minister for Finance, in this process was as consultee and as such, I was made aware of events as they occurred. The special manager was appointed by the High Court and each extension of his term required High Court approval.   The Central Bank&rsquo;s Resolution Report sets out the level of bad practice at Newbridge credit union in the past. The Central Bank was required to meet rigorous High Court approved intervention conditions when undertaking this resolution process. It must be remembered that the cause of the problems rests with those running Newbridge Credit Union. The bad practice in Newbridge over many years can be illustrated in the following key lending statistics:<\/p><p>  - An individual loan of &euro;3.2 million, which was in excess of the Credit Union Act restriction of a max of 1.5% of the total assets.<\/p><p>  - 52% of the loans exceed five years duration, as opposed to the maximum set out in the Credit Union Act of 20%.<\/p><p>  - The average loan in Newbridge Credit Union was &euro;17,281 as compared to the average Credit Union loan which is &euro;7,764.<\/p><p>  - There were 26 loans of an average value of &euro;550,000, which were seriously distressed.<\/p><p>  These statistics demonstrate that Newbridge was very different from a normal Credit Union.  The structure of many of these loans was more akin to Development loans with &ldquo;bullet&rdquo; repayments as opposed to regular repayments.<\/p><p>  Based on Central Bank advice I am satisfied that the decision to take this course of action was the only viable option available apart from liquidation. The Central Bank advised me that, having regard to the purposes of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 and the matters set out in section 9(6) of that Act, the immediate winding up of Newbridge Credit Union was not in the public interest. The reason for this being the particular purpose of maintaining public confidence in the financial system in the State, including the protection of members&rsquo; savings in credit unions. <\/p><p>  My priority in assessing the Central Bank&rsquo;s proposal on Newbridge was to protect the savings of depositors and members of Newbridge Credit Union. Arising from the transfer members of Newbridge Credit Union will continue to have full and uninterrupted access to their savings. <\/p><p>  In line with the resolution options available to it the Central Bank undertook a process which involved the examination of possible credit union combinations. This examination resulted in an approach being made to a number of credit unions.  Ultimately, however, no credit union considered that it was in its best interests to complete such a combination, even in the context of extensive financial support. This reflected the exceptional nature of financial difficulties in Newbridge Credit Union and the relative scale of the credit union within the sector.  The Central Bank also considered proposed solutions put forward by various interested parties but none proved feasible in addressing the problems or protecting members&rsquo; savings.<\/p><p>  It was as an alternative to a possible liquidation that the Department of Finance, with the support of the Central Bank, requested Permanent TSB to undertake this transaction. The transfer of Newbridge Credit Union to Permanent TSB means that Newbridge Credit Union members can be assured that they can continue to operate their loan and deposit accounts as normal. <\/p><p>  As Minister for Finance, I agreed to the payment from the resolution fund to Permanent TSB of a financial incentive of up to &euro;53.9m to support the transfer. This was on foot of a request from the Governor of the Central Bank. The incentive includes the following:<\/p><p>  - &euro;23m in cash up-front<\/p><p>  - &euro;4.25m for restructuring and integration costs<\/p><p>  - &euro;2m for other transferring liabilities, and<\/p><p>  - a maximum additional &euro;24.7m to cover a risk share on the transferring loans whereby the State will absorb 50% of the losses where loans perform below their transfer value and 50% of the gains where they perform above the transfer value. <\/p><p>  The financial incentive provided in the Newbridge case is fully recoupable from the financial services sector over time in the form of a levy.<\/p><p><i>Royal Sun Alliance<\/i><\/p><p>  With regard to the recent developments at Royal Sun Alliance Insurance Ireland, officials from my Department held a conference call with the Central Bank on Monday 11 November to discuss the position.  Following that call, the Central Bank provided background information to the Department on the sequence of recent events and the injection by RSA Group of &euro;100m in capital to bolster its reserves, taking its solvency capital requirement to 228%.  In addition, the Central Bank provided an overview of its on-going contacts, meetings and inspections with RSA which the Central Bank conducts in its role as supervisor of insurance undertakings.<\/p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland has had an on-going programme of engagement with RSA Insurance Ireland (RSAII) since the implementation of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Probability Risk and Impact System &ndash; PRISM, as it does with all high impact companies. As part of the framework the Central Bank of Ireland engages with firms at a level that corresponds to their impact category; the higher the impact, the higher the level of engagement. Engagement involves reviews, inspections and meetings, and the frequency and level of engagement is associated with the firms&rsquo; impact<i><\/i>rating.<i><\/i>  I am satisfied that this improved regulatory framework provides for enhanced supervision of the industry and protection of the Irish consumer. With regard to RSA this programme included eight on-site inspections over a two year period and on-going meetings with key role holders such as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Finance Officer, Chief Risk Officer, etc. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000075#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Stability Mechanism","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000075#WRF00725"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[49615\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000075#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide an update regarding negotiations in relation to support from the European Stability Mechanism for retrospective recapitalisation of our banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>The Euro Area Heads of State or Government agreed in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns, and that when a Single Supervisory Mechanism, involving the ECB, is in place and operational, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) could recapitalize banks directly.    <\/p><p>  The Eurogroup meeting of 20th June 2013 agreed on the main features of the ESM&rsquo;s Direct Bank Recapitalisation (DBR) instrument.

Market confidence in Ireland is high, the public finances are under control, we are reducing our deficit and debt levels and economic conditions and sentiment are improving.<\/p><p>  In relation to the conditionality, the ESM Treaty provides that all ESM funding, including the precautionary facilities, require conditionality. The conditionality relating to any credit line would be a matter for discussion in the event that an application would be made. Article 13 (3) of the ESM Treaty states as follows;<\/p><p>  &quot;..the Board of Governors shall entrust the European Commission - in liaison with the ECB and, wherever possible, together with the IMF - with the task of negotiating, with the ESM Member concerned, a memorandum of understanding (an &quot;MoU&quot;) detailing the conditionality attached to the financial assistance facility.

The option is available for a three year period from 27 March 2013, the date that the Finance Act 2013 was passed into law.<\/p><p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that payments under the AVC access provision are taxable at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate. In that regard, however, under the legislation the administrator is obliged to deduct tax at the higher rate of 41%, unless the administrator has received from Revenue a tax credit certificate in respect of the individual. It is advisable, therefore, that if an individual is not using up any, or all, of his or her tax rate band and tax credits (for example if the individual is unemployed or in low paying employment) that he or she arranges to have a tax credit certificate issued to the administrator before draw down of the AVC payment, as this will ensure that the amount of tax deducted more accurately reflects the individual&rsquo;s circumstances. A tax credit certificate may be obtained from the individual&rsquo;s local Revenue office and will indicate the tax rate band and tax credits, if any, appropriate to the AVC access payment<\/p><p>  Where an individual considers that too much tax has been deducted from an AVC access payment, the overpayment of tax will be refunded on review. <\/p><p>  There are a number of reasons why, under existing policies, pre-retirement access to the main benefits from pension plans or schemes is not permitted, the principal one being that these arrangements (and the associated tax reliefs on contributions and pension fund growth) are designed to be long term savings vehicles based on the principle that the benefits will be &ldquo;locked away&rdquo; to help fund an adequate income in retirement. <\/p><p>  The pre-retirement access to a portion of AVCs which I introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2013 is allowed on a tax-neutral basis &ndash; the contributions were tax-relieved at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate on the way in and are taxed at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate on withdrawal. The take-up of the measure to date has not been particularly significant. I would remind the Deputy, however, that this is a measure which was designed to enable rather than incentivise individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions. It is important that individuals continue to provide for their retirement and, it would appear, most individuals with AVCs have to date decided to preserve their AVC pension savings. For these reasons, I have no plans to extend the measure beyond AVCs.<\/p><p>  The broadening of the early access to AVCs provisions did not emerge as a significant issue in the various pre-Budget submissions that I received during my preparations for Budget 2014. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000076#WRG00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Pensions Reserve Fund Administration","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000076#WRG00850"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[49673\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000076#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason it is appropriate for the National Pension Reserve Fund to be used as a source of current Government spending when persons are either denied or given very limited access to their own pension fund arrangements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>The National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) was established on 2 April 2001 under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 for the purpose of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from the year 2025 until the year 2055, or such other year as may be specified by order.   <\/p><p>  The Government has decided to establish the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) which will absorb the NPRF.

The SFT regime does not and was never intended to impact on the vast majority of ordinary workers in either the public or private sector who are on middle or lower incomes.<\/p><p>  The SFT regime addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by dealing with it at the point of pension drawdown in retirement rather than by applying restrictions to pension savings or accrual upfront. The regime achieves this by imposing a penal tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down. In this way it acts to discourage the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinds the tax advantage of such overfunding by clawing back, through the penal tax charge, the tax relief granted.<\/p><p>  The changes I am making can be summarised as follows:<\/p><p>- firstly, the absolute value of the SFT is being reduced, with effect from 1 January 2014, from &euro;2.3m to &euro;2m;<\/p><p>- secondly, the valuation factor to be used for establishing the capital value of defined benefit (DB) pension rights at the point of retirement, where this takes place after 1 January 2014, is being changed from the current standard valuation factor of 20 to a range of higher age&ndash;related valuation factors that will vary with the individual&rsquo;s age at the point at which the pension rights are drawn down;<\/p><p>- thirdly, in calculating the capital value of a DB pension at the point of retirement, transitional arrangements provide for a &ldquo;split&rdquo; calculation where part of the pension had already been accrued at 1 January 2014 so that the part accrued up to that date will be valued at a factor of 20 and the part accrued after that date valued at the appropriate higher age-related valuation factor; and<\/p><p>- finally, the reimbursement options, introduced in Finance Act 2012, for public servants affected by chargeable excess tax are being amended and extended.<\/p><p>  As occurred on the occasion of the introduction of the SFT regime in 2005, and again when the value of the SFT limit was reduced to &euro;2.3m in 2010, the legislation contained in the Finance Bill provides for an individual who has pension rights on 1 January 2014 in excess of the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m, to claim a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) from Revenue in order to protect or &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; the value of those rights on that date. This is subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m, and individuals with PFTs from 2005 or 2010 retain those PFTs.<\/p><p>  As before, the &ldquo;grandfathering&rdquo; provisions contained in the legislation reflect legal advice from the Attorney General. However, unlike previous occasions, the grandfathering arrangements this time around had to take cognisance not just of the reduction in the absolute level of the SFT from 1 January 2014, but also of the increase, from that date, in the factors for converting DB pension rights into capital value equivalents. It is for that reason, lest there be any suggestion that the changes had retrospective application, that DB rights accrued up to 1 January 2014 are to be capitalised at the existing valuation factor of 20, both for the purposes of determining if there is a PFT and for the purposes of placing a capital value on those rights at the time of retirement, where that takes place after 1 January 2014.<\/p><p>  The changes and grandfathering arrangements outlined above apply, as appropriate, to both DB and defined contribution (DC) pension arrangements in both the private and public sectors. As regards DB pension arrangements, it is irrelevant whether an individual is a higher paid civil\/public servant or a highly paid member of a private sector DB scheme, the same SFT rules apply to all such arrangements.<\/p><p>  Specifically, the new lower SFT limit will apply to both DC and DB arrangements. Those in DC pension arrangements can seek a PFT from Revenue if the capital value of their arrangements exceeds &euro;2m on 1 January 2014, subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m. If the value of their DC pension arrangements is below the SFT on 1 January 2014, their funds can continue to accumulate up to &euro;2m through further tax-relieved pension contributions and fund growth, subject to the various annual contribution and earnings limits that apply, without any risk of a chargeable excess arising. Members of DB pension arrangements can equally aspire to a maximum &ldquo;tax&ndash;relieved&rdquo; fund of &euro;2m. However, in the case of DB pension arrangements, members of such arrangements do not have individual &ldquo;earmarked&rdquo; funds (as is the case in DC arrangements) and this, coupled with the fact that the value of pension benefits in DB arrangements reflect a &ldquo;benefit promise&rdquo; based on salary and service as compared to the market value of the pension funds in DC arrangements, dictates that the capital value of pension rights arising under DB arrangements has to be determined in some other way.<\/p><p>  The SFT regime provides (and has always provided) a simple formula for this purpose. The formula essentially requires the annual amount of pension payable to an individual under the arrangement to be multiplied by a valuation or capitalisation factor in order to establish the capital value, both for PFT purposes and for the purposes of establishing the value of DB pension rights at the point of retirement. Up to now, a single valuation factor of 20 has been used for these purposes. In light, however, of the major criticism levelled at the existing SFT regime, that the fixed rate conversion factor of 20:1 was inequitable relative to DC pension arrangements given the higher market annuity rates that those with DC pension arrangements could face if they were to purchase annuities, I have moved to introduce higher age-related factors. This will substantially improve the equity between DC and DB arrangements and as between those who retire at younger ages and those who retire later in life. These are significant changes.<\/p><p>  The value of DB pension rights accrued up to 1 January 2014 will, under the grandfathering requirements, be valued for the purposes of the SFT regime at the existing factor of 20. If the capital value so determined exceeds the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m, such individuals may seek a PFT from Revenue, subject to the overall limit of &euro;2.3m referred to earlier. In such cases, additional pension benefits accrued after 1 January will be valued using the relevant higher age-related factor and will, as for DC arrangements, be fully exposed to chargeable excess tax. Where the capital value of DB rights is less than &euro;2m on 1 January, such individuals may continue to accrue pension rights up to the SFT limit but those additional rights will be valued at the relevant higher age-related factor.<\/p><p>  Whether DB or DC arrangements are involved, on each occasion that an individual becomes entitled to receive a benefit under a pension arrangement for the first time (called a &ldquo;benefit crystallisation event&rdquo; or BCE) they use up part of their SFT or PFT, as the case may be. At each BCE, a capital value has to be attributed to the benefits that crystallise and the value is then tested against the SFT or the individual&rsquo;s PFT, as appropriate, by the pension scheme administrator. For DC pension arrangements, the capital value of pension rights when they are drawn down after 1 January 2014 is simply the value of the assets in the arrangement that represent the member&rsquo;s accumulated rights on that date, in other words the value of the DC fund at the point of drawdown. In the case of DB pension arrangements, the default position is that the capital value of such rights drawn down after 1 January 2014 is determined by multiplying the gross annual pension that would be payable to the individual by the appropriate age-related valuation factor. If the DB arrangement provides for a separate lump sum entitlement (otherwise than by way of commutation of part of the pension) e.g. most public service schemes, the value of the lump sum is added to the capital value of the DB pension to arrive at the overall capital value.<\/p><p>  However, reflecting the grandfathering requirements referred to earlier, where part of the DB pension has been accrued at 1 January 2014 and part after that date, the transitional arrangements provide for the part accrued at 1 January to be valued at the factor of 20 and the part accrued after that date at the appropriate higher age-related factor.<\/p><p>  When the capital value of a BCE, either on its own or when aggregated with earlier BCEs, exceeds the SFT, or an individual&rsquo;s PFT, the excess is subject to an immediate tax charge at 41%<b>, <\/b>which<b><\/b>  has to be paid upfront by the pension fund administrator and recovered from the individual. In addition, when the remainder of the excess is subsequently drawn down as a pension (or, for example, by way of a distribution from an Approved Retirement Fund or vested Personal Retirement Savings Account) it is subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate, thus giving rise to an effective income tax rate on a chargeable excess of some 65%, excluding any liability to USC and PRSI.<\/p><p>  The Finance Bill also amends and extends the reimbursement options, introduced in Finance Act 2012, for public servants affected by chargeable excess tax who are required to reimburse the public sector pension fund administrator for the upfront payment of the tax to Revenue. Unlike affected individuals in the private sector, public servants cannot minimise or prevent the breaching of the SFT or PFT by ceasing contributions or benefit accrual. The focus of the changes is to reduce the amount that can be recovered from the net retirement lump sum payable to the individual to a maximum of 20% of the net lump sum (from 50%) and to include the option of reimbursement of the pension fund administrator solely by way of a reduction in the gross pension payable over a period not exceeding 20 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000077#WRH00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Rebates","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000077#WRH00825"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[49737\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000077#WRH00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will query a case with the Revenue Commissioners (details supplied) involving a self-employed person who believes they are entitled to an additional rebate due to a period when they had ceased trading and were on sick leave.

Germany is keen to help and specifically to find ways to reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery by improving funding mechanisms for the real economy, including access to finance for Irish SMEs. The German Government has asked KfW, the German development bank, to work with the German and Irish authorities swiftly, in order to deliver on this initiative at the earliest possible date.<\/p><p>  Officials of my Department, have already exchanged working papers on this subject with KfW and the German Ministry of Finance. We have held a consultation with the German embassy in Dublin which helped pave the way for discussions with the German Ministry which were held in Berlin yesterday and further discussions will be held with KfW and other key stakeholders over the coming weeks both here and in Germany.<\/p><p>  I am keen to see the establishment of a healthy and balanced relationship. As we are trying to ensure that any initiative that comes out of this process is as effective as it can be, we will be discussing approaches that meet the strategic objectives of both States and ultimately facilitate lending to the real economy, in particular SMEs in Ireland. This relationship may take the form of a Memorandum of Understanding or a contract or indeed we may formalise that relationship in some more appropriate fashion.<\/p><p>  KfW&rsquo;s model in Germany is to lend through commercial banks. Whereas in the case of their agreement with Spain they provided a loan to ICO, the Spanish state investment bank who then lent the funding on to the commercial banks in Spain. All appropriate options will be considered in the course of the discussions with KfW for the Irish case.<\/p><p>  KfW hold a banking licence in Germany and under the rules of the EU can passport into Ireland if this was deemed necessary without a requirement to obtain an Irish banking licence. I should note that KfW&rsquo;s IPEX bank (its Import Export Bank) notified the central bank of its intention to passport into Ireland in January 2008. However, this is unrelated to the recent announcement.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has decided to establish the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) which will absorb the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF). Using the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, we will maximise our resources to enhance growth in the Irish economy and improve key infrastructure to maintain Ireland's attractiveness as a place to do business and to create employment. Officials of my Department are currently preparing the necessary legislation which I anticipate will be enacted early next year. Already, in the lifetime of this Government, the NPRF has established funds that support both strategic projects and a number that support SME financing.<\/p><p>  Further assessment of the need to create a Strategic Investment Bank over and above the contribution expected from the ISIF will be informed by the requirements of the economy once the Government&rsquo;s key immediate objectives for the repair of the banking system have been completed.<\/p><p>  We have not set targets for any Strategic Investment Bank as its role has yet to be fully defined and due to State Aid considerations its potential market is likely to be somewhat prescribed. Experience in other countries suggests that any lending facilitated by a state investment institution like KfW or an Irish State Investment Bank is generally complementary to lending already taking place in an economy and can in fact assist commercial banks with access to cheaper credit lines such as from the European Investment Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000077#WRH02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Administration","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000077#WRH02050"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[49753\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000077#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding payment of the property tax where a house is sold in 2013, but the contract is not finalised before 1 November 2013, thereby making the vendor liable for the charge in 2014 although he would no longer own or occupy the property in that tax year; if the vendor is entitled to a refund from the Revenue Commissioners in any circumstance; if the purchaser is entitled to a refund from the Revenue Commissioners where the tax for 2014 formed part of the sale agreement on the understanding at the time that there was a liability on the property, but which is no longer the case following recent clarification from the Revenue Commissioners regarding exemptions for non-first-time buyers.

[49518\/13] and [49556\/13] on 19 November 2013, where a liable person sells their residential property between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, they will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014.  I also noted that detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and is available on the Revenue website at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i>.<\/p><p>  For a tax such as LPT to function properly, legislation must specify a liability date for the tax to have application for a particular year.  Whatever date is prescribed, the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed, and I expect that the LPT liability involved is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract.<\/p><p>  An individual selling a property will often be purchasing another property at around the same time.

This recovery has been driven by strong export growth over the period, reflecting, in part, the considerable competitiveness gains achieved in the last number of years. Inflation in Ireland has been below or on par with that of the euro area average for every month since March 2008 and the latest European Commission forecasts suggests a 22 per cent improvement in unit labour cost relative to the euro area average between 2008 and 2014.<\/p><p>  Domestic activity contracted sharply following the collapse of the property market, with domestic demand decreasing significantly between 2008 and 2012. This has had severe ramifications for the labour market with the unemployment rate increasing by around 10 percentage points over this period. <\/p><p>  However, recent indications have been that domestic demand is stabilising and is moving on to a modest recovery path. Personal consumption was up by 0.7 per cent in the second quarter and healthy retail sales in the third quarter, along with improving consumer sentiment, bode well for the second half of the year. We have also seen a return to growth in &lsquo;core&rsquo; (excluding planes) investment, with both construction and machinery and equipment growing in recent quarters.<\/p><p>  Perhaps most pertinently, employment has now increased in each of the last four quarters, with employment up 1.8 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter. In line with this, the standardised unemployment rate stood at 13.2 per cent in October, having fallen from a peak of 15.1 per cent early last year. While I would stress that more must be done to tackle the still high level of unemployment, it is clear that we are now moving in the right direction.<\/p><p>  Growth of 0.2 per cent is forecast this year, with patent expiry in the pharmaceutical sector impacting on output in Ireland. Current forecasts for 2014 are for an acceleration in the pace of economic growth, with GDP forecast to increase by 2.0 per cent. The contribution from domestic demand is expected to strengthen, which is encouraging. On the assumption of a pick-up in trading partner growth, exports are set to increase once again, although the potential for further reductions in pharma-chem output presents a notable risk to this projection.<\/p><p>  Through the fiscal adjustment measures that the Government has implemented since 2011, stability has been restored to the public finances.  Having met and exceeded all of our deficit targets to date, we remain on track to bring our deficit below 3 per cent of GDP in 2015.  <\/p><p>  Irish sovereign yields are now at about 3&frac12; per cent, a fraction of the highs reached in summer 2011. This is due in no small part to successful re-negotiation of the terms of the EU-IMF programme and the promissory note deal, as well as the overall confidence in the future of economic and monetary union. However, the improvement in yields is also down to the Government&rsquo;s fiscal strategy which has seen the consistent delivery of deficit reduction.  A reduced cost of borrowing for the Government reduces the interest bill which has to be paid by the taxpayer, and, over the long term serves to keep economy-wide interest rates low in order to stimulate investment. On foot on this progress and prudent debt management policies, Ireland&rsquo;s debt ratio is now expected to decline in 2014 and remain on a downward trajectory thereafter. Budget 2014 also forecasts a modest primary surplus next year. This means that, excluding debt service costs, revenues are sufficient to meet expenditures. <\/p><p>  The process of rebuilding the economy takes time. The approach the Government is adopting is designed to implement the necessary changes in a manner that positions the economy to grow into the future and instils confidence in Ireland at home and abroad. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000078#WRJ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Savings Schemes","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000078#WRJ00650"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[49793\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000078#WRJ00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which any consideration might be given to the launch of a Government development bond which might assist economic recovery with particular reference to the need to provide a channel whereby those with savings might obtain a reasonable return on their investment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

NTMA State Savings products have been an important and dependable component of Government borrowing for many years and make a valuable contribution to the national finances. The suite of State Savings products includes Savings Certificates, Savings Bonds, Prize Bonds, the National Solidarity Bond, Instalment Savings and Deposit Accounts such as the Ordinary Deposit Account and the Deposit Account Plus.<\/p><p>  The ten-year National Solidarity Bond was introduced in 2010 specifically to allow citizens an opportunity to invest and provide money to the State to stimulate economic recovery and to assist in the maintenance and creation of employment. A four-year National Solidarity Bond was introduced in 2011. The four-year National Solidarity Bond offers a fixed return of 12%, while the ten-year Solidarity Bond offers a return of 45%.

This represents a fall of &euro;125 million (0.3%) on the original Budget 2013 forecast.  Moving to individual tax heads, excise duties continue to be below profile with declines in receipts from alcohol and tobacco the main contributors. <\/p><p>  As discussed in the Budget 2014 booklet, the shortfall in value added tax (VAT) can be largely explained by a sector specific issue unrelated to personal consumption expenditure. Encouragingly, receipts during the most recent VAT due month of September, reflective of trading during July and August, was up &euro;80 million on expectations. This is consistent with the uptick in retail sales over the summer and the impact of the change in the car registration system. Nevertheless, despite its positive momentum in the domestic economy, a small shortfall against profile is expected.<\/p><p>  Turning to income tax, the largest tax head, performance in the year to date has been healthy. The position at end-October is a small shortfall of 1% against profile. This is substantially attributable to the lower than expected DIRT receipts as a result of the low interest rate environment.  Encouragingly, other elements of income tax are actually ahead of target, reflective of the better than expected performance of the labour market.<\/p><p>  Against these downsides, there has also been an over performance relative to expectation in some key tax heads, with corporation tax performing particularly well, up &euro;235 million against profile to end October.

It is the Government&rsquo;s vision that all viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy.  The Government has imposed SME lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  Both banks achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets. <\/p><p>  AIB and Bank of Ireland are expected to lend to viable businesses both for investment and working capital purposes.  The Credit Review Office is available to assist businesses which have been refused credit.  The recent CRO report shows that the Credit Review Office upheld the credit appeal in 150 cases or 55% of cases decided.  The upheld appeals have resulted in &euro;18.5 million in credit being made available to SMEs and farms, protecting 1,521 jobs. In the recent Budget, I increased the CRO appeals threshold from &euro;500,000 to &euro;3 million and I would strongly encourage SMEs refused credit to seek a review by the Office. <\/p><p>  The Government has taken a number of actions to improve the situation in relation to credit availability to SMEs.  The range of credit options available to SMEs now include the Microenterprise Loan scheme which can facilitate up to &euro;40million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.  In addition, the Credit Guarantee Scheme is designed for SMEs who, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.  <\/p><p>  It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery.  However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.<\/p><p>  More generally, small businesses can benefit from support, guidance and advice provided at local level through the network of County Enterprise Boards which are currently being transformed into Local Enterprise Offices with closer links to businesses in their local area.<\/p><p>  2014 will see the introduction of a new training programme for SMEs, designed to enhance the financial and business planning capabilities of participants and provide expert mentoring support. Launching initially on a pilot basis involving 1,000 businesses, the 2-day programme aims to equip SMEs with the necessary tools to improve their ability to secure business financing.<\/p><p>  A full suite of developmental business supports, totalling approximately &euro;2bn, is available from State bodies and agencies.  The Government is developing a comprehensive communication strategy to increase awareness of these supports.  This strategy will encompass the revised Credit Guarantee Scheme with a view to increasing awareness amongst SMEs.<\/p><p>  Separately, as the Deputy is aware, the Taoiseach mentioned in this House last week that he had held discussions with Chancellor Merkel.  Germany is keen to help and specifically to find ways to reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery by improving funding mechanisms for the real economy, including access to finance for Irish SMEs.  The German Government has asked KfW, the German development bank, to work with the German and Irish authorities swiftly, in order to deliver on this initiative at the earliest possible date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000079#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth Initiatives","counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000079#WRK00425"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[49799\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000079#WRK00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he and his Department can repeat measures deemed to be most effective in the generation of economic activity and job creation throughout the economy in the past three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":204,"content":"<p>Since the Government has taken office, all of its economic policies have been designed with the goal of strengthening economic activity and putting the labour market back on a sounded footing.  In 2012 the economy recorded a second successive year of growth after three successive years of contraction. This recovery has been driven by strong export growth over the period reflecting, in part, the considerable competitiveness gains achieved in the last number of years.  In addition to this, recent indications show that domestic demand is stabilising and is moving on to a modest recovery path.  Personal consumption was up by 0.7 per cent in the second quarter of this year and healthy retail sales in the third quarter, along with improving consumer sentiment, bode well for the second half of the year.  We have also seen a return to growth in &lsquo;core&rsquo; (excluding planes) investment, with both construction and machinery and equipment growing in the second quarter.  My Department projects economic growth again for this year as a whole.<\/p><p>  Perhaps most pertinently, employment has now increased in each of the last four quarters, with employment up 1.8 per cent in the year to the second quarter, the strongest pace of job creation since 2008.  Encouragingly this growth consisted of both full and part-time employment and was broad based across the different sectors of the economy.  In addition, the standardised unemployment rate reduced further in October, to 13.2 per cent, which is the lowest level since March 2010, but still unacceptably high.<\/p><p>  The Government has and continues to prioritise getting people back to work. It has implemented a range of measures that have been effective in job creation over the past few years. I feel all the various initiatives have worked in unison to bring about the labour market improvement.<\/p><p>  For instance, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 builds on the success of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, by focusing on creating an environment conducive to job creation. It will support job creation by:<\/p><p>-   Building Competitive Advantage;<\/p><p>-   Assisting Indigenous Business to Grow;<\/p><p>-   Driving Entrepreneurship at Community and Local Level;<\/p><p>-   Developing and Deepening the Impact of FDI; and<\/p><p>-   Fostering Sectoral Opportunities.<\/p><p>  In addition to the Action Plan for Jobs, Pathways to work 2013, published in July 2013, is a 50-point action plan that focuses on labour market activation and builds on the success of Pathways to Work 2012.<\/p><p>  This plan focuses on:<\/p><p>-   More regular and on-going engagement with the unemployed;<\/p><p>-   Greater targeting of activation places and opportunities;<\/p><p>-   Incentivising both the take-up of opportunities and employers to provide more jobs for people who are unemployed; and<\/p><p>-   Reforming institutions to deliver better services to the unemployed.<\/p><p>  In addition to these economy-wide initiatives, the Government has also introduced sector-specific initiatives aimed at supporting job creation. Take for example the tourism and hospitality sector where The Gathering Ireland 2013, along with the reduced VAT rate of 9 per cent introduced for the tourism and hospitality sectors in the May 2011 Jobs Initiative, has supported the 8 per cent increase in employment in the year to the second quarter of 2013.<\/p><p>  All of these initiatives are having a positive effect, but this is still clearly lots to do.  The task now is to build on this by maintaining the momentum generated by these successful measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000079#WRK00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":205,"content":"<p>Question No. 75 answered with Question No. 68.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Tax Strategy","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000079#WRK00725"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[49801\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000079#WRK00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps taken unilaterally or in conjunction with his EU colleagues to rebut suggestions of the existence of a tax haven here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>As I outlined in my Budget speech on 15 October last, reputation is becoming more and more a vital factor in winning foreign direct investment.

However, the internationally accepted standard is set down by the OECD, who have identified four criteria to define tax havens.  Ireland does not meet any of these criteria.

One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.<\/p><p>  Regarding mortgage debt and personal debt, following on from the recommendations of the 2011 Inter-Departmental Report on Mortgage Arrears the Government has put in place a comprehensive strategy to address the problem.  The main elements of this are:-<\/p><p><b>Innovative Personal Insolvency Reform:<\/b>    The Personal Insolvency Act, in place since the end of 2012, now provides accessible statutory insolvency frameworks to allow debtors and creditors reach arrangements to resolve unsustainable mortgage and personal debt positions.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland, which was officially launched in April, is now in a position to process insolvency applications from debtors.<\/p><p><b>Comprehensive Advice and Guidance:<\/b>  In addition to existing arrangements, the Government has introduced a range of information and guidance resources to assist mortgage holders through what can be a difficult and stressful process.  A dedicated website, <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.keepingyourhome.ie<\/font><\/i>, has been put in place to provide general public information on mortgages arrears issues.  In addition, there is a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline, which was established under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, to provide more tailored information to individual callers.  Finally, a panel of accountants has been put in place to provide &ldquo;one to one&rdquo; independent advice to borrowers who have been provided a long term forbearance resolution offer by their lender in respect of a mortgage on their primary home.  All of these information services are provided at no direct charge to the users of the service.<\/p><p><b>Keeping families in their homes:  <\/b>  As a social housing response, a &ldquo;mortgage to rent&rdquo; scheme is now in place on a nationwide basis.  This option is available to households who have unsustainable mortgages and who would qualify for social housing support.  Provided they meet this and other appropriate criteria, this allows families, in the context of an agreed resolution to an unsustainable mortgage, to remain in their home.<\/p><p><b>Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies:<\/b>    The implementation of sustainable mortgage arrears solutions by individual banks for their distressed customers, with Central Bank oversight, is a key element of the overall framework to address the mortgage arrears problem.  The Central Bank Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) initiative announced last March, sets time bound and measurable targets for the main banks requiring them to systematically address their mortgage arrears book.  In particular, the Central Bank is requiring the main mortgage lenders to propose sustainable solutions to 20% of mortgages that are in arrears (of over 90 days) by end June 2013, to 30% by the end of September 2013, to 50% by the end of December 2013 and to 70% by end March 2014.  In addition, the Central Bank has also set targets to require these banks to conclude sustainable agreements with 15% of the relevant mortgage arrears cases by end 2013 and with 25% by end March 2014.  Also, the Central Bank is implementing a pilot initiative for the restructuring of multiple personal debt situations to test the viability of a negotiated approach where there is more than one lender involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000079#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Protection Policies","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000080#WRL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[49805\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000080#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which default by insurance companies in respect of mortgage protection has been recorded or monitored in the past five years; if indicative trends have been identified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":218,"content":"<p>I have made inquiries with the Central Bank about this matter which I understand relates to cases where a person can no longer afford to pay for the protection and\/or has a claim rejected.

It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgement to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils. Schools are supported in this regard by the National Educational Psychological Services.<\/p><p>  All Post Primary schools have also been allocated additional teaching resources for pupils with high incidence special educational needs, including SLDs. <\/p><p>As the allocation of support for pupils with SLDs is managed locally by schools, my Department does not hold details of the number of students with dyslexia and dyscalculia receiving support locally, as schools are not required to apply directly to my Department for learning support for Specific Learning Disabilities such as dyslexia and dyscalculia.<\/p><p>  I can advise, however, that the recently published National Council for Special Education (NCSE) report on Supporting Students Special Educational Needs in Schools sets out that 0.5% of the student population in Ireland is estimated to have a SLD.<\/p><p>  I can also advise that my Department provides guidelines for schools in relation to the utilisation of additional teaching resources which have been allocated to them for pupils with high incidence special educational needs. These include Circular SpEd 02\/05, Inclusion of Pupils with Special Educational Needs Post Primary Guidelines and the National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) Continuum of Support Guidelines.<\/p><p>  My Department provides funding for a number of special schools and special classes attached to mainstream primary schools which have been sanctioned to meet the needs of children with SLDs. There are 4 Special Schools and approximately 16 Special Classes attached to mainstream Primary schools catering for pupils with SLD.<\/p><p>  Further resources are also provided to schools to support pupils with SLDs. Funding is provided for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers and\/or software to assist children with special educational needs, including children with SLDs, once relevant professionals recommend the equipment as being essential for the provision of education. Schools can apply to the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) directly for this support.<\/p><p>  An information resource pack on dyslexia in CD-Rom, DVD and video format, has been developed by my Department in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland. This product has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools. The DVD and video provides support for parents of pupils with dyslexia while the CD-Rom assists teachers who are teaching children with dyslexia in the mainstream classroom.<\/p><p>  Finally, I wish to explain that initial teacher education programmes address specific teacher training elements including literacy and numeracy, differentiation and Inclusive Education including Special Education. Additional support is provided for teachers with additional training needs in the area of dyslexia and dyscalculia by the Special Education Support Service (SESS). The SESS manages, co-ordinates and develops a range of supports in response to identified teacher training needs and aims to provide direct support to schools and individual teachers in as flexible a way as possible. The SESS provides fees' subsidies for online training courses in the area of Dyslexia as well as support for in-school seminars and attendance at relevant conferences and seminars. Supports in the area of Dyscalculia usually encompass support in the broader area of numeracy, assessment, mathematics and special educational needs rather than specifically in the area of dyscalculia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000082#WRN01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies Data","counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000083#WRO00125"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[49952\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000083#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of quangos operating under the aegis of his Department; the total number of directors sitting on their boards; the aggregate fees incurred by the State in paying the remuneration of directors of these quangos; the number of quangos that have been created since the formation of the Government; the number that have been disbanded over the period; the projected cost to the taxpayer of the establishment and operation of these new quangos; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"953","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":264,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to non-commercial State bodies under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills can be downloaded from my Department's website. <\/p><p>  For the Deputy's information under the Public Service Reform plan the following were identified for rationalisation or merger and since March 2011 the following actions have taken place.<\/p><p>The Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology and Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences were merged in March 2012 to form the Irish Research Council (IRC). The IRC has been established as a sub-board of the Higher Education Authority (HEA).  There was a saving of &euro;100,000 in 2012 and 2013. Under the provisions of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), the Higher Education Training Awards Council (HETAC) and the Further Education Training Awards Council (FETAC) were amalgamated to form a new agency, the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).  Estimated likely saving on an annual basis will be &euro;1 million by 2014.  Under the provisions of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 the Vocational Education Committee (VEC) system was reconfigured, with the number of further education bodies being reduced from 33 to 16. Full year savings are estimated at &euro;2.1m. Further savings are likely to be achieved through realisation of economies of scale arising from the mergers and the wider Education and Training Sector Reform Programme.  Under the provisions of the Further Education and Training Act 2013 F&Aacute;S was dissolved in October 2013, with a new training authority, An tSeirbh&iacute;s Oideachais Lean&uacute;naigh agus Scileanna (SOLAS) being created with responsibility for funding, planning and co-ordinating training and further education <\/p><p>programmes.<\/p><p>  Following the enactment of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012, the necessary steps have been taken to dissolve the Education Finance Board in March 2013 and establish the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board (Cara Nua).

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and thus reduce unemployment and long-term unemployment.  Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.<\/p><p>  The Government is also implementing a number of programmes to assist young unemployed persons and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance\/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies and include:<\/p><p>- The Youthreach programme providing 6,000 integrated education, training and work experience for early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age;<\/p><p>- The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme scheme, which provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age, particularly focusing upon early school leavers;<\/p><p>- The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by the Department of Social Protection provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated on this scheme in the last academic year;<\/p><p>- Approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2012. This excludes apprenticeships and evening courses; <\/p><p>- MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions supports the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 long term jobseekers to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors.  Over 1,250 of these places are assigned specifically for under 25s;<\/p><p>- The JobBridge National Internship Scheme is focused on providing work experience to young people with the total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 at 2,700; - Long-term unemployed youth will also benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. Under this scheme the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person from the Live Register; <\/p><p>  The most recent statistics available from the CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey show the level of youth unemployment has fallen from an average of 75,000 in 2010 to 63,000 in the most recent twelve months for which data are available. The level of employment of young people appears to have stabilised, and indeed the employment rate (proportion of the population with jobs) for those aged 20-24 years rose from 46.5% in mid-2012 to 49% in the second quarter of this year. With regard to the expected future impact of existing policies, the original Action Plan for Jobs sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people.<\/p><p>  Graduates who become unemployed have access, through the INTREO service of my Department, to the full range of labour market programmes on the same basis as all young jobseekers.<\/p><p>  Looking forward, in addition to current initiatives, policies to increase youth employment will be supplemented by additional measures under the Youth Guarantee which will be rolled out in 2014.<\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection has set up an interdepartmental group with officials and programme managers from the Department of Education and Skills, Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, to review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the implementation of the Guarantee.

(how much can be provided from domestic sources, and what is the likely support from EU funds, e.g. European Social Fund (ESF) and Youth Employment Initiative (ESF)).<\/p><p>  For Ireland this plan will likely require:<\/p><p>-  Earmarking a quota of additional places\/opportunities for young people on existing schemes.<\/p><p>-  Varying the eligibility conditions for access to certain schemes by young people - for example reduce the eligibility criteria so that young people can access places\/opportunities after 4 &ndash; 6 months of unemployment rather than the general requirement of 12 months unemployment.<\/p><p>-  Expanding the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.<\/p><p>  In 2012, we spent an estimated &euro;170m on participation in employment, training and further education programmes for jobless young people. Significant further amounts were expended on mainstream provision of further and higher education preparing young people for entry to working life. Final estimates of cost and participants for 2013 will be produced at the end of this year when full-year cost and participant estimates (including age-breakdowns) will be available.<\/p><p>  As an initial step towards preparing for implementation of the guarantee, provision was made in the 2014 Budget for:<\/p><p>- Changing the eligibility criteria for Jobs Plus to make it easier for young people to qualify for the scheme.<\/p><p>- an additional intake of 1,500 young people on to the very successful JobBridge scheme<\/p><p>- ensuring that 1,000 places on the  T&uacute;s scheme are targeted at young people<\/p><p>- developing a pilot programme to support young unemployed people to take up opportunities under schemes such as Your First EURES Job<\/p><p>- ring-fencing a minimum of 2,000 training places for under-25s by the Department of Education and Skills, under a follow-up to the successful Momentum programme that operated in 2013, with income support for participants being provided by my department<\/p><p>- the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation making funds available to young entrepreneurs via Micro finance Ireland and other business start-up schemes.<\/p><p>  In total, the provision across these headings in the 2014 Budget comes to about &euro;46 million. The final amount of expenditure on youth programmes for 2014 cannot be predicted with certainty as it will in part be determined by the level of take-up by young people and on the mix of programmes involved. It is however likely to be significantly up on 2012 levels.<\/p><p>  Given the scale of existing and future provision it is clear that the bulk of funding for labour market programmes for young people will continue to come from domestic exchequer sources. We will however endeavour to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s share of the additional funding available from the EU. <\/p><p>  It is estimated that EU funding (ESF and YEI) for these programmes will be of the order of &euro;64 million in respect of each of the years 2014 and 2015. Given the way the funding is structured, in order to recoup these amounts from the EU in due course, it will be necessary that we spend, in the first instance, close to &euro;100 million on relevant programmes each year, or close to &euro;200 million in 2014-2015 overall. As will be clear from the above, it is anticipated that actual expenditure will be significantly in excess of that amount over the period concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000084#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000084#WRP00750"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[49630\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000084#WRP00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if assistance will be offered to help secure employment by way of training\/upskilling in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare who is currently receiving unemployment benefit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":295,"content":"<p>The person concerned was interviewed by an officer from the Maynooth Employment Service&rsquo;s office on the 12 July 2013 and on that day she applied for two computer courses.

The primary objective of the report was to gather information on pension charges levied, to assess whether these charges are reasonable and transparent, to report on the findings and to make recommendations.  The report highlights a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identifies that there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges. <\/p><p>  The Report considers the use of the Total Expense Ratio (TER) as a measure to provide  clarity of overall pension charges, including implicit investment charges.  TERs relate to the costs associated with investment fund management and are particularly relevant to investment management costs because they incorporate the additional operational costs of investment funds, such as fund administration and audit fees.  However, as the Report outlines, such costs do not cover the full range of pension charges.  For example, administration and distribution costs also impact on pension charging structures, and these costs are not reflected in TERs.  A TER and an annual management charge for an investment fund will differ and this variance reflects the additional operational costs of the fund in question.  Such additional costs impact on pension savers as they are built into unit prices.  Other  non\u2010operational costs such as stamp duty and brokerage commissions do not form part of a TER and may also affect pension savers. <\/p><p>  The launch of the Report on Pension Charges was followed by a three month consultation with stakeholders.  There was a broad range of views expressed in the submissions received as well as a range of suggestions and proposals aimed at improving various aspects of the pension charging environment.  Following the consultation period, it was agreed by Government in April 2013 that the recommendations contained in the report will be implemented, and this work has commenced.  A Key Recommendation of The Pension Charges Report was to<b><\/b><i>&quot;Monitor developments and continue efforts to develop a single standard measure that would assess all costs and charges and thereby enable easier comparisons to be made&rdquo;.<\/i><\/p><p>  A Pension Charges Working Group is in place to initiate actions that follow up on the recommendations of the report.

As such, the continued operation of the Whitegate refinery on a commercial basis is highly desirable. An operating refinery also adds value to the Irish economy and provides significant employment.

Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Waterford, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at . The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS). My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS to certain designated Electoral Divisions, including the area referred to by the Deputy. The broadband service contracted under NBS is a basic, affordable, scalable product in keeping with EU State Aid clearance for the Scheme in September 2007.    The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Waterford. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p> - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and<\/p><p> - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by service providers. ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction, completed in 2012, is also enabling the rollout of advanced mobile broadband services.<\/p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years. The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000088#WRT00500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies Data","counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000088#WRT00525"},{"type":"question","counter":362,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[49950\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000088#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of quangos operating under the aegis of his Department; the total number of directors sitting on their boards; the aggregate fees incurred by the State in paying the remuneration of directors of these quangos; the number of quangos that have been created since the formation of the Government; the number that have been disbanded over the period; the projected cost to the taxpayer of the establishment and operation of these new quangos; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"953","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":363,"content":"<p>My Departmental remit includes complex policy areas and oversight of State regulation and provision of key strategic services such as energy and public broadcasting.

Two Garda Clinics have been established to provide a positive point of contact between the Garda&iacute; and the public and an additional Garda vehicle has been made available to Community Garda&iacute; for patrolling the area.  Other relevant developments include the establishment of Business Watch schemes in retail centres, the provision of information to elderly persons in cooperation with Age Action and ongoing engagement with the eight Neighbourhood Watch schemes which operate in the Stepaside\/Glencullen area.

It should be noted that these decisions not to submit the fee or to withdraw the application will have been taken for a variety of reasons and there is no evidence that this is directly linked to the fee. Moreover, there is no formal time limit as to when an application should be completed. However, for good administrative practices candidates are normally given 6 months from the date of approval to complete the application process. The fees are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation and compare favourably with those in other jurisdictions.

The development of a new Rural Development Programme under Pillar 2 will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.<\/p><p>  A general EU co-financing rate of 53% is set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation but this rate may rise to a maximum of 80% for measures such as farm and business development, co-operation activities, and LEADER projects. Environmental type measures may be co-funded up to 75%. The total Exchequer funding that will be required to draw down the available EAFRD funding will depend on the types of measures included in the new Rural Development Programme and on the co-financing rates applied to these measures.<\/p><p>  There are a number of conditions attached to Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;313 million per annum.  The draft Regulation provides that at least 5% of EAFRD funding must be reserved for LEADER while the draft Common Provisions Regulation provides that 6% of EAFRD funding must be set aside to a national performance reserve. The funding set aside to the performance reserve will be allocated to each Member State following a performance review in 2019. The draft Rural Development Regulation also sets out that 30% of the total EAFRD amount must be reserved for environmental operations and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. In addition to these considerations, transitional funding for commitments arising from the current RDP and continuing into the start of the new programming period will be included in the budgeting process for the coming years.<\/p><p>  Work is currently ongoing in my Department to design the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) for the period from 2014 &ndash; 2020. In designing the new RDP, my Department must take account of the range of requirements set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation and the need to support key policy aims for the agri-food sector in the light of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. In undertaking this work, a number of ex-ante analyses are being undertaken and a public consultation process has also taken place.<\/p><p>  While final decisions in relation to what measures are to be included in the new RDP have not yet been made, my Department is in ongoing contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the overall financing that will be required. I expect to make decisions in relation to the measures to be supported under the new RDP by the end of this year, and to submit a draft programme to the Commission in early 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000092#WRX01400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":457,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000092#WRX01450"},{"type":"question","counter":458,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[49740\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000092#WRX01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will expedite a disadvantaged area scheme payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":459,"content":"<p>As processing of the application of the person named under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme\/Disadvantaged Area Scheme was recently complete, payment issued directly to the nominated bank account of the person named on 5 November 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000092#WRX01600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":461,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000093#WRY00150"},{"type":"question","counter":462,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[49747\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000093#WRY00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding accommodating a person (details supplied) in County Longford with the higher rate of forestry grant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The service is led by a management team consisting of the national manager and two heads of discipline and includes psychologists, social workers, speech and language therapists and addiction counsellors.  There are psychiatrists working with some of the children and the ACTS team work collaboratively with these professionals.  There are now twenty one clinicians in post.  Further recruitment is necessary to fill the principal social work position, two speech and language therapists, and an addiction counsellor. The service operates in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.<\/p><p>  ACTS clinicians are now working in the three special care units.  ACTS clinicians work with individual young people and their families and care staff; they also participate in clinical planning and review meetings involving various professionals including social workers from local areas, GALs etc.  In addition clinically informed individual therapeutic plans and individual plans have been developed for young people and clinical reports have been prepared which have informed High Court proceedings.  Through the development of the ACTS community service, clinicians stay involved with young people to support their transition out of special care units.  <\/p><p>  ACTS is in the process of rolling out clinical services in the children detention schools in partnership with the national forensic service.  In order to make the best use of a limited clinical resource and in line with best practice, all children remanded or committed to the children detention schools will be screened using an evidenced based assessment tool to see if they need to be seen by clinical services.  Referrals deemed appropriate will then be made to the clinical team who will meet weekly on campus to review referrals and plan clinical interventions.  This new procedure will mean that reports for the courts will focus on the young person's risk of offending as assessed using an evidence based assessment tool rather than reporting on specific mental health issues.  In addition the clinicians will focus on providing interventions rather than assessment only services.  Training in the use of this assessment has begun and the clinical team now meet on campus every week.            <\/p><p>  ACTS continue to support people when they transition out of secure settings.  In addition some support is provided to young people before they are placed in secure settings.

The increase in prescription charges will account for &euro;43 million of this target. The Government is committed to achieving these savings while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible.<\/p><p>  Medical card holders will be required to pay a &euro;2.50 charge per item for medicines and other prescription items supplied to them by community pharmacists, subject to a cap of &euro;25 per month for each person or family.

These new rates will be effective from 1 December 2013.<\/p><p>  Prescription charges are not payable in respect of items supplied under the Long Term Illness Scheme.<\/p><p>  In the case of persons who had both the medical card and an LTI book, the HSE policy was that they should use their medical card to access medicines. The main reason for this was that the supply of medicines under the LTI cost the HSE considerably more than under the GMS Scheme. A retail mark-up of 20% was payable to pharmacists for items supplied under the LTI Scheme. There is no retail mark-up for items supplied under the GMS Scheme.  However, following a review under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2009, my colleague, Minister Reilly, announced (on the 2nd of July) the elimination of the retail mark-up under the LTI scheme.<\/p><p>  In light of the elimination of the retail mark-up, the HSE was asked by my Department to review its policy.

The key objective is to develop services in the community which will give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and other allied health professionals.  At the end of September 2013, there were 423<b><\/b>  Primary Care Teams operating, i.e. holding clinical team meetings involving GPs and HSE staff.  These Teams provide services for almost 4 million of the population with over 2,600 HSE staff members and almost 1,700 GPs participating.<\/p><p>  The Government plans to implement the following key measures in primary care over the remainder of its term in office:<\/p><p>- Introduction of a universal GP service free at the point of access;<\/p><p>- Introduction of a new GP contract;<\/p><p>- Phased roll out of chronic disease management programmes;<\/p><p>- Expansion of the primary care workforce; and<\/p><p>- Continued development of the primary care infrastructure.  <\/p><p>  The Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service by 2016, as an essential prerequisite to the introduction of Universal Health Insurance.  As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees.  Additional funding of &euro;37 million has been provided to meet the full year cost of this measure.  The new General Practitioner (GP) contract will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.  The formulation of the new contract will have regard to the constraints of Irish and EU Competition Law, particularly with regard to the setting of fees and allowances.<\/p><p>  The HSE is developing chronic disease management programmes to improve patient access and to manage patient care in an integrated manner across service settings, resulting in best health outcomes, enhanced clinical decision making and the most effective use of resources.  The HSE National Service Plan and Operational Plan for 2014 will see a continued focus on the Asthma, Diabetes and COPD programmes which are particularly relevant to primary care.<\/p><p>  Funding of &euro;20 million has been provided to recruit 264.5 additional Primary Care staff, including Public Health Nurses; Registered General Nurses; Occupational Therapists; Physiotherapists; and Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapists.  Almost 100 of these posts are now filled or have start dates agreed and approximately 80 are at final stages of recruitment (i.e. Garda clearance).  In addition, since the Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Act 2012 came into effect on 12 March 2012, an additional 246 GPs have obtained a GMS contract.<\/p><p>  Primary Care Centres (PCCs) are being developed through a combination of public and private investment to facilitate the delivery of multidisciplinary care.  Considerable progress has been made and 34 PCCs have opened since March 2011.  Work is underway at 15 locations involving a combination of refurbishment, extension of properties and new build through direct exchequer investment.

Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person.  The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure.  Minimum Benefit Regulations were introduced in 1996, under Section 10 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994 and cover in-patient, out-patient and day-patient services provided by publicly funded hospitals, private hospitals, registered nursing home and hospital consultants. <\/p><p>  The Minimum Benefit Regulations ensure that all consumers obtain an appropriate minimum level of health insurance cover regardless of what plan they purchase and that every plan available is inclusive of a minimum suite of benefits\/procedures, some of which are available to the market as a whole and some of which will be applicable specifically to either men or women.  Importantly, under Community Rating everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan which includes this minimum suite of benefits, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health. Thus, the broad base line of procedures provided by minimum benefit should not be looked at in gender specific terms, but rather as a cohort of procedures that are important to the community of the insured population and thus should be protected and provided as a minimum base to all.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000098#WRDD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Data","counter":577,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000098#WRDD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":578,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[49735\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112000098#WRDD01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total number of persons who have health insurance as of October 2013; the figures for end of year 2007 to 2012 inclusive; the number of these that have a full medical card or a general practitioner only card; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
