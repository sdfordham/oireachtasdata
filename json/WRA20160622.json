I have publicly stated my intention to develop and bring forward legislative proposals providing for a statutory Parole Board and this was also a commitment in the Fine Gael manifesto earlier this year. <\/p>  <p>  Draft proposals have been under development in my Department to establish a statutory Parole Board which will set out the Board&rsquo;s functions, powers and structure.  The objective is a more effective and streamlined parole process which, while being of benefit to the prisoner, will always have public safety as a paramount concern.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Parole Bill 2016, a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill, was introduced by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan on 24 May 2016.  The aim of this Bill is also to establish the Parole Board as an independent statutory body and confer on it responsibility for granting parole to eligible offenders.  <\/p>  <p>  The Bill completed Second Stage in this House on 15 June 2016.  As the principle of establishing the Parole Board on a statutory basis is in line with Government policy, on that basis I did not oppose the Bill.  <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of legal and technical difficulties which must be addressed to ensure any new framework is constitutionally and legally sound and operationally practicable and effective.  The principal concerns with the Parole Bill introduced into the House last week relate to potential constitutional issues arising from a Parole Board completely independent of the Executive, the appeal mechanism, the issuing of warrants by the board, the exemption of certain categories of offenders and the quasi-judicial nature of the board as envisaged in the Bill.  The financial implications must also be considered.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to the establishment of a statutory Parole Board.

Those Regulations were revoked by the 2014 Act and an entirely new system was put in place.<\/p>  <p>  The 2014 Act was part of the then Government's comprehensive approach to enhancing the protections available to whistleblowers, including members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Under the Act, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) is now the prescribed body authorised to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.  GSOC is a statutorily independent body under the Garda S&iacute;ochana Act.<\/p>  <p>  However, Garda&iacute; who wish to make protected disclosures may do so to other persons who are prescribed for this purpose.  Accordingly, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure directly to GSOC.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the public interest in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having robust policies and procedures in place to support and protect whistleblowers and to ensure that their complaints\/allegations are fully investigated, I signalled during the D&aacute;il debate on the O'Higgins Report that I would refer certain matters to the independent Policing Authority.  To that end, I wrote to the Authority on 2 June 2016 requesting that in accordance with section 62O(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) they submit a report on the policies and procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with whistleblowers\/whistleblowing.  I also asked that they make any recommendations that they consider appropriate in order to ensure that the policies and procedures in place are appropriate and can provide assurance that whistleblowers can make complaints\/allegations in a safe environment where their complaints\/allegations are properly investigated.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is also no doubt aware of the measures that the Garda Commissioner outlined at her recent meeting with the Policing Authority.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published its Protected Disclosures Policy and all Garda Members and civilians have been informed of this policy.  In addition the Garda Commissioner has appointed a Protected Disclosures Manager who will be supported with a dedicated and properly trained team.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is working with Transparency International Ireland and other external providers to create an environment to ensure that whistleblowers are protected and supported.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is committed to providing a positive and supportive working environment for all Garda personnel.  An  Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Dignity at Work Policy, entitled \"Working Together to Create a Positive Working Environment\", outlines the policy and procedures for dealing with Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying in the Workplace.  The main Objective of the policy is to achieve a safe and harmonious working environment that encourages and supports the right to dignity at work.  I am informed that the Commissioner has established  an internal Garda Work Group to review the current practice and policies in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  and this work is currently ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  All of this points to the very significant changes in the regime for making protected disclosures by members of the Garda&iacute; and the significant protections afforded to those who make protected disclosures.

Details of that system are further outlined in my response to D&aacute;il Question 113 on 4 May 2016.<\/p><p>The report of the Inspector of Prisons on the prisoner complaints system &ldquo;Review, Evaluation and Analysis of the Operation of the present Irish Prison Service Complaints Procedure&rdquo; was published on 8 June 2016 and is available on my Department's website - <i><i>www.justice.ie<\/i><\/i>.  This identified a number of concerns in the implementation of the current complaints procedure.  Arising from this I met with the Inspector of Prisons to discuss his findings.  The Inspector made it clear to me that he considered the Irish Prison Service has to retain a central role in the complaints process but with independent oversight and that he was satisfied that a fair and effective complaints procedure could be achieved with the implementation of his recommendations.  I also had a separate meeting with Director General of the Irish Prison Service to see what action needed to be taken following on from the report.<\/p><p>In the light of this report it is clear that more needs to be done before we have a system that will gain the full confidence of staff, prisoners and the general public.  One of the key recommendations in the Inspector's report is that prisoners&rsquo; complaints would be subject to review by the Ombudsman who would also be able to deal with complaints directly in the case of undue delay.  I accept this recommendation and my officials have already had an initial exploratory meeting with the Ombudsman's office and will be raising this issue with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  <\/p><p>Another recommendation is that complaints would also be categorised as either serious Category A or minor Category B and that a robust investigative mechanism must be put in place, in prisons, to ensure the proper investigation of Category A complaints.  While I fully accept this recommendation I am concerned that replacing external investigators with an internal IPS team of investigators might give rise to a perception of bias.  I have directed that more training be provided for external investigators and that this independent investigative element be maintained for a 12 month period and then reviewed.<\/p><p>I have also accepted further recommendations in the report.  These include resolving minor complaints at the lowest level; allowing prisoners make complaints to relevant professional bodies; prisoners being entitled to an explanation for decisions made affecting them; frivolous and vexatious complaints being addressed and fair procedures applying.  Similarly the recommendations on adequate training, adhering to protocols and statutory obligations, holding staff to account, not hindering the complaints procedure and having an effective communication system are accepted.<\/p><p>In my meeting with the Inspector about his report, I specifically asked him to keep the complaints procedure under review and to give her regular reports.  I emphasised that the rights of all prisoners, including vulnerable prisoners, have to be promoted and an effective complaints system is just one aspect of achieving this goal.<\/p><p>While some amendment to secondary legislation may be required to effect these recommendations, it is not envisaged that primary legislation would be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200069#WRA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Arrears Proposals","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200070#WRB00075"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[10762\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200070#WRB00100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the dedicated new court to deal with mortgage arrears, as promised in the programme for Government, will be established; if all bank and non-bank institutions that hold mortgage debt in Ireland will be subject to it; if she plans to establish a preferred hierarchy of mortgage solutions to be applied to arrears cases; if she plans to give a statutory right to mortgage holders to certain solutions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":25,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government states, as the Deputy notes, that the Government will '<i>establish a dedicated new court to sensitively and expeditiously handle mortgage arrears and other personal insolvency cases, including through imposing solutions'<\/i>, including those recommended by a new national service which will be established '<i>to standardise the supports available to borrowers in mortgage arrears'<\/i>.

The High Court hears a small number of cases regarding very high-value houses.  The Circuit Court cases are heard by the ordinary Circuit Court judges, at over 30 venues around the country: preliminary issues may be heard by the Registrar, before a case is transferred to the judge for hearing.  Some circuits reserve a specific date for repossession cases, while others hear repossession cases along with other civil law cases such as family law or commercial cases.  The courts sit in public as is the general rule: legislative change would be needed to allow them to hear repossession cases in private.<\/p><p>Based on the data provided by the Courts Service, the number of repossession orders is falling.  In Q1\/2016, there were about 95 possession orders per month - less than half the monthly average in Q1\/2015.  And in over twice as many cases (200 per month on average last quarter) the repossession application was struck out, refused or withdrawn.  However, I fully agree that the number of repossession cases remains undesirably high, particularly in terms of the worry and stress experienced by borrowers who are struggling with their debts.

If the Court considers on those criteria that the proposal was fair and reasonable, it has power to impose the personal insolvency arrangement proposed by the borrower.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200070#WRB00200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates Valuation Process","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200070#WRB00250"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[13060\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200070#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to introduce self-assessment for commercial rates, given the systemic inability of the Valuations Office to carry out valuations in a timely manner; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>The Commissioner of Valuation, who is independent in the exercise of his functions, has responsibility under the Valuation Act 2001 to maintain valuation lists of all commercial properties in the State which are used by Local Authorities in the calculation of rates due from individual ratepayers.  This is done using two processes known as <i>revaluation<\/i>and <i>revision<\/i>.<\/p><p>Revaluation is a process where all properties in a Local Authority area are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date.  After the first revaluation of a Local Authority area is completed, revaluation is then scheduled to take place every five to ten years to reflect changes in economic circumstances since the last revaluation took place.  Revision, on the other hand, is intended to reflect structural changes to individual properties or the addition to the Valuation Lists of new properties between revaluations.  The national revaluation programme is the first general valuation of all commercial property in the state since the middle of the 19th century.  It is a very significant undertaking and involves the valuation of some 146,000 properties.  Completing the first revaluation and getting properties in every Local Authority area onto the 5-10 year cycle of revaluations, provided for in the legislation, will represent a sea-change for the valuation system.<\/p><p>The present position is that all rateable properties in the Dublin, Waterford and Limerick local authority areas are now revalued.  These 48,000 properties represent approximately 57% of the national rateable valuation base in monetary value terms or 33% in numerical terms.  In addition,13 public utilities representing some of the largest ratepayers in the State have been valued on a global basis.  Significant progress is being made and the programme has established a momentum which will be shortly built upon as the Commissioner has made valuation orders for the revaluation of seven more Local Authorities.  While the revaluation programme has been underway, the Valuation Office has continued to carry out revision work and since 2011 a total of 30,206 revision valuations were completed and certified while simultaneously carrying out the revaluations of Dublin City, Waterford and Limerick.<\/p><p>However, in order to complete the revaluation on a nationwide basis in the most timely manner, the programme will need to be accelerated and this is the main objective of the relevant provisions of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into effect on 8 June 2015.  The measures in the Act will enable the Commissioner of Valuation to accelerate the national programme of revaluation including provisions for Outsourcing, Occupier Assisted Valuation, streamlining the appeal process and wider use of computer-aided and statistical techniques.  Occupier Assisted Valuation is the term being used for the form of self-assessment that will be introduced as it better reflects what will happen in practice.  Valuation of commercial property is often a very complex process resulting in annual rates bills that can be very significant for the individual ratepayer.  This requires the application of a uniform approach based on assessing the potential annual rental value of each property and is a more complex exercise than the self-assessment of, say, Local Property Tax.<\/p><p>Occupier Assisted Valuation has the potential however to be a valuable new addition which will help to accelerate the revaluation programme and will bring the ratepayer into closer contact with a system that is one of the key determinants of his or her rates liability.  Self-assessment, in an appropriate form, is therefore being introduced by the new legislation.  Now that the legislation is in place, the Commissioner has commenced arrangements to pilot Occupier Assisted Valuation in one Local Authority area &ndash; County Laois - initially and is also using the enabling provisions in the new legislation to avail of external valuation resources to conduct the revaluation of counties Carlow and Kilkenny.  Utilising these new measures to supplement the proven capacity of the Valuation Office to deliver revaluations will see significant progress towards a more rapid completion of the national programme of revaluation.

established to review certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which were made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach with a view to determining to what extent and in what manner further action may have been required in each case.<\/p>  <p>  A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose.  The counsel appointed to the panel were nominated by the Attorney General and were all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 320 cases were referred to the Panel.  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June 2015 and concluded on 8 February, 2016.<\/p>  <p>  - In 318 cases the complainants were notified of the final outcome of the review of their cases.<\/p>  <p>  - In 1 case the recommendation was of an interim nature whereby the complainant was invited to submit further material.  The complainant has provided such material which is currently being considered by counsel.<\/p>  <p>  - In 1 case the complainant had passed away.<\/p>  <p>  The reports provided by counsel and containing their recommendations in each case constitute legal advice to me and they are, accordingly, subject to legal professional privilege.  While the report and recommendations from counsel were not provided to complainants, I have sought to ensure that letters to complainants should not only set out the recommendation of counsel, but also outline, as far as possible, the reasons for the recommendation.  To that end I appointed a retired judge, Mr Justice Roderick Murphy, to advise on the preparation of the letters and independently vouch for the fact that the summaries of conclusions and the reasoning behind them are a fair reflection of counsel's advice.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to be engaged on the follow up actions arising from the recommendations made by counsel.  These include consultations which are on-going with the Attorney General related to the terms of reference for a number of statutory inquiries under section 42 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Independent Review Mechanism was not established to act as a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation.  Nor was it designed to make findings.  Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed and what that action would be.  I know that some Deputies have argued that the review should have involved interviews with the complainants and other relevant persons, but I think that is to misunderstand this process.  To have required counsel to hold hearings where they would interview everyone concerned would in effect have been to hold full-scale investigations into over 300 cases, without having made any attempt to see if this was necessary or practical.<\/p>  <p>  I have previously assured Deputies that where further action was recommended by the review then that will occur.  And that is, indeed, what has happened.  I have made a number of requests to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission under section 102 (5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to investigate certain matters.  I have sought reports from the Garda Commissioner with a view to informing complainants of relevant matters.  In a small number of cases, I will be establishing statutory inquiries under section 42 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  In a large proportion of cases counsel did not recommend any further action by me because no such action could reasonably be taken, particularly in cases which had already been through the legal process or because they involved complaints against statutorily independent bodies, with whose decisions I could not interfere.  In no case did counsel recommend that a Commission of Investigation be established.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that many complainants were unhappy with the outcome of the review process.  In circumstances where individuals have genuine but necessarily subjective concerns about how their particular cases were originally handled, it is inevitable that many complainants who were informed that no further action was recommended, or where the recommendation fell short of what they had hoped for, would be unhappy with that outcome.  The crucial point, however, is that every case has been reviewed by independent counsel, who have made an objective recommendation based on the details supplied by the complainants themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200070#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Inspectorate Reports","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200070#WRB01450"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[17124\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200070#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the action that has been taken, given the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report on policing in December 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware I published the report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate <i>&quot;Changing Policing in Ireland - Delivering a Visible, Accessible and Responsive Service&quot; <\/i>on 9 December 2015.

GSOC's budget for 2016 is &euro;9.546 million, which represents an increase of some &euro;500,000 on the 2015 amount.  2015 also saw an increase in the number of staff working for GSOC.<\/p>  <p>  Members of An Garda S&iacute;ochana who wish to make a protected disclosure may do so in accordance with the provisions of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which came into operation on 15 July 2014.  The Act replaced the previous system of making disclosures to a Confidential Recipient.  The 2014 Act put Garda&iacute; in the same position, including receiving the same statutory protections, as others who wish to make a protected disclosure about alleged wrongdoing.<\/p>  <p>  The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 was part of the then Government's comprehensive approach to enhancing the protections available to whistleblowers, including members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Under the Act, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure to GSOC, which is a statutorily independent body, for investigation.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure.  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda&iacute; who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Annual report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which I will shortly be laying before the Houses, states that there were 4 protected disclosures made to GSOC in 2015.  I am satisfied that GSOC is adequately resourced to deal with disclosures made under the 2014 Act.  I am also satisfied that GSOC has the appropriate powers and experience to carry out its role in dealing with any protected disclosures made to them.<\/p>  <p>  As the House will recall I published the report of the O'Higgins Commission of Investigation which had found serious failings in a number of Garda investigations in the Cavan\/Monaghan Division.  Arising from those findings, which were debated in this House, I signalled my intention to refer certain matters to the Policing Authority for their consideration.

This prohibition is restated in the International Protection Act 2015 which is expected to be commenced later this year. The key concern in this regard is that both the asylum process and the wider immigration system would be undermined by giving immigrants who secure entry to the State, on foot of claims to asylum, the same access to employment as immigrants who follow the lawful route to employment. There is an effective visa and immigration system in place for those who wish to lawfully migrate to the State for employment purposes. Any change in public policy with regard to 'right to work' would also have to have regard to the unemployment situation pertaining in the State at any given time. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will, however, be aware that the International Protection Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection, which is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process. The new procedure will streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will significantly reduce the length of time that persons spend awaiting a decision on their protection application. The commencement of the single procedure and its development to a point where it is operating efficiently will respond to this particular recommendation of the Working Group Report. To be clear, the recommendation in the Working Group did not confer an automatic right to work.  Rather it proposed an enabling provision only in the event that the single protection procedure did not operate as anticipated in relation to processing timescales.

The appointment by Government of the relevant nominees under the various criteria set out in the Act will then be subject to approval by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Government will appoint one of the lay members of the Authority, which will also have a lay majority, to be Chairperson. Preparations are also being made in support of the public recruitment, by the new Regulatory Authority, of its Chief Executive whose terms and functions are similarly set out in the 2015 Act. A start-up support team is being established and a suitable premises is being identified from which the new Authority can commence its operations.<\/p>  <p>  These are the initial steps that will enable the members and Chief Executive of the new Regulatory Authority to spear-head the coming into operation of the new legal services regulatory regime.

Under section 7 of the 2015 Act, I will also, by order, appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purposes of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  Following establishment of the Authority and appointment of a Chief Executive the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced.

It should be noted that, under the relevant transitional provisions contained in the 2015 Act, complaints already made to the Law Society under the Solicitors Acts will be brought to completion under that framework and existing law.<\/p>  <p>  In support of the planned and managed commencement of the relevant Parts of the 2015 Act proposed, as I have outlined, between now and the end of this year, an allocation of &euro;1 million has been made under the Justice Vote for 2016 as set-up support for the new Regulatory Authority. Any funding advanced from this allocation will be provided on a recoupable basis.  As an independent corporate body under statute the new Authority will have the power to manage the conduct of its affairs and its finances. Once in operation, the new regulatory regime will be self-funding by means of a levy on the regulated legal professions. The levy will be applied under the terms set out for that specific purpose in Part 7 of the 2015 Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200072#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200072#WRD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[14831\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200072#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the supports in place for children who are housed in direct provision units throughout the State; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1287","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>All children living in direct provision accommodation are in the company of their parents or legal guardians - there are no unaccompanied minors in direct provision accommodation as they are the legal responsibility of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.

The outcome of that visit has been very positive and the Greek authorities have now confirmed that, within the coming months, they will be able to increase significantly the numbers available to Ireland.  In making this commitment, the Greek authorities also signalled that they will be in a position to include small numbers of unaccompanied minors among the groups being allocated.

In addition to accepting applications for refugee status from persons who are inside or at the frontiers of the State the Government agreed, in September 2015 to establish the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and to accept up to 4,000 persons overall under the EU Relocation and Resettlement programmes.  This is made up of approximately 2,622 persons to be relocated to Ireland from other EU Member States (Italy and Greece) under the two EU Relocation Decisions which Ireland has opted-in to, and 520 programme refugees which Ireland pledged to resettle under the voluntary EU Resettlement Programme.  The mechanism by which the balance of 858 persons will be admitted has yet to be decided.  These numbers are expected to be further increased by family reunification.<\/p><p>To date a total of 273 programme refugees have been admitted from Lebanon with the balance of 247 expected to arrive by the end of September, also from Lebanon.  As such, our commitment under the Resettlement programme will be realised in advance of the EU timeframe for implementation.  <\/p><p>The pace of the Relocation programme across the EU has not progressed as fast as Member States has hoped with just 2,195 having been relocated overall across the participating EU Member States.  This is largely due to operational issues in the setting up of the 'hotspot' locations in Italy and Greece, including the task of persuading migrants and asylum seekers to cooperate with the registration process - a prerequisite to entering the Relocation process.<\/p><p>The first group of persons relocated to Ireland from Greece, a Syrian family of ten, who arrived in January have been granted refugee status and are receiving our full support to assist them in their integration into Irish society. <b><\/b>A further group of 31 Syrians are due to arrive this week and an additional 40 persons are provisionally scheduled to arrive towards the end of July. <\/p><p>A team of officials from my Department, including the Director of the Irish Refugee Protection programme, travelled to Greece last week to meet with the Greek authorities to see what more Ireland could do to help speed up the process.  The outcome of that visit has been very positive and Greece has now committed, within the coming months to significantly increasing the numbers available to Ireland.  This will greatly facilitate Ireland's efforts to meet our targets set by Government last September, within a reasonable timescale.  <\/p><p>Prior to establishing the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, in 2014, Ireland introduced a Syrian Humanitarian Admission Programme (SHAP).

The role of the Mechanism was to advise me as to what further action, if any it was appropriate for me to take in respect of each complaint.  A panel of independent barristers carried out the review of each case.<\/p>  <p>  Counsel were free to make any recommendation which they saw fit.  In many cases counsel recommended no further action by me as Minister.  In a number of cases they recommended that I request the Garda S&iacute;ochana Ombudsman Commission to investigate some aspect of the complaints and, having considered those cases and the issues identified by counsel, I did request GSOC, in accordance with section 102 (5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, to carry out investigations.  In other cases it was recommended that I seek a report from the Garda Commissioner and, again, having considered the issues, I sought such a report.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, there were a small number of cases where counsel recommended that an inquiry be carried out into the matters raised in those cases.  In no case did counsel recommend that a Commission of Investigation be established.  In the case referred to in the Deputy's question, counsel recommended a non-statutory inquiry.  I accepted this recommendation and informed the complainants accordingly.  Subsequently, in consultation with the Attorney General on this and the other cases where an inquiry was recommended, I decided that a statutory inquiry under section 42 of the Garda S&iacute;ochana Act would be a more effective instrument for such an inquiry.  This fact was communicated to the family on 14 June. <\/p>  <p>  The advantage of a statutory inquiry under section 42 is that it provides a legislative framework in terms of the powers available to the person appointed to carry out the inquiry.  These include the power to inquire into any aspect of the administration, operation, practice, procedure or conduct of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Given the nature of the complaints made by the family of the person referred to by the Deputy as to the Garda investigation of this person's death these powers are particularly appropriate.  Other powers granted to the inquiry include the power to compel any person in possession of information relevant to the inquiry to provide it; and the power to require the attendance of any person before the inquiry.  These powers are supported by statutory recourse to the High Court in certain circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  I am currently consulting with the Attorney General about the terms of reference for the inquiry and I will be in further contact with the family about the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200073#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200073#WRE02000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"North-South Ministerial Council","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200073#WRE01950"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[17633\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200073#WRE02000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if the meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council has been rearranged after the 10 June 2016 meeting was cancelled; if the issue of the proposed Narrow Water Bridge project can be raised as a priority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Direct Provision system comprises not just full board accommodation but a range of services including health, education and welfare supports.  The principal issue of concern with Direct Provision relates to the period of time in which applicants - many of whom have multiple court appeals - live in the system. <\/p>  <p>  The previous Government established the Working Group on Improvements to the Protection Process including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers, chaired by Judge Bryan McMahon, to report to it on this issue.  The Report of the Working Group has implications for a number of Government Departments and services. <\/p>  <p>  The McMahon Report indicated a two-way approach towards improving the life of persons within the protection process by (i) improving the application process and thereby reducing the length of time spent by applicants in State provided accommodation and (ii) improving the quality of life of those in accommodation through improvements of services within the accommodation system itself but also the supports available through other agencies and bodies.  <\/p>  <p>  The 173 recommendations in the Report were taken forward by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  To date, a total of 91 have been implemented, a further 49 recommendations have been partially implemented or are in progress, and the balance remain under consideration. <\/p>  <p>  Just last week I met with those NGOs who participated on the Working Group to bring them up to date on the implementation of those recommendations and I have agreed with them that we would meet on a regular basis with regard to the reforms planned or in process to improve living conditions in centres.<\/p>  <p>  The International Protection Act 2015 responds to 26 of the Report's recommendations.  The Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection which is a key recommendation of the Report.  The single procedure is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The new procedure will significantly streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will reduce the length of time that persons spend in the Direct Provision system.  Preparations for commencement of the single procedure are progressing.  I expect that the relevant provisions in the Act will be signed into law later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency is working on solutions in respect of the key improvements in living conditions and catering solutions for families.  There are legal and technical challenges which need to be tackled as part of this work.  Catering solutions are already in place in some centres and a pilot project will be commenced shortly at an additional centre with a view to rolling out that model across centres in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  I am also making arrangements for those living in the system to have access to both the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and the Ombudsman.<\/p>  <p>  I should also point out that accommodation centres are subject to regular and frequent inspections by staff of the Reception and Integration Agency and by independent external contractors.  The reports of these inspections are published on the RIA website.  Centres are also subject to inspection by various other State agencies including for example Environmental Health Officers.  The Reception and Integration Agency has implemented a number of policies in all centres dealing with such issues as child protection, sexual and gender based violence and a code of practice for persons working in accommodation centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200074#WRF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[17372\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200074#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 85 of 24 May 2016, the status of the progress update for the 173 recommendations as outlined in the McMahon report; if the report is not available, the reasons for the delay and when it will be available; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Deputy will be aware that this commitment is underlined by very significant investments in Garda resources. <\/p>  <p>  On June 9 2016 the Garda Commissioner launched a five year programme to professionalise, modernise and renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to ensure that it can meet present and future policing and security challenges.  Important elements of the Garda plan include <\/p>  <p>  - increased Garda visibility with crime prevention being the number one priority<\/p>  <p>  - victims being placed at the heart of the Garda service<\/p>  <p>  - introduction of advanced IT systems introduced to enhance the investigation of crime<\/p>  <p>  - enhanced collaboration with national and international partners to tackle and disrupt terrorism and organised crime<\/p>  <p>  The Garda modernisation plan was developed with the benefit of inputs from Garda personnel and community stakeholders, as well as the experience of police forces in other jurisdictions.  The measures in the plan also respond to reports and recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the Garda modernisation programme is strongly supported by the range of investments in policing resources which have been put in place.  These investments will facilitate high visibility policing with the provision of high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles.  Provision under the Capital Plan 2016-2021 includes &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  This is in addition to the &euro;34 million that has been invested in the fleet since 2012 with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the recent additional investment of &euro;55 million in policing resources in 2016 which will make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor, as well as tackling those involved in the recent incidents of violent gang-related crime.<\/p>  <p>  All Garda activities will also undoubtedly benefit from the resources now coming on stream through the Garda recruitment programme, and in particular the Government's commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000.  We are working on measures to accelerate this programme so as to ensure that the Commissioner has the capacity to address the needs of communities throughout the country and into the future.<\/p>  <p>  Taken together, these investments represent a step-change in the overall provision for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and demonstrate the Government's commitment to investing in 21st Century policing so that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive in the community to prevent and tackle crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200075#WRG03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Prevention","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200076#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[17610\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200076#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which the proscription of membership of criminal gangs continues to be considered in areas experiencing such activity; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>The question of providing for an offence of membership of a criminal gang, in a manner similar to the approach taken in the Offences Against the State Acts with regard to membership of a proscribed organisation, has arisen from time to time. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, it is important to understand the issues which arise in seeking to simply outlaw membership of a criminal gang in such a manner.  Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.  Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships,  alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.  <\/p>  <p>  However, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, with a view to  ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular the activities of those involved in organised crime.   <\/p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.  These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.  The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment. <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not. <\/p>  <p>  Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were introduced aiding prosecution for the offences under the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  Provision was also introduced so that where a serious offence is committed as part of or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence.  <\/p>  <p>  More recently, in light of the exceptional threat to the safety of the community arising from the recent activities of criminal gangs, I have asked An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department to see whether there are other changes in the law which might be made to address the reality of groups intent on carrying out a sustained series of killings while endangering the safety of communities.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are considerable complexities to this work which require careful consideration.

In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na implement a number of special targeted strategies, including Operation Thor.  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. This comprehensive operation is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including the recently announced additional allocation of &euro;55 million in 2016. The additional resources make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime under Operation Thor.<\/p><p>Furthermore, investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community. The Government is also investing in Garda airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems.

I am very pleased that this new legislation is now available to support prosecutions arising from the carefully considered Garda strategy to disrupt and oppose criminal activity under Operation Thor.<\/p><p>More generally, Garda&iacute; continue to support the work of a range of local crime prevention initiatives including the well established network of Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch groups countrywide. Garda&iacute; also participate in more formal consultative structures such as Joint Policing Committees which provide an important mechanism for local Garda management to respond to community concerns. Effective community engagement is particularly evident in the success of the Garda Text Alert scheme which was launched in September 2013. Since then the scheme has developed as an important crime prevention mechanism with over 715 local groups involving in excess of 130,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month. I am informed that every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the text alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities as part of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will appreciate that the specific allocation of personnel and other resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, but I am assured that the Garda National Model of Community Policing continues to play a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  This commitment is also very evident in the new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme, which was recently launched by the Commissioner, and as part of which new Community Policing Teams are to be introduced in each Garda District.<\/p><p>Finally, I might add that policing in Kildare, and in all other areas, will undoubtedly benefit from the resources now coming on stream through the Garda recruitment programme, and in particular the Government's commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000.

Ireland has clearly played its part in this regard by sending some of our Naval vessels to the Mediterranean to carry out vital search and rescue missions to ensure the safety of many people trying to come to Europe for protection.  In addition, Irish Aid, the Government's development cooperation programme has been supporting efforts to assist the Syrian people, which by the end of 2015 saw a total of &euro;42 million in support provided with an additional &euro;20 million pledged for 2016.  Ireland has also committed funding to the World Food Programme; some &euro;60 million over the next three years, which is specifically targeted at refugees and in particular Syrian refugees.<\/p><p>In September 2015, the Government agreed to establish the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and to accept up to 4,000 persons overall under the EU Relocation and Resettlement programmes.  This is made up of approximately 2,622 persons to be relocated to Ireland from other EU Member States (Italy and Greece) under the two EU Relocation Decisions which Ireland has opted-in to, and 520 programme refugees which Ireland pledged to resettle under the voluntary EU Resettlement Programme.  The mechanism by which the balance of 858 persons will be admitted has yet to be decided.  Persons accepted here under these Programmes will also have an entitlement to family reunification, if they wish to do so, thereby further increasing the numbers accepted by Ireland. <\/p><p>To date a total of 273 programme refugees have been admitted from Lebanon with the balance of 247 expected to arrive by the end of September, also from Lebanon.  As such, our commitment under the Resettlement programme will be realised in advance of the EU timeframe for implementation.  <\/p><p>The pace of the Relocation programme across the EU has not progressed as fast as Member States has hoped with just 2,195 having been relocated overall across the participating EU Member States.  This is largely due to operational issues in the setting up of the 'hotspot' locations in Italy and Greece, including the task of persuading migrants and asylum seekers to cooperate with the registration process - a prerequisite to entering the Relocation process.<\/p><p>The first group of persons relocated to Ireland from Greece, a Syrian family of ten, who arrived in January have been granted refugee status and are receiving our full support to assist them in their integration into Irish society. <b><\/b>A further group of 31 Syrians are due to arrive this week and an additional 40 persons are provisionally scheduled to arrive towards the end of July.<\/p><p>Officials of my Department have been working closely with Greece over the past number of months and staff have also been seconded to the European Asylum Support Office to establish the relocation programme on the ground in Greece.  In addition, officials from my Department, including the Director of the Irish Refugee Protection programme, travelled to Greece last week to meet with the Greek authorities to progress matters.  The outcome of that visit has been very positive and Greece has now committed, within the coming months to significantly increasing the numbers available to Ireland.  This will greatly facilitate Ireland's efforts to meet our targets set by Government last September, within a reasonable timescale.<\/p><p>Ireland continues to work at EU level on progressing measures to build on existing commitments and platforms, including the Western Balkan Leaders&rsquo; Meeting and the Valletta Summit. Ireland participated in both high-level conferences last autumn and agreed to contribute &euro;3 million to the trust fund for Africa.  In addition, a key element of the EU-Turkey Joint Action Plan, which was agreed by Heads of State in November 2015, is the &euro;3 billion fund supporting Syrian refugees in Turkey.  Ireland's contribution to the fund is &euro;22.9 million. <\/p><p>The migration crisis is a highly challenging issue and is expected to remain a focus of my discussions with my European counterparts in the coming months.  EU Heads of State and Government will also discuss this issue at the forthcoming European Council in June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200076#WRH02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200076#WRH02700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200076#WRH02600"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[17396\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200076#WRH02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"why an organisation (details supplied) must pay a tax liability despite the fact that it was his Department that was at fault for the delay in awarding it charitable status.","asker":"1250","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":234,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that it has made contact with the body in question on a number of occasions, the most recent being on 9 June 2016, requesting additional information in support of its application for charitable tax exemption.<\/p>  <p>  To date the body has not provided the level of information requested, which is delaying a final decision on the issue.

Key among these is the Consumer Protection Code 2012 ('the Code').  The Code, which is a statutory code issued inter alia under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989, sets out many important protections for borrowers in relation to the sale of products (including mortgages), by imposing 'Knowing the Consumer and Suitability' requirements on lenders.  Chapter 5 of the Code contains provisions in terms of how Irish lenders must assess the affordability of credit for an individual borrower, including that the personal and financial circumstances of any consumer applying for credit must be thoroughly assessed to ensure that they are only offered a product that is suitable to their personal circumstances and which they will be able to maintain over the life-time of the product.<\/p><p>In particular, Provision 5.1 of the Code requires that lenders must gather and record certain information on the consumer, including: <\/p><p>&quot;a) Needs and objectives including, where relevant:<\/p><p>i) the length of time for which the consumer wishes to hold a product,<\/p><p>ii) need for access to funds (including emergency funds),<\/p><p>iii) need for accumulation of funds. <\/p><p>b) Personal circumstances including, where relevant: <\/p><p>i) age,<\/p><p>ii) health,<\/p><p>iii) knowledge and experience of financial products, <\/p><p>iv) dependents, <\/p><p>v) employment status, <\/p><p>vi) known future changes to his\/her circumstances. <\/p><p>c) Financial situation including, where relevant:<\/p><p>i) income, <\/p><p>ii) savings,<\/p><p>iii) financial products and other assets, <\/p><p>iv) debts and financial commitments. <\/p><p>d) where relevant, attitude to risk, in particular, the importance of capital security to the consumer.<\/p><p>The regulated entity is only required to seek the information set out at a) to d) above where it is relevant to the assessment of suitability to be carried out under this Chapter.&quot;<\/p><p>Furthermore, Provision 5.9 specifically requires lenders to carry out an assessment of affordability and consider:<\/p><p>&quot;a) the information gathered under parts b) and c) of Provision 5.1; and <\/p><p>b) in the case of all mortgage products provided to personal consumers, the results of a test on the personal consumer's ability to repay the instalments, over the duration of the agreement, on the basis of a 2% interest rate increase, at a minimum, above the interest rate offered to the personal consumer.  This test does not apply to mortgages where the interest rate is fixed for a period of five years or more.&quot;<\/p><p>It should be noted that where regulated entities are providing credit under credit agreements which fall within the scope of the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements Regulations 2010 (S.I. No. 281 of 2010) the Provisions of Chapter 5 of the Code do not apply.  However, these Regulations (which transpose the EU Consumer Credit Directive) separately\u00a0place an obligation on a creditor to assess the creditworthiness of a consumer borrower before entering into a credit agreement with a consumer borrower (Regulation 11).  In addition, the more recent European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (which transpose the EU Mortgage Credit Directive) also places an obligation on creditors - in relation to residential mortgage and other relevant credit agreements - to assess the creditworthiness of a consumer borrower and furthermore places an onus on a lender to provide credit only where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer's obligations are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement (Regulation 19).  Both Regulations provide that a creditor who contravenes these provisions commits an offence and\u00a0the Central Bank's Administrative Sanctions powers are also available to enforce these provisions.<\/p><p>More generally, the Central Bank conducts themed inspections to monitor compliance with all of its codes of conduct (including the Consumer Protection Code) and breaches of regulatory requirements are dealt with using appropriate supervisory powers, including Administrative Sanctions powers, where appropriate.

The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.\u00a0 Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the CCMA and non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  When it was introduced initially the CCMA contained a six month (later extended to 12 months) moratorium for co-operating\u00a0borrowers whose mortgage\u00a0was in arrears (or pre-arrears).\u00a0 This was revised in\u00a02013 and replaced with a requirement that a lender is required to wait at least eight months from the date the arrears arose, before legal action can commence against a co-operating borrower.\u00a0 Separately, regardless of how long it takes the lender to assess a case, and provided that the borrower is co-operating, the lender must give three months' notice to the borrower before they can commence legal proceedings where the lender does not offer an alternative repayment arrangement or the borrower does not accept an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender.\u00a0 This gives co-operating borrowers time to consider other options such as a Personal Insolvency Arrangement. <\/p>  <p>  The combined effect of these two protections (an eight month protection period and a requirement for three months' notice) is that, for a co-operating borrower, legal proceedings may not commence until three months from the date the letter (setting out one of the above positions) is issued or eight months from the date the arrears arose, whichever date is later. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to also note that the commencement of the court process is not a signal that a repossession will occur   it may often be the case that the process then prompts borrowers to re-engage with their bank and to find a solution.\u00a0 Often these cases are adjourned to allow both parties time to find a sustainable solution.<\/p>  <p>  Last year the Supreme Court ruled on an issue that arose regarding the extent to which non-compliance with the CCMA could be adjudicated by the Courts in a repossession case between a lender plaintiff and a borrower defendant.\u00a0 In that regard, the Supreme Court found that the CCMA prohibited lenders from seeking an order for possession where the moratorium was not complied with but that it did not prohibit the seeking of an order for possession in other circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that in a repossession case before the Courts a borrower's rights are not confined to the provisions of the CCMA.\u00a0\u00a0 The 2013 Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act has provided a new statutory\u00a0avenue to borrowers in a repossession case involving a primary dwelling to seek an adjournment of the repossession case to allow the borrower the opportunity to consider and, if so decided, to propose a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) to creditors in order to resolve an unsustainable debt position.\u00a0 If this is approved by the Court, the debtor would then be in a position to formally propose an alternative and sustainable payment arrangement irrespective of whether or not the primary home lender considered or rejected such an arrangement under the CCMA.\u00a0 Also, under a PIA there is an onus on the personal insolvency practitioner to,\u00a0 insofar as is reasonably practicable, formulate a proposal on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in, or cease to occupy, a private principal residence.\u00a0 Even if such a PIA proposal is rejected by creditors, the Personal Insolvency Act has now been amended to provide that the proposal can then be submitted to a Court for adjudication.<\/p>  <p>  The numbers in mortgage arrears have been steadily declining.\u00a0 Data released by the Central Bank on 10 June shows that to end-Q1 2016, the number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses (PDH) has declined for the last eleven quarters.\u00a0 Some 120,447 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured.\u00a0 It is clear that where a borrower actively engages with their lender with a view to agreeing a sustainable arrangement to address their mortgage arrears, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that borrower will be able to remain in their family home.\u00a0 Consequently, I would urge borrowers in this situation to contact the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) who are in a position to provide free and confidential support to borrowers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200078#WRK01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department

Where the child is living full-time with the father only, then Child Benefit will be payable to the father. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme does not specifically provide for the payment to the father where the child is also resident with the mother although there are a small number of child benefit claims in payment to the father in situations where the parents live together.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation was first introduced in 1974 to provide for payment to the mother.  This was seen as a progressive step, the principle of payment to the mother being subordinate to the primary objective that payments had to be for the benefit of the child.  Provision is in place to transfer payment to another individual in certain circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  The Department regularly reviews all of its schemes, including Child Benefit, in order to ensure that they are still delivering on their original policy aims and objectives and it is my intention to examine this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200082#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":391,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200082#WRO01100"},{"type":"question","counter":392,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[17423\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200082#WRO01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) under the carer's allowance scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":393,"content":"<p>Carer's Allowance (CA) is a social assistance payment made to persons who are providing full-time care and attention to a relevant person\/persons and whose income falls below certain limits. <\/p><p>The Department informs me that, to date, no application by the person concerned for CA has been received.  <\/p><p>Accordingly, I have arranged for an application form (CR1) to issue, which the person concerned should complete and return as soon as possible, in order that the Department may determine their entitlement to CA.

Against this background, the Government set out Departmental allocations for Oireachtas approval based on ensuring that fiscal targets were met while Departments continued to deliver key services at a time of increased demand.<\/p>  <p>  The backdrop to additional spending provided by way of Supplementary Estimate in 2015 was that, with tax revenues well over forecast, the deficit target for 2015 could be achieved while additional expenditure could be accommodated.

My Department is in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles.  There is regular reporting to Government on these matters, and information is published monthly, as part of the Exchequer Statement.<\/p>  <p>  The end-May Exchequer returns show that most Departments continue to manage expenditure within profile.  However, certain pressures are evident, in particular in the Health sector.  As outlined in the April Stability Programme Update, there is now scope to accommodate additional expenditure increases in 2016 while continuing to deliver against the key fiscal targets.  In this context, the Government has decided to allow for targeted increases to support the delivery of key services in the Health Sector and by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

There have been some difficulties in recruiting and retaining Specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services staff, particularly consultant psychiatrists.  Due to these operational, staff recruitment and retention challenges at local level, a number of referrals in the 16-18 year age group are dealt with by local Adult Teams under the appropriate CAMHS procedures.  The Executive is addressing this issue on an on-going basis.   <\/p>  <p>  There are 67 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services Teams and extra services for special service needs have also been introduced in recent years.  The HSE is committed to addressing the service needs of the 16-18 age cohort by expanding the staffing and range of CAMHS team coverage on an ongoing basis, supported by prioritisation of funding from the additional mental health funding allocation in 2016 as outlined in the HSE Mental Health Operational Plan 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Along with expansion of CAMHS team services, the Plan provides for improved collaboration between the Mental Health and Primary Care Divisions in the development of Early Intervention and Counselling services specifically for young people under 18 years of age.  Additional funding has also been provided for expansion of Jigsaw Services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, to complement the existing services funded by the HSE. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200091#WRX02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Data","counter":690,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200092#WRY00200"},{"type":"question","counter":691,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[17624\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200092#WRY00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children with mental health difficulties who have been admitted to adult units in the past 12 months; the adult units here that children have been sent to in the past 12 months; the length of time each child stayed in the adult unit; if she will include a breakdown of the hospitals and number of admissions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":692,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

This is reflected in the Programme for Government and the Energy White Paper. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to: <\/p>  <p>  - providing support for community-led projects in the initial stages of development, planning and construction; and <\/p>  <p>  - establishing a register of community benefit payments, and examining shared-ownership opportunities for renewable energy projects in local communities supporting, in particular, the emerging energy co-operative movement as one means of facilitating community participation. <\/p>  <p>  - These commitments reflect the\u00a0extensive range of actions set out in the Energy\u00a0White Paper\u00a0published last December. I would in particular draw the Deputy's attention to\u00a0Chapter 4 of the Energy White Paper and the enabling actions for widening the opportunity for community participation, \u00a0set out therein, which also include: <\/p>  <p>  - supporting community participation in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, via the SEAI, to share best practice, provide information and ensure that local strategies align with broader Government policy;<\/p>  <p>  - facilitating access to the national grid for designated renewable electricity projects, and developing mechanisms to allow communities to avail of payment for electricity, such as the ability to participate in power purchase agreements;<\/p>  <p>  - providing funding and supports for community-led projects in the initial stages of development, planning and construction. These will be defined using criteria such as scheme size and degree of community ownership; providing a new support scheme for renewable electricity which will be available from 2016; <\/p>  <p>  - developing a framework for how communities can share in the benefits of substantial new energy infrastructure which is located in their area; <\/p>  <p>  - exploring the scope to provide market support for micro generation. This will be informed by an SEAI analysis of the potential of technologies in the field of small-scale wind, solar, micro-CHP and small-scale hydro;<\/p>  <p>  - engage with local government on advising consumers on energy efficiency initiatives and clean energy options, integrating energy options, scoping the opportunities for demand and supply related local energy action through integrating energy issues into local area planning, and bringing stakeholders together to find locally appropriate solutions that bridge the gap between demand and supply (e.g. biomass fuel, district heating solutions).<\/p>  <p>  Several of the actions are already being implemented and the remaining actions will\u00a0be taken forward as part of the process of implementing\u00a0the White Paper and Programme for Government\u00a0commitments. <\/p>  <p>  Many communities are interested in being involved in the energy transition as evidenced by the participation in SEAI&rsquo;s Better Energy Communities and Sustainable Energy Communities programmes. Already, more than 12,000 homes and hundreds of shared community facilities have been upgraded through this programme.

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty, which meet the defined eligibility criteria.  The scheme is delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.  The homes of the scheme beneficiaries are retrofitted free of charge, thus making those homes more energy efficient.  The measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation.  Since the scheme commenced in 2000, 123,174 homes around the country have received energy efficiency measures at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;161.75m. &euro;16.5m has been allocated to the scheme for 2016. <\/p><p>Applications for the scheme are dealt with on a first come, first served basis.  Once an application is made, contractors operating on behalf of SEAI survey the home to determine what measures are most suitable for that home.  Once a survey has been completed, homes are issued to SEAI&rsquo;s panel of appointed contractors and works typically proceed within a matter of days.  The average waiting time from application to service delivery\u00a0is 92 days, with the longest waiting period being six months.\u00a0 Demand for the scheme remains strong, clearly demonstrating its potential to continue to deliver energy efficiency gains and related benefits, such as reduced energy costs and better health outcomes. <\/p><p>The following table illustrates the number of homes completed\u00a0in the last five years of the scheme's operation, along with the number of homes completed in the\u00a0previous ten years of the scheme and the number of homes completed so far in 2016. <table><tr><th>Better Energy Warmer Homes\u00a0\u00a0<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Pre-2010<\/td><td>2011<\/td><td>2012<\/td><td>2013<\/td><td>2014<\/td><td>2015<\/td><td>2016 ytd<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Number of Homes Completed<\/td><td>61,412<\/td><td>20,388<\/td><td>12,175<\/td><td>9,803<\/td><td>9,056<\/td><td>6,867<\/td><td>3,473<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Value of grants paid &euro;<\/td><td>56,700,000<\/td><td>21,400,000<\/td><td>20,500,000<\/td><td>17,553,156<\/td><td>20,655,606<\/td><td>18,136,198<\/td><td>6,800,000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The Deputy will note that the average spend per home has increased considerably over the lifetime of the scheme.  This is attributable to significant improvements in the building regulations, particularly with regard to draught proofing, that SEAI appointed contractors must meet\u00a0and an increase in the average depth of renovation per home.  Increasing the number of measures the typical home receives adds to the cost of the programme but delivers more energy savings and warmer, more comfortable\u00a0homes to\u00a0scheme beneficiaries. <\/p><p>SEAI has also been piloting a limited number of deeper interventions to homes that cannot be treated by some of the typical measures.  These cannot be applied for but rather are chosen by SEAI from the pool of existing applicants based on a needs based assessment of the home.  SEAI&rsquo;s surveyors have strict guidelines to follow and the clients identified are those who are at the extreme end of fuel poverty and deprivation.  Piloting deeper interventions\u00a0through the Warmer Homes scheme is necessary to deliver learnings on the impact such interventions can have on those in energy poverty and also to ensure that the skills needed for such works are developed in the Irish construction sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200094#WRAA00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":753,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200094#WRAA00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Transport Authority Data","counter":752,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200094#WRAA00500"},{"type":"question","counter":753,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[17406\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200094#WRAA00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 64 of 14 June 2016, if the National Transport Authority produced and submitted a written report independent of Galway City Council to Galway City Council following their analysis of the traffic situation in Galway City culminating in the subsequent draft Galway transport strategy.","asker":"1316","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":754,"content":"<p>\u200bI understand from the National Transport Authority (NTA) that it did not produce and submit a written report, independent of the Council, to Galway City Council relating to an analysis of the traffic situation in Galway City,\u00a0which led\u00a0to the subsequent drafting of the draft Galway Transport Strategy.

","asker":"1243","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":778,"content":"<p>There is no separate legal definition of the term &ldquo;au pair&rdquo; in Irish legislation, and individuals described as &ldquo;au pairs&rdquo;, &ldquo;nannies&rdquo; or &ldquo;child-minders&rdquo; are not exempted or treated as separate categories of workers under Irish employment law. Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment (written or verbal), on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees, including entitlement to the national minimum wage.  All employers, including those in private homes, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  Where the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), which is responsible for securing compliance with employment legislation, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, the WRC will investigate with a view to establishing whether a person has statutory entitlements under employment law. Complaints involving au pairs are considered on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the facts of each case. <\/p>  <p>  The recent WRC decision regarding an individual working as an Au Pair does not constitute any change to existing employment law and any persons working under a contract of employment must continue to have the full protection of employment law.  I have no plans to review the status of au pairs with a view to deeming persons determined to be employees to be outside the scope of employment law.  My Department&rsquo;s remit in this area is primarily concerned with ensuring that those people found to be employees can enforce their rights, as provided for under employment rights legislation.     <\/p>  <p>  Finally, under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, certain reckonable components may be taken into account for all workers to determine an employee&rsquo;s average hourly rate.  In this context, if an employer provides an employee with full board and lodgings, or lodgings only or full board only, a monetary allowance can be included as reckonable pay (the term &lsquo;full board&rsquo; means an entitlement to meals during the day) as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;54.13 for board and lodgings per week, or &euro;7.73 per day;<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;32.14 for board only per week, or &euro;4.60 per day;<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;21.85 for lodgings only per week, or &euro;3.14 per day.<\/p>  <p>  The inclusion of this provision in the National Minimum Wage legislation was recommended by the Inter-Departmental Group on Implementation of a National Minimum Wage.  It was the view of the Inter-Departmental Group that the monetary value of the allowances for the purpose of the National Minimum Wage would not be set at market value but rather would be similar to the amount provided for in Employment Regulation Orders. <\/p>  <p>  The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (National Minimum Hourly Rate of Pay) Order 2000 (SI No. 95\/2000) provided for the amounts specified.  There are currently no plans to make changes to these provisions.  However, I am very conscious of the passage of time since these rates were set and I will keep this in mind in my consideration of this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200094#WRAA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":780,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200095#WRBB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":781,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[17547\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062200095#WRBB00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her plans to put mechanisms in place so that retired workers can access the State's industrial relations machinery when their pensions are affected.","asker":"1259","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":782,"content":"<p>I fully appreciate the concerns of retired and deferred members of pension schemes whose schemes are being restructured, particularly where such restructuring may impact on existing or potential pension benefits.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the question of pensioner groups having access to the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery in pursuing pension scheme grievances is an issue to which careful consideration has been given.<\/p>  <p>  In doing so, it was important to bear in mind that the industrial relations system in Ireland is voluntary in nature both as regards access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.

These requirements will be fully introduced in 2016 following the publication of new Childcare Regulations. The level 5 requirement will come into effect as of 30 June 2016 for newly-registering services and for existing services on 31 December 2016.  As of 31 December 2016, staff members must hold a level 6 qualification to be permitted to work as ECCE room leaders.<\/p>  <p>  Following the introduction of these changes only those staff who hold the necessary qualification will be in position to meet the ratio requirements in early years settings.<\/p>  <p>  The Community Employment programme is administered by the Department of Social Protection.  This programme is a labour market activation measure designed to help people who are long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged people to get back to work by offering part-time and temporary placements in jobs based within local communities. <\/p>  <p>  The Community Employment Childcare Programme is a three year programme which also includes upskilling participants to qualify for a Level 5 qualification on the National Qualifications Framework in Early Childhood Care and Education.  After placement, participants are encouraged to seek part-time and full-time jobs elsewhere based on the experience and new skills they have gained while in a Community Employment programme. <\/p>  <p>  CE workers potentially form part of the adult:child ratios in some community childcare facilities.  The new qualification requirement will mean that such workers will no longer be permitted to count towards the required adult:child ratio unless they hold the required minimum qualification.  <\/p>  <p>  At the request of this Department, the City and County Childcare Committees have established a project to examine the impact of these changes on the sustainability of community childcare services that are currently dependent on CE workers to meet the ratio requirements.  <\/p>  <p>  This Department has advised childcare providers who consider that the sustainability of their service is at risk as a result of this measure to contact their local City or County Childcare Committee immediately to discuss this matter.<\/p>  <p>  There is a possibility that Community Childcare Services may not wish to participate in the CE programme if they do not benefit from it.
