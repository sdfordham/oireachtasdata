It is not surprising that the Taoiseach was so anxious to get rid of this House.  He tried his utmost to destroy this House and if he had succeeded, the Water Services Bill would have been passed last night to provide for the imposition of water charges.  This is the straw that is breaking the camel's back for the people of Ireland.  We are the last bastion of democracy in this country now.  That is why every Member of this House who will be in attendance for the duration of the debate bears an enormous responsibility.  I have never received more representations on any other issue since becoming a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas than I have received about the Irish Water issue.<\/p><p>The Water Services Bill has been passed by the D&aacute;il under the guillotine, which should not have been the case.  There should have been a full, open and democratic debate on the legislation.  I appeal to every Member of this House to listen to his or her conscience and vote against the Bill, vote down the Government, reject its proposals and let the will of the people speak.  I hope the Leader will confirm that tomorrow's schedule will include an Order of Business.  If not, my party will oppose the Order of Business today.<\/p><p>I welcome the decision by President Barack Obama to normalise relations with Cuba through an exchange of ambassadors.  This is the most significant shift in US policy towards Cuba for over 54 years.  The US President and the Cuban President, Ra&uacute;l Castro - with the backing of his brother, Fidel Castro - have both addressed their respective nations on this issue and I welcome this step.  That said, the full normalisation of relations will depend on the approval of both the US Congress and Senate, which will not be forthcoming at this point in time, given that the Republicans are in the majority in both Houses.  There is very significant opposition to this move in Miami and other parts of the United States.  There has been an improvement in Cuban-US relations with the release of an American citizen who was in prison in Cuba and of several Cubans who were in prison in Miami.  <\/p><p>US international relations have been damaged by the embargo on Cuba which has been in place for the last 54 years.  The difficulties the embargo caused for the Cuban medical system have been evident throughout that period.  US citizens, from the &quot;land of the free&quot; and &quot;home of the brave&quot;, could not leave the US and travel  90 miles to Cuba.  This country should be very proud of the fact that we have exchanged ambassadors with Cuba throughout the period of the US embargo.  I met the Cuban ambassador in Dublin recently and am delighted that our good relations with that country still stand.  We should now be ready, willing and able to increase our contacts with Cuba.  I would suggest that Aer Lingus, which operates from the US, should be planning ahead in the context of US tourists being able to visit Cuba.  Yesterday was a very significant day and I welcome the announcement made by the US and Cuban Presidents.  I might add that Fianna F&aacute;il has been outstanding in this regard, having allowed Aeroflot flights to fly from Shannon Airport to Cuba, despite the policy of the US.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800003#B00500","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1418898600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I am very concerned that the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre is currently at risk of losing its Leeson Street headquarters, where it has been based for the past 28 years.  The building is being sold by a NAMA debtor.  The Rape Crisis Centre has managed to raise &euro;1 million from donations to buy the building but there is still a shortfall of &euro;800,000.  The centre is very much dependent on its State grant but that grant does not cover the cost of renting accommodation.<\/p><p>As every woman will know, the Rape Crisis Centre is a front-line organisation that protects women at the most vulnerable time of their lives after they have been subjected to rape or attempted rape.  It would be an incredible shame if NAMA  was permitted to sell the centre's headquarters out from under it.  We are all aware that NAMA has made enormous progress in selling assets.  That said, its mandate also requires that NAMA delivers a social dividend to the people of Ireland which I believe it is not doing.  I ask the Leader to raise the matter of the Rape Crisis Centre and its headquarters with the Minister concerned.  It would be an incredible shame if, after 28 years of excellent service, the Rape Crisis Centre would lose its essential Leeson Street premises.<\/p><p>I also wish to raise the issue of a pregnant woman who has suffered a serious head trauma and is on life support in Beaumont Hospital, as reported in several newspapers today.  This tragic case, of which the Minister for Health and senior HSE officials are aware, underlines the flaws in the current legislation governing pregnancy.  I welcome the comments by the Minister yesterday to the effect that the current legislation does not protect the long-term health of women and does not cover situations of fatal foetal abnormality.  The Labour Party's position is that the legislation should be amended accordingly.  <\/p><p>I am aware there is no appetite at the moment in Government to deal with another referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, but this issue must be kept to the forefront of our minds.  We need to have a debate in this House, on the anniversary of the enactment of the legislation, to determine the extent to which the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act is protecting the health of women and performing its long-term role.<\/p><p>I am gravely concerned about an issue relating to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour, which depends to a great extent on the business of the Stena Line ferry company.  That business is worth approximately &euro;7 million per annum to the town.  There is a common perception that D&uacute;n Laoghaire is a well-off area and that the loss of such business would not have any impact.  However, D&uacute;n Laoghaire has suffered dreadfully in recent years, particularly since the economic downturn.  It is effectively a region of Dublin and it is unfortunate that D&uacute;n Laoghaire is losing out to Dublin Port.  There is an issue here in terms of the interests of the regional areas of Dublin and its centre.<\/p> <p>I ask that we take account of the balance of rights in this situation.  I would appreciate it if the Leader would raise this issue with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800003#B00600","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418899200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Leyden that the eyes of the people are on this House today.  I congratulate the Leader on ensuring that we will have a full debate on the Water Services Bill and that it will not be foreshortened by the use of the guillotine.  This is a worthy recognition of the important role the Seanad can play and I hope that the debate will be as useful as might be expected.<\/p><p>Senator Leyden also referred to Cuba.  There are changes taking place in the world and some of the most significant of these are probably happening in Russia.  The huge drop in the value of the rouble in recent weeks has been quite dramatic.  I recall that approximately two months ago I highlighted the fact that the price of Brent oil had been reduced and I criticised the fact that evidence of this was not apparent in petrol stations.  However, the reduction is now being passed on to motorists and at the petrol station closest to my home, the price currently stands at &euro;1.35 per litre.  While this is a dramatic reduction, I am not sure it reflects the overall drop in the price of Brent oil.  If we want to maintain our competitiveness, we must ensure that energy costs continue to be reduced.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden referred to D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It was only a year ago that plans were announced for the development of a new terminal to allow cruise ships to dock in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  At present, such ships cannot dock there.  This development is very important in the context of tourism.  Some very good news is emanating from Shannon to the effect that the number of flights into and out of the airport has increased substantially since the change of management took place there.  This is a reminder of the importance of giving individual units the freedom to do what they want rather than having them controlled from elsewhere.  From the point of view of tourism, the entire Shannon area will benefit from the increase in flights to which I refer.  Let us ensure that this continues to be the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800004#C00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1418899200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I wish to raise two issues.  First, I congratulate the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and the Cabinet on agreeing the criteria for the selection of the European capital of culture 2020.  This is very important for cities throughout the country that wish to submit applications in respect of this prestigious designation.  The people of the city of Galway, in which I live, have been waiting anxiously for the launch of the applications process.  Winning the European capital of culture designation would represent a huge opportunity to highlight the richness and diversity of cultural life in Galway.  Major work has been ongoing for some time on the tender proposal, so yesterday's decision by the Government is welcome.  According to the EU, being awarded European capital of culture status has led to the regeneration of cities, a raised international profile for cities, an enhancement of the image of cities in the eyes of their inhabitants, the rejuvenation of cities' culture and a significant increase in tourism.  I wish all the cities applying for designation as European capital of culture every success.<\/p><p>It is important to acknowledge that Christmas can be very lonely for many people throughout the country.  Yesterday, I met representatives from the Samaritans in Galway who wanted to raise awareness of the organisation's freefone number 116 123.  This a new number, which is operational 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, is one of the European Commission's easy to remember freefone numbers that are designed to assist people.  Christmas can be a very difficult time for the older people who may be lonely or who may be the subject of elder abuse.  The delegation from the Samaritans informed me that people can contact them about anything.  In Galway alone, the Samaritans receive 800 calls each week.  The number of calls has increased significantly since the new freefone number came into use in March.  I commend the six telephone operators which have funded the freefone service to the tune of &euro;100,000 per year.  Some 1,500 volunteers are working for the Samaritans throughout the country.  It is important for people who experience difficulties to realise that they are not alone and that they can call the non-judgmental individuals who operate the freefone helpline to which I refer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800004#C00300","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1418899200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I support the comments made by Senator Leyden in respect of the dramatic developments in the relationship between Cuba and the United States.  We have been made aware that Pope Francis, who celebrated his 78th birthday yesterday, played a crucial role in brokering the landmark deal between the United States and Cuba.  As more details emerge about the watershed normalising of diplomatic relations between the two countries, we are learning more about the instrumental role the Pope played in bringing American and Cuban leaders together.  Given that relations between the US and Cuba were frozen for 50 years, what happened yesterday represents a paradigm shift.  The Pope wrote a letter to President Obama and President Ra&uacute;l Castro of Cuba during the summer in which he urged the two to mend the relationship between their countries.<\/p><p>President Obama really seems to have rediscovered his, to use a crude word, mojo particularly in view of what was announced yesterday and the compassion he has shown towards undocumented Irish and others in the United States.  The Pope, whose mantra is &quot;mercy and compassion&quot;, is 78 years of age and he has provided extraordinary leadership and encouraged people to be more tolerant, understanding and forgiving.  Despite the negative reaction of some Cuban exiles in Florida, I am of the view that this process is going to move forward.  President Obama is on a mission and he intends to open a US embassy in Cuba.  In addition, 50 American prisoners in Cuba are to be released.  People have visited the Houses of the Oireachtas to request our help in having the Cuban five - who were convicted of being involved in espionage in the United States over 20 years ago - freed.  President Obama has indicated that he intends to release these individuals.  This is a wonderfully inspiring time for everyone.  Showing leadership is what it is all about - it is not about engaging in populist politics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800004#C00400","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1418899200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>At this time of year people struggle and find themselves in very challenging situations.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is one of many charities which do fantastic work.  It is important to recognise businesses that go the extra mile to do something different.

However, it has been announced that the hotel will remain open in order to accommodate people sent to it by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The staff at the hotel will work on a rota basis and free of charge during the Christmas period.  The companies which supply goods to the hotel will provide food and other essentials in order to ensure that less fortunate people in Clare will have an enjoyable Christmas.  The meitheal displayed by the staff and management at Hotel Doolin should encourage their counterparts at other hotels to realise that sometimes giving up one's Christmas is a good thing to do.  It is not about money, rather it is about time.  What the people at Hotel Doolin are doing is noble, honourable and reflects the spirit of the people of Clare and Irish people in general.

These visitors will contribute &euro;3.6 billion to our economy, which is up 9% on 2013.  Much of this success is due to the excellent marketing of the Wild Atlantic Way, which is making a huge contribution to tourism in this country.  The fantastic work being done by Tourism Ireland in promoting Ireland abroad, in particular in the United States, is very significant.  The additional flights between Ireland and the US this year also contributed very significantly.<\/p><p>Next year is looking particularly good with new Aer Lingus flights from Washington DC to Dublin, new United Airlines flights from Chicago to Dublin, a new Transavia service from Paris to Dublin, Finnair flights from Helsinki to Dublin and flights from Gothenburg in Sweden.

We will have an Order of Business tomorrow.  It will be no different from any other day.  We will have normal business.  We are not in an emergency situation or anything like that.  It is time for cool heads.<\/p><p>Senator Leyden welcomed the decision of President Obama on normalising relations with Cuba, as has everyone, but as the Senator pointed out, there are a lot of steps to be taken in the meantime.  Senators White, Mullins and Norris praised the role played, and the leadership shown, by Pope Francis in brokering a deal between both countries.  It is welcome that such negotiations are going on.  I am sure there is still a long road to travel but we wish them well in their negotiations.  I note the point Senator Norris made in regard to the freezing of the bank account, which he raised some months ago.  I hope that will be rectified as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden referred to the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and the possibility of it losing its headquarters.  It would be very regrettable if that were to happen.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt about it.  I will certainly make representations to the Minister.  I do not know whether the Minister can interfere with NAMA on it.  I hope some resolution can be found in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden also called for a debate on the need to review the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  We will certainly give consideration to that in the new year.<\/p><p>Senators Hayden and Quinn spoke about D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour and Dublin Port.  They mentioned the possibility that Stena Line will leave D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  There is no doubt that such a move would be a massive blow to D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I remember the damage that was done to my own city of Waterford when a major carrier left the local port.  Indeed, that decision is continuing to damage the Port of Waterford.  I note the points that were made about the competition between D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour and Dublin Port.  I will certainly bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.  Competition between ports is of paramount importance.  Senator Quinn referred to the competitiveness of Shannon Airport and the benefits that have accrued to the area and the tourism sector as a result.  It is certainly worth considering.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn referred to the need to be very vigilant about monitoring energy costs in the interests of competitiveness.<\/p><p>Senator Naughton welcomed the agreement on the criteria for the designation of the European capital of culture.  I am sure this will be welcomed by people in all cities, including Galway and Waterford, and by all Senators who have an interest in the tender competition for that prestigious designation.<\/p><p>Senator Naughton praised the work of the Samaritans and highlighted the availability of the organisation's helpline.  We all agree that the Samaritans have done excellent voluntary work throughout the length and breadth of the country over the years.<\/p><p>Senator Conway praised the work of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  He mentioned that an hotel in County Clare has kindly offered to give generously of its time and money in order to help people who are less well off than others over the Christmas period.<\/p><p>I do not see that there is a need for the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Craughwell.  As I said earlier, we will have plenty of time to debate the Water Services Bill 2014.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins welcomed the excellent tourism figures.  He said that the 8% increase in tourist numbers this year has generated great benefits for the economy.  I suggest this has resulted from various measures taken by the Government, including the VAT reduction and the removal of the travel tax.  Senator Mullins also welcomed the new flights and routes that are planned for 2015 and 2016, which will lead to further tourism benefits in the years ahead.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins reminded us of the importance of thinking about road safety over the Christmas period.<\/p><p>We thank the Whip of the Fianna F&aacute;il Group, Senator Wilson, for the ongoing provision of a pair for one of our colleagues who is severely incapacitated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800005#D02300","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418900400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800006#E00200","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1418900400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>We would have reciprocated that practice during the term of the last Government when someone on the other side of the House was seriously ill.

I appreciate that additional time has been allocated by the Seanad to consider the Bill before the House adjourns for the Christmas break.  I acknowledge that and thank the Members.  I want to express my appreciation to everyone for organising this debate.  In other circumstances, I would have preferred to have a less condensed schedule for the consideration of the Bill, but I will shortly outline the rationale for the Government&rsquo;s efforts to enact the Bill before the end of the year.  <\/p> <p>There were 40 hours of robust debate on the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  During the debate we had an extensive exchange of views from a large number of the Members both on the provisions of the Bill and wider issues surrounding both the water sector reforms and the funding model for Irish Water and various other issues.  I will not say we had full agreement on many of the matters but I reflected on the contributions of Deputies and took on board what they said.

A multitude of issues arise in this regard which are not easily solvable.<\/p><p>As was suggested during the D&aacute;il debates, a constitutional referendum on the ownership of Irish Water could lead to calls for similar referenda for other infrastructure considered to be of strategic importance or for other State-owned enterprises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800011#L00500","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1418902500,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Good.

Senators must also take into consideration that during all of this I have borne in mind the advice we received from the Attorney General.  I also had to take into consideration all of the issues relating to unintended consequences of putting such a provision into the Constitution.  The Constitution is our document and bedrock and we must think very carefully before we make amendments to it.  In this regard, I strongly believe the provisions contained in section 2 for a plebiscite are the appropriate way of ensuring that the views of the people are sought.<\/p><p>I also tabled an amendment to section 8, which deals with customer dispute resolution.  This amendment was to clarify that the right of the customer to bring a dispute to the Commission for Energy Regulation could not be frustrated by any delay in Irish Water resolving its own dispute resolution.  Section 32 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water is obliged to deal with any customer disputes in accordance with a code of practice to be approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  However, I was happy to bring forward the amendment to reflect the limited but fair concerns of Deputies and bring full clarity on the application of section 8.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s objective is to make the new domestic water charges system simpler and fairer, providing more clarity to households and ensuring water charges are affordable for customers of Irish Water.  The Government also wants to strengthen the legislative framework within which Irish Water will operate and to give people certainty that Irish Water will remain in public ownership.  The Bill includes measures to address all of these objectives.<\/p><p>As the domestic meter programme has progressed and public discourse on the water reform progress has intensified, it has become apparent that the charging regime was not publically accepted.  This created uncertainty and other concerns for customers regarding their bills in 2015 and beyond.  I must accept this.  As a result, the Government took time to reflect on the demanding reform programme being implemented to a challenging timescale.  As I have often said in this regard, the scale of the project was underestimated and its timescale was certainly underestimated.  Collectively we have listened to the people&rsquo;s concerns and we have responded.<\/p><p>The changes to the charging system as a result of the Bill will ensure the system is defined by four key attributes.  There are certainty, as every household will know what its capped bills will be until the end of 2018; simplicity, as there will be only two charging structures and a water conservation grant; affordability, as the absolute maximum net cost is now just over &euro;3 per week, and for single households it will be approximately &euro;1.15 per week, which is much less than 1% of most people&rsquo;s incomes or benefits and puts our water bills among the lowest in Europe; and conservation, as with a meter, households will have the opportunity to pay less than the capped bill and can use the water conservation grant to make changes to avail of lower charges.<\/p><p>I accept many people are in financial difficulty and given my other areas of responsibility as a Minister, I probably know this more than most.<\/p> <p>I will insist that Irish Water distinguishes between those who want to pay but cannot and those who simply refuse to pay.  Those who want to pay but are in financial difficulty will be able to avail of easy-pay options and instalment plans, just as with any other utility.  I was determined to ensure that was the case.  Those who do not register and do not pay will not be able to avail of the water conservation grant and will be liable for a late payment fee. <br\/>The Bill also addresses a number of other concerns expressed by the public.  It provides a robust additional safeguard against the danger of privatisation, specifically, the will of the people.  In the unlikely event that any future Government should seek to sell Irish Water, we are ensuring that the public must be consulted in a plebiscite and that a majority of those who vote must support the proposal.  It provides for changes to strengthen Irish Water&rsquo;s governance, part of a wider reorganisation of the corporate governance structures of Ervia and of Irish Water.  The Government is putting in place a unitary board at Ervia, which will also be responsible for Irish Water and the gas networks subsidiary.  The new board will provide for stronger governance and improved setting of strategic objectives for each of the component companies.  Advertisements in relation to this are already in place on the new public appointments website, <i>stateboards.ie<\/i>, and I am sure many colleagues here have seen them.<br\/>The proposed public water forum will ensure that the voice of Irish Water&rsquo;s customers is listened to, and is influential in the strategic direction of this utility.  That is important.  The proposed customer dispute resolution service, to be provided by the Commission for Energy Regulation, will have a legal basis, and will provide customers with the same access to resolution of unresolved complaints as energy customers currently have.  These new structures will help Irish Water identify where its customer service needs improvement.<br\/>Many people, especially in this House, have expressed concern about Irish Water obtaining PPS numbers for the purposes of registration.  This was a necessary underpinning of the former charging regime, which was based mainly on allowances rather than capped charges, but I have had to reflect on that.  I reflected in great detail, and the Government has decided that the new arrangements should be based on self-declaration and appropriate audit.  Therefore, PPS numbers will not be required for registration.<br\/>The Government package announced last month also referred to a suite of measures which would apply if households did not pay.  These will be brought forward in separate legislation in the new year, and will be the subject of extensive stakeholder engagement and pre-legislative scrutiny. <br\/>The changes provided for in this Bill do not change the fundamentals of the Government&rsquo;s water sector reform programme.  Ireland&rsquo;s public water system was and remains in need of changes to the way it operates, and the level of funding it receives.  It needs a complete overhaul.  The previous system of providing water services through local authorities was not working properly, despite the best efforts of the dedicated and experienced staff involved, and I must acknowledge these fantastic people, who have been doing fantastic work over many generations, sometimes in very difficult circumstances.  It is through no fault of theirs that we must go down this route.  We have to face the fact that local authorities were restricted in their ability to borrow, so they could not invest adequately in the system.  The time taken to make decisions to invest was often slow and bureaucratic and at times it was inefficient.  Planning for new water services largely, though not exclusively, stopped at the county boundary, so there was limited opportunity to achieve economies of scale on a regional or national basis.<br\/>We see the results of this fundamentally flawed approach in almost every city, town and county.  There are major issues around the quality of water supply and the capacity of the existing system to supply treated water in the quantities needed by households, businesses and industry.  For example, more than 22,000 people are on boil water notices and almost a million more depend on drinking water supplies that are at risk of falling below the required standards.  Almost half the water treated &ndash; at significant cost &ndash; runs off in leaks and is unaccounted for.  In addition - I use this only by way of example - 22 households are leaking a combined total of over one million litres a day into their driveways.  That is enough to serve the needs in one day in the town of Gorey, with which some in this House would be very familiar.  In Dublin, more than 800 km of pipe is over 100 years old and I cannot stand over that.  There is insufficient supply for the greater Dublin area.  Most major European cities have a spare capacity of 15% to 20%.  Dublin has a surplus capacity of only 1% to 4%.  We all know of the situation a few years ago, whereby restaurants in this city had restricted water supply during some very busy periods.  We all know what happened with the fantastic event, the Web Summit, a few years ago, where so many people visited this city and were left in a situation where water supplies were restricted in hotels while they were visiting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800011#L00700","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418903100,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Overcharged hotels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800012#M00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1418903100,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I could not agree more.

I will return to the House in the new year to talk about that very important issue.  These realities bring new demands and challenges for our water system, realities that a single national utility is best equipped to manage.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s water challenges are not unique.  Water demand is rising and supply is becoming less secure.  By 2030, the world is expected to need 40% more water than will be available.  We are distinct from most countries in the level of freshwater available, a benefit we can turn to our advantage by creating a world class water sector that can attract water-intensive industries such as ICT, pharma-chem and agrifood to Ireland.  These industries combined already sustain - I think this is a modest figures - well over 200,000 jobs between them.  In order to have inward investment in this country, we must ensure that we have an adequate water supply.  It is one of the questions that is asked of IDA Ireland when companies are looking at locating in this country.  We often talk about the need for broadband in this country, and through my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Alex White, we are dealing with this.  It is certainly an issue that has gone on way too long, but it is being dealt with.  If we do not do something about water, however, broadband or other infrastructure issues will not be the first thing on people's list when they ask about Ireland.  It will be water.  We must face up to that.<\/p><p>By 2030, our river basin management plans will have been reviewed a further three times and the quality of our water bodies will have to have improved.  Our rivers, lakes and other water bodies need greater protection not just for the protection of public health and our natural environment, but to ensure our thriving tourism industry can continue to prosper under the banner of Ireland&rsquo;s image as a clean, green country.  I doubt anyone will stand in front of the House who absolutely wants to ensure that happens.  It is a passion of mine.  Environmental and economic regulation of water services must be inter-linked.  The Government&rsquo;s water sector reforms are coherent responses to all these demands on our public water system.  They are aimed at ensuring the country has security of clean, reliable water supply and adequate wastewater treatment - when I say &quot;wastewater&quot;, I mean sewage, because that is what it is - so that our communities, economy and environment are served by a public water system fit for the 21st century.<\/p><p>Irish Water was established in July 2013 and assumed responsibility for water services functions on 1 January this year.  It has already shown the difference a single, national utility can make in making services more efficient, cost effective and national-minded.<\/p> <p>It has adopted a new approach to asset management which has resulted in a significant change of approach to infrastructural delivery.  Central strategic planning is now based on accurate asset performance data and full control of all investment decisions. The utility is now planning investment consistently across the asset base rather than on large-scale, one-off investments, which we have seen previously.  An example of this is the proposed Ringsend wastewater treatment plant upgrade, where an alternative approach to a treatment plant extension will save Irish Water &euro;170 million in capital investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800012#M00800","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418903700,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Rubbish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800013#N00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1418903700,"counter":124,"content":"<p>We can talk about that later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800013#N00300","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1418903700,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Where are the Senator's facts?

In the area of electricity supply, a major cost in the production of water, Irish Water&rsquo;s current renewable and efficient energy initiatives aim to reduce costs by 33% by 2020.  In April, Irish Water became the main contact point for customer queries and reports regarding water supply outages and water quality, through its customer call centre.  This development was another milestone along the road to achieving a single, standardised national service throughout the country, with a greater focus on those who use the public services.   Such progress would not have been possible without strong co-operation between Irish Water and local authorities, which have decades of experience of providing water and wastewater services with great care and dedication.<\/p><p>The 12-year service level agreements, now almost a year in existence, have proven to be a strong partnership between the local authorities&rsquo; expertise in operations and the considerable network and utility management experience within the Ervia Group.  This was most evident during Storm Darwin in February this year, when the two parties collaborated effectively to address emergency situations and maintain clear lines of communication with each other and with the public during a time of pressure on the public water system.  The service level agreements between the local authorities and Irish Water contain specific measures to support the move to a utility model by the end of 2017, and towards continuous improvement in the system.  An example of this is the new, digital approach towards work and asset management, procurement and inventory management capability.  Irish Water and the Water Services Transition Office, which represents the interests of local authorities in the reform programme, recently agreed on a 2014-2017 transformation plan.  The plan contains initiatives and measures to standardise and improve operations, asset management, customer service, procurement improvement, and assets data intelligence.  This, too, marks progress.<\/p><p>A key component of domestic water charges, which is central to the new funding model, is metering.  Without metering, one cannot have usage-based charging, which the OECD, among others, has agreed is the fairest form of charging.  As well as facilitating usage-based charging, the metering programme is detecting customer side leakage.  Irish Water estimates that up to 49% of the water produced is lost in leakage, of which 5% to 6% is on the customer side.  The presence of meters is helping Irish Water identify leakage that can be fixed through the &quot;first fix free&quot; scheme, which will cover leaks from the boundary of the property to a point as close as possible to the dwelling.  Meters will help customers to identify leaks for which they are responsible and will help Irish Water identify leakage in the water network.  Over time, metering will help to reduce domestic usage significantly, providing both environmental benefit and a reduction in national water demand, allowing variations in capital expenditure as a result because there will be no need to upgrade other systems due to the savings that are made.<\/p><p>The scale of the roll-out of the metering programme has been particularly impressive, despite everything.  By any measurement, the domestic metering programme has been a success.  Unparalleled anywhere in scale or ambition, Irish Water has installed approximately 533,000 meters in just over 16 months, with on average a meter being installed somewhere in Ireland every 30 seconds.  The utility has already surpassed its end of year target six weeks ahead of schedule, and is delivering a programme that is sustaining approximately 1,300 jobs throughout the country, providing the kind of economic stimulus we need.  I am sure everybody in the House agrees with that.  It is also worth noting that about 84% of these jobs have gone to people in one of three social inclusion categories, namely, the unemployed; employees of SMEs; or graduates, school leavers or apprentices.  This far exceeds the Government&rsquo;s original target of 25%.<\/p><p>I have made much commentary on this issue and have spoken much on Irish Water and I am not trying to suggest that Irish Water has not had its problems, far from it.  I will return to those.  I accept mistakes were made.  I accept mistakes were made by this Government.  I accept mistakes were made by Irish Water.  I hold my hands up and have admitted to that in the past.  However, it is only fair that we should acknowledge what it has achieved and what it has done well in such a short period. These achievements should set the bar for the other parts of the company which, dare I say it, may not yet have matched the same public expectations.  That has to change.<\/p><p>The new funding model for water services, including the introduction of domestic water charges, has also seen progress through Irish Water&rsquo;s moves towards accessing third party funding, as well as the Government&rsquo;s decisions on subvention, designed to ensure Irish Water is classified as a market corporation, thereby allowing the utility&rsquo;s expenditure to be classified as off-balance sheet. This is critical in ensuring Irish Water accesses the level of third party funding needed to increase investment in water infrastructure from circa &euro;300 million invested last year to the &euro;600 million per annum that is required.  Access to external funding from capital markets will help pave the way for sustainable investment in our public water system.  This is very important for addressing the deficiencies concerning leakage, quality, supply and wastewater treatment that I mentioned.<\/p><p>Independent, economic regulation is central to a well-functioning public utility model and is essential if we are to ensure water customers are protected and that the new utility delivers value for money.  The Commission for Energy Regulation has already made a number of major decisions in relation to the regulation of Irish Water, decisions underpinned by public consultation.  We have got to respect the independence of the Commission for Energy Regulation and the decisions it has made.  In September, the CER approved an overall allowed revenue for Irish Water for the period from 1 October 2014 to the end of 2016.  This reflected a reduction in proposed operational costs by the end of 2016 through a 7% annual efficiency challenge, as well as a 7% annual capital efficiency challenge to non-committed capital costs, excluding capital maintenance.<\/p><p>The Government package to make charges more affordable and certain has not impacted on either the level of controllable operational costs or the capital spending approved by the CER.  This is a very important point, as the independent review of Irish Water costs is at the heart of regulating our water sector and giving customers and taxpayers comfort that only efficient costs are being funded.  The Government has made an adjustment to the manner in which commercial rates are treated, which I will come to shortly, but this is considered as a pass-through cost by the CER.  These expenditure controls and efficiency targets are essential if we are to reduce the cost of delivering water services.  Beyond the first interim revenue control period of 2014 to 2016, Irish Water will continue to submit its costs and capital plans to the CER in the future in order that the regulator sets the overall allowed revenue and approved capital investment levels.<\/p><p>The regulator has also made decisions about customer protections through publication of the customer handbook, and is due to announce a timeline for the establishment of an enduring tariff framework for non-domestic customers before the end of the year.  This will provide greater clarity to the non-domestic sector on the future of tariffs.<\/p> <p>There has been substantial progress towards creating a modern, fit-for-purpose water sector.  This Bill marks another step along the journey to a full utility model and a sustainable financial model for water services.<\/p><p>I will now move on to the contents of the Bill, before summarising at the end.  Before I set out the provisions of the Bill, I would like to address some matters which are not provided for in this Bill.  The Government package announced last month also referred to a suite of measures which would apply if households did not pay.  These will be brought forward in separate legislation in the new year, and will the subject of stakeholder engagement.  <\/p><p>I will now outline the purpose and operation of each section of the Bill.  Section 1 sets out the definitions of terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 provides for a plebiscite on the ownership of Irish Water.  It provides that where a Government proposes to initiate legislation which amends the existing legislation setting out the ownership of shares in Irish Water, such a proposal cannot be initiated without a resolution from both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Subject to such resolutions being passed, the Government would then be required to submit the proposal to a plebiscite of all people eligible to vote on at a referendum on a proposal for an amendment to the Constitution.  This Government is committed to retaining Irish Water in public ownership and has already provided a statutory prohibition on its disposal.  This section will ensure that the people will have to be consulted if there is, at some time in the future, a Government that is minded to try to dispose of Irish Water, which is highly unlikely.  <\/p><p>Section 3 provides for amendments to the charges applying to domestic customers of Irish Water and the requirement for Irish Water to amend its water charges plan to address these amendments.  This section also provides that Irish Water may not commence charges for water services to domestic customers before 1 January 2015.  Arrangements for the charging for non-domestic customers and charges for connections as reflected in the water charges plan approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation are not impacted by this change.  The provisions of this section will be deemed to be part of the water charges plan approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation on 30 September 2014.  The section also provides for Irish Water to submit any consequential amendments, such as the reflection of provisions in quarterly bills, to the Commission for Energy Regulation for approval.<\/p><p>The main aspects of the amendments to charges are as follows: a capped maximum charge of &euro;160 for a dwelling occupied by not more than one adult; a capped maximum charge of &euro;260 for an unoccupied dwelling or a dwelling occupied by two or more adults; provision that only 50% of the maximum charges may be applied where a dwelling receives only one service from Irish Water, that is, only a water supply or sewage service; the automatic application of a charge of &euro;260 for any dwelling that has not registered as a customer of Irish Water by a prescribed date; the setting of a maximum volumetric charge of not more than &euro;1.85 per 1,000 litres of water or &euro;3.70 for each 1,000 litres of water and sewage services provided &ndash; these volumetric charges will apply up to the capped maximum charges I outlined earlier; in the light of the approach of reduced volumetric charge and maximum charges, the removal of the household water allowance previously provided for; and confirmation that the child allowance provided under the approved water charges plan shall apply to all persons under the age of 18.  This section provides that the amended charges shall apply for the period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2018.  It also provides that the Minister may, following consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, by order, set maximum charges for periods after 31 December 2018.  That is a very important component.<\/p><p>Section 4 provides that where a customer has not paid their water charges and has not entered into a payment plan with Irish Water, Irish Water shall charge a late payment fee for each year the arrears remain unpaid.  The late payment fees that will apply are of &euro;30 for a dwelling occupied by not more than one adult or &euro;60 for an unoccupied dwelling or a dwelling occupied by two or more adults.  These fees will apply for each year that arrears remain unpaid.<\/p><p>Section 5 provides for eligible householders to be paid an annual water conservation grant, which they can use to assist with water conservation in their homes.  The Government has decided that the annual grant should be &euro;100 per household.  The estimated cost of this grant in 2015 is &euro;130 million, and will not be incurred by Irish Water or be funded by domestic water charges, but is a completely independent measure, to be funded by the Exchequer.  The section provides that in 2015, to be eligible for a grant, a household shall have provided information on the water supply to their dwelling to Irish Water and any necessary information required by the Minister for Social Protection.  The section provides for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to prescribe a date by which householders should register with Irish Water details of their water supply and wastewater treatment.  The section also provides that a person resident in a nursing home or other residential care facility would be eligible to claim the grant in respect of his or her own house, provided the house is not rented to another person.<\/p><p>Section 6 provides for the prohibition on the reduction of a supply to a domestic dwelling.  This is an amendment to the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 and provides that Irish Water shall be prohibited from either disconnecting or reducing the supply of water to a dwelling because of an unpaid bill.  I announced this in Cork a few weeks ago and everyone in the House should welcome it.  I wanted, when I took this job, to ensure that was announced as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>Section 7 provides for the establishment of a public water forum by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  It is proposed that the forum would have at least 12 and not more than 60 members, who would be representative of the interests of all customers of Irish Water.  The forum would have a broad role in reviewing and commenting on the various strategies and plans for Irish Water, including investment plans and water charges plans.  There is provision for the Minister to make regulations in respect of the composition of this forum, but I will be taking on other views.<\/p><p>Section 8 provides for statutory powers for the Commission for Energy Regulation to provide a dispute resolution service for unresolved complaints of customers of Irish Water.  The service would be similar to that operated by the commission for customers in the energy sector.  It also provides that the commission would prepare an annual report on the number and types of complaints made under the section and, more generally, the service levels provided by Irish Water.  <\/p><p>Section 9 provides for a number of technical amendments to the superannuation provisions contained in the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 and the Gas Act 1976.  These amendments are technical and they are necessary to clarify that Irish Water does not have financial liability for the past service of officers of the Minister or local authorities, other than the net effect of any increase in pensionable remuneration due to service with Irish Water.  A separate scheme will cover the past service of such employees and this will remain funded by the State.  It is something that the workers and the unions in Irish Water need as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Section 10 deals with loans taken out by local authorities to fund capital investment in water services.  Intensive work has been under way during 2014 on preparing for asset and liability transfer and through this process the need for flexibility on some of the arrangements set out in the Water Services (No. 2) Act were highlighted.  It is important to stress that the local authorities will not be left to carry any liabilities as a result of the proposals in this section.  This section provides that where the Minister makes an order to provide that water services property is transferred from a local authority to Irish Water, any financial loans associated with the property are not automatically transferred to Irish Water.  Section 14 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 allows for any liabilities to be separately transferred.  This simply allows for the two processes to be handled separately.  For example, it is not proposed to transfer some of these loans issued by the Housing Finance Agency to Irish Water as they are already part of the Government debt and to do so would impact on Irish Water&rsquo;s debt-raising capacity for new investment and would also potentially increase customer charges.  However, to ensure that the liability is not left with local authorities, subsection (3) of this section provides a mechanism to unwind the debt from a local authority perspective, by providing for the payment of up to &euro;460 million from the Central Fund to local authorities for the purpose of repaying such loans to the Housing Finance Agency.  It is really just moving money from one side of the State to the other.  The section also provides that any transfer of property by the Minister shall not be treated as a disposal of property by a local authority.  This is to ensure that there is no adverse impact on the financial standing of local authorities from the transfer of assets to Irish Water. <\/p><p>Section 11 provides for the abolition of the power of Irish Water to require the PPS numbers of its customers.  The purpose of this section is to provide that Irish Water shall no longer have the power to request details of PPS numbers.  The section, which makes amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014, will be commenced by the Minister for Social Protection following consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This deferred commencement is necessary to ensure Irish Water can complete the work of deleting any PPS information that it had previously been provided with.  This exercise is under way and is being carried out in accordance with a protocol Irish Water developed in consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  It is very necessary.<\/p><p>Section 12 provides that public water services property shall not be rateable.  This section provides that land used for the provision of public water services is not rateable for the purposes of the Valuation Act 2001.<\/p> <p>This exemption will apply to Irish Water for the provision of water supply and waste water treatment and, importantly, to group water supplies.  From a financial perspective the changes arising from the provisions in this Bill will involve a reduction in revenue for Irish Water of &euro;21 million in 2015 and &euro;56 million in 2016.  However, Irish Water's costs will also be reduced as a result of the approach to the treatment of water infrastructure for commercial rates purposes, such that the subvention does not need to be paid to Irish Water to fund this cost.  Equivalent support, of approximately &euro;59 million, will be given directly to the local authorities through the Local Government Fund.<\/p><p>Section 13 provides for an increase in membership of the board of Ervia.  The purpose of this section is to provide for an increase in the maximum number of members who may be appointed to the board of Ervia.  The measure is part of a reorganisation of the corporate governance structures of Ervia and of Irish Water.  A single non\u00adexecutive board at Ervia level will be responsible for the governance of both companies.  The increase in the maximum number of members will ensure that the board has adequate water services experience and expertise.  I feel this is absolutely necessary.  We need to bring in experts with experience in this area across a wide range of issues.  That process is under way.<\/p><p>Section 14 is a standard provision that provides that the Minister may make regulations to prescribe any matter referred to in the Act as &quot;prescribed&quot; or &quot;to be prescribed&quot;.  Section 15 is a standard provision providing that any expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, subject to the sanction of the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>Section 16 is a standard provision to provide for the Short Title and provide that the Water Services Acts 2007 to 2014 may be cited as such and construed together as one.<\/p><p>Significant progress has been achieved. The structures that have been put in place to date will serve to ensure we have clean, reliable water supplies for our communities and our economy, and adequate wastewater treatment to protect public health and our environment for the long term.  The next step is the introduction of a fair and affordable system of water charges and a more robust governance structure for the company that we have entrusted with delivering such a vital public service.  The Government recognises that charges must be simple, fair and affordable.  People are entitled to clarity on how much their charges will be for the coming years while being given an incentive to conserve water.  The package legislated for in the Bill achieves these objectives.<\/p><p>Over 950,000 households have responded to Irish Water's customer application campaign so far.  The Government has sought to address the concerns of those who have registered and those who have yet to do so.  We are simplifying the level and structure of domestic water charges and addressing the genuine public concerns about the governance, ownership and operations of Irish Water.  I look forward to a valuable debate on this legislation.<\/p><p>I respect this House and the decisions it must make in the coming days on this Bill.  I would not concur with any comments of others who have said the Seanad has to make a certain defined decision or ensure this legislation is passed.  We have to have a robust debate, including in this House, and I am here to take part in it.  I respect the House and the decision it must make.  Everyone in here has a mandate or has served his time here and I respect the fact that everyone has individual decisions to make as part of the process.  As a result, we will have a robust debate and come to our conclusions in a fair manner.  I look forward to the debate and will obviously be talking to the Senators later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800013#N01000","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418904900,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Before we move on to the first speaker, I welcome to the Visitors Gallery Mr. Valdis Liepins, a Member of the Latvian Parliament.

I welcome the Minister and thank him for what was a comprehensive outline of the difficulties he inherited when he entered office.  I would like to start by repeating what I said on Second Stage of the Water Services (No. 2) Bill 2013 on 4 December 2013.  It is illustrative of why the Minister is facing opposition and why a hornet's nest has been stirred up regarding this controversy.  I said:<blockquote><br \/>Our party is opposing the Bill for some of the reasons I mentioned.  We are not alone in opposing this Bill.  The Labour Party's election manifesto stated it did not favour water charges.  On 18 February 2011, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, said the Labour Party did not favour water charges.  On 28 June 2010, the [then] leader of Labour Party, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, stated ... he was against water charges, that water was a necessity, that he always believed essential services like water should be delivered as a public service, that a flat household charge would be unfair as it would not discriminate between houses with five bathrooms or no bathroom, and that metering was unworkable.  That comment was made by the T&aacute;naiste three years ago.<\/blockquote>Of course, the Labour Party was then in opposition.  Therein lies the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800015#P00500","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1418904900,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Now the Senator's party is in opposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800015#P00600","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1418904900,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Is it any wonder people are so enraged over such political cynicism.

Consequently, many issues that have arisen and come back to haunt the Government could have been anticipated had debates been allowed to continue, had there been respect and had the Government listened to what was said during the parliamentary process.  That has not happened.

In 1983, Dick Spring, the then leader of the Labour Party, introduced domestic water charges for the first time.  I was a member of Wexford County Council at the time.  We would have had water charges within the rural area but never within the urban area.  As I stated on the last occasion, I did not have a principled objection to a reasonable charge.  While we had a majority on our town council, we agreed the charge should be effected by the local authority in the interest of providing revenue for the service.  There was long-term opposition at the time among the public, particularly in Dublin, but it had almost petered out by 1996 when current Deputy Joe Higgins, who was probably the lone voice opposing water charges, did well in a by-election.  My constituency colleague Deputy Brendan Howlin, who was Minister at the time, abolished the water charges.  To some extent, I do not have sympathy for the Government over its predicament because it represents poetic justice.  What was done was done for political reasons.  This highlights that populist politics eventually comes back to bite one.  While there might be a perceived short-term gain associated with the current policy, it is a foolish one to pursue in the medium to long term.  I hope all parties will desist from this in the future.<\/p> <p> During the debate last year I raised serious concerns about placing this in the stable of Bord G&aacute;is.  Bord G&aacute;is is not, and certainly was not, a model of good corporate governance when it came to cost controls, cost-effectiveness and efficiencies.  Why it was put in there is beyond me.  Unfortunately, the Bill continues this process.  It needs a much more commercially well-run corporate focus than it will have.  The Government came in on a promise of abolishing the proliferation of quangos which had been introduced over many decades.  I certainly subscribe to this.  However, here we have the introduction of a super-quango.  In fact, it is the mother of all quangos.<\/p><p>One area the Minister should review is the structure which has been established.  We not only attached Irish Water to Bord G&aacute;is, but we overstaffed it from the beginning.  We told the people who will be paying for it that the number of staff would correct itself by 2026 through natural wastage.  In other words, they are to bear the cost for the next 12 years until it comes right, rather than structuring it in a cost-efficient way from the beginning.  We have spent approximately &euro;700 million on consultants and metering, and it is very difficult to say how this will be returned.  It will take many years to recover the capital costs involved.  At any stage last year or this year was a business plan prepared for Uisce &Eacute;ireann which would illustrate to us the internal rate of return?  It is standard practice for anyone in the private sector making an investment to work out initially the internal rate of return.  Often the decision will be based on the outcome of this.  I hope this has been done, but I would be pleasantly surprised if it was.  Unfortunately, it is not how the public service works.  While there is a lot of political flak with regard to this issue, when Ministers get themselves into difficulties, and I saw it with many of my colleagues when we were in government, it is not always the Ministers' fault.  People on very high salaries do not fulfil the responsibilities they have.  Covering for these people needs to be changed and examined.<\/p><p>With regard to regulation, I have no confidence in the Commission for Energy Regulation or others.  None of them has proved to be champions of the consumer.<\/p><p>With regard to the plebiscite, did the Cabinet seek advice from the Attorney General on putting a referendum to the people on this and what was the outcome?  I am not happy we have a public monopoly.  A private monopoly would be a disaster.  Sinn F&eacute;in in its budget submission a few months ago included in its figures the part-privatisation of Uisce &Eacute;ireann to buttress some of its figures.  Very little focus has been placed on this by the media or anybody else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800015#P00900","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418905500,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800016#Q00200","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1418905500,"counter":145,"content":"<p>It is a question that needs to be asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800016#Q00300","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1418905500,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Thank you for pointing it out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800016#Q00400","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1418905500,"counter":147,"content":"<p>The Minister will respect the fact we will be extremely anxious to ensure this will not become a private monopoly.

We are here for what I hope will be a very rational and calm discussion on the very important issue of how we will ensure we have a safe, clean and adequate supply of water to serve the country's needs in the years to come.  To ensure we have a customer-centred focus, the Government has listened to the people and committed to establishing a public forum on a statutory basis to ensure that from now on, everybody will have an input on how safe, clean and adequate water is provided.<\/p><p>Fear of the unknown and uncertainty led to many of the problems we have faced in the establishment of Irish Water, particularly the uncertainty about affordability.  The Government has listened and this has been addressed.  I compliment the Minister on this.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for introduction of a water conservation grant of &euro;100.  This is aimed at enabling people to purchase water-saving devices and will ease the burden.  I am always harping on about water harvesting and perhaps the Minister will go down this road another day.  The Minister has outlined the affordable charges of &euro;60 per year for a single household and &euro;160 for others.  This is &euro;1.15 or &euro;3 per week, which is quite affordable.  We are considered a green and clean nation and we want to ensure we remain so.  Everybody in Ireland should consider this when considering water and pollution.  We have much to offer.  A total of 950,000 people have recognised this and have signed up to Irish Water.  There are two months to go before the deadline and I ask people to consider every aspect.  I believe in paying for water.  I believe in having a clean supply.  I, more than many, suffered at the doors in Dublin South-West.  I listened to the people, and the issue of uncertainty was raised at many doors.  This has now been addressed.<\/p><p>The neglect of our water infrastructure has been absolutely disgraceful.  Celtic tiger, how are you.  We should have invested then.  We do not have the choice now.  It should have been done long ago.  We should have invested in our water infrastructure.  The question is how we fund it now.  The Government has turned the country around from going to the wall.  It is now taking on the responsible attitude of funding water.  The solution for those on the left is to raise taxes on working people, not on rich people but on working people earning the average industrial wage.  A total of &euro;600 million must be invested annually in water to ensure we have a clean supply.  It must also be kept off the books to ensure we reach the troika target of a 3% deficit by the end of the year.

Two days after the recent national water protest on the streets of Dublin, when a substantial number of citizens and residents exercised their right to free assembly, the Economic and Social Research Institute published a paper entitled Distributional Impact of Tax, Welfare and Public Service Pay Policies: Budget 2015 and Budgets 2009-2015.  The paper examines the impact of budget 2015 on households at different income levels.  These eminent social scientists conclude that budget 2015 will have its greatest impact on the 10% of households with the lowest incomes.  These households take in approximately &euro;8,700; their net household income - net of income and the revised water charges, inclusive of the conservation grant - will reduce by 1% or approximately &euro;87.  Smaller losses will be experienced by most middle-income households, with small percentage gains for higher-income households.  The greatest gain will be close to 0.5% for the top 10% of households, which take in approximately &euro;159,000.  That means they will gain approximately &euro;795.  When the ESRI professors analyse the combined budgetary effects of 2008 to 2015, they find that households with incomes in the middle, or approximately &euro;35,000, had substantial losses from budgetary action at between 10% and 11%, or approximately &euro;3,500.<\/p><p>This is the evidence, so I do not find it surprising that the people I witnessed and spoke with on the 10 December protest were deeply concerned about the affordability of water charges and their ability to pay.  As the Minister and Senators are aware, much of the mobilisation of protestors is based on a belief in &quot;the right to water&quot;.  I am not a member of the Right2Water campaign because I do not agree with its entire platform but the right to water and sanitation are included in the United Nations interpretation of economic, social and cultural rights.  The right to water does not mean that we should not pay for it but it does mean that charges which control access to water and sanitation should be affordable and fair.  I suggest that if this Government is genuinely committed to affordability and fairness, it should accept the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention that our Constitution should be amended to strengthen the protection of economic, social and cultural rights.  If the Government is not willing to put a referendum to the people to make a choice to guarantee public ownership of water - our collective natural resource - the next best action would be for the Government to accept the convention's recommendation on economic, social and cultural rights.  I was very disappointed that &quot;strengthening economic, social and cultural rights&quot; was not chosen this week by the Cabinet as another referendum to put to the people.<\/p><p>Many critics of the Government's establishment of Irish Water call it a quango.  We have already heard the word this afternoon.  That is a derogatory term, although one definition indicates that a quango is simply an organisation that is financed by a government but acts independently of it.  How can we transform a quango into a public utility that provides people's right to water in a fair, affordable, efficient and effective manner?  It can be done in this Bill but not without some further amendments.  I am not of the view that we need to abolish Irish water and as lawmakers we have in our power the ability to transform it.  I hope the Minister and Senators will grasp that opportunity.<\/p> <p> I have two primary concerns about the Water Services Bill 2014.  The first is the public ownership of Irish Water.  The Minister has said that the Bill before us, in its new form as well as in its earlier form, as introduced in the D&aacute;il, gives people certainty that Irish Water will remain in public ownership.  I do not agree with that assertion.  However, I am in agreement with the Minister that in this law the Government should give people such certainty.  Public ownership is the best way to protect our collective natural resource and to ensure the right to water and sanitation.  Many Deputies on both sides of the other House spoke and many Senators, I am sure, will speak eloquently about this.  What I want to say is that public ownership, and only public ownership, will guarantee that charges are fair and affordable.  Only public ownership will require transparent and ethical governance.  Only public ownership will insist on efficient management free of cronyism and an unacceptable bonus culture, and only public ownership will provide structured customer engagement and influence in setting the charges and maintaining an ethical form of governance and an effective management.<\/p><p>The plebiscite as framed within this Bill is a proposal that asks the people if they would agree to privatisation.  It is not a plebiscite that asks the people if they would agree to public ownership.  That is how it is framed in the Bill.  It is a plebiscite framed to ask the people would they agree to privatisation.  Therefore, a plebiscite framed in this way simply does not guarantee public ownership of Irish Water.  Why is this?  Under Article 10 of the Irish Constitution, the Oireachtas is empowered to enact legislation for the purpose of regulating the alienation, whether temporary or permanent, of lands, mines, minerals and water.  What does that mean?  In a nutshell, it means that our Constitution allows for the Oireachtas to pass law that sells, transfers, leases or gives away our natural resources.  Our Constitution, as it is currently framed, allows lawmakers to transfer natural resources from the State's ownership to someone else.  Therefore, the promise of a plebiscite to the people to ask them if they agree with an Oireachtas proposal to privatise or to alienate hardly provides an adequate guarantee.  Even if this law is enacted in its present form, the constitutional guarantee will continue to be that lawmakers can transfer natural resources from the State's ownership to someone else.  Only a referendum could change that foundational constitutional guarantee to elected representatives that they can make law to privatise water.<\/p><p>I heard some of the Minister's comments on why the Government is not going for a referendum.  I heard, &quot;We cannot do it; it is too complex&quot;, or: &quot;We will not do it; it is too complex.&quot;  I heard, &quot;We will not do it&quot;, and not: &quot;We cannot do it because it is too complex.&quot;<\/p><p>My second primary concern is fairness and ability to pay.  All of us in this House know that the capped charges are an interim measure that responds to the crisis of public trust in politics.  Many of us are concerned that the revenue raised from households as suggested in this Bill will not sustain Irish Water financially and, hence, these charges will have to be raised in 2019.  The people who protested on the streets of Tallaght and throughout the country know this as well.  They do not trust the promises made by Government that the water charges will remain affordable until 2019 when the charges regime provided for in this Bill expires.  People need financial certainty and this Bill does not provide it beyond 2018.  Water charges need to be affordable and fair for the people.  They need to promote water conservation and be economically sustainable, both for the utility and the State.  It is vital that Irish Water passes the market corporation test in April, because the reverse would have serious consequences for the Irish economy.  Hence, the economic as much as the political sustainability of the fee structure needs to be considered.<\/p><p>I do not believe it is fair, cost-effective or practical for the State to subsidise the water bills of the nation's top earners for the same value as the low income groups.  My positive proposal is that households will not pay more than 0.5% of their net household income on water charges, neither now nor after 31 December 2018.  The charging regime set out by this Bill for the three-year period provides this guarantee for households earning more than &euro;34,000 a year.  In other words, it provides a guarantee that they will not pay more than 0.5% of their net income, but it does not provide a guarantee for those earning under &euro;34,000, even when taking the water conservation grant into consideration.  Therefore, it does not provide a guarantee that those earning under &euro;34,000 will pay only 0.5% of their net income.  I will be bringing forward amendments therefore that will ensure the cap in the water charges is linked to 0.5% of the household's net income when that is lower than the flat charge.  This will start to bring more fairness and ensure affordability in the charges regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800017#R03100","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418906700,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank him for his opening statement which brought more clarity to the situation and to the intent of this Bill.

It is also true to say that it is very good that the Seanad has been retained by the people because the changes that have occurred also bring into focus the importance of the debate that was held in this House.  It is also important that this House was retained because what we did successfully as Members of the House is see to it that many of the issues that we raised in the House are being dealt with in this Bill.  Many of the issues raised at the Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht are dealt with in the Bill.  I have spent the past half an hour looking at my own contributions, both at the committee and in this House, on the previous Bill and since then.  Practically all of the issues I raised during that time are now dealt with in this Bill.  For that reason, the people were very wise when they retained the Seanad - not because of my contribution but because of all of them.<\/p><p>We have had 20 hours of debate on water in this House.  It has been successful.  We see that the Minister has enshrined in this legislation that the people will decide if and when, if ever, Irish Water is to be privatised.

In the first place, the Appropriation Bill is necessary to authorise in law all of the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2014 on the basis of the Estimates that have already been voted on by the D&aacute;il during the year.<\/p><p>The amounts included in section 1 and Schedule 1 to the Bill, to be appropriated for supply services, all relate to amounts included in the Estimates, set out in the Revised Estimates Volume 2014, voted upon by the D&aacute;il in January 2014, as well as the Supplementary Estimates which have also been voted on in 2014.<\/p><p>Second, and of vital importance, the passage of the Appropriation Bill is also essential to provide a legal basis for all existing voted expenditure to continue into 2015.  This allows payments including social welfare payments, salaries and pensions, and payments to suppliers for goods and services, to continue pending a vote by the D&aacute;il on the 2015 Estimates.<\/p><p>In respect of capital carryover, under the rolling five year multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in previous budgets, Departments may carry over from the current year to the following year unspent capital up to a maximum of 10% of voted capital.  Section 91 of the Finance Act 2004 made legal provision for this capital carryover by way of deferred surrender.  Under this enabling legislation the normal requirement under the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 to surrender unspent moneys in a financial year to the Central Fund may be deferred in the case of capital moneys subject to a number of conditions.  Among those conditions is that the unspent capital sums must be set out in the Appropriation Act by reference to the Votes concerned.  The Appropriation Act determines definitively the capital amounts which may be carried over to the following year.<\/p><p>The capital carryover facility forms an integral part of the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes.  The multi-annual system is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the management by Departments and agencies of capital programmes and projects.  It recognises the difficulties inherent in the planning and profiling of capital expenditure and acknowledges that for a myriad of reasons, capital projects may be subject to delays.  The carryover facility allows for a portion of unspent moneys which would have been lost to the capital programmes and projects concerned, under the annual system of allocating capital, to be made available for spending on programme priorities in the subsequent year.<\/p><p>The amounts of capital carryover by Vote are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill.  It is proposed to carry over just over &euro;79 million from a total capital programme of over &euro;3.5 billion.  This amount of &euro;79 million is split across seven different Votes with the largest amounts arising on the Votes of the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p><p>The liabilities in respect of the first payroll payments to staff and pensioners mature on 1 January and 2 January 2015 and form part of the supply services for 2015.  However, as funding needs to be in place to ensure staff and pensioners have access to funds on these dates, Government Departments and offices will need to pre-fund their commercial bank accounts.  Section 3 of the Appropriation Bill 2014 puts in place a mechanism to provide for advances from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account in December 2014.  These advances are to be repaid to the Central Fund in January 2015.<\/p><p>The provision in the Appropriation Bill provides a clear legal authority for Government Departments and offices to have a credit issued in respect of the Central Fund, that facilitates the accounting treatment of salaries and pensions payable on 1 and 2 January 2015, as expenditure that comes under moneys voted by the D&aacute;il in 2015, where the usual processes and mechanisms for voted moneys in 2015 will apply.<\/p><p>Section 15(1) of the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014 provides that from 1 January 2015, the Health Service Executive Vote shall cease to exist and the salaries and expenses and certain other services administered by the Health Service Executive, including miscellaneous grants, shall form part of the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Health.<\/p><p>Section 3 of the Appropriation Act 1999, as amended by section 4 of the Appropriation Act 2005, provides that funds in relation to certain excise duties on tobacco products be transferred by the Revenue Commissioners as appropriations-in-aid to the Health Service Executive.  The amount involved is approximately &euro;167 million.  Incorporating the HSE Vote into the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Health requires that these receipts related to excise duties on tobacco products, be appropriated to the Vote of the Minister for Health with effect from 1 January 2015.  This change requires a revision to section 3 of the Appropriation Act 1999 as set out in section 4 of the Appropriation Bill 2014.<\/p><p>The signed Act is required by the Comptroller and Auditor General for clearance of the end-year issues from the Exchequer.<\/p><p>Under Article 25.2.1&deg; of the Constitution the President may not sign a Bill earlier than the fifth day after the date on which the Bill is presented to him.  However, there is provision in Article 25.2.2&deg; whereby, at the request of the Government with the prior concurrence of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the President may sign a Bill on an earlier date than the fifth day mentioned.<\/p><p>In view of the urgency of this Bill, the provision in Article 25.2.2&deg; is sought, and a motion to this effect is placed before the Seanad.  Such an earlier signature motion has also been sought in relation to the Appropriation Bill in previous years.  Crucially, the passage of the Appropriation Bill and its signing into law will allow the payments required to deliver our public services to continue in 2015, allow for our public servants and many social welfare recipients to be paid on time in January 2015 and in the period before the D&aacute;il approves the 2015 Estimates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800021#V00400","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1418908200,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for setting out his position.

We have seen massive price rises, estimated by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service to be in the region of 58% since 2008 and more than 300,000 people have given up their private health insurance.  The Minister's predecessor tried strenuously to tackle costs.  The figure given by the current Minister is -2% in that regard.  That is on top of an incredible performance in a period when there were no real increases in incomes because of the economic crisis.  We are making progress but I wish we could have done so earlier.  We have moved our approach to the health insurance market from one where the State's health insurance company, VHI, was protected at all times from competition.  Given that the policing of efficiencies in the health service is difficult for the Department, as the main employer, why not use competing health insurance companies as the mechanism through which this is done?  That is the emphasis that has been missing to date.  <br\/>I welcome the Minister's announcement that the regulation sector for financial purposes will be moving to the Central Bank in February.  That should have been done years ago.  Indeed, a normal feature in December has been the postponement of that decision, which confers a substantial advantage on VHI over others in the market.  The main concern in the Milliman report, referred to in my amendment, is that VHI devotes a vast amount of its energy, at managerial level, to proving that it has more older customers than the other insurers.  We had an interesting discussion on that point recently and debated whether that fact warrants the kinds of price increases we have seen in recent years.  The Milliman report argues that if a fraction of the energy devoted by VHI to proving its customers are older and petitioning the Department of Health and the Health Insurance Authority to rig the market was devoted to examining issues like &quot;average length of stay in hospitals, utilisation management, medically unnecessary admissions, and other excessive costs unrelated to ageing&quot; we would see real progress on costs.<br\/>I want to see a market in which insurers can charge customers less, not because they have cheated by refusing to insure older people but because they have secured better deals from hospitals, reduced the average length of stay, agreed lower prices for procedures and negotiated better deals with the drugs companies.  In that context, insurers should be able to confirm to the Minister that people, both young and old, can be treated at a lower cost and that any savings made will be passed on to consumers.  That would be a very welcome development.  None of that happened in the period during which health insurance costs rose by 58%.<br\/>The average length of stay in hospital, according to the Milliman report, is ten days but best international practice is 3.7 days.  Since 2010, when the report was published, some of the efforts of the former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, to focus on cost control have had an impact, albeit only to the tune of 2%.  The Milliman report suggested that there was huge scope for improvement in utilisation management and also pointed to a high volume of medically unnecessary admissions, with young people in the full of their health admitted overnight for tests and so forth.  Such overnight stays are costly to the insurers.  The report argues that issues such as poor administration, poor management and a lack of attention to issues such as the average length of stay are more important than the ageing factor.  Such issues are independent of age and improvements in this regard could make a big difference.  The former Minister for Health appointed Mr. Pat McLoughlin to try to administer change.  The potential savings identified in the Milliman report were far greater than the 2% we have seen thus far.  <br\/>The version of the Milliman report supplied to Members of this House was redacted in over 55 places.  However, reading between the lines and between the redactions, one can see that the system is inefficient.  The get-out clause for VHI was that it was insuring all of the older people and therefore must continue to receive a State subsidy.  <br\/>The Minister made reference earlier to his previous role as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport when he appointed the boards of the NTA and of CIE.  In the case of health, the Minister appoints the boards of the Health Insurance Authority and of the VHI.  In both cases, I think the relationships are too close.  While there is a social role for our transport system, the cheque goes overwhelmingly to one company which happens to be owned by the State.  That said, I know that the former Minister intervened on a number of occasions where there were lower cost providers in areas like Portlaoise and let them tender for contracts.  <br\/>Do we have any evidence that the new entrants to the private health insurance market refused to insure older people?  I do not think there is any such evidence.  In fact, none was produced in any of the many court cases related to this issue.  A subsidy is provided, as illustrated in table No. 2, for older people without any assurance that the Department of Health is getting the best value for that money.<\/p> <p>There must be some mechanism to extract the productivity gains that were so strongly - I cannot emphasise the word \"strongly\" enough - pointed to in the Milliman report as being necessary to achieve.  As I said, we know the new entrants did not refuse to insure older people.  It would have been illegal to do so in any case because we have open enrolment, community rating and lifetime cover.  No witnesses were produced in the court cases to give evidence of such practice.<\/p><p>On the other hand, we do have evidence that there are people who will not change provider because they do not mind higher prices, just as some people will opt to use a more costly airline.  In addition, some people consider it too much hassle to change provider or feel there are not significant savings to be made by so doing.  There is literature setting out the reasons people do not change their provider as they get older.  As such, it is difficult to say that being older should be the basis for a subsidy.  There are lower-cost options and a stimulatory effect from cutting costs.  For example, if person A goes to a lower-cost company, VHI will respond just as Aer Lingus had to respond when it was faced with competition.  To give out a subsidy without having a strong productivity basis for so doing, as advised in the Milliman report, seems unlikely to give an efficient result.  I would like to see insurance companies competing on the basis of getting better deals from hospitals.  Perhaps when hospitals achieve their independence, they will begin to compete in this way and the benefits of that will be passed on to customers.  However, simply deciding that because company A has lots of older customers, those older people should be subsidised and there is no need to pursue much in the way of analysis after that is not the way to get an efficient result.<\/p><p>The premia that are attached to older people go up to &euro;3,275, as set out in the table on pages 6 to 9, inclusive, of the Bill.  I am proposing in amendment No. 7 that these premia shall be reviewed annually by the head of financial regulation of the Central Bank.  The Minister has indicated that will be done in February.  I am anxious to ensure it is done before the new rates are charged on 1 May, because it has been postponed so many times.  Why, for instance, should the last category of persons in the table, at line 30 on page 9, get a subsidy of &euro;2,475?  Is there a danger in putting these figures into law and having them there forever?  Will any provider reduce costs if there is a guaranteed, upfront subsidy?  Surely these amounts should be subject to some review?  Are the proposals in line with the recommendations in the Milliman report as to what these courses of care should cost or are we looking at an old-fashioned subsidy that is not subject to appraisal?  Is what is proposed here actuarially sound and does it reflect efficient costs of treatment?<\/p><p>At the moment, the major insurer of older people - this is one of the complaints about it - submits its costings to the Health Insurance Authority, but one has to wonder whether it is really the old Ryanair system of charging &pound;208 to get to London because the Department has been persuaded and there is regulatory capture going on.  May we, as servants of the taxpayer interest, shop around to see whether we can achieve better value?   Health insurance is essentially a financial service.  As such, can we ask the Central Bank to take a broader view on what these alternative companies could and should charge?  We must have some public debate on these issues rather than putting specific sums onto the Statute Book forever.<\/p><p>I have tabled amendments Nos. 6 and 7 in the context of a health insurance industry in which we have seen an increase in costs out of all proportion to any other increases people have had to bear in recent years.  We have a report which shows the potential for substantial savings in the sector.  In terms of the incentive structure, the question arises as to whether older people are seen as a guaranteed source of income by hospitals, as referred to in the Milliman report.  We might look at VHI as an insurer against risk, but to medical sector providers it is a guaranteed source of income.  Is that why the average length of stay was found by Milliman to be so long in comparison with best international practice?  Are these incentives the wrong ones in a system where we are trying to reduce health service costs?  Are they actuarially sound as well as based on what hospital costs should be?  The Oireachtas should discuss why this sector had such a massive cost increase and assist the Minister in any way we can in making sure that issue is addressed.  If there are more large cost increases, we will lose another 300,000 people out of the sector.  I support the Minister in his attempts to address these costs.  Assuming it could never happen that an insurance company would be able to treat both older people and younger people at a lower cost and pass on savings to both groups, maybe that is the wrong assumption on which to proceed.  Has the heavy degree of protection of VHI by the State caused it to become, until very recently, less than cost conscious?  It is in this context that I tabled amendments Nos. 6 and 7.<\/p><p>I will conclude by referring briefly to my amendment No. 8, which seeks to put it into law that we would have a level playing field among insurance providers.  That is the approach I am putting forward because it would be valuable to society to tackle the costs this sector has imposed upon us in recent years and push forward the implementation of the Milliman report.  I hope these proposals and our consideration of them will be helpful to the Minister as he attempts to tackle the problem of such a rapid rise in voluntary health insurance costs and the loss of so many members.  We must ask ourselves whether we acted enthusiastically enough to implement a report which showed us how we could get a lot of those costs down by more than 2%.  As always when the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, comes to the House, we have interesting discussions.  I do not intend to press these amendments, but it is important that we discuss the issues they raise, which also were raised in the Milliman report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800024#Y00300","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418910300,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Following the Milliman report in 2010, my predecessor as Minister, Deputy James Reilly, spearheaded a focus on managing claims costs across the market.  In addition, he appointed Mr Pat McLoughlin as independent chair of the consultative forum on health insurance, which produced two reports on measures to reduce costs in the private health insurance market.  This focus resulted in a 2% reduction in claims costs in 2013.  This welcome and significant reduction has facilitated a reduction in stamp duty for 2015 for non-advanced products and the maintenance of stamp duty for advanced products at 2014 levels.  We will need to be vigilant to keep costs under control and make sure this achievement was not a one-off blip.<br\/>Under Section 7E of the Health Insurance Acts, in October each year the Health Insurance Authority submits a report to the Minister for Health setting out its evaluation and analysis of information returns supplied by insurers for the 12-month period from 1 July to 30 June.<\/p> <p>The authority recommends to the Minister the risk equalisation credits and corresponding stamp duty levies required to fund them for the following year, taking into account the changing demographic profile of those insured and market developments, including price and product developments.  The risk equalisation credit rates are based on average claims costs across the market rather than on insurance company costs <i>per se<\/i>.  This encourages efficiencies as it compensates insurers for only a proportion of the higher costs of insuring older people and less healthy people.  In addition to risk equalisation credits, the Hospital Bed Utilisation Credit, HBUC, provides a specified amount per night in respect of each hospital stay involving an overnight stay in a hospital bed by an insured person.  <br\/>The Senator will be interested to know that the Department and the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, have commenced work on the development of a more refined health status measure, using Diagnostic Related Groups, DRGs, to enhance the risk equalisation scheme and to improve support for less healthy people at all ages.  The HIA conducted an analysis of various international regimes and submitted a report to me on incorporating DRGs into the risk equalisation scheme.  That report is now under review at the Department and will inform policy developments in the risk equalisation scheme from 2016 onwards.  We are trying to move away from a very crude system whereby we just assume that older people cost more and, therefore, credits and stamp duties are attached to that to one where we will be more defined and put people into different DRGs, based on illnesses and conditions.  This is a more refined way of ensuring community rating than the very crude system in operation at present which is based on the assumption that older people cost more.<br\/>The HIA is an independent regulator with extensive expertise in all areas of health insurance.  I believe it is best placed to evaluate and analyse market developments and determine the appropriate level of credits required to support older people and less healthy people and the stamp duties and levies required to fund them.  <br\/>I note that Senator Barrett made reference to amendment No.8.  In that context I would reiterate what I said earlier, namely, that the VHI will have to be authorised by the Central Bank.  It should be treated the same as all other insurers in the market and be required to have the same reserves, capitalisation and so forth, as its competitors.  We hope that it will be authorised by the Central Bank in the early part of 2015, that is, within the next few weeks.  However, that is ultimately a decision for the Central Bank.  It is not appropriate or even possible for my Department to regulate that it be so.  The VHI has to put its finances in order and make sure that it has proper re-insurance and reserves.  Then it goes to the Central Bank for authorisation and the Central Bank decides if it meets the criteria.  It is not for the Oireachtas or the Department to decide that matter.  That is why I would not favour putting that into legislation.  It is already the law that the Central Bank decides whether an insurer is authorised or not.  That is not a decision for the Oireachtas or the Department of Health.  <br\/>On VHI costs we must acknowledge the very good work by the company in recent years.  It is now profitable again, despite the fact that it has fewer customers.  It has done a lot of work in the areas of clinical audits and special investigations.  It now goes into private hospitals, examines the claims and conducts clinical audits.  That has been very successful and has helped to bring down claims costs.  This shows that competition is working and I would like to see more of it.  I would like to see more clinical audits happening in public hospitals, quite frankly, with the HSE going into hospitals and making sure that unnecessary tests are not being ordered, unnecessary investigations are not being conducted and patients are not being sent for unnecessary consultations.  I know that happens; it certainly happened when I worked in the health service and it probably still does.  It is very hard to stand over some people on waiting lists not being treated while others are in hospital being over-treated.  That is certainly a feature of private medicine but it is also a feature of the public health service too.<br\/>Senator Barrett pointed out that I appoint the members of the boards of VHI and the HIA and I do see the conflict in that.  I know that in other countries, State-owned enterprises are not under the remit of the same Department that sets policy or regulation.  Perhaps that is an issue which should feature in manifestos in a year or so.  I would point out, however, that the process has now changed for the appointment of members to the board of VHI.  As it is a financial institution just like the State-owned banks, all appointments have to be approved by the Central Bank.  I wish the Central Bank had done that with the banks ten or 15 years ago.  It does it now for both banks and insurance companies and the Central Bank will call in people for interview before they are appointed to State boards.  I have much less discretion over appointing members to the board of the VHI than any previous Minister for Health.  Now the Central Bank must be satisfied that each individual is competent and that there is a range of competencies across the board.  It is a fairly independent process now, much more so than in the past.<br\/>If one talks to consultants who work in private medicine or to staff in private hospitals, one will hear them complain bitterly about health insurers in a way that they never did in the past.  To me, that is evidence that the insurers are trying to drive down costs in a way that they did not do in the past.  We allow private insurers to negotiate with private hospitals on price but not with the public hospitals.  Essentially, a flat rate is set and that is what they have to pay.  The insurers are asking for the power to negotiate on price with the public hospitals and that is something I intend to examine.  They cannot negotiate on price at the moment even if they wanted to and perhaps that is something which should change.  <br\/>We intend to initiate a consultation on how to encourage health insurers to cover more treatments at primary care level.  Many treatments are currently carried out in hospitals in a way that is quite expensive.  I know that Senator Burke has previously raised the issue of haemochromatosis and how venesection for the condition could be done more cheaply at primary care level if VHI and the other insurers would reimburse it.  Similar issues arise with minor surgery and chronic disease management.  However, it is a tricky thing to do because the insurers will have to be willing to play ball on that, as will the GPs, in terms of clinical governance, contracts, fees and so forth.  That said, I am keen to make real progress in this area in 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800025#Z00200","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418910900,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and welcome his description of all of these interesting and exciting events, in terms of setting the system up on a different basis from 2016 onwards.  It will not be based on the premise that older people cost more.  The requirement for Central Bank authorisation, as described by the Minister, is a first.  The Minister also made reference to clinical audits and asked why some people are being kept in hospital because they have good insurance while there are waiting lists full of people.  Senator Quinn made reference to the Chinese model of paying doctors and keeping people healthy.  Perhaps there should be some incentive in place to make sure that people do not stay in hospital for the 10.6 days mentioned in the Milliman Report.  I also welcome the news that insurers are driving down costs, even if it annoys people like Senator Crowne when they do so.  Hospitals in the private sector are competing on price.  Can we not substitute out-patient or GP visits for hospitalisation?   At present, only hospitalisation is reimbursed by all of the insurance companies.  We should encourage a change in mentality to reduce the burdens on the hospital system.  These are all most interesting developments and I thank the Minister for telling us about them.  In that context, I wish to withdraw amendment No. 6 and do not wish to move amendments Nos.7 or 8.

While I am not quite sure where I left off, I may have been talking about the referendum and the question of privatisation.  People have squashed that and have suggested there is no possibility of it.  I believe the Minister or somebody else asked who has mentioned or called for privatisation.  Although nobody has quite called for privatisation, the Minister's colleague, the former Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, has stated this was very much on the menu.  Somebody who was directly involved in the negotiations and in the utility's establishment ought to have a pretty good idea of what was on the mat and as the former Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, has been saying this, that is the evidence I would put before the House in this regard.<\/p><p>I also have received briefings from the Green Party and I am glad to see it making some sort of a comeback.  The Green Party makes the point with regard to the Irish Water utility - it wishes to keep it as a utility - that it is in the interests of the common good that this resource is permanently owned by the people and used to their benefit.  The final point made by the Green Party is a very good one with which I am sure the Minister will sympathise, having spoken about his time here in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, namely, that the role of the Upper House is to rise above the day-to-day political theatre and that is what I hope it will do.  I have received several thousand e-mails on this issue and it was simply impossible to deal with that volume but I have singled out just one.  It was from a reasonable woman who is a low-paid worker earning less than &euro;28,000 and this is a bill she cannot afford, as it is just too much.  She is a single mum, her son is about to go to university and she believes she may not be able to send him to college because of this.  Moreover, if he goes to college, he then will be charged the water rate separately.<\/p> <p>Again, this appears to be very unfair.  She states that she is already paying property tax, which is taken at source, PAYE, PRSI, USC and a multitude of other taxes and VAT every day.  She is of the view that it is unfair and unjust to impose water charges on people.  Finally, she indicates that she has zero confidence that privatisation has been ruled out.<\/p><p>I wish to make a general point.  A previous Government, following a great deal of difficult negotiation, obtained a derogation from Europe in respect of the imposition of water tax.  This is now being thrown away.  It is incomprehensible that we would go to the trouble of obtaining a derogation from European protocols only to then just leave them to one side.  What has happened to this derogation?  Will the Minister indicate why the Government did not submit an application for EU funding in respect of its plan for water charges?  On the radio in recent days it was announced that some incomprehensible amount of money - it might have been &euro;67 billion or it could have been &euro;360 billion - is available for infrastructural plans throughout the EU.  Why did we not submit an application to obtain funding for the provision of water infrastructure?  Surely such an application would have been regarded sympathetically in light of our current situation.<\/p><p>The Minister made a very good point when he stated that Ireland is distinct from most other countries because it has abundant supplies of freshwater.  He also highlighted the fact that this natural resource - which we take for granted - is not so plentiful in other countries and that these are placed at a disadvantage when it comes to attracting business, industry, pharma and chemical companies, agrifood interests, etc.  I absolutely agree with the Minister that something must be done with regard to water supplies.  However, people being obliged to pay for it twice is not the way to go.  I do not believe for one second that the money collected will be directly invested in the infrastructure system.  I am sure the Minister will be able to confirm that the money in question is not ring-fenced.  There is nothing which states that it must be given directly to Irish Water.  I am of the view that, like motor tax, etc., it will just disappear into general Exchequer funds.<\/p><p>When, on a previous occasion in this House, a Minister referred to raw sewage, I speculated as to whether she would prefer it cooked.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, referred to the contents of the Bill and stated &quot;The Government package announced last month also referred to a suite of measures that would apply if households did not pay.&quot;  The Government is being very coy about this matter.  That suite of measures is not outlined in the Bill - probably in the interests of not frightening off the ditherers who are trying to find any excuse to justify their pusillanimous support for the Government - and I would like to be provided with some information in respect of it.  These measures constitute the punishment for people who do not cough up.  What a euphemistic turn of phrase the Minister employs when he refers to &quot;a suite of measures&quot;.  It almost sounds as if we should be queuing up to be entertained by this suite of measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800028#CC00600","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418912100,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, the time for eating dessert is exhausted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800029#DD00200","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1418912100,"counter":289,"content":"<p>My pudding was wonderful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800029#DD00300","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1418912100,"counter":290,"content":"<p>No doubt the Senator enjoyed it.

In Dublin, more than 800 km of pipe is over 100 years old.  Most major EU cities have a spare capacity of 15% to 20%, whereas Dublin has a surplus capacity of between 1% and 4%.

In Castlerea, a new treatment plant is expected to be completed this month.

We always had to source our water supply from Roscommon and there was never an adequate water supply in the county.  Now we can cross borders to source our supply and in my town of Ballaghaderreen where people have not been able to drink the water there for 20 years, the plan is to extract water from Lough Mask in County Mayo.  That is a welcome development.  Some 31% of the people of Roscommon have always paid for their water and that is a statistic that is probably accurate across rural Ireland.

It has been only 24 hours since we last went toe to toe yesterday.  The classic line that comes to mind with the Water Services Bill is that if we were to start from anywhere, we would not be starting from here.  My thoughts on the Bill it that it is complex, contradictory and a conundrum.  I believe we should pay for water in order to conserve what is a limited natural resource.  I disagree with Senator Daly on that.  That is my philosophy on this.  Also it would be to widen the tax base of our citizens, scrap the universal social charge and means test the wealthy, in particular those like me who earn more than &euro;100,000.  In assessing any charge or tax of citizens, the issue of fairness and equality must be a key factor.  It is clear, as we saw as recently as last week with the ESRI report, that the gap of inequality is getting wider.  Inequality is becoming more institutionalised than ever before.  I believe strongly that a progressive tax system needs to have been in place and it is within that context that both an equitable property tax and water charge would or could work.<br\/>The Government has made an absolute hames of this.  I lay the blame at the ineptitude of the former Minister, Phil Hogan.  His portfolio above all had the potential to radically change the Irish political and social landscape.  His portfolio alone could have delivered on political reform, electoral reform, issues around climate change, local government reform, better delivery of taxation through local government reform, planning, social, housing, property tax and water charges.  The list of failed actions and financial calamaries in his legacies are longer than Santa's present list.<br\/>The debacle of the setting up and the cost of Irish Water is a clear example of the waste of money and the inept management of public administration.  It is no wonder that public trust in our systems and in us is so low or practically non-existent.  There are many reasons citizens marched on the streets and even some of the organisers admitted that, but they achieved the <i>volte-face<\/i>of public admissions of mistakes by Government, to which the Minister referred in his speech, of the exorbitant original charges for water use.  <br\/>This is not a good Bill.  Even the elemental requirement of conservation is back to front.  We are meant to encourage conservation but bizarrely section 5 makes a provision for water conservation to citizens despite the fact that there is uncapped usage of water for a period up to 2018.  This is not good law.  It is ludicrous.  Again, I am not against water charges.  I have concerns over the ambiguity in Irish Water's terms and conditions over rain harvesting.  If we harvest rain and if it is used to supplement water requirements, particularly with regard to wastewater, will there be consequences?  I would like the Minister to give me an answer to that.  Water conservation is an enormous challenge for us but it is one that we know that group water schemes have successfully managed to work.  There is a working precedent and we know this.  Senators must have honest in this House that group water schemes have shown the way forward with regard to conservation, particularly through water metering.  I live in Dublin and I defy anybody to tell me otherwise.  We need to have the facts and to have clarity in the House during this debate.  Therefore, capping water charges in itself is not a good and efficient way to conserve water and this Bill is a political statement of apology, but do two wrongs make a right?<br\/>Another issue I have relates to section 11.  If 95,000 have already registered with Irish Water, what will happen to the personal public service, PPS, numbers provided?  This Bill does not cater for them retrospectively.  How can the Minister assure the Seanad that all those PPS numbers will be destroyed?  Can he reassure the House that there a transparent mechanism has been put in place to resolve this issue?  I do not see that in the Bill.  What might the role of the Data Commissioner be in this case?<br\/>I acknowledge that a major concern of mine, to which I alerted earlier this week, has been somewhat appeased in section 2 which provides for the holding of a the plebiscite on the ownership of Irish water.  From reading section 2 and having listened to the Minister's speech, the Government must put before the people any proposals that may change public ownership of Irish water.<br\/>I am frustrated with the incompetencies of the Government which has botched and failed us in many of its promises but for some reason it  cannot even manage the administration of policy in a rigorous efficient manner.  The legacy of Phil Hogan is damaging to the people of Ireland, an effect which will be felt for years to come.  It puts us, or me, in an invidious position with regard to whether we should accept this Bill because it caps necessary water charges yet there is no inducement to conserve water, and the rollout of Irish Water has caused anger, protest, and crucially a waste of money.  The passing of this Bill will not resolve the inept mistakes of the Government but it could at least offer certainty and clarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800031#FF00200","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1418913300,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and compliment him on the good job he has been doing since he assumed office.

It is a mess that has brought Leinster House into disrepute.  Nothing else brought 130,000 people on to the streets.  We tried to table amendments with the Minister's predecessor and, as always, the Leader allowed full discussion, but it turned out that he was never formally allocated responsibility for the area, as claimed by the then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, and he had no ability to accept amendments.  I attended the banking inquiry this morning.  I think water will do for this Government what banking did for the previous one.  It has brought us all into disrepute, because we have ignored so many obvious faults and flaws, although the Minister has addressed some of them.  Let us look at the newspaper headlines: &quot;Irish Water allowances 'are flawed' &quot;; &quot;Water watchdog staff net almost &euro;1m in bonuses&quot;; &quot;Coalition will not survive water debacle&quot;; &quot;Irish Water taps up extra staff&quot;; &quot;Irish Water will cost twice as much as in UK&quot;; &quot;Irish Water has been exempted from paying an annual rates bill of &euro;59m&quot;; &quot;&euro;420k car perk for water bosses&quot;.<br\/>This has been such a disaster that we should stop it now.  Let us look at all the mistakes we have made.  We put it on top of the local authority structure.  The McLoughlin report found there was a 30% surplus of county managers, a 15% surplus of directors of services, a 10% surplus of corporate services staff, a 10% surplus of planning staff and a 15% surplus of city managers, and to this we added 900 staff, most of whom, according to the media, were not recruited by open competition.  We have 4,000 people doing the work of 2,400.  That is the burden that will be passed on for the future.<br\/>Irish Water is completely flawed in its concept.  We have been told by Deputies and Senators that it is off-balance-sheet.  Would you buy a used car from a guy who asks to keep it off-balance-sheet?  I am not sure it is off-balance-sheet or whether the idea has any validity.  Let us have public accounts that reflect the reality of what we are spending and stop seeking accountancy tricks which many people doubt will get past the EU. <br\/>Let us look also at some of the offers we rejected.  The <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>of 24 April 2012 reported that Siemens Ireland boss Mr. Werner Kruckow offered meters to the Green Party.  Apparently, the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, John Gormley, was willing to accept them, but his successor, Mr. Phil Hogan, did not pursue that offer.  We have spent more than half a billion euro on meters.  In the UK system, 60% of houses have no meters.  Why is it that the money spent on meters was not spent on fixing the pipes?<br\/>In regard to the first set of untruths by the proposers - &quot;We have to pay for water,&quot; and &quot;We never paid for it&quot; - we pay very large amounts of taxation for water.  I will give the reasons why paying through general taxation is a good way to do it.  We have now imposed a poll tax; the charge is the same for everybody, unlike income tax, whereby a family of four on &euro;100,000 pays about 14 times more than one on &euro;15,000.

Its own members, the county engineers, were the biggest wasters of all.  We know from the Minister's contribution today that the waste within houses was only 6%.  Therefore, the figure of 55% was to try to make people feel guilty in order that they would volunteer for this model.  Engineers were paid substantial amounts of money and it was up to them to fix it.  I think it was Ben Dunne who said that if one had a shop which had 55% of its stock stolen, one would interview the people around the shop rather than going to the street and blaming the customers.  We have had enough of that blame game.<\/p><p>I object to being called a customer.  I had a relationship with Kildare County Council.  I am conscripted by Irish Water and I do not want to be conscripted.  The issue of overmanning has not been addressed.  This is a regressive tax which is undermining the political stability in this country.  The way in which Irish Water conducts itself and treats its clients, the members of a democracy, is a disaster.  One of the sad consequences is that many friends of mine on the Government benches will not here after the next election.  I do not know why Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party made such sacrifices of themselves with the banking business and why this Government is so keen to sacrifice itself with the water business.  Irish Water should be reformed.  It is a case study in how not to create a quango.  It is over-manned and inefficient.  Once set up, as with all the bodies we tried to reform in these two Houses of Parliament, we will never be able to reform it.  I say, let us stop now, restore the responsibility for water services to the local authorities, implement the productivity elements that are to be implemented under the McLoughlin report, reduce over-manning and bring it back to local authorities.  There are no economies of scale in Irish Water.  In regard to water wastage, there are some small counties such as Leitrim and Waterford, where there is very little waster wastage, while there are some large counties with large amounts of water wastage.  The idea that one water company in the country would achieve some economies of scale is actually not borne out by the numbers in the McLoughlin report.  Irish Water is ill-conceived, and its headquarters should be shut down and its PR department closed.

Senator Cummins said the Government had listened to the serious concerns of public representatives and protesters, but this time last year we spent 17 hours debating the Water Services Bill mark one.  I tabled dozens of amendments, Fianna F&aacute;il tabled amendments and Senators Norris and Barrett tabled amendments, but not one of these was accepted by the Minister of the time and all such amendments were voted down by Senators on the other side of the House.  The Minister says he has raised his hands and admitted that mistakes were made, but he voted for the Water Services Bill, mark one.  It was guillotined in the D&aacute;il and the current Minister stood over all of the mistakes that he would now have us believe were merely the errors of two former Ministers who happen to have moved on.

I have spoken before about the lack of clarity and the incompetence surrounding the establishment of Irish Water.  No observer could be anything but disappointed with how it was handled.  I will not rehash all of those issues today; they are as obvious as they were avoidable.  I am concerned, however, about the damage they have done to our national confidence and the body politic generally.<\/p><p>My intention is to address the cynicism of those now opposing the establishment of Irish Water.  I refer in particular to the political opportunism of Fianna F&aacute;il in opposing the establishment of a body of which it was initially in favour.  I do so in the hope that Members of that party might leave politics aside for one moment and take the correct course.  The Government rightly moved in recent weeks to address the concerns of people in regard to the establishment of Irish Water.  Although the sums now involved are not to be sniffed at, they are reasonable and fixed.  The issue of privatisation has been addressed, as has the requirement to provide PPS numbers and other issues that caused people concern.<\/p><p>I can perfectly understand that people might be angry at the Government about this issue.  However, to use a rather hackneyed phrase, anger is not a policy and the bottom line is that we urgently need a water utility.  There are still areas in this country with water unfit for use.  There are sizeable towns with no water provision at all.  That is unacceptable.  If we are serious about attracting future investment by multinationals, developing key sectors such as tourism, which has grown by 9% this year, and promoting Ireland as a food island, we must tackle the environmental scandal of raw sewage seeping into lakes, rivers and seas and having a detrimental impact on provincial towns and cities.<\/p><p>Until such time as Irish Water is established, there will be no proper investment in our water infrastructure.  Since the foundation of the State, local authorities have had responsibility for the provision of water services and that was paid for through direct taxation.  It led to situations such as that in Galway, for instance, where 50% of the water supply is leaking away before it reaches the tap.  The most desperate and utterly untrue pseudo-reason for opposing the establishment of this utility is that it involves double taxation.  That is utterly untrue.  The new utility will not only do as the local authorities did before, that is, treat and get water to householders' taps, it will also, for the first time, allow for serious multi-billion euro investment in our water infrastructure.  The previous regime allowed for no investment worth talking about.  Local authorities had very limited ability to borrow and, if they did, such borrowing went onto the national balance sheet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800034#JJ01500","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1418915100,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Does this reading from scripts by a succession of Members on the other side of the House indicate disarray within the Government?

There is no double taxation.  The water and sewerage system is an absolute disaster and we simply do not have the necessary billions of euro to invest it.  The alternative to a public utility is for the State to borrow the required moneys and add those borrowings to the Exchequer deficit - the deficit we are only just getting under control.  The Opposition should be truthful and present this reality to the electorate.  If we were previously taxed for water services, then where is the modern water and sewerage infrastructure?  Is the Opposition seriously proposing a deficit increase?  If Members vote down this legislation, they are saying they want investment in water infrastructure but will adopt the Sinn F&eacute;in tactic of wanting every service possible while opposing any method to pay for it.  That would be endorsing the same-as-usual, populist politics that dragged this State to its knees.  We are in the process of dragging ourselves out of that morass and I urge Senators to play no part in reversing that.<\/p><p>The simple truth is that we never taxed people sufficiently to fund a modern water infrastructure structure.  Direct State investment is currently unaffordable and would, in any event, increase the deficit.  The establishment of a water utility is the only way forward, unpopular as it may be.  It is entirely our fault that this type of populist rhetoric has taken hold; I will not blame anyone else for that.  The incompetence displayed in the setting up of Irish Water has caused justifiable anger and mistrust.  However, the alternative is financially much worse.

The new measures around payment allow for greater certainty and affordability.  The original timescale for the creation of Irish Water was highly challenging and it was underestimated how much work would need to be done to ensure this utility would be up and running smoothly.  We all acknowledge the mistakes made.  As Senators Landy, Cummins and others have said on this side of this House, many of the issues and flaws pointed out by Opposition Members in previous debates have been resolved in this Bill.  Again, fair-minded people will accept that this Bill addresses those issues.  It is a response by the Government to the concerns expressed democratically by people through their elected representatives and public action on the streets.  We saw the latter in great numbers last month.<\/p><p>Changes will be made to the governance of Irish Water.  The public water forum is an important development.  The Government established the Convention on the Constitution which shows the way in which people power through appropriate fora can really work and ensure democratic governance.  The convention recommended that economic, social and cultural rights should be enshrined in the Constitution but that more scrutiny would be needed as to how that would be done.  That is the sort of constitutional text we should be working toward in the future.<\/p><p>Everyone on both sides of the House has acknowledged the need to ensure the conservation of water.<\/p> <p>There is no right to a wastewater service.  In our current mechanism we have an enormous level of waste.  The Minister has also spoken about the high levels of leakages and the fact that we need a complete overhaul of the public water system.  <\/p><p>Senator John Whelan has commented that in Dublin we are on the verge of running out of water.  Those of us living in Dublin are well aware that we did run out of water last Christmas for many periods, some lasting many days.  It was a huge problem for all domestic households but also for those running businesses, particularly restaurants and hotels, over the busy Christmas season.  That is the infrastructure that is creaking and flawed and that has suffered from decades of under-investment.  That is the issue Irish Water is seeking to tackle.<\/p><p>Some important facts have been highlighted on this side of the House in terms of the savings already visible from the creation of one utility from 31 separate local authorities operating a flawed and creaky water infrastructure.  The saving of &euro;170 million arising from the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant upgrade and &euro;12 million in procurement annually are very important and remind us of the need to ensure a better system of management and governance of the precious resource that is our water supply.  The Minister mentioned the global context.  We know that water is a precious resource internationally, too, and that this is going to become an increasingly difficult issue internationally.  This is part of a package of changes.  We need to give people incentives to conserve and no longer a right to waste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800035#KK03300","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418916300,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and welcome him to the House.  I have read the Bill carefully and listened to the Minister's open and constructive speech.  Since my appointment to the Seanad in May 2011, I have taken my role as a legislator very seriously and voted with my conscience on an issue by issue basis.  As I prepared for this debate, the Irish proverb, \"I wouldn't start from here\", sprang to mind, as it did for my colleague, Senator Fiach Mac Conghail whom I showed that I had also written it down.  The flaws in the establishment of Irish Water, the arrogance of the Government and the Irish Water leadership and their complete mismanagement are not in dispute.  However, the reality is that Irish Water exists; it is not going to go away, and the Bill, while it is not a panacea, addresses and provides remedies for a number of significant issues of concern.<\/p><p>My primary concern is the issue of public ownership.  I want to ensure the water supply will remain in public ownership.  I trust the people of Ireland and believe - I stress on a first reading - that section 2 provides the necessary safeguards in this regard.  However, I am very conscious that my colleagues will be tabling alternative proposals and I will be listening to these proposals and making up my mind accordingly.<\/p><p>It is also welcome that when the Minister took office, he clearly stated no one's water supply would be could off.  The Bill prohibits the disconnection or reduction of water supply to a dwelling because of an unpaid bill.<\/p><p>My colleague, Senator Fiach Mac Conghail, raised the issue of data protection.  I share his concerns and question whether the Bill needs to go further.  We need to ensure the PPS numbers are disposed of in an appropriate manner and to be assured that this has been done.<\/p><p>I believe in water conservation.  That is where I first came to the issue of Irish Water and would have been a supporter of it.  I believe in metering because it allows each of us to take individual responsibility for knowing what our water usage is and ensure we monitor it.  Much of that water has been lost and as such, we will need to look at the issue again.  As the Minister said, 49% of water is lost through leakages.  He noted that 5% to 6% was lost on the customer's side.<\/p><p>I also welcome the Minister's commitment today that Irish Water will distinguish between those who will not pay and those who genuinely cannot pay.  In the past week we have debated the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill in the House.  I wish as many Senators had participated in that debate as are participating today because we have a long way to go in that regard.  In recent years I was lectured about the importance of investing in services and supports, yet, at the first opportunity, we go back to cash transfers.  There is an issue for us to look at.  UNICEF has shown the impact of the recession on children in Ireland compared to those in other similar countries in the OECD.  We need to integrate the Revenue and welfare systems if we are to understand what the level of household income is and how we can lift children out of poverty.  That is not the issue before us today, but it is one I want to stress because the Minister will be sitting at the Cabinet table and when we have to take these decisions, that is where our priorities must lie.  I do not believe the Water Services Bill will be the one that makes the difference for families.  What makes the difference is having a fairer taxation system and investment in the provision of supports for children and their families to ensure they are lifted out of poverty.  <\/p><p>I will be looking at each amendment tabled by my colleagues on its merits, but important steps are being taken in the Bill which I can support overall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800036#LL00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1418916300,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I also welcome the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.  Like all of my colleagues on this side of the House, I also acknowledge the rollback the Minister initiated following his appointment as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Some of us sat through and contributed to the 17 hours of debate on the original legislation setting up Irish Water, during which, as has been pointed out, the Government accepted no  amendments whatsoever.  There was no monopoly of wisdom on the Fianna F&aacute;il side of the House; there was wisdom on all sides in all parties and individuals who put forward various amendments and the Minister is to be complimented on having listened to them.

That could happen in tandem with the local authorities retaining the right to continue to make the entire water system fit for purpose.

The big problem is that Senator John Gilroy believes that to be the case when it is not.  It is the plain people of Ireland who are speaking.  I have engaged with many people in my constituency.  In my experience it is not the case that this is a concerted effort by one particular party, but other Members can speak for themselves.  I am sorry to be political, but because Members on the other side of the House has been on this issue, I will be, too.  They are peddling the myth that Fianna F&aacute;il did not invest in water infrastructure.  If ever an urban myth gained legs, it is this one.  At the height of the Celtic tiger &euro;4.8 billion was invested in infrastructure.  As Senator Darragh O'Brien pointed out and as many of my colleagues across rural Ireland would testify - if Government Senators were truthful, they would do so, too - there is the evidence of this on the ground in the small local and regional water schemes introduced in the past ten years.  <\/p><p>To be even more political, not so much in the context of the abolition of domestic water rates for which, like Senator Darragh O'Brien, I do not feel I was responsible and which I thought was terrible, during the period in office of the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition between 1981 and 1987, it actually abolished the rates support grant.<\/p> <p>It then gave the authority to local authorities to raise revenue locally, which resulted in a number of local authorities introducing water rates.  The rainbow coalition in the 1990s attempted to introduce water rates.  On the eve of the election, rather than having measured and considered reflection on a policy issue, it said, in a panic, that it would not introduce water charges.  In 2003, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Martin Cullen, introduced a Water Services Act which attempted to address the water infrastructure in the country.  <\/p><p>It is a known and statistically accepted fact that we have approximately 99% water quality, which is unusually high for a country which has a low population density, and we are free of E. coli, notwithstanding the boil water notices, particularly in Roscommon.  It is a result of the low population density that is unique to Ireland.<\/p><p>Some 25,000 km of piping has to be addressed.  No Government, even with all of the money that was available during the Celtic tiger era, would have been able to complete that programme.  Fianna F&aacute;il cannot be accused of being lacking in developing the infrastructure of the country, because the legacy is there for everybody to see.<\/p><p>I was the first and only person to raise the question of PPS numbers.  It escaped everybody else.  Despite the fact that the Bill will amend legislation, there is a very real danger that it is also inherently flawed, and we could be here again to amend the legislation further.  As Senator O'Brien pointed out, the storm clouds are already gathering around the amount of money that will be collected and generated as a result of the amending legislation, which may not meet EU subvention requirements.  Overall, until such time as the entire water infrastructure is fit for purpose, local authorities should be able to continue to operate its development.<\/p><p>I support the concept of water metering.  It has to be in place because of the high rates of leakage, irrespective of what anybody else might think.  Otherwise, how will we be able to find out about leaks?  I do not think the fair-minded general public would be in opposition to that.  Overall, the problem now centres on the credibility factor of Irish Water and whether the Government can be trusted to ensure that there will not be privatisation.  That is why we will call for a very specific constitutional amendment to ensure that happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800036#LL00700","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418916900,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

The other side of the House assumed at the time that it had all the wisdom and that there was none on this side, but we can see how flawed that was.<\/p><p>The furore over water since 1 October has brought a level of realism and a requirement to re-examine the legislation.  The Government side has begun to listen a bit more, but we are still doing the wrong thing, just a little bit righter.  The concept of Irish Water has been poorly constructed.<\/p><p>As Senator Barrett said, we have some 4,000 people doing the work of 2,300 people.  According to Professor John Fitzgerald of the ESRI, it is the work of 1,700 people.  This is the burden and culture being propagated by Irish Water.  Everybody wants water, but everybody does not want Irish Water, including the corporate image and the culture of bonuses.  While the Minister has taken some of that off the table, including the PPS numbers, we have to get things completely right.  <\/p><p>I see merit in examining the possibility of local authorities taking on the job and fixing the leaks.  Deals were offered to the Government.  Siemens offered to install meters at a cost of &euro;810 million, none of which was to be paid up front, and recoup the cost over time, but that was taken off the table by, I presume, the former Minister, Phil Hogan.  The deal was given to Denis O'Brien's Siteserv at a cost of, I understand, &euro;539 million for obsolete meters that will need to be read by a person travelling around in a van.  If we had decided on smart metering, people would have been able to monitor their usage from inside their homes.  That would have been a step in the right direction towards water conservation.  <\/p><p>In his speech the Minister said that, according to the OECD, &quot;metering is the key to fairness.&quot;  Some 533,000 meters have been installed in 16 months.  Given that there are 1.6 million homes in the country, we are one-third of the way there.  Water has a price.  We need it, and producing it carries a cost.  Charges should not commence until all homes have meters installed.  After that, there should be at least two terms during which readings are given to every household in the country to show them their usage.  The first reading would show households whether they are above the average usage for family size and if they have leaks.  The second should be able to show whether that has been corrected.  After that, it would be fair to begin a process of charging for water.<\/p><p>The Minister is offering a grant of &euro;100, but it is not a water conservation grant.  It is an inducement to sign up and nothing else.  It is a sop to the Irish people at a fairly considerable cost, namely, &euro;130 million from the Exchequer.  The accident and emergency department in University College Hospital Galway could use that money right now, such is the overcrowding of people over 80 years of age on trolleys.  <\/p><p>If the &euro;100 water conservation grant is genuine, where are the metrics the Minister will use to verify that people are conserving water and are therefore entitled to the grant?  There are none that I have heard of.  Giving people &euro;100 and calling it a water conservation grant when it cannot be proved that they are conserving water is the type of hypocrisy that really annoys people.  Water is a precious resource and is fundamental to life.  It must never be subject to manipulation.<\/p><p>If water services ever go into the hands of a private company or into private ownership, they would be subject to manipulation.  Every day I hear that nobody in the House wants water to be privatised, but it is our job to put legislation on the books that will stand into the future for all Governments.  Irish Water must, therefore, be kept in public ownership.  The plebiscite in section 2 of the Bill to which the Minister referred will not ensure that water is kept in public ownership, because it is dependent on a resolution of the Houses.  Does the term &quot;resolution&quot; mean a majority of both Houses?  That is not secure; just look at how the other House voted yesterday.  A resolution of both Houses does not mean that we will keep water in public ownership.  There is only one way to do that, namely, to enshrine it in the Constitution in perpetuity.  I was moved by the case made by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell a few weeks ago in the House.  <\/p><p>I would see the &euro;160 net charge as reasonable if I thought the Government could ensure that figure was sustainable after 2019.  I have not yet decided how I will vote, but if the Minister can tell me the figures to show that the charge will be sustainable for Irish families after 2019 and we can invest in water infrastructure at the same time, he will have my vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800037#MM00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1418917500,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.

However, I also believe Article 10 of the Constitution needs to be debated and rewritten.  There is great concern and unhappiness among the public about the potential privatisation of Irish Water.  In providing for a plebiscite before the proposed privatisation of water services in the legislation, the Minister is clearly acknowledging this public concern.  However, the legislation provides no meaningful guarantees.  Why does the Government want to keep the option of privatisation open to future Governments?  A plebiscite is a vote of every citizen who is registered to vote on an issue of national significance.  I will not disagree that the ownership of our water supply is one such issue.  Air and water are our most valuable natural resources.  There are many natural resources but I can live without gas, for example.  I understand that if the Government of the day is not obliged to follow the wishes of the people in any such vote, the Minister can choose to ignore the outcome of a plebiscite.

Mr. Trichet demanded structural reforms, and a nightmare that none of us could ever have dreamed ensued when the European Central Bank acted totally beyond its mandate in demanding them.

Today is a historic day in the Seanad as far as I am concerned because this is perhaps the first time in the history of the State that our water has received so much debate.<\/p><p>We have to think of the purification, delivery and disposal of our water.

There are people out there who do not agree that we should be paying for our water and there are people who say we should pay for what we use.  The past system was disgraceful, fragmented and disjointed with all the various county councils around the country.  There was no unification whatsoever.  People say they have already paid for water in their general taxation and ask why they should pay for it again.  If the people have been paying for it in their taxes all these years, how come previous Governments have failed to deliver a proper water system?  Our treatment plants, the hundreds and thousands of kilometres of pipes all around the country, with people still boiling water and still wasting water, are an absolute disgrace.<\/p><p>I lived in America for about 20 years and travelled the world a lot.  When my friends in the US hear there are thousands of people protesting because they have to pay water charges, they are stunned we do not pay for water in Ireland and want to know how come.  They just cannot understand it.  I think there are only two countries in the OECD that do not pay for water.  This is a serious cultural and behavioural change for the future in people's habits and the way we use our water.  This is a new way, a new structure, and I support the Minister and his Bill.  I do not believe there is anything to fear for the people of Ireland.  Most of the fear is coming from the scaremongering that is going on.  I believe Irish Water will be a success and we have to give it a chance.

Although a stay has been put on the implementation of water charges, the fact of the matter is that water charging is going to come in.  Once it is introduced, those costs can be increased.  The water metering programme is going to continue and metered charges will come in.  There is still no constitutional right to water, as has been alluded to by many colleagues here.  This is really a ploy to get people to sign up to the principle.

The woman, who rang me specifically, has no connection with my party whatsoever.  She stated that this is the last straw.  She stated that, as she approaches Christmas, even the &euro;3 a week is far too much for her with her two children.  The Government parties are deluding themselves when they try to convince people that it is only &euro;3 a week.  It is &euro;3 a week on top of all of the other costs that have been imposed on this family.  That it is why so many came out on the streets.  That is the point they were trying to make.

Certainly, when he came in here to discuss the previous setting up of Irish Water, I did not agree with him.  When I heard him state on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; that Irish Water was an unmitigated disaster, however, I certainly agreed with him wholeheartedly.

Previous to this, Galway County Council, after a 40 year campaign, had put in the first part of that scheme - the pipes are in place.  The second part of that scheme was to connect to a clean source of water so that we would have water to go through the pipes.  That had been sanctioned by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and agreed to, from a planning perspective.  Galway County Council was on board.  The first decision Irish Water made when it came on board was to review the position and what we found out is that it is scrapping that essential investment.  This is scrapping investment to a community that has been drinking water which has exceeded WHO levels of trihalomethanes, THMs, since 2008.  That information had to be dragged out of the local authority and others.  What is happening here is not an investment.  It is a divestment from projects.  It is becoming clear, from what Irish Water has told us about what is happening regionally, the company intends to set up regional schemes.  In the case of Galway, Irish Water will pump water from Galway out through Connemara.  There will be a necklace of regional schemes set up here.

That right was challenged during the evolution of Uisce &Eacute;ireann when at one stage people were threatened with having their water turned off, in other words, that one could not wash or cook for one's children.  The people power on the streets got that modified to some extent.  They were told Irish Water would not turn the water off completely, but would only give a little water.  Therefore, a person could only wash himself or herself a little and only cook every so often.  Out of the Proclamation of 1916 came the big question: how were we cherishing all the children of the nation equally if we told them we would turn off their water if they did not pay?  Often these were people who could not pay.  I acknowledge that the Minister has made a valiant effort to salvage at a point of no return.  That point of no return was not at that particular stage but when we did not make this a red-line issue in Europe, which we should have done.  We had taken on austerity measures and we crucified the people of Ireland with them.  They suffered so much.  However, when it came to water, a life-giving resource, we should have stated quite clearly, \"Thus far and no further\", and then we would have been doing what was right for the people.<\/p><p>It has been said here that the setting up of Uisce &Eacute;ireann is akin to the setting up of the ESB, but that was not evident in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann when the legislation was first brought in and the guillotine used after two hours.  If it was akin to the setting up of the ESB, surely we should have been talking of two days or three days.  That is why we find ourselves in the position we are in today.<\/p><p>Sometimes it would pay to listen a little more closely to the man and woman on the street and the common sense which one will hear from them.  We heard it, the Minister heard it.  The question is - did we listen carefully?  When 300,000 to 400,000 people take to the streets, that is because they have not been listened to in the initial stages.  It is disingenuous to try in some way to diminish what those people were doing or, worse, as has been happening at times, to misrepresent the decent people of Ireland who knew full well that they could not pay any more - they had paid it all.  We are comfortable here.  We are well paid and we have expenses.  Sometimes it is very difficult to get down off the hobby horse and realise what we mean by &quot;people just cannot pay&quot;.  There are still children going to school whose families cannot clothe them.  There are still people going to bed early in the evening to stay warm.  We do not experience this.  It is a different world out there.  There are people who cannot even get one meal a day and this is an independent republic which will celebrate 1916 in a year's time.<\/p><p>What will happen here today?  I am not taking any political partisan position on this at all.  If the Minister thinks that passing today's legislation solves the problem, he is wrong.  It does quite the opposite.  I will tell him what it will do.<\/p> <p>What does the Government propose to do to about the unrest that has built up?

Despite that some of our pipes are more than 100 years old, if a problem arises Irish Water will only repair it free of charge once.  In this regard, a particular hotel, which is probably a couple of hundred years old, comes to mind.  How will that hotel exist if it has to bear the cost of repairs to its pipes which have been in place for a very long time?  I am concerned about the lack of regard for money.  I could not get over the figures referred to by Senator Barrett on the spend on Irish Water, including that it has spent approximately &euro;70 million on consultancies.  I cannot believe that.

It was a well managed project from beginning to end.  This Irish Water project has been disastrously managed.

There are extreme politically active groups who want to bring down the Government because of its incompetence in the establishment of Irish Water.  The concern is not about the establishment of Irish Water but the manner in which establishing it has been handled and the introduction of property taxes at the same time as people were to be charged for water.

Since my days on Clare County Council I have believed that water should be paid for.  It is a resource which many people in the Third World would love to have in abundance but unfortunately do not.  In this country we have water in abundance but unfortunately it is not purified.  It costs a significant amount of money to purify water.  Purifying water costs the country an average of &euro;1.2 billion every year, of which &euro;600 million is wasted.  To eliminate waste and create a respect for water, with which most of our citizens would agree, introducing a charge is appropriate.<\/p><p>We need to focus on the conservation of water.  Most of us here have gone canvassing over the years and have spent many days, months and years knocking on doors.  If one goes to the back door of the majority of houses one will see taps dripping.  This is a clear example of where water conservation does not work.  Apart from embracing water charges we need to engage in a serious educational programme of water conservation and advise people on how they can conserve water.  By conserving water we will drive down the cost for everybody.  We know that &euro;600 million of the &euro;1.2 billion spent purifying water is wasted but there is probably much more.  To prevent the vast majority of this water being leaked we need to create an investment programme.  The idea of having a domestic water charge, criticised and all as it is, is to facilitate Irish Water to raise money on the bond markets so it can engage in a substantial investment programme to re-equip areas which have pipes which date back decades.  In each area where the pipes are upgraded we will see a dramatic reduction in water leakage.<\/p><p>The meter programme is appropriate and should happen.  While the flat charge will prevail until 2019, and probably beyond, the metering infrastructure should be used to build intelligence and find out the location of the leaks.  It is totally unfair if house No. 27 pays for water, conserves water and is in control of water while No. 28 is the exact opposite.  The only way this can be identified, improved upon and acted on is if we have intelligence from the meters.  The meter installation problem should continue until every house in the country is metered and we are in a position to gather intelligence and act on it.  I have no doubt that pockets of the country have significant leaks, and if this is the case investment will have to be made.  People in areas which do not have leaks should embrace the conservation project.<\/p><p>This project is in its infancy.  By 2025 we will have a completely different environment with regard to water.  The water will be fit to drink, blackspots in the country will have been dealt with and rectified and people will appreciate why they should pay for water and will do so.  I hope that in 15 years time our water quality will be on a par with best international practice.  This is what all of us who believe in the principle of paying for water want to see.  We want to see a natural resource which is fit for consumption.  We do not want to see examples such as Roscommon.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister and the Minister of State well with the Bill and with the help of God it will pass and we will see a fairer discourse and narrative on paying for water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800043#SS00300","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1418920500,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, to the House.  The Bill is a complete disaster for the Government.  Like all other Senators I have received an enormous amount of e-mails. The e-mail systems are practically blocked up as a result.  There is a consistent message from people that enough is enough and they have reached saturation point as far as taxation is concerned.  This is the fundamental issue in this particular regard.<\/p><p>Water and its infrastructure have been paid for by taxation over the years.  People on farms have been paying for water for a number of years.  We pay Veolia, which is a multinational company given the responsibility by Roscommon County Council of collecting the water rates, but 20,000 households in Roscommon are not able to drink water as a result of bad management and pollution which has not yet been resolved.  During the by-election, commitments were given that no charges would be put on people who had boil water notices but it was then decided they would have to pay for the discharge of water even though the water in the first instance was not drinkable.<\/p><p>One must bear in mind the introduction of the household charge, which has been reluctantly accepted by the Irish people.  It is collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  It is obvious this charge should have incorporated water.  A specific percentage of the household charge should have been earmarked for water.  Irish Water is a quango, even though when it came into office the Government promised to abolish quangos and reduce the number of State companies.  Irish Water is one of the largest State companies to be established.  Unfortunately there has been political involvement through appointees from political parties and retired county managers.  Anyone who could be appointed was appointed on a political basis, such as membership of the Fine Gael Party.  I believe the ratio is two Fine Gael members to one Labour Party member with regard to judges, peace commissioners and prison inspectors.  It is the old system and the Government has not changed it.

The water charade since last year, when the first item of legislation was rammed through, was enough to spur anyone onto the streets not just once but repeatedly.  The anger of the people about water charges and this regime was evident on the streets in recent weeks when there were more than 150,000 people on the streets on a single weekend.  Moreover, every week since, tens of thousands of people nationwide have been out protesting against water charges.  To put it clearly, after the announcement of the changes to the scheme and after the publication of the Bill under discussion that was meant to provide assurances, tens of thousands of people descended on Leinster House last week and essentially brought the city to a standstill.  Their message was clear: no tinkering at the edges would suffice, as the people simply did not want water charges.<\/p><p>The Minister and the Government must, however, realise it is not just about water charges; some of this has been discussed by many Members in the course of the debate.  The anger is the culmination of people's feelings about numerous charges applied in recent years that have both deprived them of spending power and thrust them into severe poverty.  Aside from other considerations, one of the biggest problems in introducing water charges in Ireland is that far too many people have inadequate incomes relative to the cost of meeting their basic needs.  Social justice concerns are central to any sustainable water model, particularly given the salience of water charges compared with other taxes and charges.  As many Senators have stated in the debate, many people simply do not have the money to pay these charges.  While &euro;3 a week may be a pittance to the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and others, many families simply do not have it.  One must remember that in Ireland deprivation rates rose from 11.8% in 2007 to 26.9% in 2012, while recent European Commission data show that Ireland has much higher levels than most other comparable European Union countries.  Material deprivation in Ireland is 58% higher than the EU-15 average.  One quarter of Ireland's population experiences material deprivation, while one person in ten lives experiences severe material deprivation.  Many are going without essential goods.  As I stated, the real problem essentially is income inadequacy, as too many have low incomes when compared with the high cost of living here.  The answer from the Government should not be water charges but rather scrapping the system, which would reduce the cost of living and therefore, free up disposable income.<\/p><p>The mismanagement in respect of the payment of salaries and bonuses and the incompetence in planning, communications and budgeting essentially are symptomatic of a systems failure, a failure of government and governance.  What was the initial purpose of introducing water charges?  Was it financial, to encourage conservation or the upgrading of essential infrastructure?  While few would deny the importance of infrastructure and conservation in tackling the high levels of water being lost through leaks, what has transpired, namely, mismanagement, cronyism and the overarching threat of privatisation, has meant that Irish Water does not the enjoy the confidence to fulfil its task in terms of conservation.  I acknowledge that a plan is needed to meet our water needs, but I do not believe the current plan is it.  The Bill is not it either, nor were its predecessors.  <\/p><p>When it comes to the prospect of water privatisation, people are not buying the promises and assurances being spun by the Government.  Promises about protecting water and other assets are made, but one must remember that Governments change and politicians move on.  Many Members have spoken about the holding of a plebiscite and the point was made that Governments could change and legislation could easily be put through to take out the relevant section.  Consequently, I have no confidence in that promise whatsoever.  That said, as my colleagues have mentioned, Sinn F&eacute;in believes water charges should be scrapped.  However, scrapping them should not have the unintended consequence of restoring a system that allowed leakages and waste by some property owners and landlords which ultimately have to be paid for by the rest of society.  There should be water conservation; there should be repairs and essential upgrades of the system; perhaps the only good thing to emerge from the water services fiasco is that, at least, public discourse and attention have been drawn to water waste and deficiencies.  This essentially is where government, at both local and national level, should focus its efforts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800044#TT01600","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1418921100,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I call Senator Ned O'Sullivan<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800044#TT01700","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1418921100,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I would prefer to wait until tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800044#TT01800","speaker":"1142"},{"type":"speech","time":1418921100,"counter":627,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, and thank the Acting Chairman for giving me the opportunity to say a few words.  <\/p><p>Obviously, like everyone else on this side of the House or certainly all of my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, I will be opposing the Bill.  I appreciate that the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, is somewhat new to the role and that it is clear that there has been an element of listening, given the adjustments the Government has made to move from its original plan to the current position.  However, as the saying goes, if it was me, I would not start from here.  Throughout the country the quality of infrastructure is variable.  Obviously, some of the infrastructure in Dublin is more than 100 years old and not fit for purpose.  In Senator Terry Leyden's county of Roscommon there are boil water notices and this issue sneaks into south County Sligo which is supplied from Lough Gara and where people also are unable to drink the water.  There are other scenarios such as that in Sligo town which has a state-of-the-art system known as the Foxes Den that pumps water from Lough Gill and services the greater urban area of Sligo and on which there has been a lot of expenditure during the years.  The quality nationwide is so diverse that this is the priority and what needs to be dealt with.  It was necessary to assess what needed to be done, cost it and then set about doing it.  Moreover, this should have been done through the system of local authorities which were doing the job well.  As I have stated previously, in Sligo the go-to lady in dealing with any problem connected with water was Ms Kathleen McTiernan.  While she was a tough woman, she did her work exceptionally well.  There was a Kathleen McTiernan in every county and just as the National Roads Authority does its work and delivers through local authorities nationwide, that is how one should go about upgrading infrastructure throughout the country to the same standard as that in places such as Sligo town where a lot of work has been done.  The question then arises as to how it would be paid for.  I believe up to &euro;10 billion is the Government's own figure.  As I do not disagree with it, we must be innovative in how it is done.  The Government might consider a bond issue or using aspects of the National Pensions Reserve Fund to raise further moneys, perhaps through the European Investment Bank.  Obviously, that would create employment and bring the system up to standard, which is the priority.<\/p><p>I believe I have used this analogy previously, but the Government has set up McAlpine to build a house.  To put it another way, it is like setting up Kerrygold when all one needs is a milking machine.  This is a huge structure that lacks local knowledge and is detached from the people who were doing the work well on the ground, namely, as in the case of Sligo, the Kathleen McTiernans in every local authority area who knew exactly where all of the bodies were buried and knew precisely what had to be done and how to do it.  When such persons were given the right resources, they got the system up to standard.  This could have been done instead of putting this structure in place.  This time two years ago the same water service was being delivered throughout the country.<\/p> <p>Nothing has happened in between except that we have spent about &euro;770 million on salaries, consultants, meters and so on.  That is unacceptable; it is ridiculous.  I have had the opportunity to speak on Irish Water before and I will not delay the House, as I know others want to get in.  The reality is that we should revert to a local authority system.  We should abolish Irish Water and we should set about bringing the water quality and infrastructure up to the standard to which people are entitled and there are other ways of funding that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800044#TT02000","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418921700,"counter":629,"content":"<p>After a lot of soul searching I will be opposing the Bill tonight.  I have consistently opposed the concept behind the Bill since my earliest days in this House.<\/p><p>I am not naive and I know that water costs.  I know that everything we do occurs in an economic context.  I also know there is an opportunity cost for every euro we spend in the public sector where it is not available somewhere else.  Clearly the priority from the outset should have been to fix the infrastructure.  The second priority only then would have been to develop some degree of metering and-or billing capacity.  Instead we have had exactly the opposite.  If the billing procedure and the metering technology that were put in place were free, cheap or generating all the income we needed to fix the infrastructure, one could perhaps think of a justification for it.  However, I am seeing estimates of between &euro;430 million and &euro;540 million just to get the billing-metering of the operation up and running.<\/p><p>In addition we have completely lost at this stage the incentive for water conservation.  Furthermore we are told that water is not free, which is correct.  We have been paying for it already.  If we are paying for it from our taxes now, surely from the outset, when this thing was first created, there should have been a complete write-off against our tax for whatever would have been paid because that part of our income tax that is currently going to pay for water would no longer be paying for it.  In this regard the complicated weave of tax, social welfare and accounting instruments, which are put in place to satisfy this theoretical goal of this being off the national balance sheet, is such that any external scrutiny of what we are doing with rebates, etc., would find it very hard to maintain that this is completely disentangled from the national balance sheet.<\/p><p>For all those reasons I am very much opposed to it.  However, there is also a political reason.  The middle ground has been lost on this.  I say this with no disrespect to my colleagues.  We have many fine conviction politicians in the two Houses, many of whose convictions I do not agree with.  Some of them are very far to my left and some of them are to my right.  However, the notion that reasoned, thoughtful, non-extreme people could actually be the main objectors to this has been lost in the noise of the extremism.  It is critical that people realise it is a respectable position to oppose this very flawed initiative, send it back and get something suitable in its place.  That is why I oppose the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800045#UU00200","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1418921700,"counter":630,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey.  The establishment of Irish Water has been a mess from the start.  The public has not accepted it from the get-go.  The issues have all been mentioned here previously.  The squandering of millions on consultancy fees and bonuses drove people mad.  People were pulling their hair out when they heard the different revelations about Irish Water.  During the European Parliament and local elections people gave their answer on Irish Water.  Those elections took place when meters were being installed outside people's houses and people gave their answer loudly and clearly to the Government.  However, the Government has not listened.  It may have listened a little with the changes we have seen implemented, but it needs to listen considerably more.<\/p><p>The opposition to water charges and the protests against them grew organically from the start with people taking control themselves.  I would be somewhat sceptical and wary.  I question the sincerity of many people who have subsequently jumped on the bandwagon.  However, people have not accepted water charges and do not want them for many different reasons.  Those in the Right2Water campaign do not believe in paying for it anyway.  Other people are sick and tired of debacle after debacle and of broken promises.  People's disillusionment is at an all-time high.  We meet it every day.  People have spoken about how they come across it on social media.  We hear it on the streets and in every clinic we hold.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Kelly, was thrown in at the deep end.  He was thrown in to clean up a mess that the Department was left in.  I am not sure if it was a very wise move on behalf of the Labour Party.  I certainly would not have been offering my services to clean up that particular mess, but that is what has happened and he is trying.  In fairness the efforts he has put in place to sweeten the medicine are not good enough.<\/p><p>The conservation grant giving &euro;100 to everyone is a joke.  Has there been a proper independent analysis of the cost of the grant?  The figures I have indicate that the total cost will be &euro;165 million.  That is money that will come out of the Department of Social Protection.  The idea of setting up Irish Water in the first place was that Irish Water and the water services would not have to compete for Exchequer funding when it came to budgeting for social welfare or investing in schools and hospitals.  If the Minister of State visits any accident and emergency unit in the country he will see the problems on the ground owing to lack of investment.<\/p><p>Some of that &euro;165 million will go to people who have a private well and never even asked for that money.  It is bananas in the extreme.  It was news to me to hear in the Minister's speech - this is a good one - that &euro;100 will be given to people in nursing homes.  It is a cynical throwback to how business was done by previous governments.  This is what has people annoyed.  They do not see any change from previous administrations in how the Government has been behaving itself.<\/p><p>I have figures on Irish Water that were supplied to me.  I do not believe they were addressed in any of the D&aacute;il debates - I certainly could not find evidence of it.  Total costs and everything else are based on 100% of people complying and signing up to Irish Water.  It will be nothing in the region of that.  If 100% of the people suddenly wake up and decide there is no need for these protests and decide to sign up to it, &euro;65 million is all that will be left for Irish Water.  The money available to Irish Water to invest in maintenance, upgrades and whatever else needs to be done will decline very significantly.  If for instance half of the people do not sign up and the costs are revised, there is potential for Irish Water to be in the red.<\/p><p>We need a referendum.  I do not like the idea of a plebiscite - the idea that we would give the plebs their say.  We need a referendum so that it is enshrined in the Constitution that Irish Water will not be privatised.  If the figures I have are anything to go by there will be enormous pressure on any Government to seek private investment in Irish Water.<\/p><p>I do not know if the Bill will pass tonight.  If it does I certainly will listen intently to the various proposals made tomorrow.

That is the way it is.  If I as the representative of the Government feel they are justified and support and improve the Bill, I will take them.  However, I will do not so just for the sake of it.  I respect the fact that I must bring forward the best legislation possible for the people of Ireland to the best of my ability and the best opinion I can put forward.  I will do that here again.<\/p><p>Everyone in this House knows what this legislation is all about.  Some comments that were made earlier in the week by a colleague of mine were unnecessary and probably silly to be frank.  In respect of lecturing people as regards what will happen if they do not pass this legislation, everyone in here has a mandate and everyone here should be here.  Everyone knows exactly what we are discussing and the consequences one way or the other of whatever the result is.  This legislation is about amending the previous legislation.  If this legislation is not passed, the previous legislation exists.  That is just a simple fact.  Regardless of whether this legislation is or is not passed, it will not change the fact that Irish Water will exist and operate.  <\/p><p>I will comment briefly on a few issues.  I will approach it in a thematic fashion rather than by Senator if this is all right because there are so many speakers.  The key issue about which most people have spoken is that of the plebiscite.  Let me say straight that I believe in personal conviction and am a person who stands over what I believe.  I come from a political philosophy that would not tolerate the privatisation of Irish Water in any shape or time.  This is what I believe in absolutely.  I know that everyone has accepted my bona fides.  I have not yet heard anyone in this House or the other, local authorities or anywhere who said that they believe in the privatisation of Irish Water.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800046#VV00800","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1418922300,"counter":639,"content":"<p>Senator Quinn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800046#VV00900","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1418922300,"counter":640,"content":"<p>He did not, to be fair.  He qualified that.<\/p><p>In respect of the legislation we have drafted, what Government in its right mind would potentially pass a resolution, repeal the legislation through both Houses and then tell the people that it is taking away their right to decide on the future of water in this country?  I do not believe it is ever going to happen.  I would like to see a Government try to do that.  <\/p><p>There is another aspect to this.  I and this Government must reflect on the law of unintended consequences.  I did exactly what I said I would do in this House.  I took the motion that was passed here and I brought it to Government.  I hope everyone trusts and believes that I did so because we had discussions that I cannot get into.  There are genuine questions.  I am not deflecting in any way, shape or form.  What would we be having a referendum on?  Members must remember that through all of this, I must bear in mind all the advice from the Attorney General who is the representative of the Government.  I am not legally qualified.  Are we having a referendum on water or Irish Water?  Are we having a referendum on water services?  What are we having a referendum on?  This is a genuine and difficult question.  Where would we be in respect of the ownership of particular property and property rights?  Where would we be in respect of private wells, group schemes, the infrastructure and the land on which that infrastructure exists if it is private property and companies that already produce water on this island, of which there are a multitude?<\/p><p>There is a range of issues such as the inventory of what is protected through this referendum.  I cannot guarantee that there will be no unintended consequences from what I accept is a very strongly held view of many people that we need to have such a referendum.  I accept the spirit of that view but from a practical point of view, I have just outlined a number of issues.  I cannot say or guarantee that there will be no unintended consequences if we were to go down that route.  Where would we draw the line?  Would we draw the line at this or would we go down the road of ensuring that every other thing goes into the Constitution - CIE, the roads or the bogs?  The list could go on.  I am not saying that in a flippant manner.  I am saying it genuinely.  Where would we go?  <\/p><p>I have heard discussion in the other House about Europe and how Europe could put pressure on.  This has been referenced in this House although not as much.  Obviously, I can accept that as an argument.  I have COM(2014) 177, a Communication from the Commission on the European Citizens' Initiative &quot;Water and sanitation are a human right! Water is a public good, not a commodity!&quot;, with me.  It says that treaty rules require Europe to remain neutral in respect of national decisions governing the ownership regime for water undertakings.  I will not go into the detail of it but it goes through Article 345 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establishing the principle of neutrality in respect of these issues.<\/p> <p>I say this genuinely, as somebody who in spirit accepts what people are saying here.  My bona fides on this could not be any clearer.  I accept the spirit.  I would never tolerate the idea of Irish Water, or the water infrastructure of this State, being privatised in any way, shape or form.  I want to make it clear on behalf of the Government, in light of what I have just outlined to the House with regard to the headline issues - we will get into it in more in-depth detail tomorrow - that the Government is going as far as it can on this issue, given the consequences if we went to a referendum.  I can say hand on heart that that is an absolute fact.  It is the truth.<\/p><p>That is the major issue that was raised here across the board.  However, I would like to comment on a few other issues that were raised.  Throughout this debate, I have to accept the bona fides of the Commission for Energy Regulation, which is an independent body, that it does everything in an appropriate manner and that its figures are justified.  It not for me to question the commission in any way, shape or form.<\/p><p>I join many Senators on all sides of the House in acknowledging the contribution of the local authorities.  I appreciate that the local authorities, for which I have responsibility in my current portfolio, do some good work across the country.  There are some very good people in our local authorities.  I accept that many local authorities have co-operated with one another in the provision of water infrastructure.  As water and the infrastructure for water do not stop at local authority boundaries, we have to deal with these issues at national level.  I emphasise that we need investment at a level we have never before seen or comprehended.  We need to put billions of euro into water infrastructure quickly.  If we do not do this, frankly, we will go down the same road as Italy, which has just been fined &euro;42 million.  If Italy does not deal with some of the issues it is facing, it will face further fines every six months.<\/p><p>We need to look at the way Irish Water has created the savings that have accrued from the development in Ringsend and a number of other things, including tendering, and a number of other capital projects.  When we think about the future of this country, we must reflect on the fact that raw sewage is running straight into rivers or the sea in 44 urban areas.  I stress that I am talking about raw sewage in places where people are bathing and children are swimming.  As a father of young children, I do not think this is acceptable.  In fairness to everyone in this House, I think that, regardless of what side of this argument they are on, they will accept that this cannot continue.<\/p><p>Investment at a scale that has never been seen before is needed in the interests of future generations.  We also need to ensure that the children of today will have jobs in the coming years.  When one speaks to representatives of IDA Ireland about the issues they face when they are touting Ireland as a place to invest in, they mention the need for investment in infrastructure, educational issues such as language skills and transport issues such as the development of the road network.  I will call a spade a spade and say that issues with regard to broadband telecommunications across this country, in particular, have to be dealt with.  I would be the first to say that.<\/p><p>The other issue is water.  I know that if we do not do something about water, it will be the biggest issue into the future.  I assure the House that if some of our water supplies get infected or polluted because of a lack of investment, some of the largest employers in this country will look at Ireland again when they are making decisions on where to locate and on future investment.  We would not be able to bring in the investment that we need into the future.  That is a fact.  We need to ensure that investment is made, because it will need to more than double in the future.<\/p><p>I compliment and thank the Senators, particularly on the Opposition side of the House, who have expressed their agreement with metering, which helps us to finds leaks.  When we know there are leaks, we can save on investment and diversify our investment.  By making sure investment takes place in the areas where it is needed, we will not have to spend all our time chasing the leaks.  People should bear in mind that the revenue being raised through this process is being used to ensure Irish Water can borrow on a scale that is necessary to make the investment about which I have spoken.<\/p><p>I wish to acknowledge, in fairness to Senator Quinn and others, that the collection of PPS numbers was an issue.  It was raised again during this debate by Senators Mac Conghail and van Turnhout.  I commit to this House that the protocol which has been agreed with the Data Protection Commissioner will be laid in the Oireachtas Library for anyone to see.  I think that is the right thing to do.  At some point in the future, I will ask the Data Protection Commissioner to confirm in its capacity as an independent regulator that Irish Water has completed the big process of dealing with all the PPS numbers.  I also commit that I will ask Irish Water to come before an Oireachtas joint committee to confirm that all of this has happened.<\/p><p>Senators Mac Conghail and Keane raised the issue of rainwater harvesting.  People who need to be supported in their employment of rainwater harvesting will be supported.  The introduction of the water conservation grant will help more people to ensure they can introduce methodologies such as rainwater harvesting.  There are many other fantastic water conservation and treatment technologies out there, by the way.  Anyone who invests in such methods will be supported.  The Government will ensure there are initiatives to support conservation in the coming year.  The introduction of the water conservation grant is the first such initiative.  I want to make it clear that there is an onus on Irish Water to support such initiatives directly.<\/p><p>It was suggested during the debate that the water charges will be paid to the Exchequer.  I want to make it clear that this is absolutely and simply untrue.  Water charges from households and businesses form part of the allowed revenues of Irish Water as determined by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  They cannot be used for anything other than the provision of water services.<\/p><p>Senator Healy Eames suggested that Siemens offered to undertake a metering programme.  While such an offer was widely reported in the media, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government never heard anything about it.  The Department never received any formal proposal from the company in question.  Unless the offer was an act of charity, which I doubt, it must be respected that a process of procurement and open tender would be required under European laws.<\/p><p>Reference was also made to Irish Water's establishment costs.  The Commission for Energy Regulation, which is an independent regulator, examined this and determined that &euro;172 million of the expenditure of &euro;180 million was justifiable.  Of course there are issues and concerns.  The use of terms such as &quot;consultants,&quot; &quot;service providers&quot; and &quot;set-up costs&quot; at certain times during the discussion on this issue was not helpful.  It is a fact that when the Commission for Energy Regulation looked at this, it passed &euro;172 million of the &euro;180 million that was spent.  It is not the Government or Alan Kelly who is saying this.  It is a fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800046#VV01000","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418922900,"counter":642,"content":"<p>That is &euro;8 million in waste.<\/p> <p> There were many contributions to the debate and I accept absolutely the bona fides of the contributors.

The networks do that work excellently, but cannot do so without proper funding.  They have been starved of funding for a number of years.

My Department's local and community development programme, LCDP, is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State.  The current programme officially ended at the end of 2013, having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281 million over that period.  It is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014, with a budget of &euro;48 million, pending the roll-out of the new social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, in April 2015.  The SICAP is one of my key priorities and its budget for next year will be decided in the 2015 Estimates process.  The programme&rsquo;s target groups are children and families from disadvantaged areas, lone parents, new communities, including refugees and asylum seekers, people living in disadvantaged communities, people with disabilities, the Roma community and the unemployed.  As the Senator stated, these people are from disadvantaged areas that, in come cases, are also very rural.<\/p><p>In accordance with the public spending code, legal advice and good practice internationally, and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, the programme is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently under way.  Stage 1, expressions of interest, has been completed.  Stage 2, invitation to tender, got under way on 20 October and involves the successful applicants from stage 1 being invited to apply to one or more local community development committees in local authority areas to deliver the programme.  Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of the procurement process.<\/p><p>The public procurement process is a competitive process that is open to local development companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can deliver the services to be tendered for under the new programme.  In stage 1, joint applications were encouraged, and organisations of varying sizes - for example, smaller organisations working in consortia with larger ones - were invited to submit joint applications.  That said, I understand that some small groups, such as the groups under the remit of the National Collective of Community Based Women's Networks, NCCWN, faced a number of challenges in competing in the stage 1 process.  The results of the stage were released on 24 September and I can confirm that none of the NCCWN groups expressed an interest either as lead applicants or as part of a consortium.<\/p><p>The Department is now considering the implications of that for the NCCWN and will liaise with other relevant Departments to find a workable solution.  I can confirm that interim LCDP funding, based on a small budgetary reduction in the order of 6.5% on 2014 levels, will be provided to the NCCWN up to the end of March 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800050#ZZ00200","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1418924100,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply and for engaging with the network on the issue of funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800050#ZZ00300","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Palliative Care Facilities","time":1418924100,"counter":658,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800050#ZZ00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1418924100,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for taking this motion.

The last time I tabled a motion on this issue, the response from the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was: &quot;Arrangements are being put in place to fund this project in order that all capital costs are covered, including construction cost, design fees, equipping, etc.&quot;  In reality, the local hospice movement is being asked to fund-raise to make this a reality.  Despite all of the announcements that have repeatedly been made by the Department and two Ministers for Health, we are no closer to building the unit.

The previous Government promised a full oncology unit, including beds, radiotherapy and palliative care.  Although this was seen as a step down, it was a step in the right direction.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response, but this matter needs to be progressed.  It will benefit patients in the south east, not just those in Waterford.

The new unit will act as a focal point for the provision of specialist inpatient beds and community and day care services for patients and their families living in the south east.  It is being developed in partnership with Waterford Hospice Movement, which has generously undertaken to fund-raise &euro;6 million to cover the unit's capital cost.  This commitment is in line with a number of proposed new hospice units at various stages of development across the country where the voluntary hospice groups provide the capital costs or build the units.  The HSE is then required to provide the ongoing revenue funding for the operation of the service.<\/p><p>The new palliative care unit will be located on the first two floors of the five-storey development.  The ground floor will accommodate 20 single inpatient rooms and ancillary accommodation.  The second floor will be used to provide a day care centre, consultation rooms, treatment rooms, a therapy area and a dining area.  The University Hospital Waterford project, including the palliative care unit, is included in the HSE's capital plan for 2014.<\/p> <p>Enabling works which commenced in October 2013 have recently been completed to the front of the hospital on the proposed unit site.  These works included the construction of a new roadway to relocate the access road to the old school of nursing and the RCSI to the eastern end of the campus.  The works also involved the relocation of services to the perimeter of the site and the completion of new car parks adjacent to the laboratory.  The design team was appointed in the summer of 2014 and it is expected that the planning application for the unit will be lodged in March 2015.  Subject to funding approval by the HSE estates office, construction is planned to commence in quarter two in 2016.  Construction is expected to be completed in quarter three in 2017 and, following commissioning and equipping, the unit is planned to open in quarter one in 2018.<\/p><p>The palliative care unit at University Hospital Waterford will be staffed by existing resources currently working in palliative care, both in acute and sub-acute services across the south east.  Resources will be in place to operate the unit as planned in 2018 and in line with the project plan. <\/p><p>It is the intention of the Government that all dying people will be provided with the type of palliative care service that they need, regardless of their diagnosis, how old they are or whether they die in a hospice, an acute hospital or at home.  To achieve this, we will need a combination of generalist and specialist palliative care services to care for people at home, in an acute hospital and a hospice, where required.

For whatever reason, we have moved from a date of early 2015 to the second quarter of 2016 and that is where the concern lies.  There seems to be slippage, for which I do not know the reason.  A clear commitment was given and, apparently, the money is available.  Why have we fallen a year behind in the schedule?  Why is the local palliative care unit being asked to fund-raise?  The people of the south east have been asked to come up with extra revenue, which, again, people see as the State abdicating its responsibility.  I welcome the developments taking place.  We seem to be moving in the right direction, but it is at a snail's pace.  Unfortunately, we are not getting there as quickly as we need to.  Even by the Government's own timelines, we are falling behind.  I, therefore appeal to the Minister of State to raise the issue of timeframes with the Minister for Health, as well as the fact that we seem to be lagging behind somewhat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800051#AAA00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1418924700,"counter":663,"content":"<p>I will raise the issue with the Minister for Health.

When it started off, it was granted temporary recognition by the Department of Education and Skills.  During the years the number of students has grown and standards in the school, to the best of my knowledge from speaking to parents, teachers and others, are very high.  The school has applied and met all of the criteria necessary to be met for permanent recognition, but, for some reason, the Department is not prepared to grant it.  There seems to be one hurdle which it does not seem to be able to get over.  The bottom line is that there are in excess of 100 young students attending the school, probably a far greater number than the numbers attending many other national schools in the area, yet it does not have the permanent recognition it requires in order to build a new premises and move forward in an environment which is stable, assured, permanent and secure.  <\/p><p>At this stage, the school has earned its stripes.  It has done what is necessary and met all of the stringent criteria laid down by the Department.  I have been advised by the school principal that in all of the paperwork required every box has been ticked, that every &quot;t&quot; has been crossed and every &quot;i&quot; has been dotted to an exhaustive degree.  There comes a point when one has to say fair play needs to prevail.  Given its history which is relatively recent but significant and length of service, it appears the school has done all that is required of it.  A vote of confidence in what it is doing for the community and its students is necessary from the Government and the Department in order to allow it to move forward in an assured and a secure environment.<\/p><p>I appreciate that the Minister of State is present on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills.  If she cannot confirm that permanent recognition will be granted, I hope she might give me a specific timeline to indicate when it will happen because, as far as Mol an Oige Steiner national school is concerned, it has played its part and now it is up to the Minister to play hers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800051#AAA00400","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1418924700,"counter":666,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter which, as he said, I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  It provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position on the recognition process for Mol an Oige Steiner national school, Ennistymon, County Clare.<\/p><p>As the Senator will be aware, Mol an Oige Steiner national school which implements the Steiner approach to education was initially awarded provisional recognition in 2008, based on written agreement from the school patron, Lifeways (Ireland) Limited, to a number of undertakings.  This provisional recognition was extended year by year until October 2012 when a three year extension was granted.  A process is in place in which the issue of permanent recognition for the school is being considered.  This process is based on the school's progress in fulfilling the undertakings supplied by the school's patron to meet permanent recognition criteria in accordance with the requirements of the Education Act 1998 and the rules for national schools.  All recognised schools, regardless of their philosophy or ethos, are required to comply with the Education Act 1998 and the rules for national schools.  Permanent recognition is contingent on schools demonstrating that they meet these requirements satisfactorily.<\/p><p>Following the formal evaluation conducted by the departmental inspectorate of the work of the school, the school was invited, as part of the process, to supply a school response.  This response was received from the school in October.  I advise the Senator that the formal evaluation conducted by the departmental inspectorate forms only part of the recognition process.  The undertakings in respect of other school governance matters must also be verified.<\/p> <p>The Department has recently received a response from the school authority in relation to the school governance undertakings which is currently being considered in conjunction with the advice received from the inspectorate.  The Department expects to be in a position to finalise its consideration shortly.<\/p><p>I wish to thank the Senator again for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position in regard to the recognition process for Mol an &Oacute;ige Steiner national school, County Clare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121800051#AAA00500","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418925300,"counter":668,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills.
