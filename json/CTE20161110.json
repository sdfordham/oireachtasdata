We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, a permanent witness to the committee, who is accompanied today by Mr. John Riordan, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Alan Farrell.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda today is the minutes of the meeting of 25 October.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is matters arising from the minutes.  I do not think there is anything specific there.  Is it agreed to move on?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The third item is correspondence received since the last meeting.  There is some  correspondence to be dealt with and we will move through some of it as quickly as possible.  I will say at this stage that before we go into public session with the Comptroller and Auditor General followed by the Department of Finance officials, I wish to go into private session for a couple of minutes for one or two items of the correspondence that I do not wish to put on the public record at this stage.  There will be a few minutes in private session at that point.<\/p> <p>  Under the third item, correspondence received, there are three categories of correspondence.  Category A deals with today's meeting.  The first item is 170A.  It is the opening statement of the Department of Finance officials.  Is it agreed to note that?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is under category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers following up on previous meetings.  The first item under category B is 162B, a letter from Mr. Oliver Ellingham, NAMA board director, providing clarification on the board minute of the 13 March 2014.  Members may recall a reference to a typo.  It is good to note that this has been corrected.  Can we agree to note and publish that?  Agreed.  We will also add it to our Project Eagle folder.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is 130B(i) to (iv), correspondence received from the HSE following up on an outstanding matter from their appearance before the committee in July of this year.  As well as four attachments, there was a large number of documents provided on a USB relating to Console.  The secretariat is in touch with the ICT department here in the Houses of the Oireachtas about the best way of making these available to members over the next week.  Can we note the correspondence for now?  We will have engagements with the HSE in the new year and members can review all of the documents in preparation for the meeting at that stage.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>A Christmas present, is it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#B00300","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#B00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Or we could bring them in now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#B00500","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The next item is 140B.

If the committee agrees, we can inform Ms Finan that her presence is not required.  There are other directors who were there during 2014.  She had left the board before any decisions came to be made.  We will have seen practically every relevant board member at the time.

It is correspondence received from NAMA as a follow up to information requested.  We will note this correspondence and put it into the Project Eagle folder.   Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is item 150B(i) to (v).  It is correspondence received from the Minister of Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  A number of documents have been provided as a follow up to our engagement with the Minister on 6 October.  Additionally, a CD was provided with a number of other documents.  Can we note this correspondence and put it into the Project Eagle file?  Agreed.  We will publish that as well.<\/p> <p>  The next item is item 151B(i) to (xvii).  It is an e-mail from the Department of Health attaching a number of documents sent to the previous committee in relation to the Grace case.  It is being brought to our attention again as it was referred to in a recent newspaper article.  Can we note and publish this?  I understand that the HSE or Tusla are dealing with that directly and I do not want to duplicate any work of any other committee.  Shall we note it and publish it?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is item 166B.  It is a letter from Mr. Tom Rice, chief legal officer to PIMCO, informing the committee that PIMCO is declining the invitation to appear before it because of ongoing investigations, among other reasons.  However, Mr. Rice does provide a considered response to the committee&rsquo;s stated areas of interest.  We have invited PIMCO and it has said, for various legal reasons and inquiries that are ongoing, that it is not in a position to attend.  It has answered the specific questions we put to it in our letter of invitation.  As we have heard from the Comptroller and Auditor about the famous PIMCO withdrawal of phone calls, etc.  We have had extensive evidence presented in public by NAMA officials and board members.  In the interest of balance of the evidence being put out in public session, we have to read this letter into the public record rather than just having it buried in correspondence and appearing somewhere down the road.<\/p> <p>  At the end of the correspondence or at the start of the next session, I will read it into the public record.  It will take five minutes.  The public are entitled to see PIMCO's response in view of the fact that its representatives will not be here.  We cannot really address any further questions that occur.  It will be PIMCO's position and we can put it to NAMA when its representatives are before the committee subsequently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#B01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>That is a good idea.  I know we have the NAMA CEO and chairperson coming before us again.  However, the response that we have received back from PIMCO contradicts some of what the NAMA board members said when they were here, most specifically, the NAMA legal team and the people who were involved on NAMA's side in those conference calls.  There is currently no plan to have them before the committee again, but they have to come before the committee again given that letter, because it is a very strong contradiction of the evidence that was given to us by them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#B01100","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy because the PIMCO letter is an important letter from our public hearing's point of view.

To refresh people's memory, when the NTMA was before the committee on 21 July, we raised the issue of climate change and fossil fuels publicly.  NTMA sent back a letter dealing with the issue.  The agency said it was reviewing its policies.  We received the letter on 16 September.  It is in our committee documentation.

Item 4(1) relates to the Beaumont Hospital board.  It has a clear audit report.  As for Aontacht Pobal Teoranta, a HSE subsidiary to promote integration of persons with disability, the Comptroller and Auditor General states that the director's report is closed and that the company is to be wound up.  The assets and liabilities will be transferred to the HSE.  The organisation only had an annual turnover of &euro;1,200 in 2015.  Effectively, it has been closed at this stage.<\/p> <p>  The next item relates to the Rent Tribunal for the period from 1 January 2015 to 7 January 2016.  The Rent Tribunal was dissolved on 7 January 2016.  The functions were transferred to the Residential Tenancies Board.  Next, the Institute of Public Administration has a clear report.  The Law Reform Commission has a clear report as well.<\/p> <p>  Next is the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau.  The bureau handles complaints from consumers relating to financial services providers.  A note in the accounts discloses that legislation enacted in 2013 provides for changes in the pension funding arrangements of the bureau.  Pending the resolution of discussions with the Department of Finance in respect of implementation of legislation, the financial statements disclose that accrued pension liability only by way of a note.  We have come across the issue of pensions in numerous public bodies.<\/p> <p>  The Cork Education and Training Board has a clear audit report.  The last item relates to the Food Safety Promotion Board.  This is a North-South body.  Note 16 of the financial statements disclosed that non-effective expenditure totalling &euro;152,000 had been incurred by the board.  This relates to rent associated with space at its headquarters in Cork that has been unoccupied since December 2013 while a subletting agreement for the space expired.  A total of &euro;76,000 of this expenditure relates to 2015.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might wish to make a quick comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#D00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I wish to draw the attention of the committee to the fact that there is non-effective expenditure here.

Project Eagle was the code name given to the sale of NAMA's Northern Ireland loan portfolio.  To date, we have met representatives of NAMA, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and Mr. Brian Rowntree, a former member of NAMA's Northern Ireland advisory committee, NIAC.  We have also met three members of the current board and other senior NAMA officials.  We will shortly be meeting officials from the Department of Finance who dealt with NAMA at the time of the sale of Project Eagle.  However, as we have not really heard from the Comptroller and Auditor General since our first meeting, members have asked for Mr. McCarthy to provide a response to the evidence heard to date.<\/p><p>Before moving to the evidence from Mr. McCarthy and his response to questions from the committee, I draw attention to the fact that we wrote to PIMCO, inviting representatives to attend.  We gave it a list of issues we wanted it to deal with.  We received a reply from PIMCO indicating that because of various investigations it was not in a position to allow representatives to attend but it provided a comprehensive letter, comprising approximately four pages, responding to the specific queries we raised.  In view of the fact that PIMCO was covered extensively in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, as mentioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General here, and it has been discussed extensively by NAMA witnesses here in a public forum, it is important in the interest of balance in presenting the evidence in public that we read the PIMCO letter into the public record rather than just listing it as an item of correspondence.  I propose to do this because it deals with some of the statements made by other people before us and there may be issues requiring further clarification after we consider the letter.  It is important that it is put into the public domain at this stage.  People might bear with me for a few minutes.<\/p><p>This is a letter from PIMCO, signed by Mr. Tom Rice, chief legal officer, EMEA, PIMCO Europe Limited.  It is addressed to Mr. Kieran Lenihan, clerk to the Committee of Public Accounts, Leinster House, Dublin 2.  It was sent by e-mail and post on 8 November 2016.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>Dear Mr. Lenihan,<br \/><br \/>Thank you for your letter of 17 October 2016 addressed to Mr. Douglas M. Hodge, CEO.<br \/><br \/>PIMCO recognises the importance of the Committee's function and wishes to be helpful in providing the Committee with an understanding of PIMCO's role in Project Eagle prior to the company's withdrawal from the pending transaction.  We are, however, mindful of the ongoing NCA and U.S. investigations and for a number of reasons, including our desire to avoid taking any action which might prejudice those ongoing investigations, we respectfully decline your invitation for a representative to attend before the Committee.  However, we note in your letter the Committee's areas of interest and we provide the following information which we hope is helpful.<br \/><br \/>We would note that whilst the correct legal entity that considered Project Eagle as a potential transaction was PIMCO's BRAVO II Fund, in this letter we generally refer, for simplicity and ease of reference, to PIMCO.<br \/><br \/>1. Origin of the PIMCO approach to NAMA<br \/><br \/>In April 2013, PIMCO was approached by Mr. Tuvi Keinan, a partner at the law firm Brown Rudnick who then introduced PIMCO to Mr. Ian Coulter of Tughans and Mr. Frank Cushnahan, with whom Brown Rudnick appeared to be working to identify potential purchasers for the NAMA Northern Irish loan portfolio (which later became known as Project Eagle).  As we understood it, PIMCO was one of three firms who were approached at the time by these three parties.<br \/><br \/>PIMCO saw the transaction as one which may be of interest to its BRAVO II Fund, subject of course to further investment analysis and due diligence.<br \/><br \/>PIMCO was informed by these parties that the Northern Ireland Government wanted to ensure that there would not be a &quot;fire sale&quot; of Northern Irish homes and businesses once the portfolio was sold, but rather that a longer term approach, investing in and developing the assets, would be taken by any eventual purchaser.  PIMCO was advised that the sale of the loan portfolio was a sensitive political matter and would have a major impact on the Northern Irish economy.<br \/><br \/>PIMCO was told that the Northern Ireland Government wanted to seek to ensure that a reputable and responsible purchaser would be found, that would manage the assets in a sensitive way post-completion, and this was the basis for interested parties being invited to meet with Northern Ireland Government Ministers.  This desire for a reputable longer term investor seemed to be a good fit for PIMCO, given its usual investment approach.<br \/><br \/>Following a meeting organised by the three parties with First Minister Peter Robinson and Minister for Finance, Mr. Sammy Wilson, which took place in May 2013, PIMCO was informed by Brown Rudnick that it was the Northern Irish Government's preferred purchaser for NAMA's Northern Irish loan portfolio.<br \/><br \/>As reflected in documents made public in the course of the Northern Irish parliamentary inquiry, we understand that Brown Rudnick wrote to Minister Wilson in June 2013, purporting to act on behalf of two 'clients' and advising that both may be interested in purchasing the portfolio.  This letter stated that proceeding with one party on a limited exclusivity would ensure a focused, expedient process with guaranteed confidentiality, which Brown Rudnick saw as vital to the process.  Minister Wilson then wrote to Minister Noonan enclosing that letter from Brown Rudnick.<br \/><br \/>That approach made to the Department of Finance by Brown Rudnick was made by Brown Rudnick acting in a deal-making capacity, having identified (seemingly more than one) potentially interested prospective buyers.  At no stage in the Project Eagle process did PIMCO conclude an agreement to be advised or represented by any of the three parties mentioned earlier.<br \/><br \/>From public sources, we have now seen that Minister Noonan replied to Minister Wilson advising that parties with an interest in NAMA-held loans should make contact directly with NAMA and specifying that Brown Rudnick should enter a dialogue with NAMA so that any interest in the loan portfolio could be fully assessed.  As noted in the recent Committee hearings, the Comptroller and Auditor General Report indicates that NAMA was made aware of this approach no later than early July 2013.<br \/><br \/>In September 2013, PIMCO sent a non-binding letter of interest to NAMA indicating an interest in purchasing the portfolio reflective of the approach suggested in the Brown Rudnick letter.  Based on publicly available information at the time, PIMCO stated that it would be willing to submit an indicative total purchase price of &euro;1.1 billion in cash for the portfolio.<\/blockquote><p>It continues:<\/p><blockquote>2. The basis for making the initial bid for the Northern Irish loan portfolio<br \/><br \/>Following receipt of the non-binding hitter of interest, NAMA entered a dialogue with PIMCO regarding the portfolio.  In November 2013, NAMA opened a data room for PIMCO, and made documentation available relating to the assets comprising the loan portfolio.<br \/><br \/>With the assistance of property advisors, Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield and New River Retail, PIMCO carried out preliminary due diligence on the assets comprising the portfolio.  This due diligence was enabled by documentation provided by NAMA in the exclusive data room which included- NAMA-commissioned valuation reports from 2009;<br \/><br \/>- up to date tenancy schedules in respect of the top 55 assets; and<br \/><br \/>- basic details such as addresses in respect of the remainder of the assets.In December 2013, PIMCO sent a further non-binding letter of interest to NAMA.  This letter of interest outlined the rationale behind the revised offer and set a range of &pound;1.1bn to &pound;1.3bn as the estimated purchase price that PIMCO would be willing to pay.<br \/><br \/>The following month, NAMA advised that it could not proceed with an exclusive process with PIMCO and proceeded to appoint Lazard to institute an open-tender.<br \/><br \/>3. The circumstances of PIMCO&rsquo;s withdrawal from Project Eagle<br \/><br \/>In June 2013, PIMCO was approached by Brown Rudnick with a request for a proposed success fee.  However, there was little progress in the potential transaction across the summer period and the proposal was not reviewed in detail until September 2013.  The proposed success fee was initially expressed as a percentage of portfolio value and was within a typical range for a brokerage fee.<br \/><br \/>The Brown Rudnick proposal indicated that the success fee would be split equally three ways between Brown Rudnick and other parties, which led to enquiries by PIMCO as to whom the fee would be paid on to.  PIMCO was advised by Brown Rudnick that the fee (later advised by Brown Rudnick to total &euro;16 million) was to be paid to Brown Rudnick and then split in equal one-third shares between Brown Rudnick, Tughans and Mr. Cushnahan.  PIMCO was later advised that Tughans&rsquo; one third share was to be paid to Mr. Coulter, personally, rather than to the law firm Tughans.<br \/><br \/>PIMCO did not agree to this fee proposal.  PIMCO also sought various confirmations from Brown Rudnick including, whether NAMA had been informed and had approved of Mr. Cushnahan's potential involvement in the proposed transaction.  After PIMCO raised these concerns around this fee proposal, no further request was made to PIMCO, at that time, to agree any fee.<br \/><br \/>In February 2014, a new fee proposal was received by PIMCO from Brown Rudnick (under which the same parties were to benefit in a similar amount).  At this point, it appeared to PIMCO that disclosures still had not been made by relevant parties to NAMA.  Accordingly, PIMCO decided to contact NAMA directly and take it upon itself to disclose full details of the success fee arrangements that had been proposed by Brown Rudnick, including the amount and intended recipients.  In particular, PIMCO sought clarification on NAMA&rsquo;s awareness of Mr. Cushnahan&rsquo;s role in Project Eagle.<br \/><br \/>March 2014 Withdrawal calls with NAMA<br \/><br \/>As the Committee has heard from various parties, PIMCO provided details of these matters to NAMA in a senes of calls in March 2014.<br \/><br \/>PIMCO has been disappointed that PIMCO&rsquo;s withdrawal from Project Eagle has been repeatedly mischaracterised by NAMA.  We would suggest that NAMA has conflated what may or may not have been discussed at the NAMA Board level (upon which we cannot comment), and the reality of the calls that PIMCO made to NAMA and PIMCO&rsquo;s own decision to withdraw.<br \/><br \/>The reality of PIMCO&rsquo;s decision to withdraw was reflected more accurately by Mr Stewart in his evidence to the Committee on 25 October 2016.  PIMCO welcomes his confirmation that PIMCO withdrew from Project Eagle, and was not at any stage asked to leave the process by NAMA.<br \/><br \/>PIMCO is largely in agreement with the summarised call notes appended to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General at Appendix E of the report entitled, &quot;National Asset Management Agency&rsquo;s sale of Project Eagle&quot;, dated August 2016, although certain points are clarified below.<br \/><br \/>It should be noted that the reference to &quot;a success fee arrangement (being) in place between PIMCO and Brown Rudnick&quot; noted in the report is inaccurate.  Whilst an arrangement was proposed by Brown Rudnick, it was never agreed to by PIMCO.<br \/><br \/>As described in the notes, following a request by PIMCO for a call on 7 March 2014, PIMCO Legal spoke to NAMA on 10 March 2014 and informed NAMA about the proposed success fee arrangement.  PIMCO wanted to understand whether, and ensure that, NAMA was aware of Mr. Cushnahan's role and the fee arrangement that had been proposed to PIMCO.  PIMCO stated that it would not proceed unless and until it was clear to PIMCO that NAMA was aware of Mr. Cushnahan's role in Project Eagle (including his potential interest as a beneficiary of a fee arrangement as had been proposed to PIMCO).  PIMCO described details of the fee that had been proposed and the reasons for its concerns.<br \/><br \/>The NAMA attendees confirmed that they were not aware of the proposal but enquired as to whether PIMCO would proceed in Project Eagle should Mr. Cushnahan&rsquo;s involvement, or the fee proposal to PIMCO, be an issue for NAMA.  PIMCO confirmed that it was not currently proceeding with the transaction and that any decision to proceed or not would be informed by NAMA's response.  NAMA agreed to consider the matter further and revert to PIMCO.<br \/><br \/>We can confirm that in no way did PIMCO seek the acquiescence of NAMA to any fee arrangement, nor seek NAMA's agreement that any fee arrangement was appropriate.  That is also clear from NAMA's own minutes of the calls and the evidence of Mr Stewart to the PAC, who confirmed that did not happen.<br \/><br \/>As the notes outline, NAMA contacted PIMCO the following day (11 March 2014) to advise that the NAMA Board considered the involvement of Mr. Cushnahan to be a very serious issue for NAMA.  PIMCO agreed to revert to NAMA and on a further call, later that afternoon, PIMCO informed NAMA of its disappointment that disclosures had not been made by the relevant parties to NAMA.  PIMCO informed NAMA that it did not want to be part of any process where there was any suggestion of impropriety and was willing to withdraw.<br \/><br \/>Whilst it is for NAMA to explain the reasons for the questions asked of PIMCO on the call (and we note Mr Stewart sought to address this topic in his evidence to the Committee), PIMCO can confirm that on that call we were asked by NAMA if we had considered &quot;other options&quot;, such as proceeding without the three parties, and we were asked to consider, before closing any doors, whether every option was being considered.  PIMCO agreed to give the matter final consideration and to revert again.<br \/><br \/>On 12 March, PIMCO advised NAMA that it had no option but to withdraw from Project Eagle.  NAMA expressed its disappointment but accepted the decision.<br \/><br \/>PIMCO confirmed its decision to withdraw in writing on 13 March 2014.<br \/><br \/>We hope the above is helpful and provides some additional clarity for the Committee.<br \/><br \/>Yours sincerely,<br \/><br \/>Tom Rice<br \/><br \/>Chief Legal Officer, EMEA<br \/><br \/>PIMCO Europe Ltd<\/blockquote><p>We will publish the letter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#G00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>On the follow up from a number of organisations, this is most important piece of correspondence we have received.  It is illuminating and joins up many dots.  It clearly contradicts evidence we were given from NAMA.  That is very worrying, as it casts doubt on much of what was said to us in the evidence presented by NAMA in respect of what happened when it was made aware of the success or fixer fees.  It also vindicates what was in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  It appears that PIMCO is almost in full agreement with the Comptroller and Auditor General's interpretation of the conference call notes.  We need to get NAMA legal representatives back before the committee as soon as possible because this is a clear contradiction of what was said.<\/p><p>In fact, what PIMCO is doing is accepting what NAMA's legal people put together in terms of the notes following the conference call.  That is the issue here.  Their notes - and the appendices based on them - are what the Comptroller and Auditor General based his assumptions on.  However, when they came before the committee they tried to put a different interpretation on them.  That interpretation is sharply contradicted by what is contained in the correspondence.  The position needs to be clarified.<\/p><p> We also need to know whether NAMA was informed of all of this at the time.  In other words, when NAMA was first approached by PIMCO, was it given this information in the letter with which we have been presented in terms of April 2013 as a timeline, the fact that a number of parties were involved, including Mr. Cushnahan?  This is a serious issue because it raises questions as to the action it took or did not take - or the action it should have taken - in light of the information it was given.  It tried to present that this was all retrospective or new information which was brought into the public domain and that it was not aware of it.  If the information in this letter was presented to NAMA at that time, that puts a completely different complexion on what NAMA did or did not do.  There are also questions about whether the NAMA board was given the full information.  Serious questions arise.<\/p><p> There is a question for the Comptroller and Auditor General in regard to it also because he has dealt with this matter in his report.  He mentioned the association of Mr. Cushnahan with a number of debtors that comprised 50% of the NAMA loan book.  One of the Comptroller and Auditor General's observations is that PIMCO had an advantage over other bidders.  Given what this letter states, the fact that we now know Mr. Cushnahan was one of those who was part of bringing the information to PIMCO and that an opportunity had arisen - and in light of the fact that we know he would have had some knowledge but that he had an association with debtors - in the Comptroller and Auditor General's opinion, what advantage would this have given PIMCO over, for example, Fortress or other bidders?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#H00200","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>We will put the questions to the Comptroller and Auditor General.

To me, this letter is potentially explosive.  One aspect that jumps out at me is that in a sales process of 2013-2014, NAMA was providing valuations for 2009.  We had certain discussions with Ministers and others about the fact that valuations were not sought.  From my own knowledge, having been an auctioneer, if NAMA was selling a house for &euro;100,000 in Kiltimagh, three valuations would have been sought.  There was significant movement in property values after 2009, which would have been at the absolute depths of the crash, versus 2013-2014, when there would have been a very established trend in all three locations in which the properties were located, namely, the UK, Northern Ireland and the South.  We certainly were selling ourselves short.  That is one part of it.  In terms of the Northern Ireland Government, another part of it is that - with respect to, say, a person living in the North of Ireland - it might have been a very patriotic attempt to withdraw its property industry from what may have been perceived by it to be a process of throwing certain developers in the South under the bus of certain developers in the South.  That is worth considering in the context of the approach taken by NAMA regarding the overall economic impact on this country of its actions.  The third aspect is the role of Mr. Cushnahan and the fee element, which was simply incredible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#J00300","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Suffice to say, I agree with Deputy MacSharry.

First, this letter is a game-changer.  It sets out a number of troubling facts but, as troubling as they are, they clarify what were gaps in the sequence of events and our understanding of what happened and why.  It now seems that Project Eagle was conceived of not by PIMCO, as NAMA had asserted, but by Brown Rudnick, along with Tughans and Mr. Frank Cushnahan.  Obviously, this needs serious investigation, as the Chairman said.  We need to seek the assistance of Mr. Tuvi Keinan of Brown Rudnick.  I want to make the committee aware that I had occasion to correspond with Mr. Keinan in July 2015.  At that stage, his professional r&eacute;sum&eacute; at Brown Rudnick boasted sourcing and executing an off-market discounted UK loan portfolio sale from NAMA, Ireland's national bad bank, 2011.  I was alarmed to read that.  I corresponded with the committee at the time and with NAMA, which came back and said that, as far as it was aware, Mr. Keinan had worked for Morgan Stanley, which had been a successful bidder in a previous transaction, but it very much distanced itself from any knowledge of Mr. Keinan and now, lo and behold, his name appears here.  It is not only that we need to hear from Brown Rudnick, we also need to invite Mr. Keinan to come before us because he is specifically cited in the correspondence.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the issue on which we pressed NAMA at all levels - the board, the chief executive officer and the chairman - regarding its contention that PIMCO had connived to remain within the process and had sought its acquiescence, this letter flatly contradicts that position.  That position was defended by board members in fairly trenchant terms.  Those board members need to return and give an explanation.  <\/p> <p>  The most troubling aspect of all is that the matter relating to April 2013 appeared in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report because it is detailed in contemporaneous notes of telephone calls and also is referred to in the board minutes.  What I want to know is has NAMA been less than truthful with this committee?  Has it been less than fulsome in terms of the information it has given as to who knew what and when?  We need to get to the bottom of that matter.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Rice, who has written to us from PIMCO, was party to those telephone conversations in respect of the fixer's or success fee.  It is extremely important that we hear from Mr. Ronnie Hanna who was a key player, a key conduit for the board and who spoke on behalf of the board on these matters.  It is essential that we seek to have him come before the committee.<\/p> <p>  We focused very much on Mr. Cushnahan in respect of the fixer's or success fee and the inappropriateness of this payment.  This letter points to a much deeper problem in respect of Mr. Cushnahan.  It is not just that he was in line for a fee, it is that he was at the heart of matters from the very beginning and right through to the execution of this sales process.  It seems from this letter that NAMA was aware of that, namely, that he was not a bit player or somebody who was on the side and due to receive a fee, but rather a mover and shaker in the whole process.  Very careful language is used in this letter in order to make that point clear.<\/p><p>They referred to Mr. Cushnahan's role and the potential for the fee.  It is important, as we examine matters, that we understand the importance of all of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#J00600","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I will not go back over a lot of the territory, except to agree with a number of points.

When NAMA officials have attended these meetings, they has been quite strong in attacking back, in particular, in terms of PIMCO, as Deputy McDonald has said, suggesting that it contrived to stay in the game, and yet this piece of documentation clearly shows that PIMCO went out of its way to try to be honest with the whole process.  The credibility of all the statements by NAMA gets put on the table, and as we have seen in recent days with the US election, credibility is something that can be hard fought and easily lost.  Given the aggressive nature of how NAMA has chosen to deal with this committee, its credibility gets brought into question.  The core of this key piece of evidence in regard to PIMCO is that there is a clear assertion now that NAMA has been dishonest with this committee.  The chief legal officer of PIMCO has not taken the decision lightly to write to this committee and state clearly that there is a very wide divergence between how it approached this matter and that it was honest from the get-go and the evidence that has been produced by NAMA to say to the contrary that PIMCO contrived merely to try to stay in the game and acquire this property.  Therefore, the credibility of everything that has been put before us in terms of how we are assessing this gets brought into question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#K00500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Cassells' point but we have to allow NAMA the opportunity to respond to this as well because we are not a court.

There is an important point to be made as well that should not be lost on us in this response where it says that when this project was conceived - we now know it was not conceived by PIMCO and it was conceived by all these players, that is, Mr. Coulter, Tughans, Mr. Frank Cushnahan and Brown Rudnick - it was not specifically in relation to PIMCO and that there were at least three bidders.  That raises questions, because one of the narratives from NAMA was that once PIMCO and Cushnahan were out of the game, or once PIMCO was gone at least, that was the end of the matter.  That is not the case.  We need to know who these three bidders were.  That is very important.  Who were these other players who were in the game?  Only Brown Rudnick can answer that question, but it is an important question nonetheless.<\/p> <p>  There is reference to the information that was given to PIMCO by these players.  It is important to remind ourselves that this information was given by Mr. Cushnahan when he was a member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee of NAMA in April 2013.  The information was of a very sensitive nature and he would have had it only because he was a member.  That is how explosive this response is.<\/p> <p>  There are a lot of follow-up questions, but I reiterate it was not only PIMCO which was being approached by these fixers, players or whatever one wants to call them.

I thought I might discuss briefly four or five key matters that have come up on a number of occasions.  I have not prepared an opening statement because I am quite happy that my original opening statement stands.  That is my summarisation and presentation to the committee of what the report contains, and I would like to put on the record that I am still satisfied with my report.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the PIMCO letter, Deputy Cullinane put a number of questions to me, so I will make a number of comments in response.  First, the point as to whether the board of NAMA knew that negotiations had gone on in April 2013 was, I think, the point which was raised with Mr. Ellingham and which he corrected on the record today.  As Deputy McDonald has said, the minutes of the board meeting of 13 March record the fact that the success fee arrangement had been discussed.  The minutes state &quot;The Board noted that PIMCO had advised that the negotiations had commenced in April 2013 and noted further that Frank Cushnahan had not resigned as a member of the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee until 7th November 2013 nor had he made any disclosure of his involvement.&quot;  Those are the facts.  I am reading from paragraph 5.19 on page 93 of the report.  Moving to page 94, NAMA responded to that.  It states in paragraph 5.26:<\/p><blockquote>NAMA was not aware in March 2014 of success fee negotiations that may have taken place in April 2013 between various parties.  The minutes of the Board meeting of 13 March 2014 state that &ldquo;the Board noted that PIMCO advised that the negotiations had commenced in April 2013&rdquo;. This disclosure was taken by the Board to mean that negotiations between PIMCO and Brown Rudnick had commenced in April 2013, and not that negotiations over success fee payments had commenced at that stage.<\/blockquote> <p>That is NAMA's official position on that point.<br\/><br\/>The question arose as to what advantage there would have been to PIMCO of Mr. Cushnahan's involvement and what success might have meant in that case.  I take the Chairman's point about not engaging in speculation.  I do not want to engage in speculation as to what that advantage might have been.  However, there was a point in the paper put to the board in December 2013 on page 146.  It discusses the non-performing loan, NPL, discount.  I will come back to the discount rates, but the paper states:<\/p><blockquote>In general, acquiring non-performing loans, without an agreed strategy and consensual plan to simultaneous [<i>sic<\/i>] take direct ownership of the secured property or shares, carries significant risk.<br \/><br \/>[Asset recovery] is not aware of any such plan between PIMCO and existing NAMA borrowers.<\/blockquote> <p>The significance of that is that the level of discount that a purchaser of non-performing loans would seek can be affected by the extent to which there is an arrangement or whatever in place with the non-performing debtors.  I am not suggesting that is the situation, but there is that risk and the committee might wish to consider it as well.<br\/><br\/>Another point in that regard is that any bidder for Project Eagle or any other purchase of loans in NAMA would have been required to sign a declaration stating that it did not have a connection with any of the debtors.  That is an obligation that would have been faced by PIMCO had they gone ahead with the purchase.  A declaration of that nature was made under section 172 of the NAMA Act, that that would be an obligation on PIMCO.  It was an obligation on Cerberus, which, in fact, signed such a declaration.  Those are the comments I have to make regarding the issues that come up in the PIMCO letter.<br\/><br\/>If the Chairman wishes, I can make the four or five points I want to make and then if the committee wishes to discuss them at that point and dispose of them, that is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#L03600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":124,"content":"<p>The Comptroller and Auditor General might answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#M00100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>No, I will answer questions on this issue and any other issue the committee brings up.

This report is underpinned by such an examination.  Value for money examinations are carried out under section 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.  Specific types of issues can be examined within that.  I want to draw the committee's attention to the legislative provision that is most relevant here.  Section 9(1)(b) empowers the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out an examination as to whether disposals of resources by public bodies have \"been effected upon the most favourable terms reasonably obtainable\".  I draw attention to that because NAMA's primary purpose, having acquired assets, is to dispose of those assets.  We are not talking about NAMA investing in and holding property into the long term.  All of NAMA's activity is aimed at disposing of the assets.  It is a question of whether those disposals are \"effected upon the most favourable terms reasonably obtainable\".<\/p> <p>  NAMA had two options.  It could choose to work out the property assets over time or to bundle the loans into portfolios for sale.  Chapter 3 examines how NAMA evaluated that choice in the case of Project Eagle.  Having decided to sell the loans in a portfolio, the entirely separate question of whether the sales process implemented by NAMA relating to that portfolio sale resulted in the achievement of the best price available in the market for a portfolio arose.  That is what Chapter 4 deals with.  They are two quite separate and distinct issues.  Regarding the objectives of the examination, I want to reiterate, as I said in my original opening statement and in the report, that I draw no conclusion about the merits of the decision to sell or about the commercial or strategic objectives underpinning NAMA's decision.  It is not for me to do that or to engage in speculation about it.  That is just in relation to the examination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Can I ask an obvious question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#M00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>Yes, sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>It is a value for money report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#M00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I will keep it in layman's language.

It has been represented that I came up with the 5.5% discount rate figure as a proposal.  NAMA used a rate of 5.5% to discount its projected cashflows in the paper it gave to the board in December 2013.  It chose that rate and used it throughout its paper.  When, in the course of the examination, we asked NAMA why it used that rate, it explained to us that the board had confirmed as recently as June 2013 that this specific discount rate was appropriate for such exercises.

The board had considered what was the appropriate level of discount to use.  We have reproduced the relevant part of that paper on pages 42 and 43.  When one reads that, one should consider it in the context of the reduction in NAMA's cost of capital.  The tenor of the paper is to question why it was appropriate for NAMA to continue to use a rate as high as 5.5%, and why it should not be reduced, given that its cost of capital had fallen.  It argued, for a number of reasons that are laid out in the paper in question, that it was reasonable to continue to use that rate for commercial decision-making by NAMA.  We accepted that argument, which was presented to us when we queried why a 5.5% rate was being used.<\/p> <p>  I have already referred to page 146 of the paper that was put to the board in the context of NAMA's claim that a 10% discount rate should be used to arrive at a net present value for the workout option.  That was not raised with us in the course of the examination until June 2016, when NAMA suggested that it would have been appropriate to use a 10% rate.  The question that arises in that context is why such a rate was not used in the paper to the board if it was appropriate to use it.  Having looked back over it, all previous documentary references to a 10% discount on asset values or to a 10% discount rate are in the context of how potential purchasers would value a loan portfolio and not how a seller should value such a portfolio.  I have no difficulty with NAMA's argument that a potential purchaser of a portfolio of distressed assets would have arrived at a bid value based on a 10% or higher discount of asset value.  A purchaser would need to have that space in order to make a profit.  Equally, I accept that purchasers could have applied a 10% discount rate to their own projected loan cashflows, reflecting their typically higher cost of capital.  In the report, we have tried to represent fairly NAMA's position in relation to that and how purchasers would go about valuing a portfolio of assets.  We have included in the report all the expert advice that was received by NAMA in 2016, first of all from a number of loan sale advisers and then latterly from KPMG.  We have no dispute with it.<\/p><p>The focus in all that advice relates to the use by purchasers of a relatively high discount rate.  More recently and in the course of the evidence here, it was not something that was raised with us during the examination.  NAMA has pointed out that it used a 10% discount rate in arriving at a fair value for its loans for disclosure in its 2012 and 2013 financial statements.  That is absolutely correct but in that context, a fair value estimate is designed to reflect the price that the market would pay NAMA for all of its loans if it had to sell them on the balance sheet date.  Again, it is 10% being appropriate when looked at from a purchaser's point of view.<\/p><p> I will conclude by making the following points.  I do not accept NAMA's representation of this disagreement as a difference in accounting treatment.  Rather, it is a question about economic decision making and the discount rate is relevant to that.  It is about how we make choices between alternative ways of handling publicly owned resources.  It is not just an esoteric accounting point.  A paper which was submitted to the committee in the last week is relevant to this point.  The reference is 167 B.  This is a document that my office would have received from the chief finance officer when we were finishing the 2013 financial statements around April 2014.  It relates to a matter that the Chairman raised when I was here originally, namely, whether there should have been a post balance sheet adjustment of impairment.  That was something we discussed with NAMA at the time and this paper was NAMA's response.  I wish to draw attention to the part of the paper where the chief finance officer points out that the future potential sale of the Northern Ireland portfolio as a portfolio loan sale was not considered in the impairment calculations at the reporting date, 31 December 2013.  In estimating the cashflow of the Northern Ireland debtors, assets disposals would have been anticipated in periods from 2014 to 2020 in line with the existing strategy for NAMA.  What NAMA is confirming there is that it had an alternative to selling the portfolio, which was to work out the assets.  In the next paragraph of the document, NAMA is saying that the portfolio loan sale is anticipated to generate a loss, on disposal, of &pound;160 million.  The discount to carrying value reflects the impact of a sale of the entire portfolio of assets.  This discount factor did not arise and would not have been considered as part of the year-end impairment asset as it was anticipated that the Northern Ireland loans would be held for the longer term in line with existing debtor strategies.  Therefore, NAMA is of the view that the conditions that generated the loss on disposal did not exist at the reporting date.  Effectively, what NAMA is confirming there is that it had a strategy to hold the assets and work them out and that it did not see that it needed to incorporate the loss into the impairment figure at the end of 2013.  <\/p><p> Obviously, a lot of points have been raised with the committee around the discount rate.

On average, for the Northern Ireland loans, the EIR at the end of 2013 would have been about 4.8% as opposed to the 5.5% that was used in the cashflow analysis.

The carrying value does that; it is built on cashflows that assume that NAMA would work out the assets over time, from 2014 to 2020.  Everything on the balance sheet was looked at from that point of view.  Under International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, NAMA is also required to disclose in its financial statements what would happen if it had to sell all the loans on the balance sheet date, if it had to have a fire sale of everything it holds, which is different to its strategy of working them out.  The fair value amount is to be presented in the financial statements as well but it is presented by way of a disclosure note rather than being built into the balance sheet.  If NAMA changed it strategy and moved to one of disposing of the loans as quickly as possible, then it would have been required to revalue those loans and present in its balance sheet the loans valued on a fair value basis.<\/p> <p>  I ask Deputy Cullinane to repeat his question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#N01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>What is meant by lower costs of capital?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#N01300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>NAMA's borrowing cost in June 2013 was around 1.2%.

One could say that taking the interest rate on the 95% senior bonds and the 5% subordinated bonds, one would get a blended cost of capital.  As at June 2013, and things did not change that much between June and December 2013, NAMA's cost of capital was very low.  NAMA also had a hedging strategy for its interest rate which was protecting it against any sudden increase in the interest rate on its bonds.  NAMA discussed this in the June 2013 paper.  Effectively, NAMA had ensured that its interest rate would not go above 2%.  The difference between that and the 5.5%, which was the discount rate, reflects the risk in the portfolio.  Between a figure of around 1.2% and 5.5%, one is looking at around 4.3% or 4.4% of a risk premium, which is relatively generous.

I will not go over old ground because we want to try to reach some conclusions.  When NAMA first attended the committee, it was very strong in its criticism of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the discount rate and his understanding of market values and so on.  That softened the last time board members were before the committee, and there was some discussion of Mr. McCarthy's interpretation of what he meant in the report and their understanding of it, or at least their perception of it.  It might be clearer when the senior officials of NAMA attend a meeting of this committee in a couple of weeks' time.<\/p> <p>  There is a lot of discussion about whether Mr. McCarthy had market expertise, the level of outside expertise he should perhaps have got and so on.  I do not have that expertise.  I have to understand this through what I hear from NAMA and from Mr. McCarthy.  The same is true, I would imagine, for all committee members.  Mr. McCarthy said this is about economic decision-making and the sales strategy NAMA employs, and that whatever sales strategy it employed in respect of these assets would determine discount rates and so on.  There was a sales strategy to hold the assets, working them out over time, and Mr. McCarthy mentioned the lower cost of capital, so that would have yielded a higher return.  At no point did he say that NAMA should have held the assets until 2020, which NAMA insinuated he did.  It is clear that misrepresented what Mr. McCarthy said.  It is important that is corrected.  Mr. McCarthy's distinction was not so much that if NAMA switched to a loan sale strategy and wanted to sell at that particular time, a market rate would apply and that it should not have applied a higher discount rate, but that with all the evidence the board had at the time, as presented to us, if it had held out and kept to the work-out strategy in place, it would possibly have got a higher return because there was a potential loss in switching strategy.<\/p> <p>  I want to understand why it switched strategy.  That will come back to some of the PIMCO material but leaving that aside, why, from a commercial perspective, did it switch strategy?  It is now using retrospective excuses such as Brexit which Mr. McCarthy said it did not raise with him.<\/p><p>It also talks about the low performance of the assets and it had problems with debtors.

We did not see any of that in relation to Project Eagle.  It was quite simply we will work it out or we will sell it all as a single loan portfolio.  It might be instructive for the committee to see the Lazard documents.  I know the committee has asked to see them and I presume they are coming to it.  From these, the committee will see nothing in them about how to shape the portfolio.  If one were to look at the tender submitted by the loan sale advisers for Project Arrow - their bidding for the work, their analysis of the market, who is available to buy a portfolio of this size, what way the portfolio is put together - is remarkably different.  It explains the logic of the thing in good sense.  What it did with Project Arrow was that it took some of the better assets and sold them separately.<\/p> <p>  There are strategic responses that might have been available to NAMA but we do not see any of that kind of analysis.  Lazard was not asked to produce that kind of advice for NAMA.  That leaves me with a concern - one that remains with me - that it may not have approached it strategically.  I am not going to try to say what was the alternative best way to sell it.  I would not attempt to do that.  However, it could have got advice to assist it, taking the temperature of the market at the time and looking at who is interested in buying loans of what kind and what sort of tranches and so on.

On 29 September, Mr. Brendan McDonagh asserted that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report has adopted a position which would not be accepted by \"anyone engaged in actual loan sales in Ireland or anywhere else\".  The statement uses that type of language throughout.  Basically, the assertion is that the Comptroller and Auditor General's office did not have a clue.  Mr. McCarthy has dealt with that today.  What worries me about this type of narrative is that the report is being ignored in terms of the process of the sale and the concerns that were raised with regard to that process.  The concerns, for example, relating to conflicts of interest, to the limited information given to Lazard and so forth.  I am not happy that those concerns have not been dealt with by NAMA.

I know that the report is not an easy read.  It is difficult and tortuous but there are concerns raised therein around the quality of information presented to the board, on which the board was asked to make a decision and difficulties with the meaning of board minutes.  To be in a situation where we are disputing the meaning of words is highly frustrating for everybody.<\/p> <p>  There are a few other points that I would like to make that may address some of the issues raised by Deputy Connolly.  The NAMA representation of the sales process is that the nine largest potential purchasers in the world had access to it.  That misses completely the evolution of the sales process.  It was never intended to involve the nine largest players involved.  That would be my reading of it, if one works through it and sees the way it evolved.  We tried to lay that out in our report.  <\/p> <p>  Some witnesses from NAMA have said that I have used the benefit of hindsight in looking at certain aspects of this but one could only describe it as \"with hindsight looking back\" to claim that nine potential purchasers were approached.  That is one perspective on it but there is another perspective when one looks at the way it evolved.  For example, the paper that was put to the board on 8 January by the asset recovery unit in NAMA proposed that Lazard be appointed and at least two other purchasers be invited to look at the portfolio in the data room.  Those purchasers would be given about two weeks in the data room and then Lazard would come back with a recommendation by 31 January.<\/p><p>As for being castigated as not having market understanding or market knowledge when that is the proposal that comes from asset recovery, that would have been simply a pretence of a sale process.  In fairness to the board, it said there needed to be more than this and more time had to be given.  A better process was run but that was the starting point.  That would have been a token exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#R02700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":246,"content":"<p>There were a number of other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#S00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":247,"content":"<p>There are many issues as one goes through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Does Mr. McCarthy want to comment on those issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#S00400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>From an evolutionary point of view, this process moved through various stages.

When we received NAMA's response, we sent it what was to be the last draft of the report and the report was to be finalised.  The letter is the response to the penultimate draft of the report.  With regard to the issues raised in the letter, mainly what we included in the almost-last draft was a summary of the report.  The point Ms Nolan made in the report was that we had not expressed in more or less the same way the points in the summary that we had in the body of the report.

We have been constantly reassured by the Minister in the D&aacute;il any time oversight of NAMA was raised that the Comptroller and Auditor General had a big team in it.  I found it quite useful to hear about the practical work the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General does in NAMA.  It was very different to my perception.

The value-for-money study is very different to what has taken place in respect of looking historically at what has happened regarding the disposal of distressed loans.<\/p> <p>  The emphasis in the report is on the process, and best practice is to have a two-phase process with a wide involvement of people which is narrowed down.

If everybody in the office was in NAMA we would not be able to exercise that level of control.  It would not be an audit, it would be a control function.  I have always corrected this impression when the matter has been put in front of me.  The focus of our ongoing work is on the correctness of the financial statements and the operation of key controls, as we see it, regarding transactions that are accounted for, which we look at on a sample basis and not on a comprehensive basis.<\/p> <p>  When we came to look at the process in which NAMA engaged, our first point of reference was NAMA's policy.  How it will sell assets or loans is clearly set out in a policy statement and guidelines.  It has the option to depart from this for specific reasons, but in the course of the examination we asked where else had it used a single-phase procedure and it referenced only one, which started out as at two-phase process but it received only two bids - actually it was only one bid - and it was a very small asset.  It has always operated a two-phase process.<\/p> <p>  In addition, when we looked at Project Arrow and Project Tower, we looked at the process to see whether NAMA had followed its own guidelines on how assets were to be disposed of.  We looked at the advice it received from loan sale advisers.  We reproduced in the report a piece of advice on why it is best to use a two-stage process, as the Deputy has described.  To us, it seems fairly clear, unambiguous and well reasoned.  It is easy to understand why it makes sense.  We do not have to be market experts to state it would give us confidence in the price we would be likely to achieve at the end.  Ultimately something can be sold only once, so when something is put on the market, if an appropriate process is followed and it is made as competitive as possible, while it may whittle down, at the end of the day I as an auditor looking at the price achieved will state the process gives me confidence that the price was the best available at that time in that market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#W00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>The reason I raise IBRC is because process is something with which there is a comparison regarding-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#W00700","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":298,"content":"<p>It was suggested by NAMA that we look at the process there.<\/p><p>My difficulty with that is that I do not have access rights, those being rights to inquire into IBRC.

It might be worth the committee's while examining a non-disclosure agreement in terms of the specific requirements.  It has been represented that one must sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to get into the data room, but the restrictions are broader, in that it does not have to be just information that one gets from the data room.  There can be restrictions concerning how the process is being run, who is engaged in it and so on.  We queried the transfer.<\/p> <p>  A specific requirement in the non-disclosure agreement was that NAMA was to be told who was to be used.  That happened.  Cerberus told it about the advisers that it was taking on.  Cushman and Wakefield, which was PIMCO's property adviser, moved to Fortress.  This is on page 80.  NewRiver Retail, PIMCO's retail property advisers, moved to Cerberus.  In both cases, Cerberus and Fortress informed NAMA that they were proposing to take these on at a later stage in the process.

In table 9, the figure used for discounting was 5.5% so that is why we queried why it was 5.5%.  We got the explanation, which was related to the June paper.  A further difficulty with table 9 is that when a future value is discounted, it brings it back to a particular point in time, usually to a balance sheet date.  NAMA's standard approach in doing that is that it treats rent as it gathering rent all through the year.  If there is a rent roll of &euro;100 million, basically it is treated as if it came in on 30 June and it is discounted back to the balance sheet date, which is December.

I am here with Des Carville and Declan Reid, as the Chairman has already mentioned.<\/p> <p>  I want to begin by discussing the balance between NAMA's independence and accountability and how this informs NAMA's relationship with the Department of Finance.  NAMA was established under the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 as a separate statutory body with its own board and CEO appointed by the Minister for Finance.  The board of NAMA is mandated to carry out its functions independently and is closely guided by its obligations under the NAMA Act.<\/p> <p>  The NAMA board has full responsibility and authority for determining NAMA's strategy and commercial policies, conducting NAMA's day-to-day operations and all other business of NAMA in accordance with the board's legal and fiduciary duties.  The NAMA board also has responsibility and authority for ensuring compliance with all regulatory and legal obligations of NAMA.<\/p> <p>  The NAMA Act established the independence of NAMA and created a separation of NAMA from the Minister and the Department of Finance, limiting intervention by the Minister and the Department in the conduct of NAMA's business.  It is recognised that NAMA is a statutorily independent, fully accountable organisation and remains a separate economic unit with independent powers of decision.  As a result, the CEO of NAMA is the Accounting Officer for NAMA and is directly accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, PAC.<\/p> <p>  This relationship between the Department of Finance and NAMA differs from other bodies under the aegis of the Department of Finance.  Through every interaction with NAMA, Department officials are very mindful of the will of the Oireachtas, as expressed through the NAMA Act, in safeguarding NAMA's independence.  Nevertheless, it is not forgotten that the State has a significant financial exposure to NAMA as the guarantor of NAMA's senior notes.  The primary financial risk to the State posed by NAMA stemmed from its ability to redeem its senior debt in full and eliminate the State's initial &euro;30.2 billion contingent liability.  Recognising the State's significant financial exposure to NAMA, the Oireachtas was conscious of striking a careful balance between NAMA's independence and accountability.<\/p> <p>  Respecting this balance, the Minister and the Department keep in regular contact with NAMA.  The Department holds monthly meetings with the NAMA management team and there is almost daily communication between NAMA officials and officials from the Department across a range of issues.  Such daily issues include parliamentary questions, briefings on topical matters and NAMA's financial results, as well as broader strategic matters.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, the Department is primarily interested in NAMA at a strategic level, that is, in evaluating NAMA's ability to achieve its objectives under the NAMA Act.  As has been stated previously to the committee, the Department does not seek to involve itself in issues regarding specific debtors, specific assets or the detail of individual sales processes.  These are a matter for NAMA.<\/p> <p>  The Oireachtas also plays a significant role in NAMA's accountability in light of the number of reporting obligations provided for in the NAMA Act.  Section 53 of the Act requires NAMA to produce an annual statement to be laid before the Oireachtas, providing NAMA's objectives for the upcoming year and details on the nature and scope of NAMA's activities.  Section 55 requires NAMA to produce quarterly financial reports also to be laid before the Oireachtas.  NAMA's most recent section 53 and section 55 reports were laid before the Oireachtas last week.<\/p> <p>  Section 57 requires NAMA's annual accounts to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, ensuring that the accounts are critically and thoroughly examined on behalf of taxpayers, prior to being laid before the Oireachtas.  In addition, the Minister's section 227 reports and the Comptroller and Auditor General's section 226 reports assessing NAMA's achievement of its purposes and objectives are laid before the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  The Act also establishes the accountability of NAMA's chief executive officer and chairman directly to the Oireachtas, requiring them to give evidence, whenever required to do so, to the Committee of Public Accounts and to any other committee appointed by the Oireachtas to examine matters relating to NAMA.  In this regard, it is worth noting that NAMA has appeared numerous times before this committee since 2009.<\/p> <p>  In balancing NAMA's independence and accountability, the Oireachtas established the Act to ensure as much transparency as is consistent with bank confidentiality, while allowing NAMA to go about its business unhindered in maximising the commercial return for the State.  The Act is careful to avoid undermining NAMA's commercial mandate, to avoid placing NAMA at a competitive disadvantage, or indeed, advantage, and to avoid leaving NAMA open to potential constitutional and legal challenges.<\/p> <p>  During the Minister for Finance's recent appearance before this committee there were a number of questions regarding the pace of NAMA's deleveraging and whether NAMA was pressured to accelerate its disposals.  It is important to place these questions in their historical context.  As we begin to emerge from the crisis, we must not forget the crisis, and the magnitude of the problems we faced and the need to deal with those problems upfront.  The reality is that without some difficult and brave decisions that were made in the depths of the crisis we would not be in such an improved position today, which is not to say everything is perfect.<\/p> <p>  NAMA was established at a time when the Irish banking system was near collapse and there was severe instability in the global financial markets.  By the end of 2010, the Irish sovereign was locked out of the debt markets, the State's finances were unsustainable and we had no option but to enter into a programme of support.  As part of that programme of support, the State relied upon the troika and others for billions of euros of funding and the State and the banks relied upon the European Central Banking system for billions of euros of liquidity support.<\/p> <p>  Faced with severe financial pressure, one of our main priorities as a nation was to regain our economic sovereignty by reducing our reliance on emergency funding and liquidity support.  We aimed to reduce our sovereign debt, including contingent liabilities, to sustainable levels and to deleverage our banking system in order to increase confidence in the Irish sovereign and the broader economy, regain access to the market and reduce our cost of borrowing.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;30.2 billion contingent liability created by the guarantee of NAMA's senior debt was a significant component of our sovereign debt and contributed in no small way to Ireland being shut out of the sovereign debt markets.  The importance of reducing the State's debt, including NAMA's contingent liability, was not lost on the Members of the Oireachtas who mandated NAMA to deal with its assets \"expeditiously\" and limited NAMA's life to ten years.<\/p> <p>  NAMA took this mandate seriously and from the outset identified one of the key tensions in its mandate as being the tension between maximising value and dealing with its assets expeditiously.  In order to achieve its mandate within its ten year life as set out in the NAMA Act, NAMA's first board approved business plan dating back to June 2010 anticipated a healthy level of debt redemptions, establishing its first senior debt redemption target of 25% by 2013.<\/p><p>Once established by the NAMA board, this target was monitored by the Department and the troika becoming a <i>de facto<\/i>commitment within Ireland's recovery programme.  In balancing its primary objectives of dealing expeditiously with its assets and protecting or otherwise enhancing their value, NAMA's mandate was completely aligned with the interests of the State and the troika.  It is to be expected that there was general consensus in support of NAMA's commitment to take full advantage of investor interest with a view to accelerating disposals and the resulting senior note redemptions beyond its original targets while remaining faithful to its overall objectives and purposes under the Act.  No pressure was placed on NAMA to accelerate its disposals by the Department and I am not aware of any such pressure from any other source.  All stakeholders recognised the market dynamics and broadly agreed that NAMA was pursuing the most appropriate strategy.  This strategy was entirely consistent with the NAMA Act and the interests of the State.  This is most evident in the Department's section 227 report which evaluated NAMA's progress and made recommendations consistent with NAMA's chosen strategy.<br\/><br\/>When market opportunities began to present themselves in the UK and then later in Ireland, NAMA began to take advantage of these opportunities, accelerating the pace of its sales activity.  In adjusting its strategy to emerging market conditions, NAMA remained faithful to its mandate to achieve the best financial return for the State while dealing with its assets expeditiously. <br\/><br\/>Pursuing this strategy NAMA materially reduced the State&rsquo;s contingent liability and in so doing reduced the banks' reliance on liquidity support from the ECB.  To put it another way, as NAMA redeemed the contingent liability, it redeemed senior notes held by the participating Irish banks on a <i>pro rata <\/i>basis thereby improving their viability and reducing their reliance on emergency ECB funding and liquidity.  NAMA's steady successes have helped improve confidence in Ireland, reduced our cost of debt and accelerated the pace of our economic recovery.  In advance of our appearance, we provided a series of excerpts from troika and rating agency reports over a number of years which reflect this progression.  These materials are available on the Department of Finance website and we would be happy to discuss them in greater detail today.<br\/><br\/>I would like to focus briefly on the Department's knowledge of the Project Eagle sale process.  Around this time last year, the Department of Finance provided the PAC with over 40 documents regarding the Department's knowledge of the sale process.  In the interest of full disclosure, we provided the PAC last week with a number of additional documents released under freedom of information regarding Project Eagle.  These documents remain available on the Department of Finance website and we are happy to discuss them today.  The Department of Finance supported the Minister in his dealings with the Northern Ireland Executive across a broad range of cross border financial services issues including those relating to NAMA and ultimately relating to NAMA's Northern Ireland loan portfolio and a potential sales process.  This is a matter of public record.  It should not be surprising that officials both North and South became aware of a potential sale following the receipt of expressions of interest and were mindful of potential impacts on the Northern Ireland economy.  Throughout our engagement, we are not aware of any political pressure being placed on NAMA and I note this position has been asserted by the NAMA Chairman and the Minister.  I also confirm that in each interaction with our Northern Ireland counterparts, it was stressed that NAMA was independent in its functions, should be approached directly by interested parties, was obliged to run a competitive process, and must be satisfied that it had achieved the best price.<br\/><br\/>Suggestions that the Minister for Finance should have interfered with NAMA's commercial decision and called a halt to the board-approved sales process fundamentally misunderstands NAMA's independent mandate and the role of the Minister for Finance.  The Oireachtas ensured NAMA's independence when it made section 9 of the NAMA Act unambiguous, stating that &quot;NAMA is independent in the performance of its functions&quot;.  Section 12 of the Act bestows the NAMA board with the power to sell or dispose of the whole or any part of the property or investments of NAMA, either together or in portions, for such consideration and on such terms as the board thinks fit.  In summary, the Oireachtas aimed to ensure NAMA would be independent in its decision-making and would remain insulated from political influence.  This is enshrined in the NAMA Act and is respected by the Department of Finance in its every interaction with NAMA.  I hope this has provided some helpful context for the committee regarding the Department of Finance's relationship with NAMA both generally and in the context of Project Eagle.  We are happy to be of assistance to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.

Unfortunately, unlike Bill Murray in the film, our previous repeat visitors before today have not seen a change in the script, although PIMCO's letter this morning will at least make the sequel appearance by Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh interesting.  The previous appearance by Ms Nolan and other senior officials with the Minister for Finance was very interesting, in that the strong stance taken by the Department, and the Minister, on that day was that there was no other option on the table, bar the course of action that was taken.<\/p><p>We had a very interesting discussion this morning with the Comptroller and Auditor General on the options not explored.  What was also strongly put on the day was the fact that it was stated that the Minister and the Department played no role in the portfolio and it would have been inappropriate for anyone to do so.  However, an aspect in the letter from Tom Rice, chief legal officer of PIMCO, which we discussed this morning, sets out the context for the approach to NAMA on the purchase of the property and that the Northern Ireland Government expressed a desire that it wanted a responsible purchaser and that PIMCO fitted that bill.  It also goes on to state that the Minister, Sammy Wilson, advised the Minister, Deputy Noonan, of the fact that Brown Rudnick wanted the deal to proceed with one party on a limited exclusivity to ensure an expedient process and that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, responded that parties should make contact with NAMA directly and he advised that Brown Rudnick should enter dialogue with NAMA so that any interest in the loan portfolio could be fully assessed.

If one puts up a barrier or a price or one values the thing far higher than anyone who is going to buy it, then it may well be that one can never sell it.  It is like the guy who puts his house on the market for &euro;400,000 and then says nobody wants to buy it for that.  He then decides to wait until next year and sell it for &euro;400,000.  Then the next year the prices go down rather than up so nobody wants to buy it.  In five years' time he still has not sold it because the prices have not gone up.  There is an element of gambling and waiting.  That is all I am saying.

It is this \"impression\" I would like to focus on.  In response to questions on this particular issue in the D&aacute;il, the impression was given that the public could be assured about the workings of NAMA on the basis that the Comptroller and Auditor General's office had a strong remit in that regard.  However, that remit was very different to the reality.  The purpose of this value for money exercise is to examine this particular project.  That impression was created by the Department and the Minister.  For example, we know when the Department became aware of the information in relation to Project Eagle, PIMCO and the fixer's fees.  After this was known by the Department, it was raised in the D&aacute;il.  I recall Deputy Mick Wallace being told that if he had concerns, he should raise them with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Ms Nolan or any of the other witnesses can correct me if I am wrong but given that the Department appears to have known that there was an issue about fixer's fees, do they think the Department's approach has done little in terms of building confidence in the oversight that it would have of even a strategic approach of NAMA?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111000002#KK01900","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":655,"content":"<p>It is very difficult to answer for people's impressions.

He has people embedded in NAMA but in an auditing capacity and not in terms of oversight of everything NAMA does because it would be improper of him to be acting as a shadow-director.  The board of NAMA is responsible for the actions of NAMA.

I will get to it, given that it follows logically from the next question.  Ms Nolan said:<\/p><blockquote>There is an underlying theme in the report that the alternative was to work out the loans until 2020.  If I were to look at it from a policy point of view, I did not think that was an option given the difficulties there were in terms of the NAMA bonds, the ECB and the pressure we were under to reduce the debt.  Just as we came out of the programme in January to March 2014, I do not think it was an option for us to decide not to sell a really large portfolio purely on the grounds that we might or might not get more money.  We had to set a value and decide whether it was value for money.  That is what NAMA did.<\/blockquote> <p>The Comptroller and Auditor General's report never said the assets should be kept until 2020.  The Comptroller and Auditor General never said the 10% discount rate was a mistake to be applied to the Project Eagle loan sale.  In the report, he argued that the 5.5% discount rate and the probable loss he talked about were to do with the change in sales strategy.  All the documents we have received so far from NAMA outlined that there was a strategy in place to work out the assets over time and they could have been sold in 2014, 2015, 2016 or 2017.  They could have been sold in different ways but the projection was to get back &euro;1.49 billion.  There was a change in strategy from a loan sale to an asset sale.

It was sent by Mr. Martin Whelan of NAMA to Mr. Declan Reid and the NAMA communications team.  The note was displayed on the screen this morning.  This overview of NAMA's Northern Ireland portfolio states &quot;70% of the Northern Ireland portfolio is completed property and is income producing&quot;, that &quot;NAMA has approved &pound;140 million in new money advances&quot; and that: <\/p><blockquote>In a small number of cases NAMA has had to enforce in [the North].

I am sure the Chairman can see that it is much more useful if matters are sorted out between the parties before they gets to the committee.

Unfortunately, I was detained at the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach for part of the meeting and hope I am not repeating anything.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, the discount rate is one issue about which we have had a significant argument.  In terms of the process, the way board meetings were dealt with, how decisions were recorded and the backup given, the discount rate NAMA was recommending to the board as late as June 2013 was lower than 5.5% at 2.5%, in other words, a greater discount rate essentially involved an increased risk to the taxpayer.  I note the narrow focus of Lazard in advising on strategy at the time in the first major sale.  If one looks at Project Arrow and other projects, it has been noted that various asset packages were looked at rather than lump everything together.  How does the Department deal with these issues?  Does it look at them in its section 227 report?  How does the Minister deal with them if he sees sufficient evidence?  In each step along the way it looks as if there were inadequate board minutes.  Even NAMA has accepted that there are aspects it would change in terms of backup if it had to engage in this process again.  That is our problem.  Looking at a lot of the audit evidence, I am sure the Comptroller and Auditor General would say - I am not speaking for him - it was deficient in many areas and that it was difficult to understand.

Good morning, on behalf of my colleagues, I am grateful to the committee for the opportunity to discuss the funding of higher education.  We welcome the report of the expert group on the Future Funding of Higher Education and endorse its findings.  We would also like to record our thanks to Peter Cassells, the members of the group and its secretariat, both for the report itself and also the extensive process of research, evidence gathering and consultation which has been distilled into the final text.<\/p> <p>  The run-up to the budget and the recent private members motion debate in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann demonstrate a broad acknowledgement of the difficulties caused by almost a decade of cutbacks in higher education funding.  In our submission to the committee we set out the scale of those cutbacks and identify their impact on the core grant, the unit of resource per student and on student-staff ratios.  Our findings mirror those of the Cassells&rsquo; report.<\/p> <p>  Falling resources do not by themselves justify increased investment.  Any such investment must have a purpose and a benefit.  The Cassells' report clearly articulates the benefits of such investment across the headings of economic growth and prosperity, social development, culture and civic engagement.  The expert group reflects a deep understanding of the complex world which our graduates face now and into the future and the importance of educational quality to the social and economic progress of our nation.<\/p> <p>  Against this backdrop, we have three main challenges.  First, the more complex and changing world for which we are educating students, requires more sophisticated educational approaches.  The group captures this well in identifying the need to invest in improved student staff ratios, smaller tutorial groups, more one-to-one contact with students, more project work, enhanced feedback and more time to engage in diverse learning styles and to support at-risk students.  The group also highlights the need for investment in support services such as library and information services, student guidance and counselling &ndash; and the necessary capital funding to support all of this.  We strongly endorse this view of a quality education which enhances student outcomes and life chances. <\/p> <p>  The second challenge relates to demographics and access.  Since the 1960s, Ireland has made significant progress in the democratisation and widening of our education system.  This is reflected in the growth in participation levels, expanded post-graduate education and continuing professional development, and the internationalisation of our student and staff populations.  We detail these in our submission.  Catering for an almost 30% increase in new entrants by 2030 and making further inroads into tackling disadvantage in its various forms requires significant investment.  The Cassells group quantifies this.  To address demographics and move to a student to staff ratio of 14:1, the report estimates a need for an additional &euro;600 million per annum by 2021 and &euro;1 billion per annum by 2030.  A further spend of an additional &euro;100 million per annum is recommended for access measures.  Third, we have a capital investment challenge, scaled at &euro;5.5 billion over 15 years. <\/p> <p>  In terms of solutions, the Cassells group identifies three main contributors to higher education: the State, students and employers.  This is based on the view that all three groups benefit from higher education.<\/p><p>The State benefits because there are wide ranging returns to society from a well educated population.  Students benefit because in the aggregate substantial earnings premiums accrue to those with higher levels of education.  Finally, employers benefit since advanced human capital is a key driver of innovation and productivity.  In putting forward its funding options, the report concluded that each of the beneficiaries should also contribute.  We agree with the conclusion.  We see a mixed funding system involving the Exchequer, students and employers as the best way to deliver a high quality, sustainable higher education system. <br\/><br\/>In looking at the options put forward by the group, it is worth saying that we already have a mixed funding system in place.  The State pays through the combined core grant and grant in lieu of fees mechanism and students pay via the student contribution.  Employers pay via the national training fund levy, albeit that only a tiny proportion of this finds its way into higher education.<br\/><br\/>The difficulty that Ireland faces is that the quantum of funding delivered through these mechanisms is not proving sufficient to deliver a system that meets the quality standards that students deserve and society needs for well-being and competitiveness in the long run.  This, in essence, is the conclusion of the expert group.<br\/><br\/>There are important choices to be made to deliver the investment recommended in the Cassells report.  These are political and societal choices.  We would like to offer some observations that bear on those choices.<b><\/b>First, public funding must continue to be a foundation for higher education, especially in a society that values high participation rates.  Historically, Exchequer funding has not followed student growth.  Between 2008 and 2015 student numbers rose by 20% but the unit of resource per student fell by 21%.  A combination of rising student numbers and falling resources per student is particularly toxic.  Ireland is at the bottom of the league in the OECD in this regard. <br\/><br\/>To begin to make meaningful inroads to solve the problem our budget 2017 submission called for an immediate injection of &euro;75 million in recurrent funding for universities and &euro;30 million in capital.  The eventual outcome was a total package of &euro;36.5 million recurrent funding for higher education overall.  Only a small proportion of this money is to address growth in student numbers.  The funding will make no inroads into improving student-staff ratios or rebuilding quality.<br\/><br\/>It appears that no allocation whatsoever has been made for an injection of capital funding.  Unfortunately, this seems to reinforce historical experience in respect of the very real difficulty in moving towards a sustainable funding model based solely on public investment.Nevertheless, it represents an improvement over years of cutbacks.  The promised three-year package of &euro;160 million is a step in the right direction but it is far from the &euro;600 million investment called for in the Cassells report.<br\/><br\/>On the matter of employer contributions, the national training fund was instigated in 2000 to support training in and for employment.  It must be said that higher education is demonstrably a successful form of preparation for employment.  Three issues arise in the context of the use of this fund for higher education.  First, there is a need for greater transparency as to where the money in the fund is currently expended, particularly in regard to the &quot;for employment&quot; component. <br\/><br\/>Second, the fund is heavily in surplus and the surplus is growing.  The 2017 Abridged Book of Estimates projects a surplus of &euro;272 million at the end of 2017.  At a time when wages and employment in the economy are growing and adding to this surplus, we seriously question why the surplus is not being applied to the crisis in higher education funding.  This matter should be addressed immediately, particularly in light of the outcome of the Estimates.<br\/><br\/>Finally, we can understand that employers may baulk against an increase in the rate of the levy.  However, it needs to be seen in the context of the overall corporate taxation regime, and other reliefs and incentives available to business.  The Cassells group has projected a yield of &euro;50 million that represents a 0.1% increase in the levy.  The sum is significant in the context of the difficulties facing the sector.<br\/><br\/>I will now turn to the student contribution.  We should acknowledge that the current student charge at &euro;3,000 per annum is substantial. If these funds did not exist, not just quality, but the viability of the system would be put at risk.  One important aspect of having a student contribution is that it ensures a level of financial stability when student numbers are rising, since each additional student brings additional resources into the system.  Given the Cassells group's projections for increased student numbers, this factor is critical. <br\/><br\/>In terms of the mix of funding, precisely who should pay what across the spectrum of State, students and employers is essentially a societal and political choice.  We want to state upfront that we endorse the Cassells group's view that a system where very high levels of fees, such as those in the UK or the US, is unacceptable whether paid upfront or under an income contingent loans system.  It runs counter to the principles articulated in chapter four of the report, particularly that of fairness and balance.  Regardless of the level of the charge, there are arguments in favour of deferred payment.  It avoids pressures on families to pay upfront at a time when family incomes are under a variety of pressures in the wake of the economic crisis.  In some cases, this involves borrowing at commercial rates with the requirement for immediate repayment.  These conditions are more onerous than those envisaged for an income contingent loans scheme. <br\/><br\/>In terms of the resourcing challenge that faces the sector, the burden spreading that a loans system allows does, at a practical level, make some increase in the student contribution component more feasible.  Such increase needs to be seen in the context of the returns from investing in higher education.  The OECD has calculated that the private returns to an individual from higher education in this country are the highest among the member countries surveyed and by a substantial margin. <br\/><br\/>The group's assessment of likely repayment scenarios involving loans of &euro;16,000 and &euro;20,000, respectively, suggest to us that an affordable system can be constructed and that progressivity can be built into such a system.  We would also like to mention that the current system whereby the State pays the student charge for a large cohort of students is not without opportunistic cost since this absorbs resources that could otherwise be channelled into the system to improve both maintenance grants and pastoral and other supports for access students. <br\/><br\/>We agree with the Cassells report that increased contributions to higher education should be accounted for transparently in terms of where the resources are going and what the spending will achieve.  There have been significant improvements in this regard under the national strategy for higher education.  The HEA system performance report and strategic dialogue process, and employer and student feedback surveys, are a very solid platform to build on in this regard. <br\/><br\/>In conclusion, we reiterate our endorsement of the Cassells report.  We support the committee in its important work of debating and making recommendations on measures needed to build a higher education system that supports our shared ambitions for an educated, prosperous and progressive society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Don Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":986,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Barry.  He certainly made an excellent case and did a good job in outlining the challenges the university sector faces, of which we are all very conscious.  The other presidents will have an opportunity to respond to some of the points that were made and to questions from committee members.<\/p> <p>  Increasing access to university for socially disadvantaged groups has to continue to be a priority from the point of view of funding.  Would Professor Barry accept that the introduction of student loans could act as a deterrent to these particular students?  Low-income families may be very apprehensive about their children taking out significant loans and about the potential impact later in their lives.  Professor Barry is right to say that capital investment has been seriously depleted since 2008 and this is a huge challenge for all universities.  He referred to universities having capital investment challenges which had been scaled at &euro;5.5 billion over 15 years.  Can he expand on that and outline the key proposed areas for investment, as well as the anticipated outputs for such investment?<\/p> <p>  The professor also spoke of the internationalisation of education, the cultural and geopolitical benefits and how it is an important source of income.  How does the teaching of English as a foreign language come into play and what is the possible impact of Brexit on the international dimension?  I understand that some 20,000 students went to England on the ERASMUS programme.  Is it possible that those students could come to our universities?  What are the challenges that would give rise to?<\/p> <p>  Professor Barry mentioned the surplus in the training and levy fund and suggested that it could be used in higher education.  This committee has a remit over training and skills and if we were to recommend that this surplus went to higher education it would mean less would go to further education and to training and skills.  Is there a way both sectors could develop joint schemes or joint proposals in this area?  Does the professor have any strategy for providing online courses for the purposes of lifelong learning?  These exist to a greater extent in other sectors.  A group from the institutes of further education will be before us next and they have given us current figures for mature students, student-academic staff ratios and core staffing levels.  It would be interesting to see the figures from the universities sector.<\/p> <p>  The professor mentioned other supports such as student accommodation which, although we are not addressing it here, is a huge crisis.  On-campus student accommodation is key as it ensures students are not competing with other demands on the housing market.<\/p> <p>  A key point for this committee is building public support for the argument because education is in a competitive world and there is an onus on us to look after primary level education and second level education as well.  Building public support for one's argument is vitally important.  I was at Tom Boland's lecture last night, as I am sure many here were, and he made interesting points around balancing autonomy and accountability in the third level sector.  This will be hugely important as we go forward because in the past there has been a mismatch between those two things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#E00100","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":987,"content":"<p>It is great to have so many senior educationalists in the room, telling us and the watching public about the situation they face in the universities.

What are the links between public funding and non-EU funding?  Is there any effect on standards and on reputation?  The action plan on education, which was published just before the budget, has very little mention of this issue.  Has the association, or have any individual witnesses, made any submissions on this?  We put considerable political pressure on the Government to have some sort of a plan for third level when we saw it was not part of the action plan.  Then all of a sudden, a &euro;160 million plan was announced.  We are happy that an extra &euro;160 million has been promised, although we would like it to be a hell of a lot more as the students and teachers need more.

Is that based on a lack of faith in the State to provide?  I assume the universities would not reject the payment if it came from the State so is it in the absence of a belief that the State will provide a sustainable, publicly-funded system?  Do the witnesses see the income-contingent loan as a quicker source of funding for universities?<\/p> <p>  My next question is on learning for learning's sake.  In the UK mature and part-time studying has almost been wiped out, especially in the humanities sector.  What do the presidents feel would be the impact of income-contingent and higher fees on arts and humanities, and on other smaller departments within colleges?  In the US, arts and humanities do relatively well but the proportion of students going into those subjects is much higher and we start from a different baseline.<\/p> <p>  There are concerns about universities bringing in a student levy.  I believe this will have a massive impact, especially on those middle earners who just miss out on a SUSI grant.<\/p><p>Are universities considering any drastic measures in the meantime while we are waiting on the very slow process of the Cassells report to kick in?<\/p><p> Following the election of Donald Trump in America, the proposal to lower the corporation tax to 15% will have an impact on the education sector in terms of foreign direct investment.

Have the witnesses given any thought to that?<\/p><p> I have a question on Horizon 2020 funding which ties into the lack of capital funding for universities in that we are not in a position to benefit from any move from the UK to Ireland regarding research and development.

I will select a few that I feel comfortable addressing.<\/p> <p>  Senator Ruane asked why we were advocating for an income-contingent loan.  The primary reason for doing so is that we see higher education as providing a clear public gain and a clear private gain.  We feel that the public gain should be funded by general taxation and the private gain should be funded by those who accrue the private gain.  One of the defining characteristics of an income-contingent loan, which makes it quite different from what we normally understand as a loan, is that one does not pay until one is earning enough money to make it feasible to pay.<\/p> <p>  This also relates in some sense to the question the Chairman asked about access.  Nobody in this country could be content with the current situation with access to higher education from certain sectors of society, which are often described as disadvantaged.  Whatever we are doing at the moment is not getting the country anywhere close to where we should aspire to be.  This is a very serious matter for the committee to consider.  The committee might want to reflect on what we are proposing and the Cassells report is also proposing, which is to try to identify why people from disadvantaged sectors of society do not attend in greater numbers.  We consider that one of the reasons is that maintenance costs that apply to students attending universities are very high, as is the opportunity cost in terms of their chance to take a job that does not require higher education, but provides an immediate injection of funding into their family circumstances, which often can be quite strained.<\/p> <p>  The redistribution of funding that we are considering would mean there would be much larger and more targeted maintenance grants to people who really need them.  We need a proper description of the income-contingent loan and a clear understanding that it is not like taking out a loan to buy a car.  Those taking out the loan only pay it back when their income exceeds a certain amount.  If a person's engagement with higher education does not lead that individual to achieving the private gain, then they do not pay anything.  Basically poor people will not be paying student debt.  There is limited evidence, but the evidence from the income-contingent loan system recently introduced in the UK, for much larger fees than anything we think should be countenanced here in Ireland, and in Australia, which has been running for a considerably longer period of time, is that it has no effect or improves the number of applications form disadvantaged students.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if the meeting is just us answering all these questions now or whether there is a conversational style.  We answer the questions.  I ask Mr. Costello to say something about the action plan for education and the national training fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Don Barry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":992,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Thomas Byrne, we made an extensive submission as part of the process of consultation that the Department and the Minister engaged in.  The funding component of it was not reflected in the action plan.  The Department and the Minister seemed to take a thematic approach and this was the basis of the structure of the plan.  Even though it is not sectoral, we were surprised at the degree to which higher education does not feature as a central part of the action plan.  In addition there does not seem to be an acknowledgement that there is a structural funding problem in higher education.  It is well recognised in the Cassells report that with the kind of student-staff ratio we have at the moment and with the reduction in expenditure we have had, it is not possible to deliver the kind of quality education we need.<\/p> <p>  I wish to respond to Senator Ruane's comment on the corporation tax rate and recent developments in the US.  This shows more than ever how reliant we are on the quality of our education system and more importantly the quality of our graduates.  They are our key competitive advantage.  There are proposals in the US which, if implemented, would put us in a significantly difficult position with respect to tax competition.  That is a bit of a wake-up call and shines a spotlight on the quality issue.<\/p> <p>  On the national training fund, we are saying that it is not a zero-sum game because the fund currently extensively supports the training in and for employment.  We mentioned the transparency piece.  Most of the \"for employment\" piece goes to SOLAS, but it is never fully clear.  We never get a breakdown and we do not know where it is going.  More importantly as the economy has recovered, employment has improved and wage levels have risen, the fund has gone into progressively greater surplus.  There will be a projected &euro;272 million surplus by the end of the coming year.  That money could be deployed at no opportunity cost to the training system.  It is money that is available.  Everything that the current fund funds could still be funded.  That is separate from the issue raised in the Cassells report about increasing the levy.  Obviously every 0.1 percentage point increase could bring in an additional &euro;50 million.  We are saying that there is the guts of &euro;300 million resting in that account and we should acknowledge that it is a factor in the general Government balance.  In the context of the &euro;36.5 million in the Estimates, surely there is an opportunity to do something there.<\/p><p>I can come back on Erasmus later if colleagues does not deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":994,"content":"<p>This proposal comes from the Australian system and I taught in that system at the time it went from a fully free system to an income contingent loan scheme, which was not called a loan scheme.  It was called the higher education contribution scheme but it is effectively the scheme that the Cassells group looked at.  At the time, income contingent loans did not impact on the people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds accessing university and it had a positive impact on retention rates.  When the system was completely free, many people did not fully consider whether they were suited to a university course or the benefits of undertaking the course; they drifted into university.  The fact that when the scheme was introduced, they saw they would accumulate a debt to the state that would be paid off at a later time made them focus on whether they wanted to be in university, and if so, what programme they wanted to be in.  We saw at that time a dramatic decrease in the dropout rates and, therefore, an improvement in retention rates.  That supports the argument that there needs to be a contribution from each component that benefits from higher education - the student, the State and employers.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the rankings.  This is a significant problem for us.  The underfunding of the higher education system which has led to higher student-staff ratios relative to competitors impacts directly on the rankings because that metric is used.  It also impacts indirectly because it is an indication of the workloads of our faculties.  This means that the time for research, and research performance, is also impacted.  In The Times Higher Education World University Rankings, we have no university in the top 200.  While we are supportive of the action plan for education and the ambition to have the education system at the top in Europe, of the top 200 universities in the rankings, 97 are European and, therefore, we have a significant distance to go and significant investment is required.  Those rankings are important from a student recruitment point of view but also from the point of view of recruiting faculty from around the world.  The first thing any student in an international market looks at is the rankings.  They are interested in English-speaking countries, which is a huge advantage for us but once they look to these countries, they will look at the university rankings.

Looking at the system from far away, rankings are important in gaining an impression of the quality of the universities in Ireland.  They have a gigantic effect on our engagement with the outside world in terms of recruiting staff and international students and on our capacity to build partnerships with universities in other countries such as China.  It is tremendously important in that regard.  None of our universities are entirely led by doing what makes the rankings scores higher at the expense of the tens of thousands of undergraduate students on our campuses and we should not do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Don Barry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":997,"content":"<p>There are many questions and being a student by nature, I want to answer all the questions and get all the answers right but I will confine myself to the central question of why we are here.  What concerns us is student success and the widest possible participation in that success.  The nub of the issue is what funding model will ensure inclusive success and that the greatest number of students benefit from and are successful in higher education.  That involves making students understand that college or university or an institute of technology is for them and that they feel there is a place for them within the higher education system.  That involves institutions getting out into communities and working with schools to raise awareness and understanding of third level education in those communities, which is resource-intensive.  When resources are constrained, one has to pull back and concentrate on teaching and research.  That outreach to draw students into third level suffers.<\/p> <p>  The second issue that arises is how one pays for the education of the greatest number of students.  Senator Ruane asked a pertinent question.  Why does the State not pay?  Would we reject an offer from the State to pay for all students?  We would be foolish to reject such an offer.  There was a detailed question about whether that is fair and progressive.  Members have the Cassells report.  I can confidently state that is the best ever assessment of higher education options done internationally.  The State is enormously fortunate to have a report which draws on all the international experience, and evaluates it holistically and carefully.  The report clearly states there are issues of equity around a system where the State pays for everybody.  The issues of equity are straightforward.  General taxation is levied on all citizens for a benefit that only apples to some citizens, which is a concern.  The second issue is that some citizens do well out of higher education and the report clearly argues that it is a fairer system for those who benefit greatly and earn significant amounts to pay back the cost of their education.  Third, once students access higher education, if resources are constrained, vulnerable students suffer the most.  If we consider widening participation as an issue, it highlights that we have to invest generally in education in order that we can do the outreach and support all our students, including those who find it easy to get through university and those who find it more difficult.  When resources are constrained, those two things suffer.<\/p> <p>  We also have to be careful about what is the optimum model for funding the higher education of those students.  There is a strong set of indications in the report based on international evidence that an income contingent loan system may well be the fairest way of funding the student part of that, along with increased investment by the State and by employers.  We could elaborate on that later.<\/p> <p>  We have to be careful about the lessons we learn from other systems and that is why I draw attention to the report.  It is subtle in its analysis of what is going on abroad.  If Ireland is compared with the UK, there are two different propositions.  There was an ideologically-driven withdrawal of the state from education in the UK, particularly from humanities education, but that is not proposed here.  It is proposed that the State and the graduate, who in partnership with the State will pay it back when he or she graduates, will fund it together.  Some of the negative impacts in the UK, which are much less in Australia, are not proposed in the report.  A different system is proposed.  If the higher fees and withdrawal of the state in the UK are taken out, the UK and Australian experience is that over time, income contingent loans enhance participation.<\/p><p>I understand the fear and concern about debt aversion but the international evidence is that when we shift from students paying up-front to students paying their contribution when they graduate, participation increases over time.  In our view, it is a fair system.  It is arguable but the evidence clearly presented here suggests that that option is a fairer approach overall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":999,"content":"<p>Professor Nolan certainly makes a compelling argument.

First, our submission is that the student is at the centre of what we are trying to achieve here.  That has to be stated.  It is about the quality of the learning experience for our students and transforming their futures.<\/p> <p>  In terms of widening participation, and building on what Professor Nolan has just said, we have to recognise that while it was well-intentioned, the free fees scheme has not widened participation and effectively has turned out to be a subvention for the middle classes.  We are suggesting that there is a huge opportunity not only to address the sustainability of the system itself but to significantly enhance the attractiveness for those from socially disadvantaged backgrounds to go into education.  We have direct experience of that.  We have over 1,300 students on our campus who would not be at university were it not for direct interventions but it cost significant philanthropic funds to make that happen.  This could be done much more effectively through the system we are proposing.<\/p> <p>  Second, in terms of foreign direct investment, FDI, raised by Senator Ruane, the selling message of IDA Ireland, which has been very successful, is around the three \"Ts\", namely, talent, taxation and track record but the indications in recent days is that we could lose one of those \"Ts\", which will put a huge emphasis on the talent.  There could be reputational damage in terms of an under-funded system, and we believe we have been teetering on the brink of quality disimprovement for quite a number of years.  This is an opportunity to get that right, but the stakes are much higher now.<\/p> <p>  My final point is one raised by the Chairman, namely, Brexit.  No one quite knows what the opportunities are or what will happen but, anecdotally, in terms of talking to leading academics, researchers and international students who may come here, the absorptive capacity is a key issue.  The Chairman asked what the money would be spent on.  It is about additional and bigger lecture theatres, more laboratories, student accommodation and all those issues.  It is a key issue for international students in particular.  We had a major international student recruiting organisation in with us yesterday and they said it is happening in the United States as well.  If we think of the profile of international students, many of those will be much less likely to want to go to the US.  We now have a potential double whammy in terms of Brexit and what is happening in the US, which might be advantageous to the system in terms of international students, but the absorptive capacity will be a key issue.  Capital investment will be required quickly in order to avail of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Brian MacCraith"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1001,"content":"<p>Did Dr. Browne want to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#H00400","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>I want to make a brief comment.  To go back to the issue of rankings, a third issue with rankings, and I fully support the comments made by my colleagues, Professor Deeks and Professor Barry, is the impact on FDI.  We should be clear about that.  International companies watch those rankings and they are clear that they wish to have access to the graduates of universities that are rated internationally.  To give a recent simple example from Galway, the very first investment by an Indian FDI medical technology company in Galway was driven by its recognition of activity in the university in a centre called C&Uacute;RAM, which is funded by Science Foundation Ireland.  Its first contact with and knowledge of Ireland was through work that was reported from that C&Uacute;RAM centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. James Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1003,"content":"<p>What is the name?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#H00600","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1004,"content":"<p>C&Uacute;RAM.  It is a medical technology centre funded by Science Foundation Ireland.  That company's first contact with Ireland was awareness of the work going on in that centre and out of that has come investment into Galway in the form of a new company from India.  I am aware also, from contacts with the major international companies such as SAP, IBM and Fidelity, all of which are in Galway, that their investment in Galway is driven to a great extent by access to talent and the university's reputation and its position in the rankings is important in that context.  I would not underestimate the importance of rankings, not just for recruiting students and staff but also in terms of attracting and maintaining FDI here.<\/p> <p>  I will make two other brief comments.  Deputy Byrne asked specifically about the issue of grants at third level for postgraduate students.  There is no doubt that the decision some years ago to stop those grants had an immediate impact on participation by students in taught postgraduate programmes.  That was clear in the system.  There was an immediate drop in the numbers attending third level postgraduate taught programmes, and that has only recovered in recent years.  There is evidence that that decision impacted on participation by students in postgraduate taught programmes.  I would certainly welcome the return of support for those students into the future.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about residences.  Residences are very important.  All of us are trying to increase the number of student residences available to us.  Our university has recently committed to building 900 student accommodation units.  We have sought funding for those and we will acquire that from the European Investment Bank.  It is a difficult investment, and I believe the State should take a more active part in supporting student residences.  It is clear that, in a general sense, the private sector is not interested in making major investments in that space.  It needs some level of support from the State, and it is unfortunate that has not happened.  I believe all of us are up for making those investments provided there is some support from the State to help us make them pay for themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. James Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1005,"content":"<p>I call Dr. Prendergast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#H00800","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1006,"content":"<p>One of the rankings that is interesting, although it is not actually a ranking, is an OECD report that clearly states that we are in the bottom of the league when it comes to funding per student into higher education.  It is welcome that the Cassells report has laid out ways that higher education can be funded as a mixture, as Professor Barry has said, of public and private funding to increase the funding into higher education.  We have a lot of young people.  Approximately 25% more young people will be coming into higher education by 2028.  We need to invest in our higher education system if they are to have the quality education and the qualifications to get the jobs that are created by foreign direct investment.  It is as if we have the young people on one side, the FDI on the other and in the middle are the universities.  It is the universities that can transform the young people into those who can get jobs in the industry.  In an under-funded system we will not generate the young people with the talent to get those jobs.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the point that both Brexit and the results of the election in the United States have put the emphasis very much back on talent and the importance of Ireland investing in our higher education system, which generates the talent that can compete with the best in the world.<\/p> <p>  We also need to have capital funding into our system to create the capacity to educate these greater numbers of young people.  That cannot be done overnight.  It takes five to ten years to build it.  That is why we need to begin to invest now to create the capability to deliver that high quality education for our young people.  Of all the questions asked, that is the issue I would most like to emphasise.  It is important that we act now and not kick the can down the road.  I hope the emphasis we are putting on the Cassells report in this committee shows that it is beyond time for us to begin thinking about how to implement some of the options put forward in the Cassells report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Prendergast"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>I want to briefly touch on a point Senator Ruane made about the importance of the humanities.  Many of the arguments members will hear are important economic arguments relating to the relationship between third level education and our economic development, but the broader point is about the importance of universities to society and the impact on society as a whole of a diminished university in the context of our current funding crisis.  That is something we need to bear in mind, and it was also recognised by Mr. Peter Cassells in regard to the contributions higher education makes.<\/p> <p>  The issue of engagement and access to the humanities is critically important.  It is not just about the importance of increased sustainable funding to the humanities into the future but recognising the risks currently posed to the humanities from that lack of investment.  We already have a disadvantaged humanities sector because of the lack of sustained investment.  Particular areas in faculty terms are less amenable to income generation where those challenges are most acute.  We see an increased burden on the student in our open days in that the focus of parents is on those areas where it is considered students are more likely to have viable and progressive employment.<\/p><p>This plays in to the suspicion, as it were, that a humanities qualification is less worthy in those terms.  However, sustainable funding is critical for humanities in particular.  That is something we need to bear in mind as an opportunity.<\/p><p> A point was made about the impact of reduced grants on postgraduate education.  Certainly, I agree that it has had a considerable impact on the important sector of taught postgraduates.  However, more generally, in the past decade or so we have seen a substantial level of hidden subvention of students in our system.  This relates to those students who want to study abroad, for example, but who do not have the personal means.  They are increasingly supported by us to do this.  There is a major hidden issue at this level.  It is particularly an issue when it comes to study abroad.  This is a vital part of what we do in the internationalisation, growth and development of our students.  That is another factor to bear in mind.  There are many hidden areas where we cannot visibly see the impact of the funding situation on students and on the university as it uses its resources to subvent and support students and their development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Ursula Kilkelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>We will go back to members now.

I wish to acknowledge the extraordinary contribution the university heads have made to the social and economic fibre of the country to date.  That is without question and it has to be acknowledged.  It would be remiss of us not to compliment those involved in the Cassells report on their work.  They have set out the position and what lies ahead in a stark and scary fashion.  Moreover, they have set out what we must do if we are to ensure the country keeps going socially and economically.<\/p> <p>  One key word that affects all of us is access.  Access is a concern for all of us.  I have spoken to people from all sides of the argument and I am trying to reach a conclusion, although I am struggling at the moment.  I have discussed the question with people from households in which incomes would be classified as low.  They have concerns when it comes to their children going to college.  They maintain they are simply unable to afford it, as things stand.  The question of fees is one issue, but affording and even locating accommodation, especially in this city, is a major challenge for children and families outside the capital as well.<\/p> <p>  I am a parent with two children in college.  I know it is difficult.  The cost puts relatively young families under considerable financial pressure at a time when there are other pressures affecting them as well, including mortgage repayments and so on.  A lady from Letterkenny contacted me on this issue.  Thankfully, her family was in a comfortable financial position.  At the same time she said she would welcome it if a loan system was in place for her specific circumstances.  All the disposable income the family had was going on ensuring that the children could go to college and pay for accommodation, pocket money and so on.  She made the point that the local and general economy was losing out in many ways, because rather than spending money on the high street or the main street, all the available funding was going to ensure the children would go to college.  I imagine many families throughout the country are in the same boat.<\/p> <p>  This is a difficult question.  Professor Prendergast mentioned the old adage of the can being kicked down the road.  We have got to the stage on this issue where we have run out of road and we cannot kick the can anymore because there is no road.  We are at a crossroads.  If we are serious about the future of our young people, and the country in general, then we must grasp this nettle.  The people who occupy the Houses and the people in this committee have a major responsibility in this regard.  Ultimately, it will be a decision for the Government of the day.  I have specific questions on the contribution from employers.  Is there any fear on the part of the university heads that we could have a situation whereby employers could increase their contribution and then look for more influence over the courses they would like to see the universities take on?  What effect would that have on the university system overall?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to Brexit and the associated potential opportunities that might lie ahead for us in the university sector.  We discussed the position of United Kingdom and how the UK sector might lose out.  I have listened to various people on this subject.  They believe there is potential that we could tap in to.  What are we doing in this regard?  Are the university heads hopeful that this is an area from which we might be able to get an income stream?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the drop-out rate.  This is concerning.  Earlier, we discussed families trying to finance children going to college.  Let us suppose that after first year, Mary or John decide they have made the wrong decision and gone to the wrong course.  What can we do to try to limit that, where possible?  Is part of the reason for increased drop-out rates related to the change in career guidance provision at second level?  Are we now feeling the effects of that negative decision made some years ago?  What else could we do to minimise that potential?  A child doing the leaving certificate is under pressure - I imagine all the university heads appreciate that - and is trying to make a decision about rest of his life.  It is difficult to make that decision at that time and perhaps more help is needed.  I am keen to hear the thoughts of the university heads in that regard.<\/p> <p>  What further potential exists in the university sector, if any, for funding to be sourced from other streams?  Is there any potential?  Are there any associated side effects?  I have complimented the university heads on their roles to date.  Are there any areas where the universities believe they could improve things in the event of further funding coming towards them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#J00300","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>I welcome all the representative of the universities.  This is an exceptionally valuable opportunity for us as parliamentarians to be able to engage with them and gauge their opinion on how we should move forward.  The critical point is that we move forward and that there is no further prevarication or procrastination in respect of what is an exceptionally difficult challenge, and what is, equally, an exceptionally important opportunity for us to finally get the funding in our third level system right.<\/p> <p>  We have been discussing the issue of how third level education should be funded and the amount of that funding.  There is no obligation on any member of the deputation to answer my next question but what is their view of the autonomy they have, as university heads, in determining how money is spent within their institutions?  They are denied a certain degree of autonomy in how it is spent.  Do they believe this impacts directly on student outcomes?  If they had a greater degree of autonomy over how all university resources were spent, could the universities manage those resources better?  Does this challenge arise for the universities on a daily or weekly basis?  Is it something the Irish Universities Association has discussed in the past?<\/p> <p>  We may not agree with the mechanism used to derive the rankings.  We may believe they do not reflect the holistic nature of third level education.  However, Dr. Browne and others have outlined how important they are in terms of how we are perceived internationally.  I was fortunate to be able to travel with several members of the deputation to many destinations in Asia some years ago to market Ireland as a destination for international education.  In fact, our education system and the current high standards represent one of our greatest exports.  We earn almost &euro;1 billion per year from international education.  It is an exceptionally well-regarded system internationally, but it is becoming less so.  I recall speaking to one agent, as they are described, in India in 2012.  He said that if a university was outside the top 50, he would not consider it.  Increasingly, that is becoming a factor.  If we do not get this right, there is the potential to descend into a downward spiral where there is less and less investment in our system in terms of international education.  The perception that is positive at the moment, as described by Dr. Browne, could begin to become exceptionally tarnished.  That is something we need to be careful about.<\/p> <p>  Is there anything we could be doing now to improve rankings?  Is there something that would not require a significant investment, although might require some investment?  Are there some buttons we could press within the system now that would amount to beginning the journey back to a point where all our institutions are to be found in the upper echelons of the international rankings?<\/p><p> Professor Barry spoke about the national training fund.  This country has one of the highest third level participation rates in the world.  That is a good thing and is a fantastic story to be able to tell.  The numbers are increasing all of the time.  Ireland, as a society and demographically, is moving from a point where its further education and training system was viewed as an end in itself.  One simply reached the end of the system as a young student and stayed there.  One took whatever training and FET opportunities that were granted by the system and used them within the workplace.  Increasingly, the FET system is described as and perceived by parents, young people and people working in the FET system as a conduit to third level education.  That is a positive development.  I agree with Professor Barry that a mechanism must be found to allow some of the resources accumulated in the training fund to find their way into third level.  If that is the way students are going then resources should follow them.  That is my opinion on the matter.<\/p><p> Professor Deeks spoke about the Australian system.  It is fantastic for Mr. Cassells and his team to consider international models that have been employed as it affords an opportunity to see pitfalls and successes.  Australia has a loans system, as referred to by Professor Deeks.  Australia also has a banding system that reflects the cost per student of his or her education throughout the third level system.  In Ireland, it costs on average &euro;8,000 per annum to educate a third level student and a medical student costs &euro;30,000 per annum.  It is a fact that an arts graduate who undertakes a H.Dip. course and becomes a second level teacher has far less earning capacity than a cardiologist.  I have a question for Professor Deeks but he is not obliged to answer.  Does he believe that situation should be reflected in the design of the system?  If we move to a point where each individual contributes, should it reflect his or her future earning capacity?  More often than not future earnings are closely aligned with the cost of his or her education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#J00400","speaker":"1241","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his observations and questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#K00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1014,"content":"<p>I thank the group for coming here this morning.

Do they draw down funding early from the HEA?  Do they borrow funding from the HEA?  If so, how will the moneys be paid back?  The witnesses have said funding needs to be increased.  Would that funding be sucked into paying back the deficit before reaching crucial areas?  <\/p> <p>  Senator Gallagher mentioned the concerns about drop-out rates.  He asked whether the reduction in the number of guidance counsellors at second level was a factor in the increase in drop-out rates.

I wish to raise a couple of issues.  Yesterday a report was released on teacher participation rates by people from various social groups and nationalities.  The issue is fundamental, particularly for students who come from a disadvantaged background because many of the students desire to become teachers.<\/p> <p>  I have a general question on the support available for a master's education as it is the structure that teaching is moving towards.  The length of the course, both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, is likely to be four years plus two years.  Have the witnesses given any thought to the implications of the changes in terms of income capacity and cost implications for students from middle class backgrounds?  Such parents might not have a lot of spare money to pay the fee for a master's course.  It might be helpful if the witnesses can indicate what the likely level of fees will be in terms of the two years it will take for a master's course in order to qualify in education?  <\/p> <p>  Information technology is another issue for teachers in schools.  I wish to refer to the preparedness of teachers to teach courses to students who wish to participate in the sector.<\/p> <p>  In respect of universities and all of the third level sector, we need a fresh focus on links between colleges, experience of what modern jobs are, and to know whether students may develop an interest in same.  Some colleges focus a lot on this aspect while others have less focus.  If terms of students from a disadvantaged background, very often there is a knowledge gap in their homes and communities about what many modern jobs are like.  To be honest, I do not think career guidance counselling is particularly well able to fill the gap or necessarily appropriate to fill the gap.  One needs to meet somebody who can say what a job is like because it may be a very new job, particularly if it is in STEM, IT or a similar area.  Having had an opportunity to become knowledgeable about such a job a student could then say: \"Well, I might like to do this job and I am well able to do so.\"  Other people could then encourage that person.  There is a knowledge gap.  Certainly, I have met students or graduates who at the start of the downturn in Ireland found themselves unexpectedly unemployed having, as they constantly say, done everything right.  They had a good leaving certificate and secured a good qualification from a university.  From my own experience of third level, many of them were extremely impressive people.  Thankfully there has been an improvement in employment rates and graduate recruitment is very strong in all of the colleges and universities.<\/p><p>If it is possible to reflect on that experience, it should happen.  That is particularly in respect of people coming from backgrounds where there might not be a lot of knowledge.  One of the big differences I see between private schools and State schools nowadays is that very often parents in private schools have an intensive programme through the parents' council of knowledge dissemination about jobs, opportunities and how to do it.  That is a stand out.  A lot of schools, including a lot of DEIS schools, are trying to develop such programmes but I wonder if the witnesses have thought about the university presence.  I have been involved in a lot of access programmes, many of which are good, but there is still a confidence thing missing that is not transmitted around people being able to pick up and do a particular course and then have a particular career.<\/p><p> The other thing I wanted to ask about was the whole issue of teaching support in third level.  We are moving to larger classes generally in many institutions and I do not have a problem with that.  However, I ask about the tutor support plus the support in terms of different forms of assessment whether by essay or examination.  The opportunity for students to write is important.  Where is that at the moment?  Overall, in terms of the move to more students doing postgraduate courses, how do the witnesses look at that from a financial point of view, in particular, within their institutions and from the perspective of students?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#K00500","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1018,"content":"<p>I am very conscious of the fact that everybody has had an opportunity to speak.

Would this create undue influence?  I would say \"absolutely not\".  We want interaction and engagement with industry.  It would be a positive thing that this levy would encourage and engage that interaction between universities and industry.  It would probably answer some of the questions Deputy Burton and others have asked about employability and whether we are developing courses that give young people what they need to get jobs in the modern economy.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Nolan raised the issue of access.  We are hitting our targets on access and are determined, among the universities, to increase participation.  All the universities here have their own specific schemes.  In Trinity, we have a Trinity access programme but that is just what we call it.  Others call it different things.  It is not just to encourage but to provide a modality for young people from backgrounds where the secondary education may not be as good to access university education.  That works very well and we want to continue working with that and partnering with Government to ensure it works.  Currently, philanthropy plays a large part in that, which is good, but we could have even more support from Government in achieving that.  I come back to the Donald Trump thing.  Many countries have not focused on this enough.  It is one of the problems they have.  In fact, we realised much earlier on that we need to focus on it and we have.  We need to redouble our efforts to ensure that all the talent of the country finds its way into our higher education institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#L01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Prendergast"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1027,"content":"<p>It is worth touching on a couple of point that were relevant to the issues Deputy Burton raised around the quality of the student experience.  I mean in particular the broad sense of that but also the learning experience of students.  It is relevant in particular to the skills context, but actually I come back from that a little bit to talk about the much more fundamental process of learning that has been deeply affected by our budgetary situation.  Obviously, current staff-student ratios mean we have much larger classes.  That is a given.  On top of that, however, we have considerably less individualised attention for students and less timely feedback.  We have less diverse forms of assessment because of the pressures that creates.  We have less time for important pastoral care for our students and less time for the mentoring that happens as part of the educational developmental process.  All these things are threatened by our current environment, notwithstanding the enormous efforts staff make every day to provide these to our students.<\/p> <p>  It is important to remember that a huge amount of innovation is happening around teaching and learning experiences in terms of the level of engagement of staff with teaching and learning formal and informal qualifications and experience and creating a really dynamic learning environment.  That is inevitably threatened by our infrastructure in terms of the quality of our classrooms and our labs, but also our libraries, getting students into those libraries and facilitating them through technology and the investment required at individual level to engage.  There is a huge range of things that are affected.  That also affects the individual capacity of students to engage and learn and be present in the classroom for the learning experience when they are under financial pressure themselves.  All that plays out.  They may be working part time and so on and have health and well-being issues.  There are long queues for counselling and support.  It is important that universities step up to that responsibility which is a huge thing that plays into the need for much more sustainable investment and funding in the universities generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#L01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Ursula Kilkelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>I want to make some very high level comments because I know we are coming to the end.  Professor Deeks might talk to us a little bit about the Australian experience.<\/p><p> I am very struck by Senator Gallagher's remarks.  One reality we must face is that there are many families in this country struggling to find multiples of &euro;3,000 for more than one student going through higher education.  Coming back to the Cassells report, if we move to a system where we balance those contributions more fairly between the State, the graduate and industry, we can design such a system well or badly.  The advantage we have with the Cassells report is all that learned experience about how not to do it and some very clear pointers about how to do it.  I am confident the implementation group recommended in this report could design a system that is progressive, fair, sustainable and which minimises the up-front burden on all the families of the State.  If it is a balanced system, the State would have more resources to direct towards focused areas such as students with disadvantages or students that need support through postgraduate studies.  There is an important element there about where the State directs its resources and its freedom to do so.<\/p><p> Senator Gallagher also mentioned we have run out of road on which to kick the can.  Not only have we run out of road but there is a 10 tonne truck behind us as by 2030 we must accommodate 48,000 additional students to keep participation rates as they are.  That is the equivalent of building University College Dublin and the Dublin Institute of Technology again.  When one asks where is the need for capital funding, that is an example.  Even if we allowed our participation rates to sink by 5% - it would be a shame to drop to 50% - we would still need to find 29,000 places.  I must emphasise the urgency of tackling this problem that the Senator appreciates, which I accept.<\/p><p> There are two final issues.  Members have been good enough to congratulate us on the work we have done.  Professor Kilkelly mentioned that we have a crisis and the only reason we are not feeling it more badly is the work done by line staff, faculty and administrative and support staff.  They are now stretched beyond the limit and I must make a case for the exhaustion of those public servants over the past ten years while delivering a standard of service that students get.  They are proud to deliver that and have gone the extra mile but we have run out of road there too in terms of the physical capacity of staff to deliver.<\/p><p> Deputy Cannon also made a point.  There are areas where universities could do with more autonomy in how they manage their affairs.  In particular, we recruit staff internationally and the norms of how staff are recruited and remunerated internationally are different from here.  With that autonomy we know we need enhanced accountability.  We have a very sophisticated form of accountability through the Higher Education Authority and it has changed enormously in recent years.  With simple reference to the report, which is available, I can say that 21% of our new entrants are socioeconomically disadvantaged, 8% are mature students, 6% have disabilities and 37% are in receipt of a grant of some kind.  The State has very clear and appropriate access to how the system and individual institutions are performing.  We would all be comfortable to see it strengthened, as it could be, but there are domains where autonomy could be enhanced to make the institutions more effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#L01200","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1030,"content":"<p>As part of the overall review process, does the autonomy question need to be addressed now?

I cannot remember exactly where the economy was at the time but my recollection is it was in a recovery mode after a recession, not unlike where we are now.  That is my recollection.  However, it was a good 30 years ago and my recollection may not be sound.  One of the elements underpinning the system was a very good grant and bursary system for people from lower socioeconomic groups, meaning they could afford to live on that grant and attend university.  That helped to ensure there was not an impact on that socioeconomic group.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Cannon pointed out, the Australian system went through a banding exercise and it determined two matters, namely, the cost of delivering each type of programme and the benefit to the students graduating from programmes.  A very structured matrix was used to work out how much of the cost would be borne by the state for the programme and how much would be taken up by the student.  The Australians are very careful to have systems that are seen to be fair and this was seen as such.  The issue is that over the 30 years since, the cost of delivery of the programmes has varied and the economic return for the people graduating from the programmes has similarly varied.  When the system was set up, it appeared to be perfectly fair but over the years, disparities quickly appeared.  That is probably why when our colleagues in the UK moved to a system, they went for a flat rate, and it is probably why the Cassells report has gone for the simpler flat-rate solution.<\/p> <p>  I emphasise that although the introduction of the system caused much concern when first mooted, particularly among the student body, when it rolled, out the concern dissipated.  There was no impact and in fact there was an increase in participation from lower socioeconomic groups.  As the system bedded in, it was felt throughout the country to be fair.  It also had these positive impacts on retention rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Andrew Deeks"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1039,"content":"<p>I am conscious that we are under time pressure.

The total income of the NTF for 2016 was &euro;395 million, with total expenditure at &euro;362 million.  Of that, the only component that goes anywhere close to higher education is the Springboard initiative, which accounted for &euro;27 million of that &euro;362 million in expenditure.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about whether we could do anything to improve the rankings without spending money immediately.  One significant characteristic of the rankings is that sentiment is a major factor, specifically reputational surveys.  If there was even a sense that we had a clear national direction towards sustainability of the system, it would improve sentiment and that would materially impact on the rankings.  Deputy Cannon mentioned autonomy and this goes back to how we are very constrained in how we manage our human resources within universities.  That also feeds into the rankings as there are employer and academic sentiment surveys.  When foreign academics see the strictures we are operating under relative to what they may experience in other systems, it also has an impact on sentiment.

We will add to the comments made about the work of Mr. Cassells and his group on their report.  THEA accepts without reservation the two fundamental and compelling conclusions of the Cassells report, namely, that higher education has made a positive contribution to Ireland's social and economic development in the past 40 years and that higher education is now threatened as a result of the deep financial cuts since 2008 and the demographic trends that would see a continuing and dramatic increase in enrolments.<\/p> <p>  The detailed analysis of the impact of the recession and funding cuts on higher education did not disaggregate and examine the impact at the subsectoral level.  Figure 1 on page 2 of our submission shows that total funding per student in institutes of technology fell steeply below that for universities and colleges in 2010 and has not recovered subsequently.  The total recurrent funding per student within the technological sector declined by 25% between 2008 and 2015 compared with 19% in universities and colleges.  Had funding been maintained at 2008 levels, income to the technological sector would have been &euro;232 million more than is the case today.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the profile and vision of institutes of technology, the institutes have carved out a distinctive, differentiated role within the overall higher education system.  We supply highly skilled graduates to a growing technological and general STEM-based sector in the Irish economy and account for 38% of all higher education graduates in the country, some 25,000 graduates in 2014-15.  We drive a research and innovation agenda that responds to the needs of regional development, indigenous SMEs and foreign direct investment.  This includes 823 collaborative research and consultancy agreements with industry, 573 companies supported in incubation centres and &euro;68.5 million generated in research income, including &euro;5 million in industry-funded research.  Further detail is contained on page 3 of our submission.<\/p> <p>  We play a critical role in enhancing higher education participation, with 27% of entrants coming from targeted socioeconomic groups, 18% of full-time entrants being mature students and 32% of admitted students holders of a further education and training qualification.  Within our sector, 56% of students are in receipt of a grant.<\/p> <p>  I will address the financial challenges.  Since the economic crisis of the late 2000s, funding for higher education has declined sharply.  For the institute of technology sector, between 2008 and 2015 the State grant fell by 35%, student numbers grew by 30%, core staffing levels fell by 12%, total recurrent income per student fell by 25%, total State income per student contracted by 50% as opposed to a 46% contraction across the higher education system as a whole, and our student-staff ratio increased by 33% from 12.9:1 to 17.1:1.<\/p> <p>  The impact of the decline in the State subvention to higher education, the increase in student numbers and the decline in staff numbers have been acutely felt in our sector because the options for generating income from non-State sources are limited.  One third of our STEM programmes are heavily reliant on capital investment in ICT infrastructure, engineering and laboratory outfitting.  Cuts have undermined the capacity of institutes to develop and sustain the additional supports that their student cohort might reasonably expect, especially at levels 6 and 7.<\/p> <p>  A significant number of institutes are now confronted with the perilous financial scenario revealed by the recent publication of the higher education financial review of the institute of technology sector.  The sector has moved from generating a surplus in 2008 to an overall deficit of &euro;2.7 million in 2014-15.  Overall reserves fell by 40% from &euro;132.5 million to &euro;78.7 million.  Six institutes of technology are facing immediate sustainability challenges, with four others potentially at risk.  Our buildings have become progressively degraded and, in some instances, our equipment has become obsolete after almost ten years of minimal investment.<\/p> <p>  The sector has responded well to the crisis by cutting staff and non-pay costs, pursuing innovative developments in areas such as part-time and online provision and the recruitment of international students.  Without substantial investment, though, the core purpose and viability of our sector are at risk.<\/p> <p>  As to funding scenarios, the national objective for higher education is to expand the school population, which means that there will always be a predominant reliance on State funding.  In response to the Cassells funding options, THEA is mindful of the national objective around economic development, social cohesion and equality of opportunity.  Great benefits accrue to society from universal participation in higher education, for example, employment opportunities, health and well being, reduced crime levels and enhanced opportunities across the generations.  In an era of mass participation in higher education, those who fail to gain access become the exception rather than the rule.  THEA holds that the Cassells report's funding option No. 3 does not align with these objectives and would prove a disincentive for the majority of students in the institute of technology sector, as it would involve the transfer of fees, which were heretofore carried by the State, onto this cohort.<\/p> <p>  In reflecting on options Nos. 1 and 2, THEA considers that it is an opportune moment to revisit the national ambition regarding educational attainment and that it may be timely to make a commitment to providing free undergraduate education to all who seek it.  This could be approached in a number of ways.  For example, higher education could be free at the point of entry and exit up to ordinary bachelor degree level, that is, level 7 on the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, standard.  No contribution charge would be levied on students registered on programmes leading to the higher certificate and ordinary bachelor degree awards.  If pursued, this would involve a net marginal cost to the State of &euro;45.7 million per annum.  However, a more ambitious approach would be to provide free higher education to all students on honours bachelor degree programmes to level 8.  This would involve an additional net marginal cost of &euro;197 million.<\/p><p> This submission draws attention to the acute financial challenges facing all of the higher education sector and the very particular and severe impact the cuts have had on institutes of technology.  The disproportionate impact on the institutes of technology means that their distinctive and unique contribution is threatened.  Regardless of which funding option is chosen there is a need for additional and urgent State investment and an analysis of the sub-sectoral impact of any such intervention.  With regard to the funding options identified in the Cassells report, THEA has proposed a variation of options one and two, in that the State and the employer contribution would be the funding source up to level 7, with no student contribution applying.  Regarding level 8 and higher, and bearing in mind the greater cost associated with these higher levels and THEA's acceptance of the position that private benefit accrues the further one progresses in higher education, a student contribution may be appropriate.<\/p><p> Options one and two in the report estimate that an additional &euro;1.26 billion and &euro;997 million will be required in State funding up to 2030.  THEA proposes that an option of front-loading this additional funding to provide free higher education up to ordinary bachelor level 7 be actively considered.  The respective contributions of the State, the student and the employer will be an important part of the policy decisions on the future funding of higher education.  THEA must conclude by reiterating the existential challenge which nearly a decade of cutbacks has now presented to the technological sector.  If not addressed in an urgent and comprehensive manner this challenge threatens the immediate and long-term future of our sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1047,"content":"<p>Thank you, Professor &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in.  I propose to take the questions from members together before referring back for responses from the individual witnesses.  If the witnesses wish to follow up on questions or comments afterwards, we will accept written submissions following the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I will start the ball rolling with questions on the presentation.  I commend the sector on having 27% of entrants from targeted socioeconomic groups, with 18% being mature students.  Interestingly, 32% were admitted having first obtained further education and training qualifications.  I would be interested to hear a little more about the sector's future plans to expand this access.<\/p> <p>  You spoke about the institutes assisting regional development and being engaged in collaborative research with industry.  Research income of &euro;68.5 million is generated and &euro;5 million is generated from industry-funded research.  Given the valuable role of the sector in providing research opportunities, the &euro;5 million appears to be a low contribution from industry.  Is there any way this figure could be increased?  What are your thoughts on that?<\/p> <p>  You also spoke about staffing.  Are there issues affecting the redeployment of staff in ITs and would this mean some staff are not fully utilised?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the 28 Horizon 2020 projects in receipt of &euro;9.6 million, which goes directly to the institutes, do you foresee Brexit having a negative impact on this funding or do you believe there could be more opportunities in that area due to Brexit?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the funding proposal you are suggesting, and I appreciate your clarity on that because we must have clarity, you propose that it should be free at the points of entry and exit up to levels 6 and 7 and that from level 8 the existing student contribution should remain.  There is merit and logic in that proposal.  However, it could potentially discriminate against high achieving students who come from low income families.  That could be a concern, in that perhaps they are not being rewarded for pushing the boat out in respect of their academic abilities.<\/p> <p>  Also on the future funding issue, what are your views on the impact of the impending legislation regarding the possibility of institutes becoming technological universities?  On a philosophical note, would that dilute much of the excellent work the institutes do in terms of the very practical vision they have and their contribution to regional development?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I have two questions which I put to the university presidents as well.  How do we build public support for funding for third level?  It has to compete, regardless of whether one likes it.  We would love to have a situation where there was far more money being put aside for education overall, but the reality is that third level funding is competing with funding for primary and secondary levels and, indeed, with funding for special education.  The weight of public opinion needs to be convinced about the merit of the State putting more money into third level funding.  Second, there is the debate about balancing autonomy and accountability, which is hugely important.<\/p> <p>  I will now hand over to the members.  I call Deputy Thomas Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#P00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>I thank the Technological Higher Education Association for the ongoing work it and the institutes do.  I also thank the witnesses for the work they have done for attending this meeting.  I am glad the association put forward its view on this issue.  It is very helpful and it probably moves the debate forward significantly.  Certainly, we will consider it.<\/p> <p>  I am interested to know the extent of the crisis.  Professor &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in possibly underplayed it slightly.  There have been serious reports on the financial sustainability of a number of the institutes.  Will he comment further on that?  A report was published only last week by the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  Quite frankly, it appears that a number of the institutes are in trouble.  What I would like Professor &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in to confirm, if that is the case, is that it really is a question of funding, and that money is the reason for the severe difficulties a number of the institutes have.<\/p> <p>  My next question is one I put earlier to the Irish Universities Association.  An action plan on education was published by the Government in the last two months.  There is precious little in it about the funding of the third level sector.  Did THEA make a submission?  Was it as surprised as I was?  Indeed, Mr. Costello of the Irish Universities Association also said he had been surprised at how little mention there was of the third level funding crisis in the action plan on education.  It is a crisis, and everybody believes it is a crisis.  To return to the option THEA has presented, one issue struck me immediately and the Chairman mentioned it too.  Does it devalue qualifications below level 8 if there is a different price structure, as it were?  All of us accept that they are extremely valuable qualifications.  It certainly opens up access, but it has the potential to create possibly more of a two-tier approach.  It is incredibly good food for thought, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#P00300","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for the presentation.

I welcomed this presentation more than I welcomed the last one, with the heavy emphasis on income contingent loans.  What difference in terms of impact would they have?  The university sector sees them as a move forward, but the IT sector is not advocating for them.  Does that tie into the impact it would have on the type of students who avail of the ITs?  For example, 72% of students in Letterkenny Institute of Technology are on State grants as are 50% of students in the Institute of Technology, Tralee, whereas in the university sector approximately 25% of students in Trinity College are on State grants.  Will the possibility of an income contingent loan have a disastrous effect on the ITs, given that it would scrap the grant system and possibly remove the cohort of students who would usually access the ITs through the State grants?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#P00400","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.

I understand that unlike universities, institutes of technology, ITs, are not able to borrow money.  How much of an impediment is that and would it be a good potential source of funding?  They have experienced 25% cuts in funding, which compared with 19% for universities, is stark.  Deputy Thomas Byrne and the Chairman mentioned recent media reports about the future viability of several ITs.  I would welcome a comment on that.  Are the witnesses satisfied that all the ITs have the infrastructure to cater for current and future demand?  Do they see an expansion of the ITs existing role and if so what would that be?  For many rural families, the IT is the only show in town.   It is important that they are supported. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#P00500","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1052,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming here this morning.

How can we move this forward?  What are the options for the ITs to address the crisis?<\/p> <p>  The proposal to abolish the student contribution charge for students doing level 6 and 7 qualifications is particularly interesting as there are many disadvantaged students within that cohort.  Would such a proposal contribute to greater retention rates in the ITs?  Does this proposal have any other benefits?  Courses such as science, computing and engineering are generally more costly because of the intensity of the laboratory work and the facilities and staff required.  Would the witnesses consider it fair to effectively ask students in other courses, who may be in similar financial circumstances, to contribute to their education while others do not?

Could they update us?  A great deal of work has gone into addressing various concerns that people have raised.  I favour it because it would be a strong way to help the sector to continue to transform, to meet the needs of specific areas, to become absolutely first class institutions and to remain a strong feature of the Irish educational system at third level.  People spoke about the impact on the regions.  That is probably not very well known except at local level.<\/p><p>Do the witnesses have a view of the size the different ITs may need to reach in order to be sustainable and have a strong profile among the community and employers, in cities or at regional level, where the ITs are flagships?  Like many people, I read a recent article about Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  I was really taken aback by the description of the lack of lecture room assistance, such as interactive white boards - maybe they operate in some part of CIT but they were not mentioned in the article - yet it has an outstanding reputation.  I refer to the opportunities for third and fourth year students in all the colleges to do projects in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects, many of which are key to their careers or businesses they might form.  Is funding that nowadays challenging and do the projects continue to play a central role in students&rsquo; education?  How many women are being attracted to engineering?  The last time I was in Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, Bolton Street and on its magnificent campus in Grangegorman, I was taken aback to find that there are few women in the engineering classes.  Does the sector have any views on how that might be improved?  In respect of the move to larger classes, which people can cope with, I worry about the supports, such as assessments and opportunity to continue to do the projects which are strongly associated with the colleges.  What is the position on enhancing and deepening the students&rsquo; experience?  Many of the ITs have pioneered links with industry in Ireland.  Where are they now with that and what can the Houses of the Oireachtas do to assist in creating those positive links with employers and professions that are beneficial to both? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#Q00300","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1054,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their detailed presentation.

Is it able to pay bills as they fall due?  If not, what are the implications of that?  How is it currently funded from a cashflow perspective?  Would increased funding be sucked into paying deficits like this?

Deputy Thomas Byrne said we played it down but we acknowledge the financial crisis.  However, the HEA report last week made it very clear that six of the institutes are currently in a perilous situation, and four could join them.  It is linked to the fact that many of the institutes have been using their reserves to fill in their black holes arising from the drop in State funding.  Their reserves are dropping because they are using them to keep themselves financially viable and maintain their day-to-day operational spend.  We have heretofore been able to use the reserve for some of the nicer things we would like to do, such as bringing in additional staff to support weaker and disadvantaged students or for new buildings and additional laboratory equipment.  We are being prevented from doing that as we now have to fill the gaps left by the lack of State funding.<\/p> <p>  We did not come here today to present ourselves as the poor institutes of technology sector.  We are very proud of what we do and of our achievements and we have worked very hard.  At the start of the crisis we said we would work with the Government to get the State through the difficulties.  Now that we have come out of them we are asking the State to recognise the importance of the sector by helping us out.  In a press release on the HEA report, we called for a stability fund of approximately &euro;130 million over a five-year period, which would significantly help take the pressure off our colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#R00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1056,"content":"<p>Student numbers in the institutes since 2008 have risen by between 25% and 30%, depending on whom one asks.  They have risen within a fixed envelope for education funding in which 60% of the recurrent budget goes to the universities and 40% to the institutes.  The 40% has been a contracting envelope but has been shared by a greater number of students.  It involves doing an awful lot more with substantially less.  The institutes are funded on a current funding model and are not allowed to run deficits or borrow.  Even though they are facing a potential cashflow crisis, they are reasonably robust in that they do not have a legacy of borrowing or other charges.  Their key legacy now is one of underinvestment, especially on the capital side for the past ten years.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Burton spoke about engineering and laboratories.  I used to head up the Dundalk Institute of Technology and we used to give our used computers, on an altruistic basis, to primary schools so that they could be introduced to computing.

When we came to the end of our cashflow, as we did this time last year, we entered into a financial plan with the HEA.  We have already told members of all the cuts we have had but, because we got to the end of our reserves and started to face cashflow problems, we had to introduce a financial plan with a further &euro;638,000 in pay savings which meant that, despite already being short of staff, we could not replace retiring staff.  Moving staff around is the only flexibility we have.  Having contracts means redundancy does not apply so we can decide not to replace retiring staff or those who leave voluntarily.  We had to make savings of another almost &euro;600,000 on the non-pay side so members can imagine what that means in the context of already tight budgets.<\/p> <p>  We have to try to generate additional income and fortunately we have been very successful in attracting international students.

I am also the new person on the block so when I became president of Waterford Institute of Technology I was absolutely shocked at the business model it used for third level education.  I come from industry but no industry would manage with the same model.  Since 2008 we have taken a cut of &euro;14.5 million per year, a total of &euro;85 million.  We do the same job we did before but we have had to pay all increments that were reintroduced for our staff with no increase from the education budget.  Our staff profile is different from other institutes and it is this that has created our problem.  All our staff are at the mature end of the scale, because we are one of the longest-established institutes, and as a result our increments are higher.  We have been one of the most successful institutes in research, to which I will return later, but our research, which is seriously underfunded, is subsidising activities in the other part of the institute.<\/p> <p>  On the question of access and inclusion, the majority of our students do not come from the CAO but other routes and we are very proud of this.  Many of those students, however, have very serious psychological problems and we have to deal with this.  We have the highest percentage of students with mental and other problems but we deal with them and have established structures to do so.  It is really gratifying to see those students achieving but when I sat down with them, I learned that the majority were not referred to a psychiatrist because the health system did not have the funding to support them.  We have to support them.

We have carried on for a very long time and commitment to our community has always been at the forefront of what we do but the deficit is a very serious issue and is not sustainable.

We are one of the vulnerable institutions in the context of the financial situation.  Deputy Burton made a point about the impact of institutions within their own regions.  All of the institutes of technology, which are located approximately an hour and a half from each other in a necklace around the country, with Athlone in the centre, contribute hugely to the development of their regions.  Somebody said that investment in higher education is expensive.  Just try the alternative, which is no investment in higher education in those spaces.  When one considers the impact of the institutes of technology over the past 40 years, particularly in recent years when everything was sucked back to the centre due the cutbacks during the recession, the only people left standing in the regions were the institutes of technology working with local authorities and bodies of that sort to try to maintain a level of ambition and achievement during the period.  What drove the development of the colleges at that time was a moral obligation to the people with whom they worked to ensure that the institutes of technology continued to contribute to that development.  That has happened and we have carried it.  We have carried it because it is the right thing to do.  This is why many of us find ourselves with financial situations with which we need to deal.  We were really in a position where we had to stand up and provide the services necessary to deal with the situations where loads of people were losing their jobs and had no alternative but to come back into education to get the opportunity to get other employment, which has happened.  Some many people who have come back in during that period have been redeployed as a result.  The engagement with industry across the country has been fantastic, particularly that with FDI.  A total of 60% of our part-time programmes are industry-based bespoke programmes developed with companies locally to offer opportunities to graduates and those already in employment in those companies.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant regional development agenda here and if it is ignored, it will become very difficult to get the balance between what is happening in other parts of the country and the larger city locations.  It is difficult for us at times to make the argument for investment when one is looking at congestion in Dublin and other matters of that nature, which dominate the media on an ongoing basis.  The bottom line is, however, that geography is not a good enough reason to deny people their rights in terms of education.  Where somebody is born does not dictate their academic ability.<\/p> <p>  The sector has delivered significantly in the past 40 years.  It has been a privilege to work in it and contribute to that but it has reached a crunch stage where it needs serious investment.

I welcome the support of the committee.  I know the committee is discussing the Technological Universities Bill.  It is very important that this matter is brought to a successful conclusion because ten out of the 14 institutes of technology are in the process of seeking designation as technological universities.  Two of institutes of technology - Institute of Technology Tralee and Cork Institute of Technology - are in the final stage to be become a Munster technological university, while three in Dublin are looking to become a technological university of Dublin.  It is important at this stage that the legislative framework is put in place.  The Chairman mentioned the possibility of dilution of mission and mission drift.  I can assure her that this is far from the case.

Technological universities stand on its own merits but their creation should assist with the funding situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Oliver Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1064,"content":"<p>What we are proposing here is to create a type of university that is quite common in Europe.

One of the concerns I had in the discussion prior to when the Bill first appeared revolved around the idea that we could do it alone and that there was no cost incurred.  If we really want a serious technological university infrastructure that can compete with the best internationally and be up there with the Technical University of Munich or Aalto University, it will require a new investment strategy, new structures and new governance so it is not just a continuation of what is there at the moment.

However, my institute of technology will be in deficit very shortly.  There were many questions regarding access and our proposal around levels 6 and 7.  Access is something we do every single day.  It is not a peripheral activity.  It is a core activity of what we do and our <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>.  Access is a central point.  Whatever the committee does with the Cassells report, I ask it not to limit access to the third-level sector in any way.  It should ensure that whatever it does increases access to the third-level sector.  The committee may find a myriad of ways to do that and we have put a couple of them before it today.  The overall figure of 56% mentioned by Senator Ruane in respect of students in receipt of some grant or other hides other areas like Donegal, where the figure is 72%,  and Limerick, where the figure this year will be 70%.  This is transformative.  It is not an additive process.  It is an transformative process because, generally, these are first-generation students whose families have no links to third-level education.  They are coming to us for the first time and we must support them.  They are also coming from disadvantaged areas so they may be coming from DEIS schools, may not have had the support they need and may not get the support at home which recognises a third-level education is their pathway to a professional qualification and a different life.  Ensuring this access is really why we are here today.  Those sort of students need additional resources.  We do not judge students by the number of CAO points they obtain.<\/p><p>We do not say that is the level of their ability.  We say that it is testimony to how they got in and that it also reflects their background but that it does not reflect their potential.  Our concern and our job is to unlock potential.  The students that Professor Donnelly spoke about - the type of students we all have - need additional resources.<\/p><p> Deputy Nolan spoke about retention rates.  They are a function of our inability to put resources into what we know will make an impact on retention.  We know how to solve retention.  That is not the issue.  The issue is that we do not have the resources or the people to put into it.  The committee may put the figures - they are available - to us.  The overall retention rate in the institute of technology sector is 86% and approximately  90% in the university sector.  The committee might put it to us that our retention rates are much worse.  However, my question is how is our rate so high.<\/p><p> The type of student we are dealing with is very different.  Those students need supports.  We are here to transform that.  We also have the economic impacts the committee will hear about, but we are also about social change.  We are changing society.  What we do with the type of students we are dealing with is, in the main, transform their lives.  This is an inter-generational activity as well, so there is huge added value for society.  That is why we are advocating that level 6 and level 7 education should be free.  The type of students that tend to go into level 6 or, potentially, level 7 education are those who are first generation students, from a disadvantaged background or from under-represented groups.  Those students do not see themselves doing a four year programme, but they progress, and this is all about progression.  Students progress from further education to our institutions, or come directly to us, progress through levels 6 and 7 and onto levels 8, 9 and 10.  Our greatest day is graduation day when we see students coming through from those backgrounds.  We all have examples of students who came in at level 6 and leave with a PhD.  That is what transformation is about and that is what the institutes of technology are about.  They are about opportunity and realising potential.  We are trying to be dispassionate here, and failing perhaps, but the point is that these are all related activities.  <\/p><p> On funding, we need some income contingent loans.  They can be an additive.  However, we also need maintenance grants.  If the idea of the income-contingent loans is to remove the maintenance grants from the sort of students we have, then the Government will have failed.  If we keep increasing access at the centre point of what we want to do, we will not do that, but we need a combination of a number of activities.<\/p><p> The biggest beneficiary of levels 6 and 7 education is not the person but society.  Society benefits from higher education.  There are societal benefits as we go further on in education, but the benefit moves to the person.  Let us get it right.  Let us make sure we leave no one behind in this new economy.  Let us ensure they get in and are maintained in the process.  We will continue to do our jobs within the context of that broad necessity, but access is a centre point of what we do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#S00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Vincent Cunnane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Cunnane for his impassioned plea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#T00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1068,"content":"<p>Sorry about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Vincent Cunnane"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1069,"content":"<p>Not at all.

All of us have relationships with our local education and training providers and with the local further education, FE, providers in the region.  We have set up cluster networks as local networks as well.  In my case, we have the North East Further and Higher Education Alliance.  We meet and work in partnership with individual FE institutions and establish pathways so that students can perhaps complete level 5 or level 6 at the local FE institution and then move on to higher education.  We also deliver outreach programmes and provide distance learning.  For example, people can stay in their local area in Monaghan and do a business degree.  We are also looking for routes and partnerships we can build on to expand this access.  It is so important that not only do students have the opportunity to study in the regions but that they can stay in the regions afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Campbell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>To clarify a few statistics, approximately 48% of students that enter the institutes now have not come directly from the leaving certificate.  There is a huge problem in Irish higher education around funding, which the committee will have heard about earlier.  It is also important to say that there are complementary roles that different people in the binary divide play and do.  Professor Cunnane made the point about access being the norm is what institutes of technology do.  This is not necessarily widely understood.  One of the problems the sector has is that most of the staff in it are themselves university trained.  In many situations such as policy fora, people have come from a university background.  Increasingly, if we look at the guidance debate, a minority of guidance counsellors have been trained in the institute of technology sector.  The Chairman mentioned public awareness and perception.  There is a really serious challenge not just in the wider public, where I think that is better shared, but in the decision making public regarding the perception of the sector.<\/p> <p>  On access, currently 36% of all intake into the institutes are either from white collar, manual, semi-skilled or unskilled work backgrounds.  The equivalent figure in the university sector is 25%.  If we look at the figures for those drawn from managerial, employer and professional backgrounds, the figure is 43% for universities and 27% in the institutes.<\/p> <p>  As a final point, much of this debate is about how we transfer resources from the few to the many, which is what an effective state does.  An ineffective state transfers it from the many to the few.  The weighting for a medical student today under the HEA funding model is 2.3 in the clinical years.  A medical student who is in a hospital and working mostly off the campus is carrying a weighting of 2.3 on the unit cost which the State is paying.  The unit is basically based on a unit payment of 1 for an arts and humanities student.  Then we wonder where the medical students are recruited and selected from and we have an interesting debate about the transfer of resources from the many to the few.  The debate is central to the work.  I want to elaborate on Professor Cunnane's point.  If we begin to work through the data, we will find that there is a subvention in higher education funding that is, I would say, currently generally regressive in terms of its social impact.  This strikes me as being an issue that probably could have been more closely examined in the wonderful work done by the Cassells group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#T00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Tom Collins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1072,"content":"<p>I will pick up on Deputy Burton's questions on the Technological Universities Bill.  I am the fifth and final one of the vulnerable institutes of technology - the famous five.  We are probably running the largest deficit in recent years.  As an institute, we have run out of cash reserves and are now using our capital development reserves to trade.  Like my colleague in Dundalk, Ms Ann Campbell, we have entered into an agreement with the Higher Education Authority about restoring our institution to financial balance.  We have taken the decision voluntarily.  Its consequences include further reductions in our non-pay, redeployment of staff and larger class sizes and we are perilously close to impacting on the quality of the higher education provided to our graduates, which I take exceptionally personally.  Among the presidents here, I am probably the only graduate of the institutes of technology sector that is a serving president of an institute of technology, with levels 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 qualifications from many of the institutes and universities in Ireland.<\/p><p>We are speaking about cost, but if we move to looking at the impact of the institutes of technology, an extensive study was done by a number of professors in Trinity College Dublin that looks at the type II multiplier, which is the direct and indirect induced demand and consumption generated by the presence of institutes of technology in a region.  In regions such as Letterkenny, Galway and Mayo every &euro;1 million that runs through the institutes of technology is very productive and highly paid individuals work in the local community.<\/p><p> Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology inherited multiple campuses.  They originated from a time when we were funded directly by the Department of Education and Skills.  As the funding has transitioned to the Higher Education Authority, our guaranteed funding for multiple campuses has been eroded.  Approximately 33% of the students of many of our colleague institutes study engineering disciplines, but in GMIT 49% of our students study science, technology, engineering and maths.  We support not only a national manufacturing centre of excellence in Galway, but a global centre for medical device manufacturing, with 10% of all Ireland's manufacturing coming out of Galway city.  When we add to this other intensive activity in art and design, approximately 60% of our students are at the weighting of 1.7 discussed by Professor Collins.  As the State grant has been eroded and the student contribution has been increased, the weighting has not applied to the student contribution.  We generate a surplus on our Galway campus which we use to fund deficits in campuses which were promised ring-fenced funding.<\/p><p> The creation of technological universities that generate the type of regional economic development indicated by the study done by our colleagues in Trinity College Dublin would come at cost, but let us look at the impact and the scale and capacity they would provide to engage in research and development and the reach capacity with which they would provide us internationally.  They would generate organisations with a scale of 20,000 or 21,000 students, which are very attractive partners for international collaboration.  They would also position us for long-term financial sustainability.<\/p><p> Added to this, we must have a borrowing framework to put us at a par with the universities.  Six of the seven universities have borrowed approximately &euro;560 million at very low interest rates from European investment banks.  This has also positioned them to leverage money from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund for student accommodation and self-financing activity.  This privilege is not afforded to the institutes of technology and I contend this needs to be part of the response of the committee.<\/p><p> To look at how we may get more women into engineering, GMIT has further segmented science and engineering and we are looking at adding programmes in biomedical engineering which are more attractive.  Without the level of investment, we have no choice in the institution but to look to larger groups and to look at reducing our contribution to projects, which are so central to the work we do and to providing practical support to the students to gain productive employment.  Our latest career survey showed 94% of our students are in employment or further study within eight months of graduation.  This is a testament to our success.  Over the coming weeks we will celebrate approximately 2,000 graduations from the institute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#T00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1074,"content":"<p>I wish to clarify a point on the borrowing framework.

The development of research and innovation in postgraduate studies in the institutes of technology sector is one of the great success stories of Ireland.  If we look back at the role of the institutes of technology, they have always responded to the needs of their region.  When we started we had trades and certificates.  When industry needed degree students and there was a cap on degree students in universities, the institutes of technology responded and we created degree programmes.  In the digital economy the need is for the creation of knowledge.  The institutes have responded to this by developing an internationally benchmarked postgraduate research programme.  This has been done in an environment that has been quite hostile to the institutes.  For instance, it is probably not known by many committee members that the universities receive 25% of their core funding to cover research activities while the institutes get absolutely nothing.<\/p> <p>  We have brought in &euro;67 million of research funding through international competitive funding, have more than 400 PhD students registered throughout the institutes and are graduating students who will go directly into industry attracted to the region.  In the south-east region, the unemployment rate dropped from 14% to 10.7%.  It is still too high but this was directly because of the decision of foreign direct investment to come into the region because of the quality of the ongoing research.<\/p> <p>  Another vital element of this research is with regard to the imbalance in the Irish economy and too much investment in Dublin.  Our centres, which support indigenous start-up companies, have had a huge impact on employment in the regions.  The &euro;5 million is misunderstood in one sense.  We use Enterprise Ireland investment, which is jointly funded by Enterprise Ireland and the company involved, and this is not included in the &euro;5 million.  There were 823 collaborations with 573 companies.  These involve a certain amount of investment by industry.  The &euro;5 million is really only work that industry wanted to do in which it did not want to include Enterprise Ireland or any State funding, usually for intellectual property reasons.  Even in the universities, the level of direct investment by industry in Ireland is very low.  As part of overall investment in the institutes of technology, if we want to balance economic development between Dublin and the regions, having a policy where the institutes are recognised as being part of research and postgraduate studies, including 25% for research in the core budget, as is the case in the universities, would be a big move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2016111000002#U00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Willie Donnelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1080,"content":"<p>I wish to add to Professor Donnelly's point to give a sense of the block grant for research.

Later we will reach amendments that we discussed yesterday but were ruled out of order by the Clerk to the Committee.  I accept that the clerk's rulings are based on established practice.  As the committee knows, there is a constitutional prohibition on the Opposition putting forward amendments that incur a cost on the people or the Exchequer.  We also have Standing Orders in the Houses of the Oireachtas that interpret the constitutional provision.  The people who decide whether an amendment is in order must look at the Standing Orders and established practice.  Yesterday Deputy Donnelly and I mentioned that the proposals that come before this committee are not law.  They are only proposals from Government and we are shaping them.  The amendments have been treated as if they are a charge on the people or the Exchequer.

We rehearsed this debate on Second Stage.  I am unconvinced that the scheme works, is desirable or value for money.  The Revenue Commissioners have told us that 302 people availed of SARP in 2014 and it cost the Exchequer &euro;5.9 million.  That is an important figure when we put it in the context of the strife and difficulties we are going through now.  Let us remember that to avail of SARP one must first be a very high earner and one only gets relief on the portion of income above &euro;150,000.  The Garda have a starting pay of &euro;23,000 and it is the same for teachers who are paid for supervision and all of the rest.  Under SARP nearly &euro;6 million was provided to 302 people.  It means &euro;20,000 in tax benefit was given to each person but that amounts to almost the annual salary of a Garda starting in the service.<\/p><p>Let us look at the number of jobs created by the scheme.  In the Department's report of 2014 it states that of the 12 people who availed of the scheme only five jobs were created and six retained.  It continued:<\/p><blockquote>There is also a lack of measurable evidence that the scheme has resulted in an increase in Foreign Direct Investment or the rollout of new projects ... under the current scheme it is not mandatory to create jobs in order to qualify for SARP. <br \/><br \/>During the review, a number of stakeholders also expressed the view that the few who had availed of SARP to date had &lsquo;fallen into&rsquo; the relief rather than it being a deciding factor in their decision to relocate.<\/blockquote> <p>As the Minister mentioned yesterday, we talked about dead weighting schemes and that is what has been referred to here.  These key individuals would have come here anyway and they did not need this tax incentive to help them relocate here.  At a time when there is a reduction in available fiscal space for us next year, and pressures in different areas, we should seriously question the continuation of the scheme.  Let us remember that the scheme is supposed to be gone and I made this point yesterday.  I do not know the last time the Government introduced a tax scheme with a deadline where it accepted the deadline, let it go and closed the scheme down at that point.  The scheme was rolled over into 2016 and now it has been rolled over to 2020 yet there is no direct evidence, but increasing annual costs, that additional jobs have been created.  Serious questions must be asked about why we give the relief to high earners in the first place.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#B00900","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1098,"content":"<p>SARP is only justifiable if there is demonstrable evidence that it has led to additional investment and employment.  That is the key measure of whether SARP is a success but the jury is out.  It is a controversial scheme in light of current developments.  There must be an evidence-led demonstration that by bringing key decision-makers to Ireland, who are the top executives in many cases, will lead to investment decisions that are favourable to Ireland and, thus, have a favourable knock-on effect on employment.  If that is the case then I will stand over the scheme, defend it and call for its extension.<\/p> <p>  I understand that the Minister's Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, wrote to him in September on behalf of the National Civil Aviation Development Forum.  He raised a number of issues about SARP, particularly about aviation leasing.  In his letter two issues were raised.  First, a requirement that an employee works for the company in an overseas location for six months prior to availing of an assignment in Ireland.  The criteria was 12 months up to the past couple of years but it was reduced to six months.  Second, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has conveyed that the forum contends that the current limit of five years should be extended.  These issues are not in the Bill.  Does that mean that the Minister has considered the proposals but rejected them?  <\/p> <p>  I have made the point that justification for the scheme should be based on additional investment and employment that is created in Ireland as a result of SARP.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#B01000","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1099,"content":"<p>I completely oppose SARP as it is a tax break for a small number of well paid corporate executives and illustrates the Government's approach.

There are schemes similar to SARP in other jurisdictions that compete with us for foreign direct investment.  The Netherlands is a case in point.  It has a scheme along the lines of SARP but it is far more generous in its provisions.<\/p> <p>  I introduced SARP, in its present format, in 2012.  I did so as a result of very strong lobbying by IDA Ireland that said there was a gap in the Irish offering to attract foreign direct investment and we needed to close the gap to retain our competitive position in attracting foreign direct investment.  We reviewed the scheme in 2014.  Deputy Doherty has given the key figures.  The most recent report on the special assignee relief programme, which is SARP, in respect of the 2014 tax year shows that 302 employees availed of SARP.  It also showed that 126 jobs were created and 708 jobs were retained as a result of the incentive.  The cost to the Exchequer was &euro;5.9 million, as Deputy Doherty has put on the record.  <\/p> <p>  Second 9 provides for the announcement on budget day to extend the programme.  As Deputies will be aware, I have decided to extend the incentive until the end of 2020.  I announced the extension early in order to provide certainty for potential investors in Ireland following the UK's vote to leave the European Union.<\/p><p>The current SARP scheme, as enacted, does not finish until the end of next year so it is not ending now and we are not extending it now.  It finishes at the end of 2017 and we are giving advance notice that we will extend it further.  <\/p><p> One can do different sums on the cost of the jobs but if one takes the very high-earning people - every single employee earning a salary of &euro;500,000 who avails of the relief under SARP - almost &euro;139,000 will still be paid to the Exchequer in income tax and a further &euro;37,000 in USC so it is not a complete relief.  These high-earning people continue to pay significant amounts of tax and USC but, of course, they are less significant than what an Irish employee on an equivalent salary would pay.  If PRSI is payable, it would yield a further &euro;73,750 in employer and employee contributions.  If one is looking at the cost per job, one needs to net it all out.  <\/p><p> I do not see this as a major scheme but under the very strong advocacy of the IDA, I introduced it in 2012.  With the threat from Brexit, I think it is important that we maintain our competitiveness in this respect.  A total of &euro;6 million and about 900 jobs in all are being claimed.  One can argue about net cost and whether one goes gross or net if off but I think it is worth holding it for another couple of years.  I am not extending it indefinitely.

I am aware of the views expressed in that letter.  Similar views were expressed to me directly by representatives of the aircraft leasing industry but I do not think the case was strong enough to make the alterations that were being requested.  A lot of the time in these matters, it is a matter of judgment.  It is hard to know whether the advantages that are being claimed will result or not.  I have a note here as to why the scheme would not be open to new hires, which was the burden of the letter from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport quoted by Deputy McGrath.  It related to why someone must be employed in another country before moving to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  As part of the SARP review in 2014, the proposal to include new hires was considered but it was felt that to include new hires could cause job displacement in the Irish labour market.  For example, if an Irish tax-resident individual and a foreign-based individual with similar skills both applied for the same job, it would be less costly for the employer to hire the foreign-based individual.  This would place the Irish tax-resident individual at a considerable disadvantage so that is the principal reason I did not amend the scheme.<\/p> <p>  Deputies will appreciate that Ministers and Deputies, including Opposition spokespersons, are lobbied.  To paraphrase W. B. Yeats, sometimes it is very hard to tell the dancer from the dance.  When they are making claims about a huge economic advantage to the Republic of Ireland, one does not know whether they are simply advancing a personal case.  It is always a line ball call but in considering this, I think it is worth proposing to the Deputy that we extend the scheme without amendment and the scheme concludes as currently enacted at the end of 2017.  We are giving advance notice because there are many people looking again at Ireland - people considering whether they will transfer business from the UK to Ireland or many US investors considering whether they will change the plan they had to invest in the UK and invest in Ireland instead.  We are positioning ourselves to make sure we are competitive.  I agree that this is a small part of the IDA offers and there are many other considerations that are far more important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#C00300","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1104,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Doherty have a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#C00400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>We can dice up the figures however we want.  These 302 employees are getting &euro;20,000 in tax relief that is available to them and not to any Irish citizen.  That is the key point.  There is a &euro;20,000 reduction in tax on average and each of these people has to be earning in excess of &euro;75,000.  We know the rules of SARP.  They are that 30% of a person's income between &euro;75,000 and &euro;500,000 is disregarded for income tax purposes.  We do not have the individual details but some of these individuals could get a tax cut of &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 as a result of it.<\/p> <p>  We can take the Department at its word in respect of its report.  I mentioned what it said, which was that people had fallen into the relief rather than it being a deciding factor in their decision to relocate.  Let us think about this.  Of course, a key person from a company in the US coming to a company in Ireland when the company decides it wants that person to come over will apply for SARP.  Why would they not apply for it?  However, the question is whether they would have come over anyway.  The survey found that a number of people were going to come over anyway and then availed of SARP when they arrived here.  It also makes it clear that there is no measurable evidence that the scheme has resulted in an increase in FDI or a roll out of new projects.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has provided his own figures regarding how many jobs were created or retained and I accept that the figures are the stated figures.  However, he and I know that this is not verified in any way, shape or form.  If one looks at the forms that employers have to fill in relating to SARP, one can see that they have to provide the PPS details of the employee, the position within the company and all the other issues because it is not just about tax relief.  These individuals are getting relief for flying to and from their country of residence, and tax relief on private tuition for their children.  There is a box at the bottom of the form stating how many employees were created in the company as a result of this scheme, excluding the SARP employee, and how many were retained.  There is no verification of those figures.  If I was the company, I could put ten, 20 or 30 in the box.  We do not know if that is the case because Revenue does not verify it.  The company does not have provide PPS numbers and company positions for them.  I am sure the individuals are there.  I am not suggesting that they are not there.  The question is whether they are linked to this tax relief in the first place.  <\/p> <p>  This is not a good time to be changing the offer, particularly when we want to attract multinational and financial investment.  Hopefully, people, particularly those in London, are looking to relocate to this country as a result of Brexit but the question is whether this scheme is value for money.  A scheme involving &euro;6 million being spent on 302 individuals is not value for money.<\/p> <p>  On Second Stage, I said that there are a lot of tax breaks in the Finance Bill that benefit very few but involve large quantums of money.  I would argue that &euro;6 million is better spent in other areas given that there is no independent evidence to show that this scheme is actually creating jobs, investment and new projects.  When it was first introduced in 2012, the Government said there was a gap about which the IDA lobbied heavily and that we needed to take these risks.  We took the risk.  An evaluation was done.  It said that there is no evidence to suggest that it is actually working.  It is a huge tax relief for these individuals.  It is time not to extend the relief but to leave it the way it is.  I would like to see the scheme gone but it will operate for another year.  During that period, we should carry out a more detailed analysis and look under the bonnet to see if this has really created jobs.  What the Minister is asking us to do in this Finance Bill is to extend the scheme to 2020, which it is not something I would or can support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#C00500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"vote","time":1478772000,"counter":1106,"content":"<p>Question put:Question put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 5; N\u00edl, 2.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#D00200","aye":["1369","1364","1223","1248","1326"],"nay":["1288","1308"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478772000,"counter":1107,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael D'Arcy took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478772000,"counter":1108,"content":"<p>SECTION 10<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478772000,"counter":1109,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That Section 10 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1110,"content":"<p>This section relates to the extension of the foreign earnings deduction which is a tax break to a relatively small number of people.

The changes are that the section is extended such that it will continue to apply for the tax years 2018, 2019 and 2020.  The list of qualifying countries is expanded to include the Republic of Colombia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan from 2017 onwards, and that the minimum number of days required to be spent in the qualifying countries is reduced from 40 days to 30 days.<\/p> <p>  The kind of fear that is frequently expressed about Brexit is that it will reduce the capacity for Irish companies to export to the United Kingdom.  The advice generally given is that the exporters should seek new markets and get into other markets to compensate for loss of market share in the UK, if it occurs.  This scheme was originally introduced to give a tax benefit to the person, very often the sole representative of a company, who is trying to develop new markets, frequently in Third World countries.  That is the reasoning behind it.  The reason for extending it this year is - as in the previous section - that it is extant as is until the end of 2017 but we are giving advance notice to companies that it is our intention to extend it to the 2018, 2019 and 2020 tax years.  There had been some representation from the parent Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that it should be extended to the Republic of Colombia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.  I am not too sure how fruitful these markets are for Ireland but it is another expansion to the list of countries that would be eligible.  Colombia has strong export potential for Ireland  in telecommunications, financial services and digital technology.  Enterprise Ireland has a small number of clients whom it believes have the capacity to develop this market.  Exports to Colombia have doubled between 2011 and 2015.  Similarly, Pakistan has been identified by Enterprise Ireland as being a strong export target for education services.  Irish exports to Pakistan grew by 26% in 2015 and have almost quadrupled since 2011, although this is calculated against a relatively low base.  As I have said, I do not claim any expertise in this area.  We get submissions in advance of budgets and Finance Bills from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and frequently it is transmitting to us the advice of the agencies; this particular advice is coming from Enterprise Ireland in order to further develop alternative markets for Irish goods and services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#E00400","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1112,"content":"<p>Will the Minister explain why there is a further reduction in the number of days?

My reservations are around a number of proposals that the Minister has introduced.  At the beginning it was a limited scheme that was targeted at the BRIC countries, and the argument was put forward that these were emerging markets and that we needed to encourage exports into these emerging markets.  Then there were amendments and the decision to review the scheme.  The countries included were Egypt, Algeria, Tanzania Senegal, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Democratic Republic of Congo.  Now we see another expansion of the scheme, and as Deputy Murphy has pointed out, the change to the restriction on the number of qualifying days.  It would be unwise to consider the effect of Brexit when we discuss this scheme given that export goods from Ireland to the UK was 17.9% according to figures in the review that was done at the time.  Obviously there are a lot of people who do not know what is coming down the line in terms of tariffs and so on and will have to look at other export markets and try to diversify.<\/p> <p>  I have some questions with regard to this section.  The justification for the extension of the scheme is interesting, and Deputy Murphy has asked the Minister how this has come about.  The review that was carried out actually calls for the scheme to be extended to all countries highlighted in the Government's integrated plan for trade, tourism and investment, which are all non-EU countries.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate why he deems certain countries to be included.  I am not arguing that the review's suggestion is what should happen; I am interested in the rationale behind that decision.  The review suggested that expansion of the scheme would include countries such as Japan - which was our tenth largest trading export country at that point in time - Australia, Singapore, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico, Vietnam, Thailand and Chile.  Why were those countries not included in the scheme and are we likely to see those countries being included next year?<\/p> <p>  Other proposals were put forward and we have seen a relaxation of the scheme.  Qualifying days are down to 30 days, there were calls for it to be reduced to 20 days, there were calls for the travel time of employees to and from these countries to be included instead of just the days they were there.  I am interested in the rationale for the decision.  I am not advocating this but if this scheme is about supporting exports and companies to develop in markets - that are not as developed for exporters at this point in time - then why is this scheme not available to every country outside the European Union?  Very established trading partners might be excluded such as the US which is probably the only country, bar Japan, that is in the top ten category with regard to exports from Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#E00700","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1115,"content":"<p>When the scheme was introduced in 2012 travel to Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa was included.

These countries were included in order to further encourage the development of export markets by Irish-based enterprises, especially enterprises in the agricultural sector.

We believe that by extending the scheme to these countries we can develop alternative markets.<\/p> <p>  I have no wish to over-stress the Brexit issue, but the advice from anyone talking about Brexit or any economist talking about the disruption in exports, potentially, from Ireland to the United Kingdom is to diversify markets.  Those who can should avail of the scheme.  The reason I am not advocating that we make it a permanent part of the tax code is that extensions, such as the extension I am proposing now, allow D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to review the position, just as the committee is doing now and just as it has done in previous years when extensions were brought in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#F00300","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1119,"content":"<p>The conclusions of the review included the opinion that while it could not be definitively stated that the existence of the foreign earnings introduction had led to an increase in exports to the qualifying countries, there was a consensus among stakeholders that the FED should be extended and enhanced to support SMEs trying to expand exports into emerging markets.  The first part of this raises concerns for me.  This was done in 2014.  Those responsible for the review made the point that it takes time to establish markets in the countries in question and that the effects cannot be proven.  We are now in 2016.  We should be able to say definitively whether those pioneers, to use that term, those who originally availed of the FED, were actually successful in establishing market share in those countries and whether the scheme actually worked.<\/p> <p>  We may decide to extend the scheme for a further three years to 2020 and reduce its qualifying criteria.  However, is the Department willing to look at the earlier entries into the scheme, in other words, the BRIC countries, to establish whether the conclusion still stands?  Can we now state that the FED has led to an increase in exports to qualifying countries?  Given that the scheme was introduced in 2012, four years ago, we should be able to carry out such a review with definitive verifiable evidence from the qualifying companies and individuals involved.  They should be able to say whether it led to exports into those qualifying countries.  I urge the Government to do that in order that we have the relevant information for the Finance Bill next year in case we are looking at these sections again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#F00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1120,"content":"<p>A variety of factors are at play when markets develop for Irish exports.

I urge the Minister to consider it.  I realise we cannot put forward amendments that may have a cost on the Exchequer or the people.  I urge the Minister to consider my amendment.  It does not abolish the scheme.  Indeed, the scheme is being extended under section 11 for a further two years.<\/p> <p>  The scheme benefits a number of claimants.  In 2014, a total of 2,291 people availed of the scheme.  It is for long-term unemployed people who start their own business.  They get relief for two years.  The maximum relief is &euro;40,000 each year.  Therefore, the maximum relief an individual could get is &euro;80,000.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty is that the number of individuals who are actually able to get anywhere close to relief at the high-end is extremely low.  The figures show that the vast majority of them are claiming relief on a small scale.  Approximately 75% of these entrepreneurs are getting relief at below &euro;15,000.  Basically, their profits do not reach &euro;15,000 in the first two years.<\/p> <p>  I have argued that the relief should be curtailed to &euro;20,000 per year but extended over a longer period.  This would give more certainty for businesses.  Business people who have availed of the relief have told me that the major challenge in any business is making any profit in year one and year two.  The figures I have before me show that in the case 696 or one third of the 2,291 individuals who claimed in 2014 the profits on which the exemption had been claimed were between zero and &euro;1,000.<\/p><p>We know that is the experience in that significant profits are not involved.  An exemption on profits from &euro;1,000 to &euro;2,000 was claimed by 161 individuals and from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,000 by 141.  The figure for exemptions on profits above &euro;15,000 starts to slide down from 30 to 12.  While 49 people are able to gain relief on profits up to &euro;40,000 per year, the majority are only getting relief on small amounts.  As I said, one third have profits of less than &euro;1,000.<\/p><p> My amendment would provide for the granting of relief up a figure of &euro;20,000, which would not affect about 85% of claimants, and extend the granting of relief over three or four years, depending on the costs involved.  For a business person, it would mean a little more certainty in setting up and it would not cost much more because of the small number of claimants at the top end.  People with profits of up to &euro;40,000 have probably fallen outside the category of those who need this relief.  They would still get relief on their profits up to &euro;20,000 over four years.<\/p><p> It is a good scheme which encourages people to set up their own businesses and rewards them for taking that risk.  We know that the first few years in business are the most difficult.  The evidence tells us that the scheme is of little benefit to the majority of individuals.  Tweaking it could have a measurable impact on some entrepreneurs who have decided to use the start-your-own-business relief scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#F01100","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1128,"content":"<p>Deputy Pearse Doherty's argument is that the start-your-own-business relief scheme should be amended to make it available over four years rather than two, that it should provide relief on taxable profits up to &euro;20,000 rather than &euro;40,000 per annum and that it should be extended to new businesses which commence before 31 December 2020, two years longer than that proposed in the Government's extension.  Material on take-up of the scheme is only available for the first full year of the scheme, with 1,823 participants in 2014, who include participants who availed of the scheme in 2013.  The scheme was available for just two months in 2013 when there were 139 participants.  According to Revenue, the estimated cost of the scheme in 2014 was &euro;5.2 million, or approximately &euro;2,852 per individual on average.  Recent analysis by Revenue suggests approximately 90% of applicants are earning profits under &euro;20,000.  However, it is important to note that we do not have sufficient information to make a judgment on how these businesses may fare in their second or subsequent years.<\/p> <p>  Extending the scheme, as suggested by the Deputy, could involve considerable costs, as it is unclear how the profits of businesses may evolve.  For example, in extending the period during which relief may be claimed to four years as opposed to two, there is likely to be considerable additional costs for the Exchequer in 2019 and 2020 as a result of individuals who commence a trade in 2017 continuing to have exempt income in 2019 and 2020 which otherwise would be taxable.  The scheme has already had a higher take-up rate than expected and a higher cost than forecast.  It is unclear how fair it would be to continue to assist certain businesses in their third and fourth year, while providing no support for businesses which were not set up by long-term unemployed individuals.  It is also unclear how the Deputy's amendment would affect businesses which are already claiming start-your-own business relief.<\/p> <p>  For these reasons and while I can understand the reasons behind the amendment, I am unwilling to accept it.  I highlight the fact that the relief will be available until 2020 for individuals who start their business before the end of 2018.  I suggest, therefore, that this issue might be considered again in the future.  I see merits in the Deputy&rsquo;s argument.  If I thought it would benefit the scheme, I would accept the spirit of his amendment.  However, I do not have enough hard data to know whether his argument is correct.  The amendment is about a year premature and I would not rule it out indefinitely.  I am prepared to come back to it next year when we will have more data to support the points he has made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#G00200","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1129,"content":"<p>That is appreciated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#G00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478772000,"counter":1130,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478772000,"counter":1131,"content":"<p>Section 12 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478772000,"counter":1132,"content":"<p>SECTION 13<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1133,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 51, 54, 55, 58, 59 and 62 are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#G00700","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1134,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 51:<\/p><blockquote>In page 21, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:&ldquo;(a) in section 784&mdash;<blockquote>(i) by inserting the following after subsection (2E):<blockquote>&ldquo;(2F) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, a retirement annuity contract shall not cease to be an annuity contract for the time being approved by the Revenue Commissioners where, notwithstanding anything contained in the contract as approved&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(a) the person with whom the contract is made&mdash;<blockquote>(i) on or before 31 March 2017&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(I) commences payment of an annuity to the individual,<br \/><br \/>(II) pays a lump sum of a kind referred to in subsection (2)(b) to the individual, or<br \/><br \/>(III) transfers the value of the individual&rsquo;s accrued rights under the contract in accordance with subsection (2A),<br \/><br \/>or<br \/><br \/>(ii) in priority to any payment or transfer referred to in subparagraph (i), makes available from the cash and other assets representing the value of the individual&rsquo;s accrued rights under the contract, to such extent as may be necessary, an amount for the purposes of discharging a tax liability in relation to the individual under the provisions of Chapter 2C of this Part in respect of the contract,<\/blockquote>(b) insofar as subparagraph (i) of paragraph (a) is concerned, the annuity contract is deemed to be a vested RAC in accordance with section 787O(6), and<br \/><br \/>(c) insofar as subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) is concerned, the annuity contract is a vested RAC within the meaning of section 787O(1).&rdquo;,<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>and<blockquote>(ii) by inserting the following after subsection (7):<blockquote>&ldquo;(8) Where an annuity contract is a vested RAC within the meaning of section 787O(1), the provisions of section 784A(4) shall apply to the cash and other assets representing the individual&rsquo;s accrued rights under the contract at the time of death of the individual as if that cash and those other assets were assets of an approved retirement fund.&rdquo;,&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>Section 13, as initiated, amended certain provisions of Part 30 of, and Schedule 23B to, the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 with the aim of closing off tax planning opportunities involving the use of personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs.  This tax planning involved the PRSA owner never taking benefits from the PRSA, which meant that various taxes were avoided and the assets of the PRSA passed tax-free to a surviving spouse or civil partner on the death of the owner after age 75 years.  The amendments made in the Bill were designed to ensure all PRSAs vested no later than the owner&rsquo;s 75th birthday were brought within the range of taxes that the tax planning was attempting to avoid.  The range of amendments I am now proposing to section 13 reflect further consideration of the provision in the light of feedback and commentary received by my Department and Revenue since publication date.  They are designed to ensure the closing off of this type of tax planning is fully effective by including retirement annuity contracts, RACs, within the provisions, as well as to clarify how certain aspects of the measure are to operate.<\/p><p>In summary, the following Committee Stage amendments are proposed: to provide that RACs which have not matured on, or by the time, an individual attains the age of 75 years will be treated as maturing, which will give rise to a benefit crystallisation event, BCE, in similar circumstances as PRSAs, as already provided for in the Bill as initiated; to clarify the transitional arrangements allowing individuals who are over 75 years at the date of passing of the Bill and who will face a deemed vesting of their PRSA or RAC on that date to access the assets in their PRSA or RAC by way of an annuity, a retirement lump sum or a transfer to an approved retirement fund and that such accessing will have to be completed by 31 March 2017; to make provision for any chargeable excess tax arising on a vested PRSA or RAC where the owner is over 75 years to be recovered by the administrator from the PRSA or RAC assets in priority to any other payment being made; to require an affected individual to provide a declaration in respect of the BCE for his or her administrator within 30 days of the deemed vesting of the PRSA or RAC, and, where a declaration is not made, to treat the entire value of the BCE as being chargeable to tax; to provide a review mechanism where it subsequently transpires that some, or all, of the value of the BCE should not have been charged to tax; and to provide for other minor technical amendments to ensure clarity of the provisions.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 51 amends section 784 of the TCA 1997, dealing with RACs, by inserting a new subsection 2F into section 784.  This is primarily to provide transitional arrangements which mirror those provided for PRSAs in new section 787K(2D) of the Bill, as initiated.  The new subsection 2F provides that an RAC which has been approved by Revenue will not lose that approved status where the insurance company with which the contract is made on or before 31 March 2017 pays an annuity or lump sum to the individual or transfers an amount to an ARF or, in priority to the making of such payments or transfers, uses the RAC assets to discharge any liability to chargeable excess tax arising as a result of the deemed vesting of the RAC.  The facility to make a payment or transfer to the individual with whom the RAC is made after age 75 only applies where the RAC is deemed to have become a vested RAC on the date the Finance Act 2016 is passed, that is, in circumstances where the RAC owner is 75 years of age before that date.  The use by the RAC administrator of the assets in the RAC to discharge a chargeable excess tax liability will apply in any circumstance where the RAC becomes vested on the date the RAC owner attains the age of 75 years, without having exercised his or her retirement entitlements under the contract by that time.<\/p><p> It also inserts a new subsection 8 into section 784.  This new subsection provides that where an annuity contract is a vested RAC - that is, where an annuity does not become payable or a transfer to an ARF, etc., has not been made on or before the date on which the RAC owner attains the age of 75 years - the amount of cash and other assets in the RAC representing the owner's rights under the contract at the time the owner dies are to be treated as if they were assets of an ARF and the taxation provisions in section 784A(4) apply accordingly.  This new subsection mirrors the death-related PRSA provisions in section 787G(6), as provided for in section 13 of the Bill as published.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 54 amends section 787K(2D) as initiated, which provides transitional arrangements for individuals who are over 75 at the date of the passing of the Bill and who will face a deemed vesting of their PRSA or PRSAs on that date.  The amendments are for the purposes of clarifying the circumstances in which such individuals will be allowed to receive a payment of their PRSA assets in the form of an annuity, a retirement lump sum or a transfer of the assets to an ARF on or before 31 March 2017.  They will not be permitted to take periodic withdrawals after 31 March 2017.  As with vested RACs, this also permits the use by the PRSA administrator of the assets in the PRSA to discharge a chargeable excess tax liability in any circumstance where the PRSA becomes vested on the date the PRSA contributor attains the age of 75 years without having drawn down benefits.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 55 makes a number of amendments to Chapter 2C of Part 30 of the TCA 1997, which deals with the limit on tax relieved pension funds, that is, the standard fund threshold regime, by inserting a definition of \"vested RAC\" into section 787O(1), which is the interpretation section for Chapter 2C, in relation to annuity contracts or trust schemes which are included in the existing definition of \"relevant pension arrangement\" in section 787O(1) that are approved by the Revenue Commissioners under section 784.  Under this amendment, a vested RAC is an RAC from which the owner has not taken retirement benefits on or before the date of his or her 75th birthday.  This definition is similar to the new paragraph (c) of the definition of \"vested PRSA\" in section 790D(1), which was included in the Bill as initiated.<\/p><p> It also inserts a new subsection 6 into section 787O.  Where an RAC owner attains the age of 75 before the date of passing of the Finance Act 2016, without having taken benefits, this new subsection provides that the RAC is deemed to become a vested RAC on the date of passing of that Act.  This mirrors the PRSA provision included in the new subsection 1A of section 790D of the Bill, as initiated.  It also inserts a new subsection 5A into section 787R.  This is an important amendment which will ensure that a BCE arising as a result of the vesting of an RAC or PRSA at age 75 is brought into charge to tax.  In general, where a BCE is due to occur in respect of a pension arrangement, the scheme administrator may seek a declaration under section 787R(4) from the owner regarding prior BCEs so that the administrator can determine if the BCE in question gives rise to chargeable excess tax.  In the context of these anti-avoidance measures, the purpose of this subsection is to counteract situations where individuals refuse to provide a declaration, thus leaving the administrator unable to determine the amount of any BCE that is to be subject to chargeable excess tax, that is, arising from the vested PRSA or vested RAC where the owner is 75.<\/p><p> Under this new subsection, an individual whose RAC or PRSA vests in accordance with section 13 of this Bill is required to provide a declaration containing the details referred to in section 787R(4) to his or her administrator within 30 days from the date of the deemed vesting, regardless of whether or not the declaration is requested by the administrator.  Where an individual fails to provide a declaration, the administrator can assume that the individual's standard fund threshold, which is currently &euro;2 million, or personal fund threshold, if applicable, which would be higher than &euro;2 million, has already been fully \"used up\", so that the entire value of the BCE, the vested RAC or vested PRSA, will be treated as a \"chargeable excess\" and taxed at the higher rate of tax, which is currently 40%.  <\/p><p> Finally, it amends subsection 5 of section 787S which in general allows for the adjustment of chargeable excess tax which is incorrectly included in a return to Revenue by an administrator.  This amendment is a necessary counterbalance to the amendment to section 787R and deals with the situation where a BCE is taxed in full under the new section 787R(5A)(c), that is, where a declaration has not been submitted by the RAC or PRSA owner in circumstances where, if a declaration had been provided, no chargeable excess or a lesser amount would have arisen.  The amended subsection 5 allows Revenue, on a case being made to it, to make any necessary adjustments to ensure that the tax liability is correct.  This is particularly important for individuals with relatively small PRSAs or RACs who may accidentally, through illness or the like, find themselves in this situation.  It allows the situation to be redressed.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 58 makes a minor amendment to new subsection 1A of section 790D included in the Bill as initiated, to make absolutely clear the date the PRSA is deemed to become a \"vested PRSA\" where the PRSA contributor has attained the age of 75 before the date of passing of the Finance Act 2016.  In other words, this means the date of passing of the Finance Act 2016 and not the date the PRSA contributor attains the age of 75 years.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 59 and 62 insert new subparagraphs (bc) and (dc) into paragraphs 2 and 3, respectively, of Schedule 23B to the TCA 1997.  These mirror the provisions already included in the Bill as initiated for vested PRSAs and respectively ensures that the vesting of an RAC at age 75 is treated as a BCE and sets out how the amount crystallised by the BCE is to be determined.<\/p><p> I commend these amendments to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#G00800","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>Is amendment No. 51 agreed to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#J00100","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1137,"content":"<p>May we discuss the other amendments?

The primary purpose of the provision going forward is to stop this tax planning in its tracks and to make sure it would be financially irrational for an individual to allow a situation to arise where he or she does not vest his or her PRSA or RAC on or before his or her 75th birthday.  If he or she does this in the future, he or she will not be able to access the benefits but will be taxed on them nonetheless.  For individuals who may be contemplating this form of planning in the future, they have been forewarned in the legislation that the consequences will be severe.  We assume that, rationally, they will avoid doing so.  In the case of an individual who has got him or herself into the situation already and is not in a position to unwind the arrangement, in my view, it would clearly not be proportionate to impose potentially significant and, in the case of vested PRSAs, ongoing tax charges under the imputed distribution regime while at the same time not allowing the person to access their funds.  An attitude of \"They have made their bed so they should lie in it\" seems to me to be unreasonable.  These individuals may face chargeable excess tax.  They will face notional distribution tax if they make their PRSA a net to the ARF.  They will face the ARF regime on assets passed on death so they are not escaping.

In addition, it would be very difficult for the Revenue Commissioners to administer such a scheme; the existing travel pass or tax saver scheme is transparent in that the providers are listed in the legislation and the cost of the pass at the start of the year is known.  On the other hand, parking facilities are provided by a multitude of different providers, from multi-storey to waste ground, and at various rates.  <\/p><p>I would be concerned also that to extend the scheme in the manner proposed by the Deputy would perhaps have the unintended effect of increasing the distance driven by commuters before they switch to public transport.  Also, incentivising use of the car would appear contrary to the intention behind the travel pass legislation which was introduced in budget 1999 as a traffic-related measure.  In his budget speech at the time, the then Minister, Mr. McCreevy, stated that the scheme was being introduced &quot;to address the growing traffic problem in urban areas&quot;.

One of the ways that would go a portion of the way would be to reintroduce the second house tax.  Given the Government's position on LPT, I do not expect the Minister to accept the amendment.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 67 calls on the Government, within one month of the passing of the Act, to lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on the likely changes to the amount of LPT payable by households based on the most recent house price data and forecast for the net valuation period.  In July 2015, the Thornhill report called for a freeze on the valuation date and said any legislative change to defer the valuation date should be accompanied by the legislative changes necessary to reform the system as I have outlined.  While we got a freeze, we did not get the reform which Mr. Thornhill suggested.  Mr Thornhill was no politician facing an election.  Of his 83 page report, the only recommendation implemented was the recommendation to freeze the deferral date that was intended.  Even that was taken completely out of context.  It was supposed to allow for reform.  The report set out over more than 13 pages that LPT needed reform.  However, there is no mention in the programme for Government to touch the issue.<\/p><p>The freezing of the LPT was a cynical election move.  It cannot be deferred forever, and I want to figure out where the Government intends to go with it.  Our position is to abolish LPT.  The valuation date was May 2013.  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, at this point house prices were at 59.6% of the base which was calculated in 2005.  It is now almost 30 points above that, which means average house prices are almost 50% higher than they were when they were valued for LPT.  When the freeze ends and revaluation kicks in, many people are in for a terrible shock.  This is very clear.  My position is not for reform but abolition.  The tax has become bizarre tax.  It is called a local tax, but it is no more local than any other tax.  The only local element is that wealthier counties can afford to reduce it with no impact on services while poorer counties cannot afford to reduce it.  What is the Government going to do about it?  It is a poorly designed tax.  If the Government decides it will freeze it forever and the valuation date will always be May 2013, people will not face an increase.  If a revaluation takes place in two years' time based on current property prices, which have increased by 50%, people across the board will have to pay a higher LPT.  A report is required on the options for the likely changes in the amount of LPT in order that we can be informed of the movement and, if the valuation date were set, for example, next year, what it would mean for individuals and local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#L00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1190,"content":"<p>I will speak first to amendment No. 66 which seeks a report on options for the abolition of LPT.  LPT is designed to provide a more sustainable system of funding for local government and place the provision of local services on a sounder financial footing.  It has led to greater transparency and accountability at a local level and it is certain that the stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability created can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.  LPT is also a significant base broadening measure.  The level of income expected to be generated by LPT in 2017 is approximately &euro;460 million.  Deputies will be aware that, under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, Ireland may not introduce discretionary revenue reductions unless they are matched by other revenue increases or expenditure reductions.  This means the Government must consider carefully any tax changes as any reductions will have to be offset elsewhere by tax increases.  A report by the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, published on 4 November, includes the statement:<\/p><blockquote>An annual property tax is a tax on capital\/wealth and as such contributes to social equity.  The new Irish property tax has generous thresholds but is also a very stable tax.  It is hard to avoid and so is a sound source of revenue for the State.<\/blockquote> <p>As regards abolition of LPT, it is well established that the taxation of property through an annual recurring tax is less economically distortionary than the imposition of tax on income or capital.  This is supported by economic literature and OECD analysis which underscores how an annual tax on land and buildings has a relatively small adverse impact on economic performance.  Both international and domestic research indicate that property taxes are more growth friendly than taxes on labour.<\/p><p>The Government is determined to do everything in its power to protect and support the creation of jobs.  The introduction of a property tax is part of a broader approach to the taxation of property.  The aim is to replace some of the revenue from transaction-based taxes, which have proven to be an unstable source of Government revenue, with an annual recurring property tax, which international experience has shown to be a stable source of funding.  With LPT we have a stable source of funding which is fair and progressive, with the owners of the most valuable properties paying most.  The tax is equitable, has reference to ability to pay, conforms to international norms and significantly broadens the domestic tax base.  We have seen how previous over-reliance on revenue from transaction-based taxes, such as stamp duty, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax, led to a significant fall in tax revenue when the number and value of transactions decreased sharply from 2007 onwards as a result of the economic and banking crisis, creating enormous problems for Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal position.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 66.<\/p><p>Regarding amendment No. 67, I have taken on board the concerns expressed by home owners during the past two years regarding the potential impact of increasing property prices on their LPT liabilities, particularly in urban areas.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 provided for the postponement of the next LPT revaluation date from November 2016 to November 2019.  Projected impacts on LPT liabilities due to increasing property prices have been examined as part of the review of the operation of LPT which I initiated and which was completed in mid-2015.  The review was carried out by Dr. Don Thornhill, who chaired the interdepartmental group on the design of a local property tax in 2012, and it focused especially on the issue of property price developments.  Dr. Thornhill&rsquo;s report on the review of LPT was published on budget day last year on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The postponement of the revaluation date for LPT means home owners have not been faced with significant increases in their LPT for 2017 as a result of increased property values, and it gives sufficient time for the other recommendations in Dr. Thornhill&rsquo;s report to be considered in full.<\/p><p>The cost associated with the deferral of the revaluation date for LPT is estimated to be approximately &euro;125 million in a year.  The Thornhill review of the local property tax estimated an increase in LPT collection to &euro;560 million in 2015 if residential properties were revalued at May 2015 property prices.  This compared with the &euro;435 million estimated LPT collection in 2015 if May 2013 property valuations were maintained.<\/p><p>If factors such as property prices and the rate of exemptions and deferrals were to remain the same until 2019, the estimated cost, as I said, would be &euro;125 million per annum, not taking into account any changes in property prices since the review.  The amendment sought would be a significant undertaking and would only be appropriate in the context of the wider work on LPT.<\/p><p> A previous exercise which examined the impact of property price developments for LPT liability for the period May 2013 to May 2015 as part of the Thornhill review took approximately six months to complete and required significant resources.  The results from that report are likely to be still valid in terms of the distribution of the changes in LPT liability, though the level of the changes would be higher, reflecting more recent increases in property prices.  The review found that revaluation as of May 2015 would have been associated with: significant increases in tax liabilities for some taxpayers; higher value properties as of May 2013 experiencing the largest increase in tax liability; and a wide degree of regional variation in changes in liability, with the largest increases mainly occurring in the Dublin area.  Forecasting of future property prices would be fraught with difficulty and would likely be highly inaccurate even at an aggregate level.  Forecasts at a more detailed level which estimated different price paths on the basis of location and property characteristics would be even more unreliable.  It would be misleading to base estimates of changes in household LPT liability on such forecasts.  In light of these considerations, I am not supposed to accept the amendment.<\/p><p> On questions raised by Deputy Doherty as he proposed the amendment, there are obviously two variables.  There is the value of the property subject to LPT, but also the rate at which the LPT is charged.  I am sure that whatever Minister is involved in reassessing the position in advance of a new revaluation date of 2019 will take both variables into account in order that dramatic increases in property taxes for individuals would be avoided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#L00400","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1192,"content":"<p>The Minister gave no indication of the recommendations of the 83-page report by Dr. Thornhill on needed reforms in 13 areas or when they would be carried out.  All we have at this point in time is a date in November 2019 when the revaluation of the LPT liability will take place.  All of us in this room know what that means.  It means that nearly every household in the State will see an increase in their local property tax.  It is likely that most households will go up at least one step.  In some areas, as the Minister mentioned, where house prices have been accelerating at a faster rate, particularly in certain parts of Dublin, we could even see a two-step increase, which could be significant.  In my view, there is a need to inform people and the debate as to what is going to happen.  The Government talks about how this is progressive taxation and all the rest, yet the whole point of the local property tax is that it is meant to be linked to one's asset.  If it is not linked to one's asset, then it is not a local property tax.  Unfortunately, the way that this family home tax has been structured means that people are actually paying on their liability.  People in negative equity still have to pay this.<\/p> <p>  I encourage the Minister to carry out the report and to issue a comprehensive statement in response to Dr. Thornhill's report on where the Department stands on the reforms that he has recommended in order that we can have a fuller discussion.  There are other issues that need to be addressed.  Unfortunately, my amendment No. 68 has been ruled out of order.  That is related to issues of muscovite MICA.  It is a plight in particular areas in Donegal in which buildings are crumbling.  There has been excellent investigative journalism carried out by RT&Eacute; that looked at this issue in great detail.  There is a need for the Government to address this issue.  I note that the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has made comments on this in the past.  We need some action and the Minister for Finance has a role in that.<\/p> <p>  I have one last point I wish to make about the local property tax.  We were told at the time that there would be exemptions.  As we know now, there are no exemptions from the local property tax, not even for those on the lowest incomes.  There are people in the courts at this point in time, where the banks are trying to take their homes from them.  They are still subject to this liability, as are those in negative equity and so on.  What we do have is a deferral.  People have to be on very low incomes to be able to avail of the deferral.  How can we justify the fact that the State is charging them an interest rate of 4%, at a time when one would not even get a 1% interest rate on savings one has in the bank and when the country is able to borrow at less than 1%?  The local property tax is still accruing on the people who are on the lowest incomes in society and who are therefore able to prove to the State that they do not have the resources to pay it.  On top of that, a 4% interest applies.  When this was decided, interest rates were very different to what they are now.  In my view, it is completely unjustifiable.  Despite my reservations about an opposition to the overall local property tax, the idea that we continue to apply a 4% interest rate for people who cannot afford their local property tax is wrong.  It is profiteering off the back of people who already cannot afford to pay in the first place.  I encourage the Minister to change the interest rate charge for deferred payments to an appropriate rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#M00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1193,"content":"<p>As well as accepting Dr. Thornhill's proposal that the revaluation date would be deferred to 2018 or 2019, I accepted and enacted other proposals and amendments as well.  For example, proposals regarding the treatment of property with pyrite defects and properties adapted for persons with disabilities were enacted in the Finance Act 2015.  I know there are other problems in the quality of building materials, particularly in counties in the north west of Ireland.  The Department with responsibility for building standards is the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  I understand that an expert panel on concrete blocks was established by that Department in April 2016 to investigate the problems that have emerged in the concrete block work of certain dwellings in Donegal and Mayo.  The terms of reference of the panel have been published.  In general, the terms of reference were designed to establish the facts behind the problems that have emerged in Donegal and Mayo and to outline technical options for addressing the problems identified in order to assist affected homeowners.  When it was set up in April, the terms of reference required it to report within six months and to advise on solutions.  That report should come to hand pretty quickly.  We can then consider all of the issues that are wrung from it.  I agree with the Deputy that, on the basis of the evidence at this stage, there is a problem and a genuine cause for concern.  I await the advice of the technical report to see what way that can be remediated or what the parent Department proposes by way of remediation.<\/p> <p>  The 4% rate is half of the standard rate of 8% that applies to late payment of LPT.  It is not related to current interest rates, but it was 50% off the penalty rate that applied to late payments of LPT.  As I say, the revaluation date is to take place from 2019.<\/p><p>The Government of the day would have to make a decision about it in advance.  The programme for Government has committed to a general review of measures to boost local government leadership and accountability.  That is agreed in the programme for a partnership Government.  It provides for the preparation of a report by mid-2017 and it would be very difficult to develop such a report without taking into account how property tax is operating in local authorities and reflecting on some of the other recommendations made by Dr. Thornhill.  Deputy Doherty will get his report anyway arising from that commitment in the programme for Government, although it will not be related solely to property tax.  Without having seen any draft terms of reference, property tax would be within the remit of the consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#M00300","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1195,"content":"<p>I take the point and we can leave the amendments aside for a moment.  There is the figure of 4% and the late payment is 8%, so it is usually a once-off when a person has not paid on time or decided not to pay and so on.  The problem with the 4% figure is that it continues.  It could apply to a person with a very low income, such as a pensioner, but with an expensive house in Dublin.  The person could be asset rich and cash poor and have deferred the tax liability.  The 4% rate would be applied every year and if the property is sold, the quantum would be paid.  It could also be paid if the person gains employment or comes into additional income.  That is very different from the late payment rate, as it continues to build and becomes quite substantial.  A 4% figure applied to &euro;500 might not be much at &euro;20 but if that is extended to ten years it is &euro;200.  However, it is not just for one year and if an individual cannot pay for the second year, there is another &euro;200 over the period and so forth.  There can be quite a big liability arising for individuals who simply do not have the ability to pay.  A late payment occurs with individuals who have not been permitted by the Department to defer the payment.  The people I refer to meet criteria and it is acknowledged that they cannot pay.  They are the poorest in society.  This penalty is excessive and there is no rationale for it.<\/p> <p>  The only question should be whether the State is losing money as a result of the deferral and it would not if it were reduced to 1%.  The State would benefit more as a result of these low income individuals deferring their payment.  That is not justifiable under any grounds.  I ask the Minister to consider that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#N00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1196,"content":"<p>The 4% figure arises from a scheme that was included for the benefit of home owners who did not have the cash flow to pay property tax.

This allows people to defer the property tax and it accumulates as a charge on the property.

I have debated this with the Minister every year since he introduced the amendment allowing for the banks that incurred massive losses during the financial crash to carry forward those losses against taxable profits.  When this was introduced, the banks were on the floor and the Government stepped in to assist the banks, as it had done in previous years.  The banks are no longer on the floor.  There may be borrowers in significant distress as a result of the banks' attitude towards them but we can consider that AIB has annual profits of &euro;1.9 billion, while Bank of Ireland has a profit of &euro;1.2 billion and is paying dividends again.  This rule allows the banks to deal with their losses during the financial crisis to reduce their tax liability to the State.<\/p><p>We all know banks must pay their fair share.  This should not only be the money pumped in by the State for them; it should be in excess of the euro for euro amount because we had to borrow that money at a significant interest rate.

Allowing banks to carry forward losses in the way that is currently applicable is completely and utterly unjust.  I am not permitted to ask the Minister to end the scheme but I ask him to bring forward a report.  Let the Department examine this and put the issue in black and white before Oireachtas Members.

The provision limited the amount of prior-year losses that a NAMA participating institution could offset against trading profits to 50% of trading profit for each accounting period.  It should be noted that it did not disallow any tax losses from being utilised but instead lengthened the period over which they could be used.  In 2013, I decided it was appropriate to remove the restriction on relief for losses in participating institutions, with effect from accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.  This was done against the backdrop of the introduction of the new capital rules under the EU Capital Requirements Directive, CRD Four.  The removal of the restriction has protected the carrying value of deferred tax assets at the banks in which the State has a significant stake, thus improving capital ratios under the new Basel III rules and consequently increasing the value of the State&rsquo;s investment.<\/p> <p>  The removal of section 396C enabled the banks to absorb their losses over a shorter timeframe than would be the case with a 50% limit in place.  Whereas corporation tax will not be payable on the banks' trading profits until their losses are fully absorbed, the net effect of the measure in terms of tax receipts is largely one of timing.  This will be offset by an improvement in the valuation of the State&rsquo;s equity stakes in the banks, as well as its debt investments, while the risk to the State as backstop provider of capital is also reduced.<\/p> <p>  In conjunction with the removal of section 396C, in 2013 the Government also decided that the banking sector should make an annual contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period from 2014 to 2016.<\/p><p>The banking sector should make a contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period 2014 to 2016.  As part of budget 2016, I announced proposals to extend this levy to 2021 subject to a review taking place of the methodology used to calculate the levy.  The new methodology has been included in this year's Finance Bill.  Between 2017 and 2021, the levy is expected to raise &euro;750 million, which reflects the significant role played by the banking sector in the economic crisis.  Although significant trading losses carried forward are reported on the corporation tax returns submitted by covered banks, the timing of when these losses will be utilised will be determined by future profitability.  The banks typically manage losses on a group basis in accordance with the group relief provisions provided for in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  While revenue for the banks may be protected by these losses in the short term, this position may change for later years as the relevant banks return to profitability.

The motivation for the change in 2013 arose from CRD 4 and the new capital rules for banks under Basel III.  Up to then, it was possible to continue to use potential losses in a bank in calculating the off-setting arrangements against tax liability as part of tier 1 capital.  When the change took place, it was in ease of the taxpayer that I removed the 50%.  If we had not done it this way, we would have had to put extra capital into the banks at that time.  The extra capital would have had to be taken from either borrowing or Exchequer funds.<\/p> <p>  It is not that the banks will pay less over time.  Everyone knows that recovering the Irish banks is a long term rather than a short-term game.  They will pay the same amount of tax over time but there is an advantage in doing what we did in 2013 in terms of making provision for the capital required for the banks under the Basel III arrangements.  That was one of the key factors at the time.  I also took on board the arguments being put forward now by Deputy Doherty and others.  These arguments were put forward at the time as well.  I took them on board so that the banks would make a contribution to remediate the crisis they were significantly responsible for causing.  Rather subjecting them to the normal corporation tax regime, we introduced a levy system of &euro;150 million a year from the banking sector.  I announced on budget day that we were extending in the Finance Bill the &euro;150 million per annum levy to 2021.  That guarantees a tax take of an additional &euro;750 million.  I also said the calculation of this would have to be changed because it adversely affected foreign banks.  We need better targeting in that regard.  It was related to the amount of DIRT paid by banks as well.  We know what has happened with the lower percentages on DIRT and the amount of DIRT paid.  There is a change in the methodology, but the net result is the same; the banks will pay &euro;750 million in levies over the five year period 2017 to 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#O02000","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1220,"content":"<p>It is scandalous.

The Minister is correct that every country in the world has a regime in place for dealing with business losses.  The issue is that institutions that return to strong profitability are being allowed, as a consequence of built-up losses in the system, to opt out of making a contribution to taxation.  This is wrong, particularly in the case of Ireland, given that we have such a large built-up need for capital investment, as we discussed yesterday and earlier today.<\/p> <p>  Some years ago, the Minister for Finance at the time, the late Brian Lenihan, and one of his predecessors in that office and a former Taoiseach, Mr. Brian Cowen, agreed with me that the same circumstances which applied to high income earners at the time were a scandal.  As a result, they agreed to introduce a regime of minimum effective tax rates, similar to those in operation in many other countries.  Under this model, if a person has built up losses, he or she must contribute to taxation once profits exceed a significant level.  We have this formula in place for income tax and I am pleased that the Minister has maintained the model because it was the subject of much debate in the period after the crash.  This approach has served the country well.<\/p> <p>  We all want financial institutions to be viable and provide credit.  I fully concur with the Minister on that point.  However, in the context of a housing crisis in which construction companies and development firms have built up large losses, it is a mistake to allow the banks to effectively make no contribution when they return to significant profitability.  This does not address the country's needs.  While everyone recognises that losses are a particular feature of business and addressed in taxation systems, one cannot have circumstances in which banks begin to earn &euro;200 million, &euro;300 million or &euro;500 million per annum without making a contribution because there are accumulated losses in the system. <\/p> <p>  While it is not easy to address this issue, the various requests made by members should at least be examined.  We should learn more about the issue and work out a strategy for addressing it.  I am aware that the Minister does not favour hypothecating taxes, but some of these contributions should be directed into capital investment in third level education, an underfunded sector that has much catching up to do.  That would be an investment in the future economic sustainability of the country.  The details could be worked out.  The Minister should not simply reject our proposals.<\/p> <p>  I worked in business for a long time.  One can conduct comparative studies of different tax regimes, but the Minister's two immediate predecessors correctly saw fit to accept the principle we have outlined in respect of people with very high incomes who had available to them a large number of tax shelters.  A report in the D&aacute;il showed that many of those on incomes in excess of &euro;1 million per annum effectively paid no tax.  We finessed the tax code by introducing the concept of a minimum effective income tax rate and the Minister maintained this model.  As I stated previously, including during the debate on Apple, we should introduce a minimum effective tax rate for companies.  This issue was discussed in the debate on Apple and the tax treatment of some multinational companies.  We need to ensure individuals with strong incomes are contributors to the taxation system.  Equally, in the corporate sector, notwithstanding that it is technically more difficult to achieve, we should ensure profitable corporations with significant current profits are not able to avoid making a contribution to the economy through corporation tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#P00500","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1478772000,"counter":1232,"content":"<p>Deputy John McGuinness resumed in the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1233,"content":"<p>I am glad that the Chairman has rejoined us.  That is not a reflection on Deputy Michael D'Arcy.  <\/p> <p>  I have simply requested a report on many of the facts surrounding this issue and fully appreciate that it is an issue of timing.  What is happening is that banks are being treated like any other business and allowed to carry forward losses indefinitely.  What the late Brian Lenihan had the foresight to do in the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 was to provide that it would not be appropriate for financial institutions participating in NAMA to be treated like any other business.  As a result of section 396C of the Taxes Consolidation Act, he made it clear that a portion of the participating institutions' income should be taxed in any given year.  He achieved this by inserting in the legislation a provision that only 50% of losses could be carried forward in any given year.  That was the purpose of the provision.<\/p> <p>  The Minister argued that in previous years he changed this provision.  The former Minister's objective was clear.  I was about to refer to a statement he made when I was interrupted by the Acting Chairman.  Mr. Lenihan stated the NAMA legislation limited the amount of trading income of a participating institution and all other participating institutions in the same group against which losses carried forward could be offset in any accounting period to 50%.  The objective, he continued, was to leave a portion of income in the tax net which would otherwise have been relieved by the use of losses carried forward.  Unused losses could, he added, be carried forward indefinitely by companies until they were fully utilised and this remained the position both for institutions involved in the NAMA process and companies generally.<\/p><p>That was the intention.  The Minister stated to us earlier today as well as in previous years that he got rid of section 396C because of the issue of capital and the risk that the State might have to recapitalise the banks because losses would not be accounted for in the way in which they are accounted for in terms of tier 1.  However, there is a question whether that argument remains the case today.  Time has moved on.  Banks have become more profitable.  I have given the Minister the figures that show the banks' capital has been restored.  The intention behind section 396C was the right one.  There may be merits in what he did a number of years ago in the Finance Bill, but there is a question whether that is still the case.  I am asking for a report.  Is the decision the Government took at that time still as valid today?  Is the issue, which the Minister has repeated today, of a fall below the capital requirements of the banks, still valid?  If not, then it is an issue of timing, but the State needs additional revenue now.  Let us say that an assessment by the Minister's Department stated that reverting to what was originally in the tax code would not impact the capital position of the banks.  It obviously would not impact the profitability of the banks because, one way or another, they will be able to carry forward these losses, either now or into the future.  However, it will not impact on their profitability.  The question is therefore whether we could revert to the position that existed under Brian Lenihan Jnr. and see the banks paying taxes now, next year and the year after that on the billions of euro in profits they are collectively making.  We will get those taxes at some time in the future because the losses will run out, but we need them now to deal with some of the crises we have in our society.  That is the argument I am making.  I am not saying that we should do that here and now because I cannot put forward that proposal, but at a bare minimum we should consider this issue, a report should be done - I cannot imagine that it would be hugely complex as much of the data are available - and it should be published.  This will continue to come up time and again, and we need to have an informed debate on it with all the facts.  That could easily be done by the Minister's Department, and I cannot see a reason for his resistance to not doing it.  If he is as sound in his arguments as he has expressed them today, a report of that nature could close this debate down, so I encourage him to accept the amendment I put forward seeking such a report to be commissioned by his Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#P00700","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1235,"content":"<p>I have made the main point but I add to it the wider question of the various deductions and allowances that a bank or any other corporate entity is allowed to avail of to write down its taxable income.  It is a scandal that is waiting to be uncovered when we dig into the detail.  We need a forensic analysis of every single one of these headings under which a bank or any other corporate entity is able to write down its tax liability.  Looking at the figures before me for 2011, I see there was &euro;39 billion in deductions and allowances under various headings that year.  The figure is pretty consistent - in fact, it is rising.  I do not know the more recent figures.  Every single one of the headings needs to be forensically investigated so that we can see whether we are being robbed.  We have a good bit of evidence and we know that these corporate entities employ the best tax lawyers and the big accountancy firms to find ways to reduce their tax liabilities under various headings.  Trying to keep up with them is a very difficult job.  We will discuss a number of the means later - the section 110s, the means by which Apple managed to avoid taxes and so on.  These losses carried forward constitute one of those very significant headings.  It is an absolute scandal.  Any forensic analysis of these headings under which taxable profits are written down would reveal that the Exchequer and the public are losing out a hell of a lot.  The very least the Minister could do is carry out a review of this, consider it closely and let us all see what is happening under this heading, how much potential revenue is being lost and what the case for and against it is.

Losses incurred in the carrying on of a trade are a normal fact of business life.  The provision of relief for such losses is a standard feature of our tax code and that of all other OECD countries.  It would be difficult to justify the taxation of business profits without also taking into account business losses.  The carry forward of unrelieved trading losses is a usual feature in other tax jurisdictions, and that is the way corporation tax applies to business and how losses are treated.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the banks, the late Brian Lenihan Jnr. introduced the NAMA legislation at a very sensitive time.  He brought in this provision.  It was a decision which made the passage of the Bill more acceptable, but he never had any expectation that there would be a tax on bank profits at that point because there was no expectation that a bank would be profitable even if it were allowed to offset 50% of it losses against future profitability.  It was not envisaged that the recovery would be rapid enough to put bank into profitability on the other 50%.  That was not the issue.  It changed in 2013 because circumstances had changed, in particular with the treatment under CRD IV of core tier 1 capital for banks provisioning.  The capacity to write off historic losses against future profits was included in the calculation of capital requirements, but under Basel IV a termination date was put on this, and beyond a certain point it was signalled that this would not be acceptable.  That is why I made the change.  However, like the late Brian Lenihan Jnr., I envisaged that it would be generally unfair if the banks that had been such a causal factor in the recession that was visited on us were to pay no tax at all.  Therefore, to substitute for the possibility of their only offsetting 50%, I introduced the levy, at &euro;150 a year, and in this budget we have announced the renewal of that to 2020.  Overall, therefore, about &euro;1 billion will have been collected from the banks from 2011 to 2021 or whenever it is.<\/p><p>It is based on the DIRT paid, so it is related to the deposit base of the banks.  Deputy Burton talked about a minimum tax regime for the banks.  That is, in effect, what the levy is designed to do, to ensure that the banks pay a minimum amount of tax and that it is related to the deposit base.  However, it is not a <i>de minimis<\/i>provision like the 30% that must be paid in the personal tax code because personal taxes are paid on income whereas corporation tax is paid on profit.  There is an assessment of the potential profit when the levy is being imposed.

They were vindicated when they took a case in that regard, even though at the time of the dispute there were denials that there was a problem.<\/p><p>There has also been an interesting variation in the figures given by the Department in response to questions as to how many people are categorised as self-employed in the construction area.  At one point I received a reply stating that there were approximately 30,000 and then we were told it was over 60,000.  In fact, there is also a figure that puts it as high as 70,000.  To have that level of self-employment among the 130,000 people working in construction immediately tells one that it is being abused.  I do not believe for a minute that more than half of all those working in construction are self-employed entrepreneurs.  It makes no sense in terms of how construction operates.  Signs of it are seen in cases such as the Kishoge dispute.  The workers at the centre of it believed themselves to be employed by the main contractor.  Then they were not paid for weeks, after which one of them was paid and was told that he was a sub-contractor and the boss of all the rest.  They were unaware of this.  This is what is happening, and it is on a widespread basis.  Frankly, everybody knows this is happening, but there is no serious effort to deal with it.<\/p><p>Many of the people who are categorised as self-employed simply do not fit any of the criteria that should apply to the self-employed, such as having offices and the like.  They do not have any of this stuff.  Clearly, they are people who have been taken on by the contractor but he does not wish to pay the various contributions, sick pay and so forth which he would have to pay if the person was categorised as directly employed on PAYE.  As a result, there is evidence to suggest that the taxpayer is losing a huge amount of tax revenue due to people being wrongly categorised.  Unfortunately, I do not have the figures with me now but I have quoted them to the Minister in the past.  There have been parliamentary questions on this issue and the replies show a minus figure in some years under the RCT tax heading.  In some years the State pays out more in refunds under this heading than it receives, in a situation where 60,000 people are categorised as self-employed.  The State ends up with a minus figure.  Even when the figure is a plus, it is a very small amount of money compared to the number of people employed.  If those 60,000 people, or even half of them, were categorised correctly as PAYE workers there would be tens of millions, possibly hundreds of millions, of euro in additional tax revenue for the State.  There is wholesale abuse.<\/p><p>There is a further piece of evidence of how this is continuing.  The latest Purchasing Managers' Index shows that jobs growth in the construction sector is now at its weakest in 18 months, but we know that construction is growing at present.  The index points out that it is because outsourcing is accelerating, so there is job displacement.  As the construction sector begins to take off again our old friends, the developers, are up to the same old tricks again.  They are displacing properly paid jobs with these outsourced jobs to supposedly self-employed people who are not, in fact, self-employed people.  They are bricklayers, labourers and so forth who are being falsely categorised as self-employed.  This is Italian mafia style stuff taking place in the construction sector and there must be a serious move to deal with it.  It is very unfair to the workers, obviously, and it is also costing a huge amount of money for the taxpayer.  The Minister for Finance should be far more concerned about the urgent need to deal with this.  We are asking that a serious study be carried out in this area to get to the bottom of what is, regardless of how one looks at it, a very controversial and disputed matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#R00600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1245,"content":"<p>It is important to emphasise that the relevant contracts tax, known as the RCT system, does not determine the employment status of an individual engaged in the construction industry.  The design and development of the relevant contracts tax system was an anti-tax evasion measure to counteract tax evasion in the construction, forestry and meat processing sectors.  Principal contractors are required to deduct tax from the payments made to sub-contractors and pay it to the Revenue Commissioners.  As it is recognised that it would be undesirable to deduct tax from compliant sub-contractors, provision is made for these compliant sub-contractors to receive payments without deduction of tax.<\/p><p>The electronic relevant contracts tax, or eRCT, system was introduced with effect from 1 January 2012 and has reduced substantially the opportunities for fraud, mainly from bogus documentation, that attached to the previous paper-based RCT system.<\/p><p> It is important to emphasise that the system does not determine the employment status of any individual engaged in the construction industry.  Where the parties have entered into a contract for employment, that is, there is a principal and subcontractor relationship, the eRCT system operates to determine the tax obligations on all parties.  In contrast, where the parties have entered into a contract of employment, that is, there is an employer-employee relationship, PAYE operates on all payments made.<\/p><p> The Revenue Commissioners have undertaken to examine any case brought to their attention of \"bogus self-employment\".  In 2015, a sector-specific compliance programme was initiated for the construction industry, which included a focus on the mis-classification of employees by employers.  Interventions by Revenue into the construction industry in 2015, which have included audits, resulted in additional yield for the exchequer of &euro;51 million.<\/p><p> The code of practice for determining the employment or self-employment status of individuals was created to assist both parties to an engagement, including an engagement in the construction sector, in determining whether a contract of engagement is, by its nature, either a contract of service, that is, an employer and employee arrangement, or a contract for service, that is, not an employer and employee arrangement.  The code of practice is not a Revenue code, but was compiled with the assistance of a variety of Government and representative organisations.<\/p><p> Since RCT does not determine the employment status of an individual, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  Revenue is inviting members of the public, including elected representatives and members of trade unions, to draw to its attention any example of bogus self-employment and is committed to dealing with same.  While the Deputy has been strong in his general arguments, he has been short on specifics.  If he knows of specific cases, he should ring Revenue, which is committed to rooting out the practice.<\/p><p> The revitalised construction industry is moving away from the tradition of main contractors employing hundreds of workers towards a subcontractor model in which a developer with a small staff of administrators is bringing in people to pour foundations and lay blocks, electricians, carpenters and so on.  The different sectors of the building trade are organised on a subcontract basis to a greater degree than previously.  This is not to say that what they are doing is illegitimate or not Revenue compliant.  It is just a different model.<\/p><p> There is another factor.  The Deputy will see it if residential house building in Dublin gets reactivated to the same degree as commercial building.  Construction is largely becoming a manufacturing industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#R00700","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1247,"content":"<p>A what industry?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#S00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1248,"content":"<p>It is becoming a manufacturing industry rather than a construction industry.  A great deal of what goes into modern buildings is manufactured off site in factory-type environments and is brought on site to be put together.  One sees this in what is happening on the commercial side in Dublin.  It is not quite like assembling Lego, but there are construction companies that are supplied to a large extent by manufacturing companies.  I do not mean manufacturing construction materials.  Rather, they are manufacturing whole sections that can be put together.  This can be seen all over the city.  I am told that this model has moved on to housing as well.<\/p> <p>  Of course there is an issue with tax avoidance and evasion in many industries.  Revenue's activity is not just confined to construction.  There are similar problems in the pharma, IT, airline and other industries where subcontractors are employees under another name and there is tax evasion.

I am glad to hear the Minister acknowledge that there is some problem.  By the way, I have raised specifics.  I cannot spend my days and weeks wandering around building sites conducting spot checks, so I am dependent on calls from construction workers.  I have raised specific cases in the D&aacute;il when I have been tipped off by construction workers about particular sites.  For example, I raised a case in the D&aacute;il eight or nine months ago and there was a raid three or four weeks ago.  That was the delay between my naming a specific firm and site and a raid on that site.  From the report that I received from construction workers, Revenue found that a large number of people had been mis-categorised when it finally bothered to raid the site.  That was just one raid, and the problem is that there are not enough raids to identify a problem that is rampant.  Anyone working in construction will say so.  It is a clich&eacute; to say that the dogs on the street know, but there is wholesale abuse of the category of self-employment.  It is being dictated by contractors because they have the whip hand.  People approach contractors looking for jobs and believe that they have got them, only to discover that they are instead being categorised in this way and that, if they kick up a fuss, they will be out the door.  This is how it works.  Everyone knows it.<\/p> <p>  Consider the number of people who are supposedly self-employed.  It goes without saying that general labourers - bricklayers or particular trades people, for example - will comprise a larger portion of the workforce than managers or bosses, be the latter main contractors or subcontractors.  One would expect that the portion of people who are self-employed would comprise approximately one quarter of the construction workforce.  It is not a quarter, though.  Rather, it is approximately a half.  This suggests that major abuse is happening.  Any reasonable person looking at the situation would agree that that is what is happening.<\/p> <p>  A serious investigation is required.  I am not the only one raising this problem, as the Minister well knows.  ICTU has carried out reports on it and trade unions with significant numbers of members working in construction agree that it is happening.<\/p> <p>  I will go slightly off point, but the Minister has raised another matter.  It is true that there is a great deal of Lego-type construction.  It is not doing much for the quality of construction in Dublin, aesthetic or otherwise.  It is the cheapest way to bang stuff together and is too widespread.  Some of that is precisely because developers do not want to have to deal with troublesome workers like bricklayers, carpenters, stonemasons or so on, who do quality work and build quality buildings, because they demand things like the right to pay tax.  They cannot have that, so get rid of them and have as much of the Lego-type stuff that they can bang together as quickly as possible.  Its quality is poor.<\/p><p>This is something we have already learned to our cost with some of the construction practices in recent times.  More to the point, it is something people who have to live in certain places have learned to their cost.  I suspect we will find much more of it in the future.  Apart from anything else, skilled tradespeople and experienced construction workers are also the best police for the purposes of quality control, which has been significantly hit over recent years.<\/p><p> It is patently obvious that there is enough evidence in the form of allegations, and from groups kicking up about it and saying there is a problem, to justify a serious investigation.  I can commit to bring to the attention of the Minister, Revenue and the public any tip-offs I get, as I and others have done in the past.  If a serious allegation of widespread abuse of the tax system or of employment rights is made, however, it is up to the State to look into it and to find out if there is a systemic problem, which I absolutely believe to be the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#S00500","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1252,"content":"<p>I disagree with the Deputy in one respect.  There is a lot of very high-quality, well-designed and well-built construction taking place in Dublin and it is much better than it was during the Celtic tiger.  The construction methods the Deputy deplores are the methods in use in every major city in the world, whether the temperatures are above or below freezing point.  One does not mix concrete when the temperature drops below freezing point or one will end up with a load of cracks, as anybody who ever put down a concrete path will know.<\/p> <p>  There is not much difference between the Deputy's general thesis, except for his style of expression, and the approach of the Revenue Commissioners.  An alleged loss of employer PRSI to the Exchequer because of an employers' behaviour in the construction sector is acknowledged by Revenue as a high risk from a tax compliance point of view.  I am informed that Revenue is monitoring the sector for abuses of tax, and the duty system forms part of its ongoing compliance programme, to which it commits significant resources.  In view of the welcome growth in activity in the sector, Revenue has an extensive dedicated focus on construction to target the various tax compliance risks associated with the sector.  As I pointed out, one of its initiatives collected tax due of &euro;51 million and the Revenue Commissioners will continue their work in this area.  It is not difficult for people to be compliant in a business where they go to work every morning and clock into the same building, but the building industry is transitory and people move from site to site, from contract to contract and from city to city.  Compliance is more difficult but Revenue is dedicated to compliance and it has made a lot of progress.  I do not believe it is as bad as the Deputy makes out but I am also sure there is some tax evasion.  As construction activity continues and it gets more difficult to get key workers, the potential for exploiting construction workers will become more limited.  When everybody was looking for a job, it was easy to do deals with people and such deals might not have been fully tax compliant.  The Revenue Commissioners are doing their job and will act on any information provided to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#T00200","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1253,"content":"<p>It is not a simple issue and it has been going on for years.  Certain individuals will feel they will benefit from designation as self-employed, even though it will be bogus self-employment.  They would not look at the impact of having no sick leave or the protection given by PRSI, and some employers would be of the same view.  The Government has acknowledged that there is an issue.  The Minister has acknowledged it and, when Minister, Deputy Joan Burton initiated a consultation process in January this year.  When discussing a similar amendment put forward by Deputy Boyd Barrett, we were told to wait for the consultation process, which was ongoing.<\/p> <p>  Four options were outlined in chapter 8 of the report and ICTU put forward sensible proposals that the onus should be on the contractor and individual to prove their contracts were contracts for services.  One of the proposals was that everybody would be treated as a PAYE worker until they could prove otherwise.  Another proposal was that contractors should be levied a sum equivalent to the PRSI liability, to be repayable only on satisfactory approval of employment status by Revenue.  At the moment it is up to Revenue.  The industry is transient and people are working on one site today while they may be working on another site as a contractor on another day.  It is very hard to pin all of this down, and putting the onus on Revenue to investigate means we will be chasing our tails a lot of the time.  It would require intensive input from Revenue personnel, but the PRSI loss from every bogus self-employed worker is &euro;2,886 and it has to be asked if chasing that type of money is worth the effort.  It is also about workers' rights and we need to rebalance the situation.<\/p> <p>  It would be wrong to suggest that every self-employed person working on a construction site is bogus, as they are not.  There is no doubt, however, that this is the way the system works in Ireland.  Friends of mine thinking of coming back from London and Glasgow will not do so at the minute because prices are not right.  When they do come back, however, they know they will be deemed self-employed because that is the only way they will get the price from the contractor.  They will sacrifice their security and sick leave for the extra cash in their pockets in the short term.  I am not talking about my friends but generally.

There is a great deal of bogus self-employment in Ireland and it is not helpful to the long-term sustainable growth of the Irish economy not to review our systems with a view to limiting this.  It is pervasive in other areas, too.  Has the Minister received any report on the outcome of Revenue's examination?  Many people in Revenue have been very anxious about this.  There is a great difference between self-employed businesspeople, who set up firms and employ other people, and people who are forced into being treated as self-employed in the construction industry.  The difficulties down the line for many individuals are quite significant.  Construction is, by and large, a young man's game and it is very difficult to convince 25 year olds and 30 year olds that by only paying the 4%, they are not looking after their own best long-term interests.  They do not believe they will fall off scaffolding or end up injured in some way, leading to life-long difficulties.  They also do not believe that, even if the industry picks up again, it may go into a decline at some later stage.<\/p><p>At such a stage and particularly if their partner or spouse is working, they will not qualify for any kind of unemployment assistance support.  It has really big consequences for many individuals who then become quite impoverished.  If they also have children and other family dependants, the whole family can become impoverished.  While it is an industry issue, it is also a really big social issue.  It also concerns the sustainability of our social services.  We know that it is spreading like wildfire across different types of businesses where the gig economy exists and you pick out a self-employment part of a job and identify people as contractors.  Again, quite a lot of this is happening in IT.  The work of people in IT is often much more sustainable and long term than that of people in construction.  It is one thing when people are in their 20s but when they get into their 30s and have no framework for longer term sustainable employment, it has huge implications for their place in society and is very difficult for them.  It is an economic and social welfare issue but it is also a societal issue in Ireland.  Could the Minister give us an update on where the study is?  <\/p><p> Revenue and the Department of Social Protection are collaborating in carrying out examinations at sites.  In respect of school building, which was a specific concern for the past number of years and where the State was paying top dollar on the contracts, the former Minister for Education and Skills, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, actually got the Department of Education and Skills to hire what were in effect private investigators to check out the sites to see what was happening.  Trade unions and ICTU are very familiar with the outcomes.  If Revenue and the Department of Social Protection go on site, they check people out and find that they are registered.  I do not know what is happening.  Do they have two sets of books - one for when they are working in the normal economy and another that is under the table or off the regular books?  It is a very big problem here.<\/p><p> We are also seeing a return to an increase in immigration.  The Minister spoke earlier about a potential shortage of skilled building workers.  If people from countries like Poland come in and are outside our system, it is a mug's game for us if they are not fully registered for tax and insurance.  They are competing against good firms who are paying people properly.  This is what happened to the Minister's predecessors at the height of the Celtic tiger.  If we go down that road again, it will be a mug's game for Irish society.  People will come, be bogusly self-employed and not contribute to social welfare.  The people who are paying PAYE will have to pick up the tab.  Ultimately, the people paying their contributions will have to pick up the tab.  <\/p><p> Nobody is saying there is an easy solution.  It is a very tricky area to legislate for but this is a critical area in terms of looking for reforms in the Irish system.  If people want to set up their own businesses, that is the best thing in the world and we have developed lots of supports for them.  However, if they have no choice, are at the lower end and are really stuck in a seriously unprotected area, that is all our loss and a particular loss to the individuals involved.  I ask the Minister and his officials to give some thought as to how we could work together to address what is an awful problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#T00400","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1256,"content":"<p>As someone who has operated the new RCT system as an accountant, I would point out that there is a significant amount of genuine self-employment.  Revenue has never been in possession of as much data as it has now.  If one takes into consideration the changes that have happened since 2016 in terms of a principal actually registering a contract through the eRCT system, one will see that the site location, the value of the contract and various details of the employee in question have to go in.  Revenue has all that data whereby it can furnish aspect queries or Revenue audits directly to that firm or principal contractor.  That is going on.  I have seen detailed audits.  A company or a principal must account for everyone on their books in terms of whether they are self-employed or in the PAYE system.  Obviously, it is a significant blow to them if they are found to have self-employed individuals who should be employees.  The code of practice is very clear on that.<\/p> <p>  I would point out that there is a lot of rigour in terms of someone getting a 0% payment from the eRCT system because, obviously, Revenue determines what deduction should be given to a contractor.

While there are issues, many of them are due to fraud and are being clamped down on by Revenue.  Revenue has the data to go after a lot of these cases.

The Minister said that construction is reporting growth in all areas and has grown consistently for the past three years.  However, as I pointed out to him, job growth is stagnating.  The PMI report I mentioned previously states that while the rate at which companies outsource work to subcontractors grew the fastest in three months, they are displacing direct employment.  As construction picks up again, the move back towards subcontracting that was a major feature of the last construction boom is returning and with it, almost inevitably, an increase in bogus self-employment - replacing directly employed people with stuff that is outsourced, which opens up to all of the bogus self-employment.  It is in that outsourcing that we see all the bogus self-employment.  I accept that there are legitimately self-employed people in construction.  I know that is the case but when the proportion of people who are categorised as self-employed is as high as it is and is increasing significantly while job growth is stagnating, that suggests that the abuse of the category of self-employment is increasing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#U00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1259,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#U00500","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1260,"content":"<p>I thought it was a very interesting discussion.  All I can do is reaffirm that Revenue is paying particular attention to any instances of bogus self-employment it comes across and that it regards the construction industry as being one of the high-risk areas.  Revenue has taken action and as I have already pointed out, one piece of work yielded &euro;51 million in additional taxes.<\/p><p>Deputy Burke has given a professional accountant's point of view of how the system has been tightened up with the new electronic system since its introduction in 2016.  This is very effective.  Whenever a sector is coming out of a recession, it takes a while before it fully legitimises itself.  If construction workers are unemployed and then get intermittent work, the tendency is to continue signing on and take the week's work and sign on the following week.  It is not until people have a sense of security about having a continuing job that they make the arrangements that bring them fully back in.  We have already discussed a scheme for self-employed people whereby the first &euro;40,000 in income for a two-year period would be exempt of tax and Deputy Doherty made the interesting proposal that we split the &euro;80,000 involved into four units of &euro;20,000 rather than two of &euro;40,000.  We have built an incentive into the tax code for someone coming off the live register to be self-employed rather than be an employee.  In reply to Deputy Doherty's amendment I said the cost of that scheme had exceeded the forecast and that the take-up was stronger than anticipated.  I believe some of that is reflected in people being incentivised to style themselves as self-employed and providing services to the construction industry.  Many do so legitimately.<\/p><p> There are certain categories of work where services in particular are being provided to different users where people need to be self-employed.  It is increasingly true of the information technology, IT, industry.  If one brings someone in to reconfigure the software in an office, that person might work for three or six months and move on to the next job.  People in the IT industry are increasingly self-employed.  This applies across all professions with engineering or architectural consultants, quantity surveyors and so on, connected to the building industry.  There is an increasing incidence of self-employment too in areas associated with new technology.<\/p><p> I do not disagree with most of the points made and Revenue has to be vigilant and I am sure it will be aware of the discussion here today because there are Revenue officials present and listening to the committee's contributions.  We can take it forward by replying to the former T&aacute;naiste's question about the consultation undertaken jointly by her and me starting in January of this year, and Deputy Doherty raised this as well.  The consultation was on the use of intermediary type employment structures and self-employment arrangements and their impact on tax and pay related social insurance, PRSI.  That was the mission statement when it was set up.  We received 23 submissions, one of which was from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, which were all relevant to the issue.  They were passed on to a working group comprising officials of the Departments of Social Protection and Finance.  They were also passed on to the Revenue Commissioners.

When it was first proposed, it was to be a pilot scheme for Georgian Dublin.  Then for a couple of years Brussels was sizing it up, changes were proposed and we had a much wider scheme, including residential and commercial elements.  Now it is for any building although previously it was for buildings built before 1915, and it is for any size of building.  There are strict criteria to designate areas in cities.<\/p><p>I think it is fair to say the Department of Finance has been very generous in its interpretation of these criteria, for example, in a chunk of Limerick city near O'Connell Street.  The person who was paid by the Department to draw up the designated areas recommended the following for Limerick:<\/p><blockquote>While Limerick City Council has sustained its case for designation of a Special Regeneration Area, the inclusion of more affluent streets, including much of O&rsquo;Connell Street itself, and Pery Square, is questionable, as is the inclusion of areas of significant redevelopment in the area north of Sarsfield Street and west of Patrick Street, and also the redevelopment of Cruise&rsquo;s Street.  It is recommended that the City Council should identify sub-areas within the overall proposed boundary which adhere more closely to the Department&rsquo;s criteria; the smaller northern sub-area (Nicholas Street \/ Mary Street) should be accepted.<\/blockquote><p>However, the entire area was included on the advice of the Department's officials.  The most affluent areas were included for redevelopment, even though they clearly fell outside the criteria for the scheme at the time.<br\/><br\/>As the Minister knows, I have always been cautious about this scheme.  The only difference I can see between it and Fianna F&aacute;il's old section 23 scheme which we discussed at length and which was criticised by most people is that this scheme has been capped on the insistence of the European Union because of state aid rules.  With that exception, the provision of 100% relief over a ten-year period is the same as that in the old section 23 plan.  As Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett said, we are now allowing landlords to avail of the scheme also.  There has been little interest under it in some cities.  Despite the redesignation of the areas recommended by the independent person - he said certain areas should not be designated - there has been absolutely no interest in the scheme in the Minister's city of Limerick.  I understand where he is going in this regard in so far as we are in the middle of a housing and homelessness crisis.  I am sure that is the argument that will be made.  There may be a tax angle in incentivising new builds, landlords and all the rest.  Landlords have a legitimate business in providing accommodation in the State for renters.  Landlords, homeowners and local authorities have their respective roles in providing social housing.<br\/><br\/>I have serious reservations about the scheme because it has morphed into something that was never intended.  It was supposed to be a targeted small-scale initiative, but it is growing and morphing into something it was never intended to be.  I do not think any of the analysis of the scheme up until now has justified its existence.  I would like to hear the Minister's opinion on why it is still not working in cities such as Limerick.  Why have no applications been received?  As I said previously, the argument that seems to be made when a pilot scheme is introduced is that it is worth taking a risk and trying it and that if it does not work out, it does not work out.  Rather than letting the scheme wither, the Minister has decided to pump more steroids into it by providing that it can apply to any building of any size and to landlords.  Now the idea of living over the shop does not apply anymore.  It is no longer a living city initiative but a property initiative and a tax incentive for property development initiatives, similar to section 23.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#V01200","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1275,"content":"<p>I disagree with the Deputy.  First, the scheme is not being extended to apply to any building.  It is still confined to buildings built before 1915.  They have to be within the designated areas set out when the scheme was initiated.  There is no new designation of areas into which buildings would fall.  There has been a disappointing uptake because the conditions attached to the scheme, particularly with regard to square footage, were too restrictive.  A typical Georgian building in Limerick, typically three or four storeys over a basement, almost by definition falls outside the square footage requirement for the purposes of eligibility.  The cost of refurbishing a prestige Georgian building is greater than that of a new-build on a greenfield site.  When people looked at the numbers, they found that they did not work.  The advantage of the living city initiative is that it passed muster with the European Union from a state aid perspective after two years of difficult negotiations in Brussels.  It is worth persisting with for that reason.  The amendments I am introducing are considered by state aid authorities in Brussels as <i>de minimis<\/i>provisions.  We can do this without needing further permission.  Two changes are being made, one of which is the elimination of the restriction on square footage in the case of Georgian and other historic buildings.  It is true the buildings built in our main cities before 1915 tended to be large.  The scheme is targeted at such buildings.  Its aim is still to encourage the regeneration of designated areas in the nominated cities.  We are making <i>de minimis<\/i>changes that qualify for state aid purposes to see if they will work.  A number of Deputies have stated categorically that all of the old section 23 schemes which we abolished did not work.

I am not saying we will bring them back, but I do not think we should exclude the tax incentivisation of projects for social or economic purposes from the tax code as a matter of principle.  The living city initiative has been ratified for state aid purposes.  The <i>de minimis<\/i>amendments being proposed do not extend the scope of the scheme beyond the existing designated areas.  Two things are being changed.  First, I am changing the square footage limitation because it has inhibited the scheme.  We introduced it to avoid abuse, but it has limited the scheme to the point that there has been hardly any uptake in some cities.  Second, I am extending the scheme to landlords because, as all Members of the D&aacute;il have pointed out, there is a rental crisis, a shortage of rental accommodation and a homelessness crisis.  We must incentivise the supply of suitable rental accommodation if we can.  If we can introduce tax breaks to make it worthwhile for somebody to turn a Georgian building of four storeys over a basement into modern and well fitted-out apartments, that can make a big contribution to the availability of rental accommodation.  I do not think the scheme will work unless the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government changes some of its regulatory regimes.  Frankly, it is too costly to refurbish an old building.  The policy intention and desire of Parliament is not being matched by the regulatory regime imposed on developers who might carry it out.  I am not looking for low-quality development or anything like it.  I am not in the business of arguing that case.  It is possible that this minor and low-cost proposal will make another contribution to a series of initiatives that have been brought forward by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government with the intention of increasing the supply of residential accommodation for purchase and rental.  I am using the living city initiative which has not been very successful as a vehicle at this stage because it had already passed muster under state aid rules.  If we were to start a new scheme, we would have to pass the state aid test again and it would be another two or three years before we could get it across the line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#W00800","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1282,"content":"<p>I will put the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#W00900","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1283,"content":"<p>My amendment No. 63 on section 14 was ruled out of order.

It is coming from the Institute of Directors in Ireland, IoD, which has been peddling this idea for quite a while and now it has been proposed by Deputy McGrath.  I would fall into the category of Ciar&aacute;n Hancock's view on this; the Government should tell this group of elites to take a hike.  Hancock's article has given us examples of some of the individuals who would benefit from this measure.  The presentation put forward by Deputy McGrath speaks about people going to their groups and giving of their experience, but what the Deputy fails to mention is that many of these non-executive directors are actually doing so with large remuneration.  Ciar&aacute;n Hancock's article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>talks about one council member of the IoD as a non-executive director of Cement Roadstone Holdings, CRH who receives a fee of &euro;78,000 per year plus &euro;54,000 for serving as a member on two board committees.  It goes on to say that this person also serves on another board as a non-executive director, a foreign board, and receives a fee of &pound;45,000 per year and serves on a further board which paid her $55,000 in addition to $25,000 for serving on two board committees.  Other studies which have been done in the past, and particularly those from when we looked at the banking scenario, show that non-executive directors tend to be non-executive directors on a number of boards.  It is not unique to see a non-executive director on multiple boards.  This happens particularly with senior level business people and they are remunerated for that but the Government is considering bringing an amendment which would actually give them a tax relief for travelling to and from these board meetings, when they are paid handsomely on many of those boards.  Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly has put forward an argument that people are doing this of their own free will and for no remuneration, which is a separate issue.  That, however, is not what the Institute of Directors in Ireland has put forward.  The institute is looking for this measure to be treated the same as it is for foreign non-executive directors.  If this proposal comes forward from Government it would not have the support of Sinn F&eacute;in.

This amendment is about accidental landlords and I shall just take a moment to lay out the case.  The Minister and I have spoken about this before when I submitted a proposal in 2014.  I spoke with the Minister and his officials and they came back with various reasons why they did not feel was the way to go at the time.  Most of those reasons have been dealt with or can be dealt with.  The reason I am moving this amendment is because we have a situation, and we have spoken about this on a previous amendment yesterday, whereby there are many people who bought small apartments during the bubble and they went on to have kids.  They may have bought a small apartment on their own or as a couple they have gone from being a one-person or a two-person household to being a four or five-person household.  They find themselves trapped in that situation.  It is an unintended consequence of the crash where there are a considerable number of people of a particular age group who have one of five options available to them.  They are sitting in a small one or two-bed apartment, with two or three children.  It is not a situation in which anyone would want to bring up their children.  Option one is to sell the apartment and buy a small home, a two or three-bedroom semi detached house.  They cannot do that because they cannot save the deposit, which goes back to the conversation this committee had yesterday about first-time buyers who are in the same situation.  The people whose mortgages are in negative equity, I would argue, are in a worse situation in that not only are they paying the high rents that the first-time buyers have but, because of the age difference of some ten years, they tend to have more children at that time.  Therefore they are also dealing with very high child care costs.  Option one which is to sell the apartment and buy a two or three-bedroom semi-detached house further out is not available to most of these people because they cannot save the deposit to do this.<\/p><p>Option two is to keep the apartment that they have and try to get another mortgage with which to buy a two or three-bedroom house.<\/p><p>Given that the Central Bank's rules on how the negative equity apartment has to be dealt with, the banks essentially will not lend them any money.  We do not need to get into the detail, but I am happy to do so if the Minister wants.  Basically the Central Bank rules are such that virtually nobody in negative equity can keep a one or two bed apartment and rent it out and get another mortgage.  The third option is to rent out the small apartment and rent a two or three bed semi-detached house somewhere else that is more appropriate to raise the children.  They cannot do this because they are hit with double taxation, which is the purpose of the amendment and I will come back to it.  The only other two options available are to stay in the apartment, which is what many of them are doing and I imagine we would all agree this is not what anyone wants, or to rent out the apartment and not declare the income to Revenue, which obviously is not a situation anyone wants to be in either.<\/p><p> What I want to try to address here is giving these people a reasonable chance.  While they cannot sell the apartment and get another mortgage, they cannot save a deposit and they cannot keep the apartment and get another mortgage, what they can do is rent it out and rent themselves a three bed semi-detached in which to raise the children.  This is what I am trying to achieve.<\/p><p> At present, the tax system does something which I believe is double taxation and is an unintended consequence.  I do not believe the negative equity trap was ever envisaged by the tax rules.  It applies full PRSI, USC and income tax to the rental income people in this situation receive and gives no consideration to the rent they pay out.  We have a household whose net income and disposable cash have not changed.  Perhaps the people receive &euro;12,000 in rent and pay &euro;12,000 out in rent, but they still pay a mortgage.  Their income position is no different to that of a family who owns and is paying down a two or three bedroom semi-detached house, but their tax position is changed radically.<\/p><p> Let us assume people are taking in rent of &euro;1,500 a month and paying rent in a new place of &euro;1,500 a month.  Let us assume &euro;500 is used to pay down the interest on the apartment they own, so this is tax deductible.  What they are left with is a taxable income coming in as rent of &euro;1,000 a month.  This, on the basis the household comprises two people who are both out working, is taxed at the marginal rate.  They are hit with a tax bill of &euro;5,000 to &euro;6000.  This is not a marginal impact, it is a very material change in a situation.  Given that it is so marginal, the people are trapped.  They are faced with doing one of two things.  They can either break the law and hope they do not get caught by Revenue or they can stay in the apartment.  Some people in this situation are renting out the apartment, moving to a three bed semi-detached house and paying the &euro;6,000 extra in tax every year, but on that basis they are stuffed.  They pay rent, child care and an additional &euro;5,000 to &euro;6,000 a year payment.  This is the situation I am trying to avoid.<\/p><p> When I brought this to the Minister and his officials attention, part of the response I got was that it would be administratively very difficult to do because we would have to get valuations on whether people are in negative equity and whether this is changing on an annual basis.  Perhaps they are not in negative equity any more.  I agree this would be administratively very difficult to do.  In the discussions I had on this with the officials two years ago, it occurred to me that from a pure labour market mobility perspective we should not need to constrain it to negative equity.  Let us say somebody in the private, public or social sector who owns a house in Dublin is posted to Galway for three years.  That person would rent out the house in Dublin and rent a house in Galway.  As the tax law stands, this person would be hit with a &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 additional tax liability.  I do not believe this is intended either.<\/p><p> The amendment I propose, and I appreciate it probably needs to be checked by the Department and Revenue, is targeted at these accidental landlords, is to state that we do not want them hiding from Revenue or trapped in a one bedroom apartment with three children, so we will make the move tax neutral.  The way to keep it very simple is to state it applies across the board.  This would mean someone who owns a home in Cork and gets a job in Donegal will not be taxed for renting out the house and living somewhere else.  The way I have tried to structure the amendment is so that if someone were profiting from renting out one place and paying rent somewhere else, any profit would still be taxable income.  For example, if someone rents out a house in Dublin for &euro;1,500 and moves to Cork where the person only pays &euro;1,000 it means that person's net income has increased by &euro;500 a month.  The amendment states this is taxable income, because the person is better off with new income coming into the household.  However, if someone rents out his or her place for &euro;1,000 and pays rent in a new place of &euro;1,000, be that person in negative equity or posted from Galway to Cork for work for two or three years, that person will not be hit with what is a very substantial tax bill, which I believe is unintended.  Not only would this help many people trapped in negative equity, it would improve labour mobility throughout the country.  While I imagine there may be technical reasons the Minister cannot accept the amendment as I have drafted it, I would very much like agreement from the Minister that this is what we would implement.  I would be very happy to work with the Minister and his officials between now and Report Stage to try to put something together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#X01300","speaker":"1230","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1297,"content":"<p>Some of the people Deputy Donnelly has described as accidental landlords are not accidental landlords.

The cost at the time provided by the Department was &euro;27 million.  There are people who are very badly caught and there is no doubt about this.  Deputy Donnelly has described their situation very well.  They are deep in negative equity, no longer living in the property, renting themselves at a time when rents are spiralling and caught with a hefty tax bill in respect of the rental income on the only property they own.  It should be a policy objective to do something for them and help them.  They are in an incredibly difficult situation.  Deputy Donnelly has acknowledged that his amendment would require some work to define the period in question within which people bought and to ensure they only own one property.  Such measures would need to be addressed.

That is my problem now.  The first issue is the cost.  We could also make a commitment to doing something in the future and including the cost next year but there could be unforeseen, unintended consequences along the lines of those mentioned by Deputy Boyd Barrett, in addition to other considerations.<\/p> <p>  As explained by Deputy Donnelly, the scope is very wide.  The amendment appears to propose that any landlord who lets a property that was his or her primary residence and who also rents another property as a tenant would be entitled to claim a deduction for rent paid when calculating any net rental profit from the rental income received.  If in this case one decided to get into rental property as an investment, would one's first move not be to acquire an apartment, rent it, then rent another one and keep moving along?  One could have a chain of apartments against which one would be offsetting rental income from the first one.  There are all sorts of difficulties.<\/p> <p>  We have made some progress already, however, and it is worth putting it on the record.  In section 15, we committed that the interest allowable as an expense for landlords will be progressively increased from 75% to 100% over a five-year period.  Therefore, there is an additional offset in terms of the interest on the mortgages.  If a person rents his or her existing apartment to a tenant in receipt of a social housing support, he or she can get the 100% interest write-off immediately.  He or she would not have to wait for the five years to elapse.<\/p> <p>  The second relief worth mentioning is that, having discussed this difficulty with the Central Bank, the bank is easing the prudential rules in respect of persons in negative equity.  I raised this yesterday and committed to Deputy Donnelly that we would give him a briefing note on the changes.  We did not send it to him last night but we will do so.  I am prepared to talk about this again on Report Stage.  Thus far, I do not see a way forward although I can identify with the difficulties for individuals the Deputy has outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#Z00300","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1303,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  I cannot see the unintended consequences.  The idea of someone using the measure to rent out a string of properties does not hold up.  This is a very simple idea.  The idea is that if one owns a home, rents it out and pays rent on another, one can offset one against the other.  Let me put it at its simplest.  Imagine two families living beside each other who decide to rent each other's homes from each other and pay each other &euro;1,000 per month.  Neither of the families would be better off.  There would be no more money going in to either.  I am using a closed example.  There would be no extra money going in but a &euro;10,000 tax bill would be incurred by the families.  It just does not make any sense.  Where somebody deriving rental income from a property he or she has purchased purchases another rental property, the measure would apply to only one.  Critically, the offset would apply only to the amount of rent one is paying oneself.  The idea that one could achieve considerable tax deductibility just does not hold up.<\/p> <p>  I accept that the amendment, as I have tabled it, may not be correct.  I have no doubt that there are holes in it.  However, it should be reasonably straightforward to legislate for this, with the policy objective ordaining that if one rents out a premises that one owns and pays rent somewhere else, one is not going to get taxed on the double.  What is occurring is double taxation.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the concept of helping accidental landlords, and the people Deputy Michael D'Arcy spoke about, there is a genuine labour mobility issue.  If one lives in a house that one owns in Dublin but must move to Galway to work for three years, one will want to rent out the house in Dublin and rent a place in Galway.  It does not seem reasonable that one should be taxed &euro;5,000 for doing so.  I am more than happy to look into this.  I would imagine that other jurisdictions have this well figured out.  Having regard to policy, is the Minister amenable to the idea that this constitutes an unintended tax and that it has trapped people?  Would what I propose not help many people?<\/p> <p>  I know people who have left the country over this.  They are saying they cannot raise their children in their apartment and are not willing to avoid tax in the hope they are never found by the Revenue Commissioners.  They literally do not have the &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 to pay the tax bill they would incur if they moved the children from an apartment to a small house in the suburbs.  Since I know people who have left the country over this, it is not a marginal issue.  For those it hits, it hits really hard.  We are not talking about a tax bill of &euro;500 or &euro;1,000; we are talking about a tax bill of &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 at the end of the year based on very modest assumptions.  I refer to normal market rent today.  Would the Minister be able to give an example of where and how he believes the proposal would be abused if it were implemented?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#Z00400","speaker":"1230"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1304,"content":"<p>I will come back to it again on Report Stage.  I can see many difficulties at present.  I am not sure how extensive the problem is.  We are getting submissions from landlords stating they cannot make a profit on rental accommodation and that they do not have a taxable income on rental accommodation.  Tax liability is on the income, not on the total rent.  There is a variety of costs that can be offset against profit, including the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant and the costs of maintenance, repairs and insurance and the management of the property.  Where the property is under management in an estate or apartment building, the annual management fee represents a cost.   There are also the costs of registering a residential tenancy with the RTB and of letting, including letting agency fees.  Wear-and-tear allowances are available in respect of expenditure incurred on furniture, fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord.  These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum for eight years.  An individual may be allowed a deduction in respect of the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair a premises, subject to certain restrictions.  A landlord is entitled to claim a deduction of 100% of qualifying interest in respect of a rented commercial premises but, in general, only 75% is allowed.  I have referred to this already.<\/p> <p>  I would like an example from the Deputy's experience.  It seems to me that the potential for profit on renting a small apartment when one moves on to a bigger one is quite limited, especially when it is almost by definition that people in negative equity have very big mortgages and consequently have extensive interest payments to write off against any profit from the rental.  I would like to see worked-out examples.  I am disposed to being sympathetic if the Deputy can point a way forward for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#Z00500","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1305,"content":"<p>Will Deputy Donnelly work with that and perhaps withdraw his amendment and come back on Report Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2016111000002#AA00100","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1478772000,"counter":1306,"content":"<p>If I could sit down with the officials, it would be very useful.  To put it very simply without going into any of the detail, let us say rent in Dublin is about &euro;1,500 a month now and for most the costs probably amount to about &euro;500 a month.  A lot of them are on tracker mortgages so the interest payments are reasonably low for now.  With regard to the worked examples I have looked at, on &euro;1,500 a month, we could probably take off about &euro;500 a month on tax deductibles.  That leaves us with about &euro;1,000 taxable income.  Over 12 months, that is &euro;12,000 taxable at the marginal rate, which is &euro;6,000.  That is more or less how it is working out.

At any one time we all know someone who is accessing services, a family member, a friend, a colleague.  We all share the same goal.  Each of us wants a health service where people feel valued, respected and well cared for.  Since I was appointed six months ago, I have visited more than 20 hospitals and other primary care health facilities throughout the country.  It is vital and has been very beneficial for me to see for myself what professionals, front-line health service staff, patients and families experience.  There are positives and negatives to report.  Do I feel heartened when I witness the levels of professional commitment?  Yes.  Do I feel encouraged when patients tell me that their lives have greatly improved since they had their surgical procedure or obtained treatment in an Irish hospital?  Yes.<\/p><p> Equally, I am not blind to the fact that we face significant challenges.  We face increased demand from a growing and ageing population and the increasing incidence of chronic conditions.  I know that patients and families and, indeed, clinicians are frustrated by waiting times.  To address these challenges I, as Minister for Health, and this Government accept that significant investment is required.  In recent years the health Vote has typically required an annual supplementary budget to cover deficits.  In July of this year, in an effort to properly fund health and break the cycle of Supplementary Estimates, the Government provided an additional &euro;500 million funding to the health service to bring the total gross funding to &euro;13.695 billion.<\/p><p> When we last met we were in the last phase of budget 2017 negotiations.  I am pleased to report that budget 2017 delivered the highest health budget ever at &euro;14.6 billion.  Of this amount, just over &euro;14 billion is for current funding and just over &euro;450 million for capital funding.  This unprecedented investment will serve to make a real difference in the services we can deliver.  Budget 2017 includes &euro;18.5 million to support the development of primary care services; &euro;10 million in new development funding for home care supports like home help and home care packages; &euro;20 million to enable people with a disability to move to more appropriate accommodation in the community.  The budget also provided for automatic medical cards for an additional 10,000 very sick children, whose parents are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  These increased resources will also allow the health services to plan for the challenge of increased demand from a growing and ageing population, and begin some significant new developments which will over time deliver real improvements for patients.<\/p><p> Before going on to talk about the services which will be delivered in 2017, I want to refer to industrial relations matters, which is a topical issue at the moment.  Members will all know that the INMO executive council has decided to ballot on industrial action.  I respect their decision but industrial action is not the way to address the medium-term or long-term needs of the public health system.  This Government is committed to a collective approach to industrial relations and public sector pay policy as the most effective means of delivering economic security and stability.  Any approach to pay restoration must be within the terms of what is available and affordable.  I am pleased, therefore, that the INMO has once again confirmed its commitment to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Through that agreement we have been able to deliver benefits for our front-line nurses such as the restoration of the increment for nurses who graduated between 2011 and 2015, amounting to some 4,000 nurses working in the Irish health service today who will see pay restoration of over &euro;1,000 from January 2017.  The public service pay commission has started its work and the Government will continue to work with ICTU over the coming weeks to ensure the continuation of a collective pay policy framework that meets the needs of public servants and society.  I am well aware of the pressures felt by nurses and that is why budget 2017 provides funding for an additional 1,000 nurses to join the payroll.  This is a very important role and I want to work with the INMO on recruitment and retention issues.<\/p><p>I want to see how we can improve and enhance the Bring Them Home campaign we have in place through the HSE to bring our nurses back home from abroad.  I will be meeting the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, next week as part of my ongoing engagement with key stakeholders on important issues relating to the health service.<br\/><br\/>The health services to be provided within the available funding will be set out in the HSE&rsquo;s 2017 national service plan which is being finalised.  I take the opportunity to outline key priorities for the year.  One of my priorities when I was appointed Minister for Health was to reactivate the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  This year I secured an investment of &euro;1 million specifically to treat approximately 3,000 additional people who had been waiting for an endoscopy treatment.  As a  direct result of this initiative, as at the end of October, the number of patients awaiting a gastrointestinal endoscopy had fallen dramatically, from 5,700 to 1,200.  The NTPF is confident that by the end of the year there will be no patient waiting longer than 12 months for an endoscopy.  Budget 2017 provides an additional &euro;50 million to be allocated to the NTPF in 2017 and 2018 to treat patients who have been waiting the longest.  It is important that we focus on those who have been waiting the longest.  I am not sure that was always the way the NTPF worked in the past, but it must work that way now.  In August the HSE developed a waiting list action plan focused on reducing the number of patients who had been waiting the longest.  Throughout 2017 my Department will continue to work with the HSE to reduce waiting times through driving efficiencies and process improvements, with a particular focus on adherence to chronological scheduling and validating waiting lists. <br\/><br\/>I am delighted that the &euro;40 million allocated as part of the additional &euro;500 million secured in July has been provided on a recurring basis for the winter initiative.  Winter comes every year and it is important that funding be provided on a recurring basis.  I am pleased that has happened.  As part of the winter initiative, &euro;7 million has been allocated to fund a targeted waiting list programme for orthopaedics, spinal surgery and, importantly, those with scoliosis.  The initiative had provided resources to treat patients on orthopaedics and scoliosis waiting lists, with over 600 patients benefiting.  Since the initiative was announced recently, 354 patients have either been treated or given an appointment to receive treatment within the next six weeks.  This funding is crucial in enabling winter preparedness measures to be introduced across the health service and reducing overcrowding pressures in hospitals.  <br\/><br\/>I very much welcome the additional funding in the budget of over &euro;90 million for acute and emergency services.  The increased allocation demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to driving key policy and strategic initiatives to improve and expand acute care and emergency services for patients.<br\/><br\/>Patient safety and the delivery of quality services to patients will remain priorities for me, my Department and the HSE.  Provision is made for costs associated with the new primary care centres and the extension of medical cards to all children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  Work will continue on the development of appropriate primary care services through primary care teams.  <br\/><br\/>Of course, improving health services is not only about resources, but I hope the additional resources demonstrate our commitment to investing the gains from a recovering economy in a better health service.  With increased resources we can at least plan for the challenge presented by increased demands.  While we need to consider the challenges facing us, we should also recognise where progress is being made.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>At a previous committee meeting Deputy Catherine O'Connell and I spoke about maternity services.  This is one area, in particular, where we are beginning to make a difference.  This has been a landmark year for maternity services with the publication of the country's first ever national maternity strategy, Creating A Better Future Together, 2016 to 2026.  The publication of the strategy demonstrates a new and enhanced focus on maternity care, both at policy and service delivery level.  It provides a roadmap for how we can improve maternity and neonatal care in the years ahead.  The Health Information and Quality Authority will publish in the coming weeks new national standards for safer and better maternity services.  They will provide a framework for maternity service providers to ensure they are meeting the needs of women, their babies and partners and that a consistent service is being delivered across the country.  These developments represent the necessary building blocks to provide a consistently safe and high quality maternity service. <br\/><br\/>The HSE&rsquo;s national standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss and perinatal death guidelines are also a positive step in the right direction, recognising that in the midst of devastation there are practical ways by which we can and must help bereaved parents.<br\/><br\/>I am aware that recently the committee was briefed by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the Connolly for Kids Hospital group on the development of the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  The committee has asked me to address the issue and I am more than happy to do so.  I want to be clear about this, as I read the transcript and watched much of the debate at the last meeting of the committee.  It is very important that we all accept that every single person involved in, and every single doctor working in, the health service shares a common desire to try to put in place a national paediatric children's hospital.  Some of the language used at the last meeting of the committee in terms of there being a suggestion anybody involved in the project, from a policy or medical point of view, would want to see anything but the best outcomes for the children was, frankly, offensive.<\/p><p>We are all united in a desire to build a national children's hospital.  We can have disagreements but let us not get into the gutter.  Let us not attack the <i>bona fides<\/i>of the people involved in this project.  I have seen the people work and I have talked to the clinicians, who were working so hard on delivering this landmark project for Ireland.  It is really important that the legitimate issue people want addressed, explained and discussed be addressed.  Accountability is important.  Please do not doubt the bona fides and intentions of any of the people in my Department or the HSE, or those on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  They are working tirelessly to deliver this landmark project.<br\/><br\/>Independent reviews since 2006 have reaffirmed the importance of colocation with a major adult academic teaching hospital.  St. James's Hospital has the broadest range of national specialties of all our acute hospitals, in addition to a strong and well-established research and education infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to be the adult colocation partner. <br\/><br\/>Importantly, enabling works began this summer on the campus of St. James's Hospital and  they are under way as we speak.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is currently reviewing tenders for the main works contractor and specialist sub-contractors for the new children's hospital.<br\/><br\/>I will now address some of the issues raised at the Oireachtas committee meeting on 27 October.  The issue of access to the children's hospital is of great importance to everyone associated with this project.  The design of the hospital has recognised the need of most parents to access the hospital by car, and parking has been provided for families based not only on current demand but also on projected future demand.  The parking system will also allow families to reserve spaces ahead of arriving at the hospital, and emergency drop-off spaces will also be provided.  St. James's Hospital campus is better served by public transport than any other hospital in the country.  I acknowledge, however, that most people will arrive by car.  That is why it is essential to provide adequate parking.<br\/><br\/>The question of transporting neonates quickly and safely was raised during the hearing.  This is very important for any parent, and it is important to raise it.  The national neonatal transport programme serves the whole neonatal population across all 19 maternity centres and three paediatric hospitals and retrieves patients from anywhere in Ireland and abroad.  In the programme's 14-year history, it has transported over 5,000 sick babies and, thankfully, there has not been one single fatality in transport.  Let us acknowledge the work of the programme over 14 years.  It has resulted in the safe transport of over 5,000 of our sickest babies.<br\/><br\/>It was suggested a children's hospital could be more easily, cheaply and quickly built on another site, such as that at Connolly Hospital.  People have suggested it is not too late to change the site.  I want to make clear that the cost of transitioning the new children's hospital to another site has not been assessed in any detail as no such project exists.  We do know, however, that the transition of the new children's hospital from the current site at St James's would require the abandonment of all the work undertaken to date and a whole new design and planning process.  At best, this would lead to a delay in developing this hospital, and it would also mean that construction inflation would be likely to have a significant impact on project costs.  Together with lost expenditure on the project to date, that could offset much, if not all, of any savings to be obtained from building on a greenfield site.  That is the best-case scenario.  The truth is that such an application would have no guarantee of success.<br\/><br\/>Let us not forget that An Bord Plean&aacute;la's report ruling on the planning permission for the hospital rightly referred to congestion on the M50 and seriously called into question the view that unfettered access to the Connolly site and to on-site car parking can be accommodated.  Let us also remember when we are having these conversations that the National Children's Hospital at St. James's will be supported by satellite units at both the Connolly and Tallaght hospital sites.  I have visited Connolly Hospital to discuss that exciting development with management, staff and patients there.<br\/><br\/>We all know at this stage, being truthful, that further debate will not create consensus on this issue.  The debate has been running for a seriously long time.  There are children whose parents could, understandably, have expected to have benefited from this hospital who are now no longer children.  My priority is now to make progress on the new hospital as soon as possible.  The decision on the location was made in 2012 and it was reaffirmed by my most immediate predecessor.  My priority is now to get on with building the hospital so we can ensure children, young people and their families have the facilities they deserve. <br\/><br\/>I want to see continued engagement from the National Children's Hospital and the new National Paediatric Hospital Development Board with parents who have legitimate concerns.  This is a hospital for the children and parents of Ireland.  The voice of children has to be at the centre of this, and ongoing engagement with parents and children is essential although we will not agree on every issue.  The commitment I give to this committee is that we should continue to engage on all the issues.<\/p><p>The hospital will be built on the St. James's site.  Let us continue to engage on all the issues and provide assurances, information and exchanges of ideas.  That is absolutely vital and I am happy to commit to this happening.<\/p><p> Another topic which came up during our discussion at the committee the last time was the opportunity e-health offers.  Deputy Louise O'Reilly asked me several questions on this.  Projects under development in this area include the implementation of a new individual health identifier, a new national laboratory information system and a new maternal and newborn information system.<\/p><p> I also want to refer to some key initiatives being progressed by my ministerial colleagues.  Several members are interested in disability services, an area in which I too have an interest.  My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath, has been driving specific measures in this area.  While he will be happy to discuss this in greater detail, I will highlight some positive developments.  The task force on personalised budgets for people with disabilities was established by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, in September.  <\/p><p> The terms of reference of the commission of investigation into a former foster home in the south east are being advanced, informed by the recent Dignam report.  The registration of designated centres for the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, inspections was successfully extended through legislation, while HIQA's excellent work through its inspections continues to be carried out.  Children with disabilities continue to be a priority and in 2016 the health sector worked closely with our colleagues in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to launch the new access and inclusion model for children with disabilities to avail of the free preschool year.  There is a renewed commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  This is being supported by &euro;100 million in capital funding from the Department of Health from 2016 to 2021.  This will also be supported through the service reform fund which represents a combined investment of &euro;45 million between the Department of Health and Atlantic Philanthropies.  An additional &euro;31 million of the overall health budget was secured in additional funding for disability services in 2016 and included in the 2017 Estimates.<\/p><p> In the area of mental health, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Helen McEntee, established a youth mental health task force.  This is a community-led group with representatives of the public, private, community and voluntary sectors, which is mandated to act as a galvanising force to improve the mental health and well-being of our young people.  An important project advanced at budget time by the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, is the national forensic mental health facility at Portrane, County Dublin.  This project was spoken about for years and now will be developed as a result of the additional funding secured by her.<\/p><p> It has long been government policy to help older people and others to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, with long-term nursing care being seen as a last resort only after home care and other community-based supports have fully utilised.  Under this Government that emphasis is being strengthened.  Overall funding for services for older people has increased to &euro;765 million in 2017, an increase of &euro;82 million since the HSE's 2016 service plan.  This has focused on additional funding for home care in particular and is aimed at allowing people to continue to live in their own homes and at facilitating discharge of older people from acute hospitals.<\/p><p> Since her appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for communities and the national drugs strategy, Deputy Catherine Byrne, has launched a national public consultation process and published an expert review to guide which will inform the development of a new national drugs strategy.  This will be published in early 2017.<\/p><p> The Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, launched the A Healthy Weight for Ireland - Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025, with 60 actions to improve Ireland's health and to reduce the burden of obesity across society.  This policy and action plan aims to reverse obesity trends, to prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system and the wider society and economy.  We are on track to be the fattest nation in Europe if we do not get this right.  This is an important initiative.<\/p><p> These, of course, are just a sample of the many initiatives being progressed by my colleagues.  The development of primary care is central to the Government's objective to deliver a high-quality, integrated and cost-effective health care system.  The programme for Government commits to a decisive shift in the health service towards primary care.  This involves enhancing primary health care services, building up GP capacity, increasing the number of therapists and other health professionals in primary care, and continuing to expand the development of the primary care infrastructure.<\/p><p> The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be key to achieving our objectives of treating more people in the community.  Engagements to date have seen the Department of Health, HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, agree a several service developments including the introduction of a diabetes cycle of care for adult patients with type 2 diabetes, an enhanced support framework for rural GPs, and a revised list of special items of service under the contract to encourage the provision of more services in the primary care setting.  The next phase of discussions on other aspects of a new contract is expected to commence before the end of the year.  I have made it clear I want that process to be inclusive of GP organisations and look forward to the process moving ahead over the next several months.<\/p><p> We see the continued enhancement of speech and language therapy services for children and adults.<\/p><p>This has been a particular focus in recent years and development funding of &euro;4 million was provided this year to focus specifically on speech and language therapy waiting lists in primary care and social care for children up to 18.  This investment is allowing the HSE to fill 83 new posts in primary care to address waiting lists, prioritising the longest-waiting children for speech and language therapy.  When these positions are filled, the number of speech and language therapists will be close to 700 whole-time equivalents. <\/p><p> The development of primary care centres to accommodate primary care teams is obviously an ongoing area of importance.<\/p><p> Regarding medical card coverage and developments, at 1 October 2016 there were just over 1.7 million medical cards, representing 35.9% of the population, and over 460,000 GP-visit cards, representing 9.8% of the population.  Over 45% of the population has free access to GP services under universal GP care and the GMS scheme.  This compares with nearly 38.1% at end of 2010.<\/p><p> Before I finish I wish to mention an upcoming event.  I will shortly establish the new patient safety office based within the Department of Health, which will lead a programme of significant patient safety measures focused on initiatives such as new legislation, the establishment of a national patient advocacy service, the introduction of a patient safety surveillance system, extending the clinical effectiveness agenda and setting up a national advisory council for patient safety.<\/p><p> While we have secured a significant increase in funding for the health services, I do not underestimate the challenges involved in the delivery of a safe efficient health service.  We must maintain our focus on improving the way services are organised and delivered.  I hope I have given the committee a good overview of the many initiatives and reforms that are under way.  I thank members of the committee for the opportunity.<\/p><p> If I can be so cheeky, I remind people that every Member of the Oireachtas has received an invitation from me to raise awareness about blood donation.  We need more blood donations.  It is something I have not done to date and I will rectify that wrong today.  I hope as many Members of the Oireachtas as possible will join me after this meeting in donating blood.  Transport provided by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service will leave Leinster House at 1 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#G00300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1341,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p> <p>  After the opening statements we might address issues in the statements before proceeding to questions that have been submitted.<\/p> <p>  I invite Mr. O'Brien to give his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#M00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1342,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend the committee meeting.  As this is my first attendance and that of most of my colleagues at this committee since its establishment I take the opportunity to wish the committee well with its work and assure it of our fullest co-operation and assistance.  I am joined today by a number of my colleagues, whose names and titles are in the written version of the statement.  I will save time by not reading that out.<\/p> <p>  The committee requested information and replies on a range of specific issues, which have been provided.  I will therefore confine my opening remarks to other matters.  On income and expenditure, as at 31 August, the latest published figures, the HSE has recorded expenditure of &euro;8.925 billion against a budget of &euro;8.902 billion leading to a deficit of &euro;22.7 million or 0.26%.  Pensions and demand-led areas represent two thirds or &euro;15 million of the overall deficit with the remaining one third or &euro;7.7 million arising within operational service areas.<\/p> <p>  The HSE is in the process of developing the national service plan for 2017.  We are in discussion with colleagues in the Department of Health on the development of the plan and we expect to submit it in draft form on 15 November, which is next week. <\/p> <p>  In emergency department, ED, performance, there were 909,468 emergency presentations up to August, an increase of 6.1% on expected activity.  ED patient experience registrations in August 2016 were 4.8% higher than the corresponding period in 2015.  Despite this increase, the INMO 30-day moving average for trolleys in August 2016 was lower than the corresponding period in the previous year by up to 5.6%.  <\/p> <p>  The national service plan for this year prioritises a reduction in waiting times for hospital care with a focus on those waiting the longest so that there will be no inpatient or day-case patient waiting more than 36 months by year end.  Hospitals are also required to reduce by 50% inpatient and day-case waiting lists for patients waiting 18 months or longer.  At the end of August, 89% of the inpatient and day cases were waiting less than 15 months.  In addition, 83% of patients on the outpatient waiting list were waiting less than 12 months and 90% were waiting less than 15 months.<\/p> <p>  The HSE is supported in the implementation of the winter plan this year, with the provision of &euro;40 million, to provide a comprehensive range of actions and measures across community and hospital services to increase the availability of community care, facilitate timely discharge from hospital and increase hospital capacity.<\/p><p>Specifically, the &euro;40 million provides for an additional 950 new home care packages and 58 weekly approvals for transitional care to support discharges from acute hospitals.  An additional 55 acute hospital beds are being provided across a range of hospitals as well as 18 step-down beds provided by the Mercy University Hospital in Cork.  The funding will support the expansion of minor injury services in Dublin for an additional 100 patients per week. <\/p><p> Community intervention team services will be expanded and there is an increase in funding for aids and appliances specifically to support targeted discharge of patients from hospitals.  A targeted waiting list programme for orthopaedics, spinal care and scoliosis care is being implemented in designated sites by the year end.<\/p><p> In summary, the outcomes to be achieved through the implementation of this plan and through integrated working across community health care organisations and hospital groups are the reduction of delayed discharge levels and reduced numbers of patients on trolleys in emergency departments as well as improved patient experience times.  In primary care, the HSE is continuing to work on the shift of clinical activity to primary care.  Community intervention teams are now operating in 13 areas and expanding further for the coming winter period.  Structured chronic illness programmes are underway for Type II diabetes patients and asthma care for children.  Improved access to diagnostic tests such as ultrasound is in place for general practitioners and minor surgery is also under way at 20 GP practices around the country.  This programme of work is ongoing and scheduled to increase further in 2017, enabled by developments such as the review of the GP contract and ICT enhancements such as Healthlink, eReferral, individual health identifiers, IHI, and the development of a shared electronic health record.<\/p><p> In mental health, the allocation of an additional &euro;15 million to initiate new developments in 2017 with a recurring full year value of up to &euro;35 million will allow for the ongoing development of services in line with A Vision for Change.  Approval has been received for the awarding of the contract for the construction of the new national forensic mental health facility at Portrane.  This facility, estimated for completion in early 2020, will replace the existing Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum with a modern facility providing 120 Adult forensic beds, a 10-bed forensic child and adolescent mental health Unit and a 10-bed mental health and intellectual disability unit.  There is an ongoing need to improve access to psychological therapies for children.  Funding is in place to develop this service and approval is now awaited and expected from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to recruit in excess of 100 assistant psychologists.  <\/p><p> The 2016-17 'flu campaign which was launched as part of this year&rsquo;s winter planning is well under way.  This year&rsquo;s campaign is targeting the challenges encountered in increasing uptake levels last year with each community health care organisation, CHO, and hospital group required to develop a 'flu plan.  Staff are a particular focus this year with staff vaccination clinics being held in CHOs, supported by peer-to-peer vaccination training.  In addition, poster campaigns, text messaging, screen saver reminders and other innovative ideas are being utilised to encourage staff, in particular, to get the vaccine.<\/p><p> This concludes my opening statement and together with my colleagues we will endeavour to answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1344,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien.

I note that the Minister for Health was outraged, as I was.  I am well used to reading memoranda from the HSE.  In fact, this morning is a little like a reunion of the national joint council.<\/p> <p>  The memorandum that was sent was disgraceful.  How is it that it was drafted?  Who approved it?  Will Mr. O'Brien apologise to the staff at whom it was directed?  Is this some kind of policy that is in place in the background which has leaked out by accident?  I was outraged when I saw the contents of the memorandum as were nurses, midwives and other workers in the health service.  Those people are owed an apology.  That is the least they are owed.  We should hear from Mr. O'Brien on the memorandum before we go any further.<\/p><p>Did it come from Mr. O'Brien's office?  Was he aware of it and, if so, did he sanction it?  If not, will he explain how a document of this nature was circulated without the knowledge of senior management?<\/p><p> To be fair to the Minister, he was first out of the blocks in expressing concern about the memorandum.  I do not want to put words in his mouth by saying he expressed \"outrage\" but he definitely expressed concern.  I have no hesitation in expressing outrage because that is how I feel about this issue.  While I have other questions, I would like this issue to be addressed before the meeting proceeds to other matters.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#N00300","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1347,"content":"<p>As my colleague, Mr. Liam Woods, confirmed yesterday, what we are talking about here is a memorandum prepared by the office of legal services for his information.  The memorandum was shared only by him with a group of chief executives and for some reason was disseminated more broadly.  From where does it come?  In 2012, a particular case arose in a particular hospital that I will not name.  It was related to a patient whose acute care phase had been long completed and who was refusing to leave the hospital and move on to a more appropriate care setting.  The staff in the hospital, which included nursing staff, sought guidance as to what rights, obligations, duties and powers were available to them and a senior counsel provided advice at the time.<\/p> <p>  This issue is not about a general policy but about cases which are very rare in the context of the total number of patients who pass through Irish hospitals.  In exceptional circumstances, it occasionally arises that there is a refusal to move on from a hospital for whatever reason.  There have been other instances more recently which gave rise to similar inquiries to the office of legal services.  As a result, based on that advice provided by a senior counsel, a memorandum was prepared and sent by legal services to the national director setting out various steps that would need to be taken to ensure every possible step had been taken to make appropriate provision and provide appropriate care to each patient and what steps might be available thereafter. <\/p> <p>  I emphasise that this is not about patients who have recently completed their care but about rare and exceptional circumstances which arise perhaps a handful of times each year.  They occur when patients or former patients have, for whatever reason, a desire to remain in a care setting occupying a bed which they do not need but another patient may need and refusing to move on to another more appropriate care setting that has been provided for them.<\/p> <p>  The memorandum should not have been distributed as widely as it was.  It was only available as a background note to advise people of the appropriate steps that should be taken to ensure patients get the right care in the right circumstances in these rare and exceptional circumstances.  The memo had already been withdrawn from circulation almost two weeks ago because the person who received it took the view, which I share, that it should never have been distributed in that way.  To the extent that it has caused distress to any staff member who received it or to members of the general public as a result of being disseminated, we absolutely regret and apologise for any concern to which it has given rise.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to have an opportunity to make very clear that this is not about something that happens in the generality.  It is about exceptional circumstances which, in a hospital system as wide as the Irish system, will arise only a handful of times each year.  It is necessary, in the context of patients occupying beds that they no longer need while other patients may be waiting for those beds, to have a clear understanding of the appropriate steps that should be taken in such circumstances.  I am not sure if Mr. Woods wishes to add anything.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1348,"content":"<p>I did not see the memorandum but watched the RTE reports on the issue.

Let me step back and put that into its full context and then I will deal with the specific point raised by the Deputy.  This was a total recitation of all the legal provisions that relate to a situation where a person refuses to leave a hospital bed.  This is one line in a very long memorandum that deals with everything that should be done to facilitate the patient in moving to a right location.  This is not about patients who do not have some place to move on to such as a nursing home place or supported discharge.  This is about patients - and it is very rare - who, in the face of every possible thing having been done and provided, still refuse to move on.  The reference to minimum force was not a suggestion that minimum force should be used.  It was a reference to what the law provides for and what it was saying that people need to be very careful in these situations.  There is reference to the necessity to protect people's interests, for example, by a referral to the appropriate courts to determine a situation if that should arise.  To be clear, there has never been - and never will be - a direction that people should be using force, minimum or otherwise.  It was a valid, comprehensive explanation of what the total legal position was.  The use of the term \"minimum force\" is generally intended as dissuasion to the usual force.  This is not about asking our staff to use physical force to remove patients from wards.  It may well be the case, however, and it has been the case - and I suspect that in the future it will be the case - that there may be circumstances where the HSE or the individual hospital may have to seek the assistance of the courts to persuade an individual, in very rare circumstances and in the face of every possible assistance having already been provided in regard to alternative placement, to vacate a hospital bed to which they have developed an attachment but not a need, and where there is another patient who needs that bed.  I hope I have clarified it for the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1353,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Reilly asked about policy.  Policy is set by me, not by lawyers or anybody else.  Let me be very clear that it is not the policy of the Irish health service - in any way, shape or form - to interact with patients in the manner suggested by the memo.  Not only is that not the case, it is also not the case that front-line staff would or should ever find themselves in that position.  I described this as utterly offensive and unacceptable.  I did not just do that in public yesterday when the memo came into the public domain.  I did it on 27 October, the day I was made aware of this by a nurse, in a communication on my behalf to officials, who communicated to the HSE.  I was assured that the memo had been rescinded from circulation the following day.  In fairness to the people with whom I work within the HSE, I do not believe it is in any way a fair refection on their commitment to, or how they view, patients.  Yesterday was a bad day for the health service in that regard, but this is not the policy of the health service or the HSE.  This was a legal memorandum referring to some very specific and rare situations.  Let me provide assurance today to patients, to their families and to staff members in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I shall also pick up on the very important point that was made with regard to delayed discharges.  We must all focus on reducing the length of time that people find themselves having to stay in hospitals.  When I travel around hospitals it is clear that generally people do not want to be there any longer than they have to be.  When one considers the metrics on delayed discharges, it is worth noting that on 13 September there were 643 people who found themselves in Irish hospitals, who were medically fit to go home but had nowhere to go.  As of yesterday that number has been reduced to 538 as a result of winter initiative funding, extra home care packages and extra transitional care beds.  That is where all our focus has to be.  I welcome the clarification provided by the HSE and the apology offered by the director general this morning.  I need everybody's attention and focus to now be back on reducing delayed discharges and providing the best service possible.<\/p><p>It is important and appropriate to raise this issue because it caused serious concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#P00300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1355,"content":"<p>The Minister referenced the ballot for industrial action by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation that is currently under way.  I suspect its members will be joined by other colleagues in the health service.  You would not need a crystal ball to figure that one out.  I understand also that the Irish Medical Organisation is balloting its members.  It is safe to say that the health service is not a place of industrial harmony, rather it is a place of industrial unrest.<\/p> <p>  The Minister referenced pay and the Government's commitment to the Lansdowne Road agreement, but that agreement is at an end when it was breached.  I and all of us here will know the terms of it, the manner in which it is applied and the strictures it places on people.  It has been breached.  The issues that the INMO has raised are not only about pay, they also relate to services.  The Minister addressed pay in his contribution but he might address the services.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is that of recruitment.  We would all be interested to know what it is that the Minister will do that has not been done to date.  What has been done to date is not working.  It is having a very limited impact.  The Minister had targeted recruitment but he did not come anywhere near reaching his targets.  I also know that some of the people who came to work in the health service have now gone back to where they came from.  Whatever it is that the Minister has been doing to date is not working.  We would like to hear what will be done that has not already been done.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Connolly Hospital and the location of the new national children's hospital.  We have all been in receipt of representations and have met representatives from the Connolly for Kids Hospital group.  Has the suggestion that the sties be flipped been given a detailed look - I am not talking about there being a report on it - whereby the satellite centre would be located in St. James's and the main hospital would be located in Connolly Hospital?  The campaigners will know it is my party's view that this needs to be done and done quickly.  We did not get hung up on one site over another but we do not want this to be delayed unnecessarily.  Given the level and depth of concern that has been expressed, to what extent have the other alternative options been examined?<\/p> <p>  What is the timeframe for the colocation of the maternity hospital with the national children's hospital?  I understand an application for planning permission for the maternity hospital has not yet been submitted.  The trilocation element is key.  We all know that.  There will be an adult hospital and a children's hospital, but I struggle to know where it going to fit in on the campus.  I am very familiar with the St. James's Hospital campus and I have seen an aerial view of the site that is marked out for it.  However, the proposed site also raises concerns because, first, there does not seem to be any urgency about this project and, second, when all the people arrive at the hospital where will they park their cars and how will they get in and out of the hospital?  If one has occasion to use the maternity hospital that is planned for the campus at 3 a.m., one will not be travelling to it on the Luas but by car.  We need to have some idea of when we will see the colocated maternity hospital, as we do not know that.  The concerns that have been raised, justified by the by the campaigners, should be addressed.  It may be that we will never reach agreement on this but at least those concerns, which are heartfelt, should be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#Q00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1356,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly for those questions.  First, the INMO has decided to ballot but I do not think the ballot has yet commenced.  I am due to meet the INMO towards the end of next week.  I would ask the INMO to do what it, in fairness, has always done during my six months in office, that is, to constructively engage.  It has reaffirmed its commitment to the Lansdowne Road agreement and to operating within it, and I welcome that.<\/p> <p>  I cannot remember the exact word the Deputy used but she effectively said the Lansdowne Road is dead.  There is an onus on anybody who says that to explain where we will find the &euro;1.4 billion that this would result in if we were to immediately end the agreement.  We do not have it within the health Vote and I do not believe we have it within the education of the justice Votes.  Many of the issues the Deputy rightly asked me about and on which she keeps me under pressure involve spending more money on public services.  The budget looked at improving public services, public sector pay in terms of the Lansdowne Road agreement and trying to modestly increase everyone's take home pay in a fair way through tax reductions.  If one disproportionately favours any one of those three elements over the other, it clearly impacts on the ability to do the other two, and we must be conscious of that.<\/p><p>However, there has been an ability, through the collective national framework, to address some of the issues which nursing representatives brought to me and my predecessors.  I can give two quick examples.  One is the unfair anomaly relating to pay for graduate nurses between 2011 and 2015.  Approximately 7,000 graduated then and there are approximately 4,000 working in our hospitals.  I concede that 3,000 are not, which is a sign of the problem with recruitment and retention.  They will see their pay restored by between &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,500 from January.  That happened through the Lansdowne Road framework, so there are flexibilities within it.  Another example is the task transfer, the ability to recognise that the Lansdowne Road agreement refers to task transfer and that our nurses are doing jobs in hospitals that previously had been done by other health care professionals and must be paid for that.  That has taken place now as well.<\/p><p> There are other issues in the Lansdowne Road agreement relating to nurses that need to be explored and discussed.  However, it is important that everything is done in a collective manner.  I listened to a former trade unionist on the media at the weekend who said that when there was no collective agreement in the past and workers' wages decreased overall.  A collective agreement works not just for workers and the Government but for stability for all of us.  The INMO is a member of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The general secretary of the INMO sits on the ICTU public services committee.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has met with that body and he said this week that he intends to continue to engage with it.  I will meet the INMO next week.  I always enjoy meeting the INMO because I find it a very constructive organisation.  There are issues relating to recruitment and retention, and I accept that some of them are linked to the overall pay and conditions of nurses, but they must be addressed in a collective way.  The sectoral, siloed way of looking at things will not serve this country well and it is not Government policy.  It must be addressed-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#Q00300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1358,"content":"<p>What does the Minister call the deal that was done with the Garda?

The INMO is a member of ICTU.  ICTU is in a process of engaging with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on  behalf of the Government.  The INMO members voted to be part of the Lansdowne Road agreement and this week the INMO reaffirmed its commitment to that agreement.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has made it clear that there are significant challenges as a result of the independent decision of the Labour Court in terms of how that impacts on other unions within the Lansdowne Road agreement, but these must be addressed collectively.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked me what I will do about recruitment and retention, which is a valid question.  The budget refers to 1,000 additional nurses.  We are actively advertising to recruit nurses.  One of the problems in recruitment and retention, as we all know from our lives and from talking to people, is that so many of our nurses and nursing graduates left the country because they were not being offered jobs, or they were being offered jobs for two or three months while the UK was offering them full, permanent contracts.  That is the second piece.  Every nursing graduate this year has been offered a permanent contract in the Irish health service.  There has been an improvement in graduate pay from 2011 to 2015, although a number of that cohort went abroad.  We now must bring them back and this is a further tool in the basket to do that.  Their pay will be restored somewhat from January.  We are recruiting for another 1,000 positions and we are now offering people permanent contracts.  The Deputy is quite correct that it is not all about pay.  It is also about the conditions in which people are working.  We are investing in the health service again.  Instead of cutting health budgets, we are expanding them.  We are putting more resources into trying to make our health service function in a better way.<\/p> <p>  It is important not to have this conversation in a vacuum.  While nursing numbers are still down on their peak, and I am certainly not suggesting that they are back to where they must be, the numbers have increased from September 2015 to September 2016 by 1,391.  There are 1,391 more nurses working in the system this year than there were in September last year, so the numbers are moving in the right direction.  There is significantly more work to do and I look forward to engaging with that.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of Connolly Hospital, I share the Deputy's view, from talking to parents, that people who express concerns are doing so in a legitimate manner, and they are legitimate and sincere concerns.  I was simply making the point that in the dialogue and discourse it would be useful if people understood that the motives of the people trying to develop the national children's hospital are also good.<\/p><p>They too want to see improvements in paediatric services.  All of the various options for acute hospital sites were considered by the Government of the day in the decision it made in 2012.  Obviously, I was not in this role at that time.  It is important to look at the multi-specialties available in St. James's that, quite frankly, are not available elsewhere.<\/p><p> I think the Deputy made a very reasonable point about the Coombe.  St. James's is about the tri-location of the paediatric hospital, an adult acute hospital with a level of specialties that others do not have, which is vital for our children, and maternity services.  The Deputy knows that there are plans to move the Coombe.  The Deputy will ask me where it is at and will ask me to show a bit of movement on that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#R00500","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1363,"content":"<p>Is the planning permission even applied for at this stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#S00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1364,"content":"<p>No, it is not, but let us be clear about a couple of things.

I will say this for the first time today - I have not said it before - I would like to see us now moving ahead with the planning permission phase for the Coombe.  I have to be honest that the building of it is not going to happen today or tomorrow.

I wish to raise a number of specific issues, particularly about the maternity and gynecological services.  My understanding at the moment is that there is a substantial waiting list in Cork University Hospital for gynecological services.  I understand that the HSE is aware of this.  What action is proposed to deal with it?  I think this issue has been raised but yet it appears that no progress has been made in reducing the list.  What do we intend to do with this issue?<\/p> <p>  The second issue I wish to raise is the Portlaoise report regarding the maternity services in the midlands in which recommendations were made.  What stage are we at in implementing those recommendations?  I am a little bit concerned about reports.  In terms of maternity services, back in 2003 there was something like slightly more than 100 medical consultants in obstetrics and gynaecology.  It was suggested then that by 2011, we would have 180 such consultants.  My understanding is that we now have 130 whole-time equivalents.  The Minister spoke earlier about maternity services and when I see reports coming out, I wonder about implementation.  We are now 13 years on from the report of 2003.  The number of deliveries increased dramatically in the period from 2003 to 2010.  It has reduced a bit since, but that does not mean we should now park employment in both gynecological and maternity services.<\/p> <p>  It is not just about consultants, but also is about nursing staff.  The report on Portlaoise recommended the appointment of a director of midwifery - I believe that was the title used - in each of the 19 maternity units.  What is the progress in that regard?  I also understand that we may not have the people to meet the criteria that have been set out for that role before someone can be appointed.  To how many of the 19 units has a director of midwifery been appointed?  What progress has been made in filling the remaining positions?  Will I be asking the same question again in 12 months' time?  I am a little concerned about that.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of additional staff, particularly junior doctors and nursing staff.  In 2015, we spent &euro;225 million, almost a quarter of a billion euro, on agency staff.<\/p><p>Up to June of this year, we have spent &euro;113 million.  We will come out with the same figure for 2016.  One reason for that is that the education grants for junior doctors were withdrawn.  If some of that was reinstated we might be able to reduce the cost of agency staff.  What are we doing to cut the agency budget and to give the funding to people who are making the commitment and want to get on with a career in nursing or as junior doctors?  When will we see a reduction in the cost of agency staff and an increase in the allowances that are given to the junior doctors?<\/p><p> I have another question to put later.  It is one I asked in October 2013 and three years later I am getting the same answer.  That is not good enough.  I do not want to be asking the same question on these issues-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#S00400","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1367,"content":"<p>Which question is that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#T00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1368,"content":"<p>I wanted a detailed breakdown of the number of consultant positions in each hospital and the number of vacancies.  Fifteen years ago, every hospital under the old health board system planned the recruitment of a new consultant when it knew someone was retiring.  We now seem to have no mechanism in place.  An average of 120 or 150 consultants retire every year.  There is no reason that we should not advertise those posts 12 months before those people retire so that there is someone to fill the posts the minute the retirees walk out the door.  The answer I got to that question today is as if someone pressed a button and did no research because when I put that question in October 2013, I got the same answer as I got today.  I put the question in 2014 and I got a detailed reply.  I cannot understand why that detailed reply in 2014 could not have been updated for today&rsquo;s reply.  I do not think it is acceptable.  We were asked to submit questions four weeks before this meeting and it is not acceptable that someone can press a button and give me an answer without doing any research, especially when it was already set up in January 2014.  We have made no progress since then on this issue, which is an extremely important matter.  There are three parts saying it is not possible to give the answer, yet in January 2014 I could get an answer to the same questions.

There is a focus on bringing those waiting, in both time and number terms, back to 18 months, but also behind that mark as best we can.  The challenge, from our point of view, is interesting.  Looking at our own data, the slight fall in the number of births, back to approximately 63,000 to 64,000, is leading to an increase in the provision of gynaecology services, but there is also an increase in demand and we are working with that.

In terms of numbers, we would be talking about between five and seven obstetricians per year.  That is in hand.<\/p><p> On midwife numbers, a specific piece of work was done last year on the number of midwives required for the number of deliveries by unit.  That report identified the need for an additional 100 midwives nationally.  We have invested in those midwives in the course of this year and last year.  Those numbers have been put in place and that analysis will continue.  It is a dynamic analysis because the numbers are clearly changing with the volumes of service.  That investment has been made.<\/p><p> On the appointment of directors of midwifery by site for the 19 units, four sites had directors of midwifery in place.  I do not have the exact number in my head for those advertised and filled, but we still have another four or five to fill based on the first round of competition.  The rest are recruited and are being put in place.  We are going back to the market.  Senator Colm Burke is also well informed in the point he makes about the specification for the role.  We have had a look at that.  We are working with our colleagues in HR to see how we can express that specification and still maintain a standard, but I understand the Senator's point.<\/p><p> The agency cost generally is over &euro;225 million, over half of which is medical and most of the balance of which is on the nursing side.  The HSE has been recruiting with a view to displacing agency staff and it will continue to do that.  It is within our current operational remit to do that and it makes sense, as the committee would understand, in every way.  There is some amount of agency that is endemic to the system because of the nature of the system, but we are above that amount, which, I understand, is the point the Senator is referring to.  We have open flexibility around that recruitment.  We are doing that and we have done some of it this year.  That represents a financial saving to a hospital and also brings in permanent staff.  Therefore, it is very positive.  We are doing everything we can both to attract and retain staff in that context.<\/p><p> On the point the Senator raised about the replacement of consultants, in terms of the response I am quite happy to go back and look at a more comprehensive reply and pick up what was referred to in 2014.  Perhaps I can deal with the Senator directly on that.  In terms of the recruitment process within the HSE generally, there is full capacity to fill replacement posts and there is no obstacle to early approval of posts based on the notion that a replacement is required within a period of time.  I understand the Senator's point, which is that it can take time - perhaps up to 12 months - to recruit a consultant and leaving a post vacant or having a locum for that period of time is less desirable than having a planned replacement.  I fully get that point.  I am aware that some posts are notified in advance and go to recruitment before the posts are vacated.  Assuming reasonable notice of the intent to vacate the post, and it is almost always the case that it would be known, there is capacity for that.  It is something that would be useful to encourage and pursue further.  Operationally, it is within our flexibility to undertake that form of recruitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#T00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1373,"content":"<p>On the issue of 2014, a detailed list of all the posts in all the hospitals was given.

First, to follow on from one of Senator Burke's questions and Mr. Woods's response regarding the 125 nurses and midwives that have been put in place, does that mean they have been recruited?  What does \"put in place\" mean?  Are those 125 personnel now working in the service?<\/p> <p>  The Minister for health promotion is not here but the Minister for Health might address the matter of the notable decline in the uptake of the HPV vaccine in the past year.  When the former Minister for Health, Mary Harney, introduced this she expected an uptake of the HPV vaccine of approximately 80%.  My understanding is that we exceeded that, with an uptake of approximately 90%, but due to various factors, including a fairly aggressive social media campaign and various claims about the side effect profile of the vaccine, we are heading towards an uptake rate of under 50%.  That is concerning because it is in breach of the concept of herd immunity and in terms of how we had the possibility of eradicating cervical cancer for people like my young daughters.  My understanding is that the fall-off in the rate of the vaccine uptake could translate to the deaths of 40 girls who are now 12, 13 and 14 years of age.  Forty girls in that cohort will die of cervical cancer directly as a result of the fall-off in the vaccination rate.  I would like the Minister to outline how that can be addressed.  I want to highlight that the next phase in vaccination was for young boys.  There has been a huge rise in head, neck and anogenital cancers in men.  The HPV vaccine was to be rolled out to boys but as a result of the impact of a campaign, young boys are now not being vaccinated.  There is a sense of inequality in that boys are not getting what we planned to give them.<\/p> <p>  Second, the Minister or the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, might update me on the policy regarding medicinal cannabis use, about which there has been much talk lately, where we are going with that and the timeframe.  There is concern among people with multiple sclerosis and parents of children suffering from seizures that this particular medication could assist them.  The Minister might outline the position on that.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted to hear that the Minister is progressing the planning for the tri-location model at the St. James's hospital site and the maternity hospital.  One of the main reasons I entered politics was to seek to have a maternity hospital and a children's hospital on the same site.<\/p><p>The effect of having one's child taken from one at birth and brought to a separate hospital is something I would not like anyone to have to go through.<\/p><p> We have a wonderful national maternity strategy.  It reminds me of the introduction of the cancer strategy when I first returned to Ireland from the UK.  We have a wonderful document to which many skilled clinicians in this country have given their time and expertise out of sheer dedication to the health service.  Those of us who are elected - those who recently came to the House and those who are longer serving - know that we are very good at doing reports but there seems to be a major problem in the context of taking action and implementing policy.  Could the Minister indicate how we will outline the national maternity strategy?  If she is not in a position to do so today, perhaps in the future the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, might refer to how the mental health of mothers could be incorporated into the strategy in order that we can combine maternity services and mental health services when women go into hospital to have children?<\/p><p> Deputy Louise O'Reilly mentioned workforce planning.  That is a major issue.  What I hear from doctors and others working in the health service is that in the past medical people went away and did training in Canada or Australia and they always wanted to come back to Ireland.  Now, however, it appears that they do not want to return.  This is just anecdotal evidence that I have heard.  When there is a vacancy for a well-paid post, first, nobody applies for it and then sometimes the person who applies for and gets the job is not the individual one would ideally want to fill the position.  There is a knock-on effect on the quality of care.  I am concerned about the lack of buy-in on the part of medical professionals in respect of the system.  I would like to hear if our guests are aware of any new initiatives to try to encourage medical professionals who trained here and who had their education paid for by the State to return to Ireland.  We are essentially exporting them and not getting them back any longer.  In the past, we used to benefit from the experience of other countries but now we are not getting those people back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#V00400","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1379,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Connell.  She raised many issues  I am very pleased that she raised the issue of the HPV vaccine because it is really important that - based on all of the medical advice available to me, the Department and the chief medical officer - I get to put on the public record my support for this very important vaccination programme .  The Deputy is aware that the immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the national immunisation advisory committee, which is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and which comprises experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics, and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  In 2009, the committee recommended the HPV vaccination for all 12-year old girls in order to reduce their risk of cervical cancer and the vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second-level school in September 2010.  As the Deputy is aware, there are two licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland and Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the school immunisation programme.  It is provided free of charge to girls in the first year of second-level school.<\/p> <p>  In September 2011, a catch-up programme was started for all girls in second-level schools and the 2013 and 2014 campaigns were the final years of the catch-up programme.  I am very much aware of the misinformation out there to which Deputy O'Connell referred and I am extremely concerned about the impact that is having on the health and well-being of young women.  Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide.  Each year in this country approximately 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and approximately 100 women will die from the disease.  All cervical cancers are linked to high-risk HPV types of infection.<\/p><p>There are more than 100 different types of HPV but published figures for 2014 and 2015 show that the HPV vaccine uptake was 87%.  That was the highest ever uptake since the programme began in 2010.  While I do not have final figures for the 2015 to 2016 programme yet, preliminary figures released by the HSE do indicate that approximately 5,000 fewer girls received the HPV vaccine for the period compared with the previous year.  That significant decline in uptake does vary across the country, with some western and southern counties most affected.  The decline is extremely regrettable and I am concerned that it might be related to unsubstantiated concerns about the safety of the HPV vaccine raised by groups.<br\/><br\/>Information is available for parents and I encourage them to check out all vaccines.  The information leaflet on the vaccine is available on the national immunisation website, <i>immunisation.ie<\/i>.  The website has been accredited by the World Health Organization, WHO, for credibility, content and good information practices.  It allows members of the public to contact the national immunisation office to ask questions if they require further information.  Where possible, the questions are answered by a member of staff in the office within one working day.  I encourage the parents of this country to access this service, ask questions and look at the information.  The information that is provided on the website has been accredited by the World Health Organization.<br\/><br\/>Gardasil is a safe and fully tested vaccine which protects against the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.  Approximately 300 women are diagnosed in this country each year with cervical cancer.  By January 2016 more than 200 million doses of Gardasil have been distributed worldwide and in Ireland more than 580,000 doses of the vaccine have been administered.  More than 220,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.<br\/><br\/>It is not just me who is saying this vaccine is safe and it is not even just evidence in this country.  We have also seen the results of the detailed, scientific review carried out in November last year by the European Medicines Agency, EMA, an agency which I hope will locate in Ireland.  It examined the evidence surrounding reports of two conditions, namely, complex regional pain syndrome, CRPS, and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, POTS, another condition which causes symptoms such as dizziness and fainting as well as headache, chest pain and weakness.  In line with its initial recommendations, the EMA confirms that the evidence does not support a causal link between the HPV vaccine and the development of the conditions.  Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to change the way the vaccines are used or to amend current product information.  The agency&rsquo;s committee for medicinal products for human use also looked at the issue and concurred that the available evidence does not support that CRPS or POTS are caused by the HPV vaccine and it therefore also did not recommend any changes to the terms of licensing or product information for those medicines.  Furthermore, on 12 January this year the European Commission endorsed the conclusions of the European Medicines Agency that there is no change to the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend current product information.  The final outcome by the Commission is now binding on all member states of the European Union.  The review recognised that at the time more than 80 million girls and women worldwide have now received the vaccines and in some European countries they have been given to 90% of the age group recommended for the vaccine.  Use of the vaccines is expected to prevent many cases of cervical cancer - cancer of the neck of the womb - which is responsible for more than 20,000 deaths in Europe each year, and various other cancers and conditions caused by HPV.<br\/><br\/>The benefits of the HPV vaccine are well known.  They are well endorsed, not just domestically but internationally and they are now binding on member states of the European Union since the European Commission examined the issue in January 2016.  I assure members that the safety of the vaccines will continue to be carefully monitored, as is the case with all vaccines and will take into account any future new evidence.  I am genuinely concerned about the much lower uptake of the vaccine this year compared to last year based on preliminary figures.  That will result in people dying of cervical cancer, a cancer which could have been prevented were people vaccinated.  I again encourage parents to check out the expert medical information available to them and the information endorsed by the WHO on the website, <i>immunisation.ie<\/i>.  I would like to see the expansion of the vaccination programme to boys and we will come back to Deputy O&rsquo;Connell with plans in that regard.<br\/><br\/>I know maternity services are an area of particular interest to Deputy O&rsquo;Connell.  In terms of the national maternity strategy, she is correct in identifying the similarities between it and the national cancer strategy because the model of the former is based on the national cancer strategy.  We are about to launch a new national cancer strategy in the coming months.  The country has made so much progress in terms of cancer services because not only did we have a coherent strategy but we drove it on.  It was driven on quite courageously by my predecessors.<\/p><p>The national maternity strategy replicates that model.  We will now see the establishment of the national women and infants' health programme to drive on the delivery of that strategy, which is really important, and the HSE has advised my Department on it.  The HSE representatives may wish to comment further on it, but it is now at an advanced stage regarding the appointment of an interim programme director for a period of two years.  The clinical director post will also be advertised shortly.  This is about putting the meat on the bones of what is a world class document on which so many people worked very hard.<\/p><p> It is stating the obvious to say that global competition for medical consultants remains extremely keen.  Comparing September 2016 to September 2015, we have seen 116 extra consultants employed.  We recognise the need to work on various issues.  The issues, as many Deputies and Senators have stated, do not concern pay alone.  There is a range of issues in terms of making Ireland attractive.  The MacCraith report provides a plan, which we need to get on with and implement.  It speaks of a range of issues above and beyond pay, particularly in respect of training.  In 2015, in line with the MacCraith recommendation, we increased pay rates for new entrant consultants.  This was done within the context of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  We have also allowed for incremental credit for previous experience so that new entrants do not have to start on the first point, but this work is very much ongoing.  Perhaps Mr. O'Brien may wish to comment further. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#W00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1478768400,"counter":1382,"content":"<p>I wish to give some degree of reassurance on the national cancer control programme.

I do not have any fear that this will be one of those documents that does not get implemented.  I was heavily involved in the cancer strategy and we are definitely following the same trajectory and will get the same benefits.

We are really pleased with this and within health, through leadership, we are setting up a strategic integrated workforce planning group.  This will have representation from national doctors training and planning, nursing, health and social care professionals, support grades and management and administration.

However, in terms of my area of responsibility within the Department, it is important to provide an update to the committee on it from a medical point of view.  As have all Members of the Oireachtas, I have been contacted by many patients who have a strong belief that medicinal cannabis could provide them with significant pain relief or even allay symptoms of what are some very serious conditions.  Yesterday, there was a briefing by Deputy Gino Kenny on a Bill that he intends to propose.  I also met with Ms Vera Twomey, who has been advocating for this change based on the medical conditions of her daughter, Ava Barry, yesterday.<\/p> <p>  Last week I decided to initiate a review of Ireland's policy on medicinal cannabis.  We have to be led by the evidence.  My instinct is that I would like to see a change in policy, but it has to be evidence-based and based on best international practice.  We must follow the clinical and scientific evidence.  Therefore, I have asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, formerly the Irish Medicines Board, which is the body that is available to us in terms of clinical and scientific evidence, to do a body of work and to report to me in January of next year on its views based on its research into medicinal cannabis.<\/p> <p>  From our conversations and meetings on it and from the work of the committee, I know that the Chairman intends - commencing this month - that this committee would also carry out work on the issue, which I welcome as it will be extremely complementary to the work of the HPRA.  In that regard, I understand that representatives from the HPRA will attend a meeting of his committee on 24 November.  I have asked the chief executive of the HPRA to keep this committee up to date with its work so that the work of both bodies might dovetail, with a view to being in a position in January where, collectively, we would have the information available to us in terms of the scientific and clinical evidence.<\/p> <p>  I do not intend to dilly dally in terms of progressing any recommendations made but nor do I intend to buy into the myth that we can just snap our fingers and make changes in this regard tomorrow.  There is an appropriate process, which is for both the HPRA and the committee to carry out their work.  Having spoken to the Chairman yesterday, I know that a number of other countries have pursued a course of action in this regard.  I do not wish to tell the committee its business but it may be of use to it committee to hear from them.  For example, this week I wrote to my counterpart in Denmark.  Denmark changed its policy in this regard on a four-year trial basis.  I am eager to work on a cross-party basis.  We will need to work on such a basis if we are to move this forward.  I envisage that we would have a sense of the direction of travel we could collectively take by the end of January if people are prepared to take it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#Z00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1388,"content":"<p>I have little to add to what the Minister has already stated.

As part of the overall picture of illegal drug use in Ireland, cannabis has one of the highest rates of use among all different ages, from age 15 to 65 plus.  There is a huge emphasis on how we deal with the use of cannabis in the country.

He will have to be imaginative to solve the issue.  On behalf of the Irish people, I ask that he be imaginative now rather than at the last minute.  Obviously he cannot reveal all his cards here, but I hope he has a plan in place to deal with what is glaringly obviously facing all of us given the decision on the Garda last week.  The Minister can throw out the line it was a Labour Court recommendation and the Government took it, but we all know, and I know, how this works with regard to the Labour Court, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the process by which it came about.  The Minister needs to face up to this now to be able to deal with it in several months time.  Let us not be back here speaking about planning for the strike and that the Minister has a way to solve it in an imaginative way within the Lansdowne Road agreement, which may or may not be possible.  I want the Minister's assurance he is doing this.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister guarantee he will come within budget this year?  I will be delighted if he does but I would like a guarantee.  I welcome the winter initiative and I have spoken to the Minister about it.  In fairness, he discussed it in a good bit of detail with me in advance and I respect him for this.<\/p><p>We have a huge problem with home help hours.  Will the Minister consider looking at a reallocation for this in the budgetary arithmetic?  Financially there is huge value in it.  I know from speaking with many of those working at senior levels in the HSE that they believe it would be something that could help them quite a bit.<\/p><p> I have a number of questions on maternity hospitals.  I am a huge supporter of the national maternity strategy as I believe it is an excellent strategy.  We must learn from what happened at Holles Street and in Portlaoise.  It is all very well having a strategy, but it needs to be implemented pretty rapidly because of the issues I just referenced, and I would support the Minister on this.  Unfortunately we will have issues while the strategy is being implemented.  How will it be funded?  Can we be innovative regarding how we fund it?  I have some ideas I will share on this because we need to think outside the box as to how we will fund it.<\/p><p> Approximately three or four weeks ago, during Question Time in the D&aacute;il, I asked the Minister about the use of private accident and emergency units for public services.  He committed to get back to me on it but he has not done so.  Will he, through the Secretary General, document the conversations and meetings which have happened in the meantime to show he has taken it seriously?  He did commit to coming back to me.  It is absolutely immoral and wrong that in 2016 an 85 year old woman can be left on a trolley in a public hospital in the Mater, while 100 yd. down the road there is a private hospital with a vacancy and that we can get into our cars and listen to the same hospital advertising for patients.  It is wrong and immoral, and the Minister has a duty to deal with it.<\/p><p> Will the Minister confirm to me no partial or full review of the National Ambulance Service is taking place that will have any negative impact on the provision of the service throughout the country?  I raised the particular issue of the mid-west with the Minister a number of weeks ago and he has not reverted to me.  Will the Minister confirm there will be no diminution of services, particularly of advanced paramedics, in the country and in the mid-west?  Will the Minister confirm this because he committed to come back to me on it?<\/p><p> We have a real issue with GPs.  The Chairman is facing a critical issue with Shannondoc in his home county of Clare.  The loss of services, particularly in rural locations, is absolutely frightening people.  The Chairman and I will face a public meeting on this on Friday week.  The services in County Clare are dropping significantly and the Chairman probably knows more about this than anyone.  What is the Minister doing to ensure the loss of these services can be prevented or what alternative mechanisms can be put in place?  We need a more holistic view on how we can get GPs into rural areas in particular and on how they can provide services.<\/p><p> I welcome the roll-out of community intervention teams and I am a big supporter of them, but we need consistency of approach throughout the country.  How can we push this along in a consistent way rather than leaving certain parts of the country lag behind for a long period of time?  I welcome the Minister's thoughts on this.<\/p><p> Will the Minister guarantee that medical postgraduate colleges will train enough specialists to provide for the health service and GPs?  Will he guarantee to us here and now that issues will not emerge on the corporate governance of these colleges and how they ensure we have the volume of specialists and GPs coming through to meet the needs of the health service?<\/p><p>I am asking this very specific question for a reason.<\/p><p> Finally, will Mr. O'Brien issue a circular to the various regional authorities or HSE groups, if he sees fit to do so, in relation to some kind of consistent approach to the management of their communications?  Some regions are using public relations firms and other regions are not.  I do not see why some of them are spending taxpayers' money on public relations firms.  Will Mr. O'Brien ensure there is a consistent approach here?  I believe this is not a good use of taxpayers' money.  When public relations are managing HSE regional corporate communications, it creates another layer.  I suggest Mr. O'Brien needs to deal with this immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#AA00400","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1396,"content":"<p>Deputy Kelly is making up for not being here the last time.

That is entirely a matter for the committee.  While I am grateful to the Deputy for asking me about the serious issue of industrial relations, I suggest we need to take a step back.  No decision to take industrial action has been made.  Certainly, no decision to strike has been made.  The INMO's executive council has decided to ballot for industrial action.  I do not think that ballot has commenced yet.  The result is due on 15 December next.  The Deputy is entirely right when he says that as Minister for Health, my job is to look at how we how we are going to address this issue before that date nears.

I know he wants to prioritise this issue and feels particularly strongly about home help.  I will ask the Minister of State with responsibility for this area, Deputy McEntee, to speak about this issue.  We have funded more home care packages and home help hours in the budget.  My strong view is that we need to look at the policy underpinning home help and home care because there is a lack of consistency in this area.  I do not know whether my colleagues around this table share that view.  Like all politicians, I want people to grow old with dignity in their own homes.  However, I am conscious that the only statutory scheme we have to underpin supports for older people is the fair deal scheme, which sends older people into nursing homes.  It is not as easy to resolve as I might make it sound with that commentary.  Some suggestions have been made.  Deputy O'Dea has published a constructive Bill in this regard, but it has a number of limitations and challenges that we need to explore.  I would be very interested in engaging with people on a cross-party basis in this regard.  I do not think the current model of home care is sustainable unless we look at statutorily underpinning it as we did with the fair deal scheme.  Why should the only statutory scheme be the one that involves sending people to nursing homes?  Maybe we could discuss that further.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy Kelly for his comments on our world-class national maternity strategy.  It is astonishing that we have not had such a strategy up to 2016.  I am reassured by the fact that it replicates the model of the national cancer strategy, which got on and did things.  As I have already outlined to Deputy O'Connell, an interim director has been appointed to drive the women and children programme within the HSE.  The same model was used under the cancer strategy.  Obviously, there is funding for the maternity strategy this year and into next year.  I will get the figures for the Deputy.  As Mr. Woods has already made clear, some 100 midwifery posts have already been filled as part of the driving on of this strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#DD00700","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1415,"content":"<p>What about the capital side?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#DD00800","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1416,"content":"<p>There is capital allocated for the national maternity hospital, but not yet for the other hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#DD00900","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1417,"content":"<p>How will they be funded?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#DD01000","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1418,"content":"<p>I hope they will be funded in the context of the capital review.

I know there is merit in it because my officials and I have met representatives of the Private Hospitals Association.  We will document that for the Deputy.  I will mention some of the challenges that exist.  We have to acknowledge that many private hospitals do not have 24-7 accident and emergency departments, intensive care facilities or critical care units.  Many of them provide episodic care to those with defined conditions, rather than those who turn up with emergencies.  We are using them as part of our waiting list initiative.  Their use is likely to increase in the context of the reactivation of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  They are also being used in the context of some of the winter initiative funding in areas like scoliosis, orthopaedics and spinal surgery.  I will give an example of public-private collaboration under the winter initiative.  Under a collaboration between the Mater public and private hospitals, respiratory patients can go directly to the private hospital rather than the public hospital.  We will send the Deputy details of this in our letter.  We are also trying to pursue a public-private collaboration under the winter initiative with Charter Medical's minor injuries service in Smithfield.  That will commence in December.  These are pilot schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#DD01300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1421,"content":"<p>I accept all of that.

If there is any specific information, I would like to know about it.  I will ask the question but I certainly have no information on it.<\/p><p>GP training is one of the more challenging areas.  I know it is a priority project for the Chairman and for me as it is vital to ensure we have a sustainable health service delivered to communities.  The key to making general practice sustainable is a new GP contract and engagement on that will start this year.  That contract must be meaningful for GPs and the delivery of primary care.  There is a body of work ongoing to ascertain what we want as a State and what we need from a new GP contract as people have been talking for decades about moving things into the community.  Although there has been some movement, substantial parts of the process have not come about.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will know from his involvement with the previous Government, we have seen an increase from July this year in the number of GP training places, and we are now training 172 per year, an increase from 157.  In 2010 we were training 119 GPs per year, so it is an increase.  The Chairman would be much more knowledgeable about this than me, but particularly in rural communities and areas of urban deprivation, there are business sustainability issues, if I can put it that bluntly, for GPs.  These are places where there is a need for a GP but there may not be a possible business case for a GP to justify establishing what will effectively be his or her own business.  That is why I have made it clear in the context of the GP contract negotiations that we might consider the option of salary for GPs.  If the State recognises the need for a GP in an area but there is none there, we could make an intervention and offer a salary.  I have spoken to younger GPs who want a work-life balance.  One should not have to be a wonderful business person to be a wonderful clinician or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  If there is an opportunity for a possible role, we could explore that in the context of the negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#FF00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1456,"content":"<p>I have a question on what is being discussed.  The Minister mentioned some critical issues, with one being the GP contract.  Is there a timeframe for negotiating this contract?  It has become critical.  We are losing our newly trained GPs and established GPs who are retiring early or emigrating.  There is an ageing population of GPs, with 33% being over 55.  This feeds into the lack of GPs working in rural areas and deprived urban areas.  Certainly, the problem with ShannonDoc and other co-operatives is not just confined to Clare or Tipperary.  It is a national and international issue as it is very difficult to attract GPs to work in rural and isolated areas if the conditions of service are so onerous that it is impossible to run a practice, make a living and have a reasonable lifestyle.  The timeframe of the GP contract is essential to how we deal with out-of-hours issues and recruitment of GPs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#FF00600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1457,"content":"<p>I can give a timeframe for the commencement but I will not give a timeframe for the conclusion.

We do not need an effort to put in place one big-bang new contract too be a static document for the next few decades.  Primary care developments are moving at too fast a pace.  We are operating off a contract that was originated 44 years ago.  Both the body of work and timeframe that would be involved in replacing it with a new contract would be colossal.<\/p><p> The negotiations will commence this year, which gives a very narrow window of opportunity.  I would like to take a phased approach to it.  While it will be very difficult for GPs and the State to agree a big-bang approach to a new contract, we can make progress on a number of issues in an incremental timeframe.  This year, I have made it clear that I would like a range of organisations to be involved.  That is not with any preference.  As a policy-maker, I should not care of which representative body a person is a member.  I should be willing to engage with all GPs in the interests of all patients.  Work is ongoing.

I hope health does not become a party-political issue.  It is important for us to say what health is, as distinct from what it might not or should not become.  For me, it is a societal issue.  I come immediately to the 600,000 people with disabilities or chronic illnesses and the 200,000 carers.  Everybody will find themselves in this space.  This is about how we see the trajectory and the planning regarding services into the future.<\/p><p>In my first question I talked about knitting the commitment to ratify and implement the UN convention into the statement of strategy, specifically that it would state that it is a matter for ongoing consideration at a senior management level in the Department.  Although the reply was helpful, it was a little shy of that.  Everybody comes into the disability or chronic illness space at some stage.<\/p><p> Given the increased incidence of chronic illness, planning is extremely important.  As I said earlier this week, I am very concerned that if there is any increase in costs of paying people who provide the services, it will come from the level of service the Minister is struggling hard to try to provide.  Employment is a major element of what is a personal service.  I am not saying whether there should or should not be any movement in it.<\/p><p> We talk about the winter initiative.  There is a disability issue morning, noon and night, winter and summer, but probably more in the winter time.  Many people are on a knife edge and are already getting less than they need.  This is another worry and concern on top of it.  The Minister understands the load he and his officials bear when they go into negotiations and try to be fair to everybody.  We have a huge distance to travel regarding the UN convention.<\/p><p> The director general's opening remarks were the opening remarks for this meeting.  They were examining many issues that are here and now.  We should have a decent idea of the trajectory of chronic conditions.  This is not a criticism of the Minister but must be dealt with.  Some of the causal factors are behavioural, and some are due to the parents people had which we cannot do anything about.  However, we can do more about amelioration, early intervention and good self-management, and there are many organisations in that space.  In parallel with dealing with the hot issues at the moment, it is important that we see the template regarding what Ireland is facing.  For example, at a presentation here a few weeks ago, Dr. Joe Harbison said that in 20 years we will have twice the number of people who have suffered strokes.  Let us start to put those things together and figure out what can be done in a range of ways about them.<\/p><p> I have written to every Department about disability and the statements of strategy.  Disabled people are simply members of the public to be served.  Health has taken up more of a load than it ever should have regarding people with disabilities.  In many Departments, there is a knee-jerk reaction to send any disability issues over to the Department of Health.  There is plenty for the Department of Health to get on with, and there is plenty for other Departments to do.<\/p><p> The success and value for money from health spend around disability and chronic illnesses is what people can do outside health.  Can they get jobs and be part of their communities?  It is a major issue.<\/p><p>What has to happen outside health to get the good bang from the investment that health is struggling to put in?  A strong statement on this should be in the statement of strategy and that might encourage others to do the same.<\/p><p> What will be the quantum of the additional delivery of services to people using personal assistants, PAs, next year?  The Minister helpfully said increases in PA services are needed.  His service plan will not be published for a week or two.  What improvement will there be in the hours and services available for people in the year ahead?  If he cannot reply now, that is fair enough but that is the question.<\/p><p> My third question relates to the provision of neurological community and hospital-based services in 2017 over and above the current level of service.  I am in the same time warp in this regard.  Hopefully, the reply will be one I would like to hear.  Specific condition support organisations and other disability organisations, the Department and the HSE could do better work on early intervention and supporting people.  The Minister mentioned that the fair deal scheme is statutorily underpinned whereas community services are not.  Provision has been shaved away over the years.  Putting supports into the community will take pressure off acute services and make sure people who should never be in the acute system do not end up there.<\/p><p> Mental health reform groups were buoyed up when they heard &euro;35 million would be provided next year but now they are hearing the figure will be approximately &euro;15 million, increasing to &euro;35 million the following year.  They are concerned that this amount will not be available next year because it is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#GG00700","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1467,"content":"<p>I have been liaising with my party colleagues, Deputy Butler and Councillor Murphy, on Waterford hospital.

Will it be later this year or early next year?<\/p> <p>  I welcome the additional &euro;18.5 million in funding for the primary care strategy and I also acknowledge the work on the development of primary care centres around the country but it is not all about bricks and mortars.  It is about the activity that happens within the centres.  Bearing that in mind and the serious manpower crisis in general practice, will the Minister consider specific funding for practice nurses in the context of nurse prescribing?  There are many inadequacies within our health system in so far as GPs perform nursing duties and consultants perform GP duties.  If GPs are considering sending their nurses a on nurse prescribing course, they have to fund it themselves.<\/p><p>Given 90% of all patients are seen in general practice on a day-to-day basis, a specific model to fund practice nurses in nurse prescribing would help the transition of the patient through the system in a more timely manner and would help alleviate the pressures we are witnessing in primary care and it probably would reduce the referral rates to secondary care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#JJ00200","speaker":"1373","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1469,"content":"<p>I intend to visit Waterford hospital shortly and I made clear in the statement I released when I published the Herity report and in my correspondence with the HSE in the context of the service plan that I expect those service improvements to be advanced and progressed in the context of the HSE's 2017 service plan.   I expect to deliver on them early in 2017 and I will have an opportunity to detail more of that when I visit the hospital shortly.  I look forward to doing that.<\/p> <p>  Senator Swanick made an important point on primary care.  I had the honour of addressing a practice nurses conference in Santry recently.  They left me in no doubt about this valid point we are discussing.  The GP has an important role in primary care but there is an issue about resourcing the practice nurse to do more as part of the GP's team.  These issues will be considered and addressed in the context of the GP contract negotiations.  The negotiations cannot just be about the GP and the State; they have to be about the GP and the GP's team of support, including other health care professionals.  That will be addressed in that context.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Senator Dolan's questions.  I am aware of his work in this area for a long time and I admire his commitment.  It is important to have him in the House on behalf of the 600,000 people with disabilities.  We are lucking to have Deputy Finian McGrath as our Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities and he will go through the specific issues raised by the Senator but we will make sure disability issues are front and centre in all our Department's strategies.<\/p> <p>  The neuro-rehabilitation strategy is important.  I had an excellent meeting recently.  I would like to acknowledge Deputy O'Reilly's colleague, Councillor Natalie Treacy, who has done superb work in this area.  Councillor Treacy and representatives of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, MS Ireland and another organisation came to see me recently.  I asked them informally to do some work with me on the need to improve our neuro-rehabilitation services.  We will detail improvements in the service plan for 2017 but the key element - I think there was agreement at the meeting - in this regard is the need to publish the implementation plan as quickly as possible.  It is due shortly and it is a priority.  At least then, we will have the long awaited roadmap.  In fairness to the HSE and all those working on the strategy's implementation plan, they had the common sense that when the feedback came in from the consultation that people were not satisfied with the implementation plan to have another go at it to try to make it better.  I expect the implementation plan to be published shortly.  I also expect to visit the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire shortly.  I have asked again that the delegation would accompany me because while there is a significant project of work planned for the hospital, which is exciting and will result in significant improvements for patients, there is a bigger campus.  We should have a discussion about a master plan and look on the development at the hospital as phase 1 with a view that more needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  We also have to look in the context of our hospital groups structure at the ability of some of our lower level of acuity hospitals to do more in the rehabilitation space.  I think of County Louth when I reference that.  Our Lady of Lourdes is the acute hospital but the stroke rehabilitation work being done in the county hospital in Dundalk is impressive and it wants to do more.  I visited Roscommon hospital recently to announce and progress funding for its rehabilitation unit.  The idea that all roads lead to D&uacute;n Laoghaire must be challenged because of the significant burden that places on families and support structures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#KK00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1470,"content":"<p>The issue of time and resources was raised.

My ambition is to rebuild the services.  We accept they have been devastated over the past seven or eight years and part of the plan is to try to reinvest, reform and develop the services.  In my first six months in the job, I have met approximately 2,800 people with disabilities, their families and service providers throughout the country.  By Christmas, I hope to have met everybody who works in the sector.  That is just the background.<\/p><p> On the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Department of Health will shortly issue a statement of strategy which will outline the objectives of the policies and which will contain specific actions to enable and support people with disabilities to live independently and lead active lives in their communities.  The lead responsibility for the ratification of the UN convention lies with the Department of Justice and Equality.  However, the Department of Health will provide significant input into the drafting of the legislation.<\/p><p> The forthcoming Department of Health statement of strategy will reflect the importance placed on empowering people with disabilities to lead lives that will allow them to have greater independence and to gain access to the services they choose.  The statement of strategy is coming out soon and we will include it in the latter.  I will talk to the Minister, Deputy Harris, on the details of this issue.<\/p><p> The Senator asked that the needs and interests be considered at a senior level at all times in the Department.  The answer in that regard is absolutely -100% yes.  That view and the views of all people with disabilities are reflected in my meetings at the Department of Health and the HSE, and regularly at Cabinet meetings.  As the Senator has told me on many occasions, disability rights and services are broader than just health.  I need to focus on that.  I think the Cabinet has accepted it at this stage.  That is why I indicated that I will work closely with the Minister, Deputy Harris, to include the viewpoint to which I refer in the statement, which is very important.<\/p><p> Not only does the Department need to change radically, but so do society and political parties.  I would always ask the question, \"What are you doing in relation to the issue of people with disabilities?\"  That is very important.<\/p><p> The Senator also asked about personal assistant hours.  We are looking very closely at this in preparing our service plan.  I cannot give a specific commitment at this meeting.  The provision of personal assistant hours is very important for people.  We need to ensure that the people who have them get more hours.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the late Martin Naughton, a great campaigner on disability rights.  He pushed for that issue for many years and he reminded me of it regularly when I took over as Minister of State.  That was one of my reasons for putting him on the task force for personalised budgets.  We need to deal with these issues.  We are starting that process.  I will do my best to include personal assistant hours in the service plan.<\/p><p> Of course, I have my own personal issues regarding respite places for intellectually disabled people and quality day services.<\/p><p>We had a few successes regarding day services this year.  It is very important that people know that.  We have to rebuild and invest in our services.  The bottom line is that we have to ensure that every person with a physical or intellectual disability is respected as a citizen of the State and that their rights are protected.  Part of that strategy will be radical reform and investment in the services to ensure that every person with a disability gets his or her rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#KK00300","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1473,"content":"<p>I know it is now 12 noon, but I wish to touch on two things.  In the area of home help, the objective is to keep people within their homes for as long as possible.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, rightly said that disability should not just be related to health.  I share the view that when it comes to supporting older people within their homes, it is not just a health issue.<\/p> <p>  The national positive aging strategy is the first strategy of its kind to identify that.  I look forward to working with every Department next year in moving that strategy forward and identifying how we can help to keep people in their homes.  However, obviously home help is one of the biggest elements of that.  As was pointed out by Senator Colm Burke in the Seanad last night, there is a complete inconsistency in people being able to access the nursing home support scheme and obviously home help.  That is because we do not have the framework.  Work to develop a more stabilised framework or a formalised system is already under way.  The Health Research Board is preparing a report on the financing and regulation of it.  It will look at the regulation in other jurisdictions, the legislative framework, the registration process, the inspection regime, self-assessment, training requirements and the national standards.  If we are going to make it work, we need to ensure we have a framework for older people or people with disability who need care.  I hope that report will be presented to me by the end of this year and we will get working on it next year.<\/p> <p>  On budget day we announced &euro;35 million worth of new initiatives.  We were very clear that as in previous years, we have not been able to spend all of that.  The increase overall is &euro;24.7 million and while some would argue that only &euro;15 million of that is on new developments, the &euro;9.7 million on increasing staffing wages will help us to be able spend the full &euro;35 million or whatever figure we decide into the future as well.  Mental Health Reform has identified that we need to inject &euro;35 million every year for five years to fully implement A Vision for Change.  The Government fully supports implementing A Vision for Change over that five-year period.  However, if we do not plan and make those changes, particularly in the area of staffing, while we can allocate it, we will never be able to spend it.<\/p> <p>  There were a number of questions earlier about what we were going to do to increase staffing numbers.  Thankfully, in line with the other nursing elements, over 90% of the psychiatric nurses coming out of college are getting full-time positions here.  However, I am aware that we need to increase that.  This year, funding was allocated for 60 new additional training places.  That number will increase by 70 again.  We hope that in the next four years, that number will increase to 520, which is a 45% increase.  Obviously the &euro;35 million and the new developments depend on being able to get those numbers.  While I understand the disappointment that it is only &euro;15 million, that is in the context of it being a full &euro;35 million, with the addition of &euro;50 million for a new forensic hospital, which I think we would all agree, is also a significant element of implementing A Vision for Change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#MM00200","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1474,"content":"<p>I forgot one short point when responding to Senator Dolan.

Unlike my colleague, Deputy Kelly, with whom I get along very well, I do not agree with having very few people at meetings of this nature.  Occasionally, one needs a full house in order to get a comprehensive response to the issues that are likely to be raised by an equally large delegation from the committee.  I compliment the Minister and Ministers of State and their officials for their attendance and wish them well in the work they have done so far and the work they are about to do.<\/p><p>I am a bit more radical than Deputy Kelly in the sense that I totally disagree with the concept of the HSE as a vehicle for the delivery of health services.  I have always held that view.  From the outset, I asked Mr. Brendan Drumm if he thought it was the appropriate vehicle and he said that on the day of his appointment, he did not know.  I presume that over time, he came to a conclusion on that as well.  I mean no disrespect to the good people here who do an excellent job and the people who have tremendous expertise in their own field and have a huge contribution to make to the provision of health services in this country.  It is a second opinion.  I believe there can only be one opinion, which is the Minister for Health and the Department, and no policy-making body other than one to carry out the decisions taken, as used to be the case once upon a time when the old health board system was in existence.  One of the greatest things about the health board system was the fact that at a meeting of the health board, all the services involved sat in front of one at least a month.  It was a great way to keep up to date.  The crises such as those one reads about in newspapers did not appear then because there was somebody there <i>in situ<\/i>knowing what was going to happen before it happened.  I just want to mention that point.  The Minister knows my views on this subject, as did previous Ministers.<\/p><p>I welcome the concept of budgeting with reasonable accuracy.  We hope it is accurate at last in order to deliver services.  Over the past seven or eight years, nobody could conclude with any kind of security what would be available to spend on anything.  Virtually every service is short.  Cuts fell on some like a guillotine and nothing could be done about it.  Health, education, environmental and housing services have suffered.  Everything suffered to a huge extent and the people suffered but the people who suffer most are those directly affected such as households where someone has a disability, whether a child or young adult or where someone has had to care for a relative with a disability for a long period of time, particularly the carer who may be a mother in some cases looking after a father, daughter or whoever the case may be.  I and everyone here has seen this.  I hope we are getting to grips with this situation.  Somebody may have been caring for a relative for 40 years who was originally a child, the care of which became a huge burden over time for the caring relative with consequent damage to his or her own health such as back problems.  We all know people who have been affected like that.  I acknowledge the presence of Jonathan Irwin.  I also acknowledge the late Martin Naughton with whom I launched a service in that area many years ago.<\/p><p> If one looks at a household with a child with severe disabilities and asks how many people are available to care for that child as he or she progresses, we all have seen situations where women in particular may have spent 25, 30 or 40 years caring for the same child in a dedicated fashion, show the stress of it and do not always get the response they would like from the HSE, which is the delivery body at this stage.  I am not criticising any of the witnesses.  In recent days, I had occasion to try to source a location for residential care because I believe there is an interaction between the residential care and respite care that is available and the carer's ability to care indefinitely.  It is not possible to move one without the other.  The unfortunate 20 year old was being referred to a nursing home, which is totally inappropriate for a person of that age.  I remember visiting St. Dympna's Hospital in Carlow as a visiting committee member many years ago to find a child having an epileptic fit in the middle of a group of much older people.  I thought this was appalling.  We need to move away from those prehistoric times.  While we talk and all claim to know about it, it is only when one meets the person directly involved face to face that one fully appreciates what it means.<\/p><p> I ask the HSE not to allow situations to develop where that kind of resolution is proposed because it is inappropriate and does not work.  We need to recognise that the mother, as was the case in this situation and a number of other cases, may have dedicated her whole life to the person needing care.  There may be no other partner there to help, as is often the case.  The trauma suffered by that carer over a period of time can be really serious.  If that person tries to hold down a job, sometimes in the health care area, it makes it even worse because they must now juggle one and the other.  Can the HSE seriously consider a form of residential care in particular areas where it is appropriate to cater for those kind of cases?  I know the witnesses will tell me that we have respite care but we do not have it in the way we need it.  There will be some cases where there is a need for weekly residential care with provision for the person to come home for the weekends, and that can work and has worked quite well.<\/p><p> Due to the budgetary restrictions over recent years, we have had to cut transport provision.  Again, this is a huge problem for the unfortunate people to whom I have just referred and who the witnesses all know about.  Could the mobility grant or something similar be introduced to replace what was there to ensure we do not differentiate between one patient and another and that if one mother has to drive her child to special educational needs services or work therapy, she is able to do so and is not excluded from a transport service provided to other children at the same time?<\/p><p> In respect of disability and psychiatric services, we could do nothing up to now.  We may not be able to do all we need to do in the short space of time offered by the next year or year and a half, but perhaps we could focus on those issues in a way we have not done previously with a view to engaging in the forward planning that is necessary in order that it can kick into place when the time comes.<\/p><p> The home care package is an excellent idea.  In a previous incarnation, I used to hear about how wonderful home care packages were and how everybody was going to be cared for at home.  That is not so.  It is not possible to do that and there will always be a need for institutional care of a high quality for a certain number of people who cannot be cared for at home because it would cost a multiplicity of converging arrangements to provide any degree of worthwhile care for them.  The key point here is the quality of life for the person being cared for.<\/p><p>We must put in place the necessary measures to ensure the best possible service to ensure their quality of life can be provided for the person being cared for and also for the carer.<\/p><p> As I said, I welcome the provision of primary care centres but I am a bit suspicious of them.  I would have thought the emergence of the primary care centres would show a dramatic reduction in the number of patients presenting at accident and emergency, particularly for minor ailments or even where minor surgery was required.  I tabled a number of parliamentary questions to the Minister and his predecessor and I have not got the answer that I want.  I am aware that patients still pass by the primary care centre and go on to accident and emergency.  That should not be happening because it involves duplicating services and wasting money.  One cannot have two staff doing the same job side by side, with one of them overcrowded and the other not.  That is apropos of what was referred to by Deputy Kelly in a different context.  As the Chairman will be aware, we need to deal with these matters.<\/p><p> On the question of the delivery of services to rural areas, there is a notion developing within some elements of the HSE that if everybody is brought into an urban setting, services can be delivered there.  They tried that in the UK long ago and it did not work.  It is as simple as that.  That was found to be at fault.  I would ask that we recognise that the purpose of this exercise is to deliver the highest quality services to the broadest spectrum of the population in the most efficient and effective way, including in terms of both cost and health.<\/p><p> I am in favour of medical cannabis.  I assure the Chairman, unlike quite a number of others, that I have not yet even experimented with it and I do not intend to.  I have experienced severe pain due to a particular condition I have.  I know all about that and I know that those who suffer severe pain will do anything to alleviate it.  The most important point is we strictly differentiate between recreational use and medical use.  We need to get a second opinion on that to ensure we legislate for the patient, not for the frivolous.<\/p><p> The Chairman will be glad to hear I have come to my last point.  This is something I hold a strong view about as well.  When I was Opposition spokesman on health, there was a group of public hospitals that provided care for older people.  Those hospitals were well established and built up over the years, but gradually they became the poor relation.  People said these kind of hospitals brought about a stigma and that we could not have people living like that and so forth.  We eventually got to a situation where somebody somewhere decided we would have no more such institutions and we would care for the people in the community.  That would be a good idea if it happened, but it does not always happen.  There are a number of such hospitals and residential community care centres which are public and which are doing a great job.  I do not want to see them replaced by private institutions because there is an important element here that we need to keep on board.  We need to be able to compare the private sector delivery with the public sector delivery without overlapping and side by side in order that we can have a clear evaluation of who is doing what.<\/p><p> Close to the Minister's heart is Crooksling where the highest quality of services have been available.  I disagree entirely with the antics of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, in its efforts to reduce it to make it inoperable and uneconomical.  There has been a dedicated staff there who have worked diligently to ensure the provision and delivery of the services, and they have done a great job.  The patients they have - women only - could not possibly get the same quality of services in the home.  It cannot be done.<\/p><p>One cannot deliver the services to 60, 80 or 100 patients in the same way as they can deliver them there in that fashion.  As the Minister will be aware, we have a service in Athy in County Kildare and we have an excellent service in my own town, Maynooth.  I am sorry for being parochial in these matters but those services are working extremely well and just because some genius, in working out decimal points in some place in the system, has come to the conclusion that he can do a better job elsewhere does not mean that he can.  One such person emerged in recent times in the case of the location of GPs throughout the country.  I would be delighted to accommodate that argument at any time whenever those individuals want to present themselves.<\/p><p> Generally speaking, the population of this country is almost double what it was in the 1950s.  There are double the number of people working in this country than there were in the 1980s.  We are in a far more demanding atmosphere than previously.  This means that we now carry out an evaluation as to what we require in the future.  Senator Colm Burke asked about various appointments, etc.  All this information is available at the press of a button.  One should not need to dig for it at all.  If it is not available at the press of a button, somebody is not doing his or her job.  All that information is right there.  One can find out what are the requirements, how many staff are retiring, how many spaces are left to be filled, how many consultants will retire next year and how many GPs will retire next year.<\/p><p> Incidentally, I cannot see for the life of me why everybody should have to retire at 65.  I assure the Minister that there are several GPs throughout the country who would be quite happy to continue on working well after 65, and well after 70 at which time they are obliged to retire, but who resent being asked to retire.  They have given an excellent service which they built up themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#NN00600","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1485,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan for his contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#QQ00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1486,"content":"<p>I knew the Chairman would be appreciative of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#QQ00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1487,"content":"<p>If Senator Colm Burke would be ten times more brief, I would appreciate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#QQ00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1488,"content":"<p>President-elect of the United States, Mr. Trump, has now proved the issue in relation to retirement anyway.<\/p> <p>  Returning to my own queries, the reply to Question No. 15 was inadequate.  It was not dealt with and I do not understand it.  The reply is confusing.  It is a simple question.  My understanding is that in the case of the HSE north Lee public health nurses, at any one time there were ten staff either out on sick leave or maternity leave and replacements were not provided while they were out.  I have no complaint about staff being out on maternity leave or sick leave.  It is about the lack of a procedure for replacement.  That amounts to almost 15% of the staff out at any one time, which puts an unfair burden on the staff who are there.  I ask that the situation be addressed and that I get a proper written reply to that question.<\/p> <p>  I return to another question I set out earlier in relation to consultants.  As far as I am concerned, the template was set out in 2014.  I should not have to wait until January to get a report.  I ask that I get a detailed reply before the end of the month on that matter.  I do not believe I should have to wait three months.  I do not have the privilege of being able to put down parliamentary questions in the same way as the Deputies have.  We only ask questions once every three months and these are two questions where replies have not been adequate.<\/p> <p>  The other point related to persons with intellectual disabilities.  The reason I raised that question was that I understand there is a difference in funding provided to organisations.  One organisation is getting 19% less funding than comparable organisations which cater for the same number of people.  The reply gave the cost of residential care as working out on average at &euro;80,000 per person.  My understanding is the average cost of the organisation I was in discussion with is &euro;56,000 per person per annum.<\/p> <p>  The questions have not been dealt with appropriately.

In relation to bed capacity, there was a review and reconfiguration of services in the mid-west seven or eight years ago and acute beds were taken from Ennis and Nenagh.<\/p><p>Yet, the regional hospital in Limerick, University Hospital Limerick, as it is now called, has a major trolley problem.  I realise the Minister visited the hospital some weeks ago but the same problem may not have been as acute as it was on Tuesday.  A total of 66 people were on trollies in Limerick on Tuesday, a record number.  This goes back to the reconfiguration and the bed capacity issue.  I know a bed capacity review is under way.  The living evidence of the shortage of beds is the trolley queues that continued throughout the summer.  They never dipped unlike in previous years.  Now, the hospital in Limerick has the highest number in what is probably the mildest winter we have had for several years and there is no influenza problem at the moment either.  What is the situation with regard to bed capacity, in particular for Limerick?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#QQ00600","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1491,"content":"<p>I will begin with your question, Chairman.  I will ask Liam Woods to comment in a moment as the director of the acute hospitals division.  Bed capacity is one of the issues contributing to the trolley situation in Limerick, but there are others.  Bed closures or bed capacity not being opened in nearby hospitals, where they are available but where there is a staffing issue, is another contributing factor.  Possibly, the primary care Shannon Doc configuration could be a contributory factor as well.  Certainly, I am concerned that it could become a contributory factor.  Another challenge in Limerick relates to the capacity of the emergency department - I am referring to the physical capacity.  I was struck by this when I visited the building.  I realise plans are under way for a new emergency department and staff will be moving in to it early next year.<\/p> <p>  We have opened a further 53 beds as part of this year's winter initiative.  I will ask Liam Woods to comment on that in a moment.  We are going to carry out a bed capacity review in general for the country.  I am keen for the bed capacity review to be complete in time for the Government's capital plan review.  Obviously, there is a cost associated with accommodating and physically fitting in to our hospitals more beds and for this to be done in time for the capital review.<\/p> <p>  It is important to consider several points when we are discussing trolleys.  Specific hospitals have specific problems and there is no disputing that whatsoever.  It is important to discuss the figures in context.  We still have a situation whereby despite emergency department attendances being up, on average, in the system by approximately 5%, the number of people on trolleys this year is still down by approximately 4%.  I accept this is not a defence of the point and the figures are still far too high and unacceptable, but it means almost 4,000 fewer people have been on trolleys in the health service this year to date than for last year for the same period.  This is simply a contextual comment.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked several questions.  I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, to address some of them and I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to deal with mental health and older persons questions.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised specific issues regarding structures and the HSE structure in particular.  I get the impression that we have been talking about the structure and model of the health service since God was a boy.  I am sceptical about whether our patients have benefited significantly from such academic and deep discussions.  That is why we need to have consensus.  What we do not need is for Ministers to arrive and start tinkering with structures and models and ending up all over the place for a period, only for a new Minister to come in to do more tinkering and re-modelling.  This is why the Oireachtas cross-party Committee on the Future of Healthcare has to come up with a vision for our health service that is owned not by me or the Department of Health but by the Oireachtas and all parties within it.  I look forward to receiving the report of the committee.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan is right in respect of his comments on primary care.  I have been consistent in the view that primary care is about more than bricks and mortar, although bricks and mortar are important.  Figures available to me indicate that approximately 30% of the minor surgical procedures currently carried out in our acute hospital settings could be undertaken in general practice.  That represents a sizeable number of people.  Much of this needs to be addressed in the context of the general practitioner contract, although some work has been done in this area.  Under a pilot project on minor surgery in general practic, we have seen 4,263 minor surgical procedures carried out.  Approximately 55% of these were carried out on medical card patients.  We now have a comprehensive accreditation system for GP surgeons.  Practices have been tested in what we are calling the minor surgery pilot study.  A final report on the project has been published and we are now planning to progress it further and to extend it to more practices.  Patient satisfaction as well as outcomes is important and 96% of patients who had surgery carried out in the GP practice rated the overall experience as very good or excellent.  A similar project in respect of the provision of ultrasound services in primary care is under way.  This started as a pilot in 2005.  Funding of &euro;700,000 was provided in 2015.  A further amount of &euro;13.5 million of held-back funding for primary care developments was provided for access to diagnostics this year.  I have visited several places.  I was in Tipperary recently in a centre where people are now getting an ultrasound done in the GP practice rather than going to the hospital in Clonmel.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the views expressed.<\/p><p>We need to do more and the general practitioner contracts are important in this regard.<\/p><p> I will make a final point on older people.  I agree with the views expressed in this regard as well.  If an older person comes into our hospital system, he or she needs to be dealt with in a particularly sensitive and careful manner.  While the debate about specific hospitals is probably for another day, we can develop the pathway of care for older people.  The first place should always be at home in the community.  The point made is right.  That will not always be possible.  Under the winter initiative this year, we have piloted a new development for older people whereby there is a specific place where the older person comes in on entry to the hospital.  A specific nurse will be on hand to deal with the older person.  Sometimes older people have acute needs and are in a fragile situation.  Our older people should not have to go through the general milieu of the emergency department.  I am watching carefully the project we are about to initiate in St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny with a view to further learning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#RR00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1493,"content":"<p>I will comment on two aspects.  Deputy Bernard Durkan raised the question of a person with an intellectual disability in a nursing home.  First, it is important to know that 60% of all young adults and adults with an intellectual disability live in their family homes.  What we have now is a situation whereby families are considering the idea of combining living at home with a mixture of respite care and day care.  Again, Deputy Durkan is correct to point out that we must have these services in place.  Otherwise we will end up with people outside the system or in some cases on the streets.  That is not acceptable.  The principle of having someone with an intellectual disability in a nursing home as a long-term answer is not acceptable to me as the Minister of State.  We are prioritising these issues, especially the questions of residential, day care and respite care in the service plan.  We have to deal with these issues.<\/p> <p>  Another issue might assist the families affected.  I set up a task force in September to look into the possibility of a personalised budget.  Many families are coming to me privately inquiring about this.  I accept that it will not suit all families.  However, a substantial number of families throughout the State are telling me that if they were given the budget for 12 months, they could spend it wisely.  That would deal with the issues raised by Senator Colm Burke.<\/p> <p>  Someone mentioned a cost of &euro;80,000 per year for the service and another &euro;56,000 per year per person in further service costs.  I am also finding out the consequences of emergency crisis situations.  These can happen in several cases where people with disability have high dependency needs.  If the person ends up in the emergency department, we will end up spending twice the amount of what it would have cost with a better planned service.  I am sitting down with people from St. Michael's House, Prosper Fingal and similar organisations such as St. John of God.  I am suggesting to them that they need to focus on these issues and work closely with us in developing the services.<\/p> <p>  The value-for-money review of disability services in Ireland is being implemented through the Transforming Lives programme.  There is a need to monitor performance, control expenditure and shape services.  These are issues we need to deal with in a comprehensive way.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to the original question from Deputy Durkan.  It is unacceptable to have a person with an intellectual disability in such a particular service.  That is probably as a result of a crisis situation.  We need to ensure that the services and funding are put in place and that we respect the families involved, as well as the person with the disability.  That is my objective.  I do not make big promises, but I am giving the commitment that this is the direction in which I want to bring the services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016111000002#SS00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1478768400,"counter":1494,"content":"<p>Sorry for going over time.
