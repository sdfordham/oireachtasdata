During my visit to the US last week, I spoke with several key contacts in the US Congress including leading members of the House Judiciary Committee, Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Chair of the Congressional Friends of Ireland, Pete King.  I also met with representatives of Irish community groups as well as some community members who are undocumented.  I am acutely aware of the difficulties they face as a result of their undocumented status.  I am more determined than ever to continue to work to find a solution to their plight.   <\/p><p>  A resolution of the situation facing the undocumented Irish in the United States remains a priority for the Government.  The Government also attaches great importance to seeking provision for future flows of migration between Ireland and the United States through the extension of the &ldquo;E-3&rdquo; visa scheme to include Irish citizens.  In this context, we very much welcomed the US Senate&rsquo;s approval of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill by a 68-32 margin on 27 June last.  The comprehensive draft legislation, which was drafted over several months by a bipartisan group of eight US Senators, provides for extensive reform of the US immigration system. It includes provisions that would legalise the status of undocumented Irish people and provide a path to permanent residency.  It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US via the proposed E-3 visa. <\/p><p>  The Bill is a very positive development.  Its provisions, if adopted, would help to end the great hardship and uncertainty faced by undocumented Irish in the US and their families here in Ireland.  The inclusion of a new provision to allow several thousand Irish citizens to legally avail of employment opportunities in the US every year is also particularly welcome.  <\/p><p>  The focus has now shifted to the House of Representatives for its consideration of the issues.  It remains to be seen whether a consolidated Bill can be agreed between the Senate and the House of Representatives.  It is generally accepted that securing overall agreement will remain a complex and challenging process, particularly at a time when Congress is preoccupied by budgetary and debt issues.  This was clear from my discussions last week and I believe the challenge to secure agreement has become even greater in recent times.  I am determined to continue to deploy all our resources at political, diplomatic and Irish community level to make progress on this vital issue.  <\/p><p>  In addition to my contacts last week in New York, I visited Washington DC on 11-12 July and held a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, including with key members of the House of Representatives and Senate, with the US Administration and with Irish-American community representatives.  I reiterated throughout all these contacts the Government&rsquo;s interest in all aspects of immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing an overall agreement reached which provides relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and a facility for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.<\/p><p>  I wish to acknowledge the critically important role being played by a number of Irish community organisations, including the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform and the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.  I also want to acknowledge the role played by Ambassador Collins and more recently by Ambassador Anderson and staff at the Embassy in Washington who have been steadily building support for our objectives. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200061#WRA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":22,"content":"<p>Question No. 15 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation Issues","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200062#WRB00250"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[41064\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200062#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of ambassadors to Ireland that have called to his office since taking office to register an official complaint; and if so the detail of same.

The private sector, as an engine of growth, innovation and investment to developing countries, has a major role to play in development. Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the IFC is led by the Minister for Finance as Governor of the World Bank. Ireland has been a member of the IFC since 1958.  Through Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ireland partners with the IFC to support technical assistance and advisory services to the private sector for investment climate reform activities in Sub-Saharan Africa and for fragile and conflict affected states in Africa. The aim of this support is to reduce poverty through inclusive private sector growth.  Irish Aid has provided &euro;900,000 to the IFC for this technical and advisory support in 2013. Ireland does not provide financial resources for investments through IFC.   <\/p><p>   Officials in my Department have taken note of the &ldquo;Compliance Audit of IFC's Financial Sector Investments&rdquo; by the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) as well as the management response by the International Finance Cooperation.

In particular, I am aware of deeply disturbing footage which has been circulating on the internet purporting to show young LGBTI individuals being lured to a location only to be violently assaulted. Let me state quite clearly that any acts of violence directed against members of the LGBTI community in Russia, or anywhere else for that matter, are unacceptable and to be deplored.<\/p><p>  As I reiterated to the D&aacute;il last month, Ireland is firmly committed to combating discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.

As I said, such legislation, while purporting to protect young people, is more likely to result in the further stigmatisation and, indeed, criminalisation of LGBTI young people. My Department has made our position known to senior officials at the Russian Embassy in Ireland.  I, myself, have not spoken to the Russian Ambassador but it is my intention to raise the matter at my next meeting with a Russian Minister.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, I have asked officials in my Department to actively engage on this issue in various international fora and explore what avenues can most effectively be pursued in voicing our concerns, including with our partners in the EU.  For example, with other like-minded partners, Ireland was instrumental in ensuring that the EU statement at the 24th Session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva on 17 September contained a strong reference to our serious concerns over Russian LGBTI legislation. The statement called on the Russian Federation to strive for greater inclusiveness and tolerance for minorities in Russian society. <\/p><p>  Discussions continue within the EU on how best to ensure that our concerns are kept firmly on the agenda of the Union&rsquo;s structured dialogue with Russia.  That dialogue includes specific consultations on Human Rights with Russian officials, the next round of which should take place this autumn.

The terms under which the Rafah border crossing to Egypt operates are restricted by the agreement between Israel and Egypt under which the Sinai was returned to Egypt, but it has at times acted as an important safety valve when conditions in Gaza have demanded it. Unfortunately, due to the turmoil in Egypt, including serious security problems in the Sinai and a belief by the Egyptian authorities that weapons and fighters are entering Egypt from Gaza, controls on the Rafah crossing have tightened considerably in recent months.<\/p><p>  The health system in Gaza, like all aspects of life, is affected by these various restrictions, inevitably resulting in greater risks to some patients. Medical supplies to Gaza, like all goods, must come in through crossing points whose operation is laborious and often interrupted, and the access of patients to treatments not available in Gaza is likewise complicated.  The recent case of Mr. Abu-Sada is a particular example of this. As a Hamas official he would be unlikely to seek treatment in Israel, but it is not clear if this had any bearing on his ability to cross into Egypt. I have no independent details of the particular circumstances of his case.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that numbers of patients from Gaza are treated in Israeli hospitals, which also indeed treat patients from the West Bank and even, recently, from the fighting in Syria. This is despite the fact that Israel considers both Gaza and Syria to be hostile territories, from which it is subject to attack. Some patients have also been transferred into Egypt.<\/p><p>  I commend those actions. I call for the ending of all restrictive measures on entry into, and out of, Gaza of normal human, commercial and humanitarian traffic. And in the meantime, I would indeed appeal to all relevant authorities, Palestinian, Israeli and Egyptian, to be as flexible and compassionate as they can be in providing for the treatment of  persons in need in Gaza, trapped by the forces in conflict around them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200063#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200063#WRC01150"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[41125\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200063#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which he in conjunction with his EU and UN colleagues may encourage the new administration in Iran towards a more secular society incorporating a modern attitude to human rights; if it might be found possible for the international community to respond positively in terms of reduction and-or removal of sanctions in return for the adoption of human rights principles and recognition for minorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, Ireland and our EU partners will certainly continue to do all we can to encourage a greater respect for human rights in Iran. It is encouraging that the new Government has made some positive signals in that respect. Ireland strongly urges Iran's new President Mr Hassan Rouhani, who has received a strong mandate from the Iranian people, to improve the human rights situation in Iran.<\/p><p>  I raised the issue of human rights in Iran in a bilateral meeting with new Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on 26 September, in the margins of the UN General Assembly session in New York, following an earlier phone contact with him. I particularly expressed Ireland's concerns about Iran's use of the death penalty. In addition, while welcoming the release of several Iranian prisoners of conscience, including human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, in Iran this month, I strongly encouraged the release of more political prisoners.  Indeed, many further practical steps are needed to mark a real change in the human rights situation in Iran. In particular, together with EU partners, I urge President Rohani to immediately end the house arrest of former Presidential candidates Mir Houssein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi and to release all those imprisoned for non-violent political beliefs or for belonging to a particular religious minority, such as the Baha'i.<i><\/i> Furthermore, in line with the EU's strong position of principle on the death penalty, I reiterate Ireland and the EU's call on Iran to halt all pending executions, and introduce a moratorium on this cruel and inhumane punishment.<\/p><p>  I am encouraged by the agreement in principle by HR Ashton and FM Zarif in New York last week to re-launch the EU-Iran Human Rights dialogue in the near future. I hope this renewed dialogue can lead to further actions by the Iranian government to improve the overall human rights situation in Iran. <\/p><p>  In March 2013, following a review, the Foreign Affairs Council prolonged the EU restrictive measures against certain individuals in response to serious human rights violations in Iran by 12 months. The Council also added 9 persons responsible for serious human rights violations to the list of those subject to a travel ban and an asset freeze. This brings the number of persons targeted to 87. The Council also decided to subject one entity responsible for human rights violations to an asset freeze. The EU has also banned the export of equipment for monitoring internet and telephone communications. In addition, equipment which might be used for internal repression may not be exported to Iran.<\/p><p>  The measures are now valid until 13 April 2014. In deciding whether to increase, maintain or reduce restrictive measures against individuals, the EU will consider the actions of these specific individuals with respect to human rights.  These measures should not be confused with the sanctions related to the nuclear issue, which are a separate matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200063#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200063#WRC01350"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[41157\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200063#WRC01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the recent deaths of Palestinian civilians and Israeli soldiers in the West Bank in recent weeks; the knock on affect this could have on peace talks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":65,"content":"<p>I have noted with deep regret the continuing toll of casualties in the Occupied Territory, including the deaths of Palestinian civilians and Israeli soldiers in recent weeks.

Indeed, in both Israeli and Palestinian communities, some people have responded to these deaths by calling for an end to talks with the other side.

The events of this summer, and the ongoing parades in Ardoyne, point to a need to progress meaningful dialogue further.

Meaningful, sustained dialogue between parade organisers and residents&rsquo; groups must be an essential aspect of achieving the right balance.

I raised the matter most recently with Ukraine&rsquo;s Foreign Minister, Leonid Kozhara, during our bilateral meeting last week on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York.<\/p><p>  Concerns repeatedly expressed by Ireland and its EU partners were reinforced by the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on 30 April 2013, which ruled that Ms Tymoshenko had been unlawfully detained. As the Deputy is aware, High Representative Catherine Ashton and Commissioner Stefan F&uuml;le issued a joint statement in response to this judgment, which urged the Ukrainian authorities to reconsider Ms Tymoshenko&rsquo;s imprisonment and to implement fully all rulings of the ECHR. I fully support this statement. <\/p><p>  The EU&rsquo;s position is as set out in the Conclusions of the 10 December 2012 Foreign Affairs Council and in the joint statement of the EU-Ukraine Summit of 25 February 2013: that Ukraine must address convincingly three key areas including the issue of selective justice if progress is to be made towards signature of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement at the Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius in November.

In this cautiously hopeful atmosphere, President Obama spoke by telephone with Iranian President Rouhani on 27 September, the first conversation between the two countries' leaders since 1979.I myself met with new Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif on 26 September and, in a wide-ranging discussion, very much encouraged the new opening for more productive engagement between Iran and the international community. I have consistently emphasised that while the issues surrounding Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme are of serious international concern, progress in addressing these can only be achieved through diplomacy and negotiation.<\/p><p>  US Secretary of State John Kerry also met with Foreign Minister Zarif at a Ministerial-level meeting of the E3+3 (Germany, France and the U.K. plus the U.S., China and Russia) on 26 September in the margins of the UN General Assembly session in New York. I welcome the fact that this meeting was a substantial and positive one. The Iran nuclear issue remains one of the biggest stumbling blocks to better relations between Iran and, not only the U.S., but also the EU and the wider international community.  I fully support the statements of Secretary Kerry and EU High Representative Ashton following this meeting, which emphasised that the current political opening must be translated into a practical, time-bound framework that is implemented on the ground. Iran and the E3+3 and Iran have agreed an early date of 15 and 16 October for their next meeting, in Geneva. This will be an important test of Iran&rsquo;s willingness to truly engage this time around.<\/p><p>  The US, the E3+3 and other EU member states including Ireland fully acknowledge Iran&rsquo;s right under the Non-Proliferation Treaty to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. However, under the terms of the NPT, Iran must not engage in a nuclear weapons programme, and must cooperate fully with the safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as a means of verifying the exclusively peaceful nature of its programme.  Iran currently stands in breach of a succession of UN Security Council and IAEA resolutions concerning its nuclear programme. In its report of November 2011 on the implementation of IAEA Safeguards in Iran, the Agency concluded that there are strong grounds for serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme   while also indicating that Iran had carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device.  <\/p><p>  I very much hope that Iran will now be ready to address the many legitimate questions which the international community has asked regarding its nuclear programme and to address also the concerns about possible military dimensions to that programme without any further delay.  There is no doubt that the Iranian people would be the main beneficiaries of the better economic and political relations with the wider international community, including the E.U. and the U.S., that would follow the prompt and peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200064#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":82,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200064#WRD00550"},{"type":"question","counter":83,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[41159\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200064#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the continued widespread human rights abuses by the Bahraini regime; the recent announcement of an Arab Court of Human Rights to be based in Bahrain when it is established; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":84,"content":"<p>The overall human rights environment in Bahrain continues to be of serious concern.

Flagrant violations of International Humanitarian Law and widespread human rights abuses have tragically become the norm inside Syria, with the lack of protection afforded to civilians being of huge concern. The number of fatalities is now in excess of 100,000 and there are currently almost 7 million people in need of emergency humanitarian assistance, many of whom are children. Fear and uncertainty have forced more than 2.1 million Syrians to flee to neighbouring countries, with well in excess of 4 million people displaced from their homes within Syria's borders.  Ireland's total support in response to this humanitarian crisis is now almost &euro;11 million. This makes Ireland one of the most generous contributors in the world to the humanitarian response on a <i>per capita<\/i> basis. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, inside Syria, excessive controls on aid agencies working in the country, the fragmentation of the armed opposition and the intensity of military confrontations have made the operating environment extremely volatile and insecure. Restrictions imposed by the Assad regime, combined with logistical constraints and increasing insecurity, have made it very difficult to reach many areas of Syria where large numbers of civilians are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. There are currently reports of more than half a million people trapped in rural Damascus in need of urgent assistance. Ireland reiterates the call of the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator, Valerie Amos, in calling on all parties to agree to pauses in hostilities to allow humanitarian agencies immediate and unhindered access to evacuate the wounded and provide life-saving treatment and supplies in areas where fighting is ongoing, while civilians must be allowed to move to safer areas.<\/p><p>  In this complex situation, it is highly unlikely that options such as humanitarian corridors would be effective. I share the caution of the United Nations' humanitarian agencies, the Red Cross\/Red Crescent movement and many of our other partners in respect of the calls for military intervention in support of humanitarian action. Such intervention could have the result of placing extremely vulnerable civilians and aid workers at further risk. I believe that negotiated access remains the most effective approach. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding our reservations on the establishment of humanitarian corridors, there are other measures which, if implemented, could reduce the impediments to humanitarian access. Ireland fully supports the UN's demands for the free passage of medical supplies, the demilitarisation of medical facilities; the prior notification to civilians\/aid convoys of military offensives; the designation of priority humanitarian routes to allow safe passage of aid convoys; the use of humanitarian pauses in fighting to allow humanitarian access to people; and the use of cross-border operations, where appropriate. <\/p><p>  Moreover, with the attention of the world now clearly focused on Syria, and positive developments underway in relation to removing the threat of chemical weapons and restarting the political dialogue process, Ireland wants to ensure that this window of opportunity is also used to address the most pressing humanitarian challenges related to humanitarian access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200064#WRD01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200064#WRD01250"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[41165\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200064#WRD01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide further details on his Department&rsquo;s recent pledge of &euro;2 million in emergency assistance for Sudan and South Sudan; the person who will receive the funding; and the way it will be spent.","asker":"981","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":94,"content":"<p>In July, I announced &euro;2 million in funding to provide access to life-saving food, shelter, basic health care and water for very vulnerable conflict-affected communities in Sudan and South Sudan. Some 8.5 million people are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance in both countries. Ongoing conflict has forced people to flee their homes and has denied them access to essential services, particularly in border areas between Sudan and South Sudan. This funding was channelled through the United Nations Common Humanitarian Funds (CHFs) for Sudan and South Sudan.  are country-based pooled funding mechanisms which provide early and predictable funding to NGOs and UN agencies in order to respond to critical humanitarian needs. CHFs enable Humanitarian Country Teams on the ground to swiftly allocate resources where they are most needed, and to fund priority life-saving projects as identified in a Consolidated Appeal Process or a similar humanitarian action plan. The Common Humanitarian Funds in Sudan and South Sudan have enabled UN agencies and NGOs to contribute to a timely and effective humanitarian response as well as to promote and facilitate durable solutions for affected populations.<\/p><p>  In Sudan, the majority of the most vulnerable populations are in Darfur, where approximately 3.5 million people currently receive food aid, including some 1.4 million sheltered in camps for internally displaced persons. In South Kordofan and Blue Nile States, the United Nations estimates that there are currently over 300,000 people displaced or severely affected by the conflict. Already in 2013, the Common Humanitarian Fund has disbursed over $60 million to UN agencies and NGOs to provide basic services in the areas of shelter, water and sanitation, nutrition and education to these populations.

Conflict intensified in Jonglei State and the tri-state areas of Lakes, Unity and Warrap. In Unity and Upper Nile States, new arrivals have pushed the number of refugees to over 190,000 and humanitarian organisations have had to establish new refugee camps in these two states. The South Sudan Common Humanitarian Fund has allocated some US$90 million towards access to food, health, nutrition, water and sanitation, education and protection in highly vulnerable areas. In addition, the Fund has proven to be an invaluable mechanism for pre-positioning of emergency relief ahead of the rainy season.

It was a major achievement of our EU Presidency in the first half of this year to secure agreement on an integrated EU position for the Special Event at the United Nations in New York last week.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste addressed the opening session of the MDG Special Event and co-chaired one of the four roundtable discussions on progress under the MDGs and future challenges in the fight to end global poverty and hunger.<\/p><p>  Ireland and South Africa were asked to co-facilitate the Special Event and we negotiated overall agreement on a strong outcome document, which was endorsed by all UN member states.  It provides a clear commitment to maximising progress over the next two years under the MDGs and a roadmap for the negotiation of a new global development framework post-2015.  This marks another important step in the post-2015 process by committing to completing the work of the MDGs, to freeing the world of poverty and hunger, and ensuring a life of dignity for all.  We believe that there is now a strong basis for the negotiation of a new development framework which can help eradicate extreme poverty and hunger in a generation, empower women and girls, focus on equitable economic opportunity and integrate international efforts to address poverty and the impact of climate change.<\/p><p>  I agree that issues related to employment and decent and safe work, are critical to poverty eradication and sustainable development.  Very limited progress has been made on the MDG target to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all, including women and young people.  According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), unemployment has increased by 28 million since 2007, and an estimated 39 million people have dropped out of the labour market, leaving a 67 million jobs gap as a result of the global economic and financial crisis.

With the number of fatalities surpassing 100,000, there are now close to 7 million people who are in need of immediate life saving support. In addition to more than 4 million people who are displaced within Syria, some 2.1 million Syrians have fled the violence to take refuge in neighbouring countries, one million of whom are children. The Government has repeatedly condemned the civil war in Syria and the violations of human rights inflicted on the Syrian people. <\/p><p>  In line with the UN's humanitarian response plan for Syria, it is imperative that life-saving emergency assistance is provided and essential basic services are delivered to affected people in Syria and its neighbouring countries, especially food, water, sanitation, health, shelter, education and essential non-food items.

The future operation of the plant is a matter of speculation, but it is clearly essential that it become fully operational as soon as possible.  The position in relation to electric power is somewhat more complicated than suggested in the question.  Mains electricity supply in Gaza is partly supplied directly by Israel, as a normal commercial transaction, and partly generated by the Gaza power plant.  The power plant in turn depends either on fuel supplied by the Palestinian Authority via Israeli controlled border crossings, or smuggled in from Egypt.  These two sources were already inadequate to meet all of Gaza&rsquo;s needs, and power cuts have been endemic for some years.  In recent years, however, the situation has worsened considerably. The Hamas authorities in Gaza have purchased less power from Israel, either because they wished to be less dependent on Israel or because it was more expensive.  At the same time, however, they have refused to pay the Palestinian Authority for the fuel it supplied, with the result that the PA ended supplies.  The end result has been an increased reliance on fuel smuggled in from Egypt, which comes through the tunnel system controlled and taxed by Hamas, and so provides them with revenue. <\/p><p>  The recent turmoil in Egypt, and particularly strong Egyptian measures to control the border and reduce smuggling, has reduced this source of fuel supply on which Gaza has become over-reliant, and threatened further power cuts.  I am not certain that Israel has in fact been asked to supply more power, or if so under what terms.<\/p><p>  The power supply in Gaza, and in due course the operation of the new sewage plant when it becomes operational, are of course of critical importance for public health.

During Ireland&rsquo;s three year membership of the HRC, which runs from 2013-2015, we are actively working to add value to the work of the Council and strengthen the institution itself.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to membership of the HRC is guided by the pledges and commitments made during our campaign to secure election which reflect our well-established human rights priorities.  These include the following: Defending the universality of human rights; Freedom of expression (particularly on the internet); Freedom of religion or belief; LGBTI (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex) rights; Peace building and conflict resolution; The human rights situation in the Middle East; Strengthening the UN Human Rights Treaty Body System; The promotion and protection of human rights defenders; The promotion and protection of an enabling environment for civil society; Women&rsquo;s rights, combating discrimination and Gender-Based Violence.  We are also highlighting the importance of ensuring that human rights considerations underpin all areas of development &ndash; with a particular focus on health, education and combating hunger.<\/p><p>  Ireland held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the first six months of this year, which encompassed the March and June sessions of the Human Rights Council.  As Presidency, Ireland played an active role in the HRC as part of the Joint EU Team, together with the EU Delegation (EEAS).  In the March session, I personally delivered the general statement on behalf of the EU on a number of country situations and thematic priorities.  Over both sessions, the joint EU Team, which included the Irish delegation, led in the preparation of drafts and the conduct of negotiations on the EU-led initiatives including DPRK, Belarus, Burma\/Myanmar, Freedom of Religion or Belief and Rights of the Child.  Ireland worked in tandem with the EEAS on resolutions relating to Sri Lanka, Mali, Syria, Libya, Eritrea, Middle East, human rights defenders, combating religious intolerance and illicit funds. Ireland also negotiated four further resolutions on behalf of the European Union on national human rights institutions, discrimination against women, cultural rights and foreign debt.<\/p><p>  Ireland led on two important initiatives during the September session, which concluded last Friday.  As part of our commitment to ensuring that our human rights priorities and development programme are mutually reinforcing, Ireland led on a resolution on preventable mortality and morbidity of children under five which was adopted by consensus on 26 September.  Some 6.6 million children under the age of five die each year, mainly from preventable and treatable causes.  This resolution focuses on how the HRC can act in elaborating a human rights based approach to this issue and support the much needed engagement of the human rights community in the ongoing efforts to strengthening accountability for children&rsquo;s health.  As a result of the adoption of this resolution, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights will elaborate technical guidance, in close consultation with the World Health Organisation drawing on the particular expertise of that agency, and with the participation of all relevant stakeholders, including Governments.  This technical guidance, grounded in human rights principles, can help national Ministries and other actors to design policies and programmes to reduce and eliminate under-five mortality.<\/p><p>  Ireland also led on a resolution on creating and maintaining a safe and enabling environment for civil society which was adopted on 27 September.  Civil society actors have come under increasing pressure in many parts of the world in recent years.  In some countries, dialogue with civil society remains limited and the space for civil society engagement is narrow or shrinking.  Restrictive legislation and repressive practices in some countries have led to stigmatisation, harassment, and even criminalisation of civil society actors engaged in promoting and protecting human rights.  The resolution adopted last Friday underlines the important contribution of civil society and calls on States to create and maintain a safe and enabling environment in which civil society can operate effectively.  It also provides for a panel discussion to be held during the next session of the Human Rights Council in March 2014 on the challenges facing States in their efforts to ensure space for civil society, and lessons learnt and good practices in this regard.<\/p><p>  Ireland has also made national statements at the most recent session of the HRC on human rights situations in a number of countries, including Egypt, Syria, Sri Lanka, Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea, Sudan, and Somalia.  We have also raised important issues such as the safety of journalists, children affected by armed conflict, and the role of civil society in integrating gender perspectives in the work of the HRC.  <\/p><p>  Ireland will continue to respond proactively to emerging human rights situations and themes, including emergency situations, and to play an active role in the Council&rsquo;s three yearly sessions (March, June and September) and in the sessions of Universal Periodic Review (UPR) examinations, during which countries&rsquo; human rights records are examined.  Ireland will continue to promote and defend the work and independence of the human rights treaty bodies, the Human Rights Council special procedures and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  The Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in Geneva is responsible for the management of day-to-day activity on the Human Rights Council.  A team of three diplomats and two interns work in support of the Permanent Representative of Ireland to the UN in Geneva to deliver on our priorities for our membership term.  My Department is in close daily contact with the Permanent Mission in Geneva in this regard, with input from other government departments within their areas of responsibility.  Officials in my Department would be prepared to provide regular briefings to members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade on our engagement with the Human Rights Council as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200065#WRE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200066#WRF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[41181\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200066#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has contacted the Russian Government and if not, if he will give a commitment to contact the Russian Government regarding the appalling conditions faced by Nadezhda Tolokonnikova of the Russian punk group Pussy Riot who has gone on hunger strike at what she calls gulag like prison conditions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

While the sentence of one band member was subsequently suspended on appeal, the court upheld the custodial sentences imposed on the other two members, Maria Alekhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova. The imposition of lengthy prison terms on the two women, both of whom are mothers, is a matter of great regret and deep concern. While their actions may have given rise to offence in some quarters, the sentences appear out of proportion.  This is particularly so as Ms Alekhina and Ms Tolokonnikova had spent five months in custody prior to sentencing.<\/p><p>  The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, has urged the Russian authorities to review and reverse the sentences in line with Russia&rsquo;s international obligations in regard to respect for freedom of expression.

I have also commented on the specific restrictions placed on fishermen.  Even though the limit enforced by Israel has been extended from 3 to 6 miles, this is still very restrictive, and the local exhaustion of stocks caused by overfishing in a very restricted area has led to the collapse of Gaza&rsquo;s fishing industry, which is an important source of food. In recent years Gaza fishing boats have often sailed to Egyptian ports to buy fish, instead of catching it.  Egyptian controls on movement into Gaza are partly dictated under the terms of the agreement with Israel by which the Sinai was restored, and partly by security concerns concerning infiltration of militant groups and weapons into Egypt from Gaza.

I undertook a political and trade mission to China (Beijing and Shanghai) from 30 July to 3 August 2013, at the invitation of the Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi.  The purpose of my visit was to strengthen the high-level political engagement necessary to deliver on the Strategic Partnership Agreement between Ireland and China.  I also had a series of engagements focussed on supporting Irish companies doing business in China, promoting Ireland as a tourist destination, and promoting Ireland as the best investment location for Chinese businesses looking to expand in Europe. The Strategic Partnership Agreement between China and Ireland was adopted in March last year during the visit of the Taoiseach to China, and extends to all areas of our bilateral relationship including political, diplomatic, trade, investment, agriculture and food, education and tourism.<\/p><p>  In the period since it was agreed, there has been impressive progress made in Irish-Chinese relations.  Eight Irish Government Ministers have visited China promoting trade and other links.  On the Chinese side, there have been visits to Ireland by ten Ministers or other senior figures in the Chinese administration.  Irish trade with China is now worth over &euro;8 billion a year, with a strong trade surplus in Ireland&rsquo;s favour.<\/p><p>  During my visit, I had a number of high-level political engagements, including with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Wang Yi; with a member of the State Council, Chairman Yu Zhengsheng; and with Minister Wang Jia Rui, Minister at the Communist Party International Department.  At these meetings, I stressed the potential for increased investment and economic co-operation, and took the opportunity to promote Ireland as an education destination.  I also raised the issue of access to the Chinese market for Irish beef.  I had the opportunity also to discuss wider political issues, including human rights issues, EU-China relations, and current international developments.<\/p><p>  During my visit, I announced that Ireland has secured full market access to China for salmon exports, which represents a sizeable opportunity for Irish salmon exporters, with demand for high-end seafood in China growing substantially each year.  This followed intensive negotiations with the Chinese authorities by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) in conjunction with the Irish Embassy in Beijing.  Further, Dublin Airport Authority signed a twinning agreement during my visit to establish a Sister Airports partnership with Beijing Capital International Airport, which will allow the two companies to co-operate to further commercial and tourism links between the two cities.  The agreement aims to enable the two airports to engage in a joint marketing initiative to improve airline services between Dublin and Beijing. <\/p><p>  I held a number of engagements pursuing key priorities, including exports, food and agribusiness, education, tourism, targeting of investment, and support for Irish companies doing business in China.  These included engagements organised by Tourism Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Bord Bia. <\/p><p>  I had meetings with a number of Chinese companies interested in investing in Ireland and potential partners for Irish exporters.  These included Shanghai Bright, Huawei, Yanhua, the Bank of Communications and ChinaCache.  I addressed approximately one hundred Chinese and Irish partner company senior executives at a business event organised by Enterprise Ireland.  This allowed me to present Ireland&rsquo;s key strengths both as an investment destination and as a trading partner.  I also witnessed the signing of a number of significant memoranda of understanding, including one between IDA Ireland and the Shanghai Foreign Investment Development Board, which has responsibility for outbound investment.  <\/p><p>  I attended networking events organised by the Irish Embassy in Beijing and the Consulate General in Shanghai, which provided the opportunity to meet a wide range of official, business and cultural contacts.  I addressed a promotional event organised by Tourism Ireland in Shanghai which was attended by over 100 representatives of the Chinese travel industry, including airlines, travel agents, tour operators and media.<\/p><p>  While in Shanghai, I addressed the Shanghai Returned Scholars Association, a non-government network of influential senior academics, business people and officials, as well as the graduates of the Ireland-Shanghai Senior Officials Training Programme, which has improved awareness of Ireland and our influence, including on trade\/investment-related issues, among key municipal government commissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200068#WRH00300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":184,"content":"<p>Question No. 70 answered with Question No. 28.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":185,"content":"<p>Question No. 71 answered with Question No. 14.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Neutrality","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200068#WRH00550"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[41151\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200068#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has read the recently published Red C Poll, commissioned by PANA, which details Irish persons attitudes to neutrality and the war in Syria; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

We are furthermore committed to our obligation as members of the UN to provide assistance in any action which the Security Council takes in accordance with the UN Charter.

Already this year, in addition to Croatia&rsquo;s accession, we have seen significant progress in relation to Serbia and Kosovo in particular.  In June, under the Irish Presidency, the EU agreed to open accession negotiations with Serbia and to begin negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Kosovo. This agreement came in recognition of the progress achieved in the EU-facilitated Belgrade-Pristina dialogue and, in particular, the agreement on principles governing the normalisation of relations between the two countries.<\/p><p>  The EU agreed to hold the first intergovernmental conference with Serbia, to officially begin accession negotiations, by January 2014 at the very latest, on the basis of a negotiating framework to be adopted by the European Council later this year.  The European Commission is also making preparations to begin negotiations with Kosovo on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), a significant milestone on Kosovo&rsquo;s European path.<\/p><p>  Meanwhile, accession negotiations are continuing with Montenegro. Under the Irish Presidency, we opened a new chapter in talks with Montenegro and work is underway towards the opening, later this year, of the two key chapters relating to the judiciary, fundamental rights and justice, freedom and security.  In neighbouring Albania, the new Government has made gaining EU candidate status a political priority. The European Commission will, later this month, give its assessment of the reform process in Albania and, on that basis, consider whether Albania could be granted candidate status.  In Macedonia, while there have been some positive developments in the domestic reform process and in good neighbourly relations, there has also been negative fallout from the political crisis at the end of last year. We await the European Commission&rsquo;s detailed assessment of the situation and whether, in the Commission&rsquo;s view, enough progress has been made to recommend opening of accession negotiations.<\/p><p>  There has been a disappointing lack of progress in the delivery by the leadership in Bosnia and Herzegovina on important reforms, for example, on bringing the constitution into line with a key ruling of the European Court of Human Rights. The EU has made clear the reforms needed in order to realise the country&rsquo;s EU perspective.  The EU needs to examine what else can be done to encourage the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to move forward with reforms. As I have stated before, I believe this can best be done in the context of the review of the mandate of the EU&rsquo;s Special Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina.  However, I would continue to emphasise that while we will do everything in our power to encourage movement on the path to EU integration, this is ultimately a matter for the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<\/p><p>  In relation to Turkey, the accession progress was reinvigorated earlier this year when, under the Irish Presidency, it was agreed to open a new chapter (on regional policy) in accession talks. The opening of this chapter will take place at an intergovernmental conference later this year. Ireland&rsquo;s view remains that greater EU engagement through the accession progress with Turkey is the best way to ensure delivery of reform.<\/p><p>  Finally, in relation to Iceland, we note the decision of the Icelandic Government to put negotiations with the EU on hold until an assessment of the negotiations and developments within the EU has been made, and a referendum takes place.<\/p><p>  Later this month, the European Commission will bring forward its annual progress report on enlargement.

Despite the long delay in reaching this stage, I welcome the decisive action the Security Council has now taken on Syria.  Full implementation of the provisions for the complete elimination of Syria&rsquo;s chemical weapons and full compliance by Syria with its obligations is now imperative. Ireland has pledged &euro;200,000 in funding to support the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, assisted by the UN, in implementing these arrangements.<\/p><p>  The Security Council has also called for the early convening of the Geneva II peace conference, hopefully by mid-November.  Syria&rsquo;s conflict can only be resolved politically, not militarily.  Peace can only come through all Syrians engaging in a genuine, representative and inclusive process to agree a new political dispensation in their country.<\/p><p>  I also welcome the Security Council&rsquo;s clear call for accountability for what has occurred in Syria.  I have long called for these crimes to be referred to the ICC which exists precisely for this purpose.  Ireland is playing its part in the international effort to meet the massive needs both inside Syria and in the wider region, having contributed almost &euro;11 million to fund relief efforts to date. On a per capita basis, we are one of the most generous contributors in the world to the Syria humanitarian crisis.  Ireland has also been consistent in our efforts at EU and international levels to highlight the grave humanitarian dimensions of the crisis and the need for the international community to meet its obligations in providing life-saving assistance to Syria and neighbouring countries.

I visited the area in July 2012 to see at first hand the situation on the ground, and I have worked to ensure that it remains high on the EU and UN agendas.  Current estimates suggest close to 2.5 million people in Ethiopia, 1.1 million people in Kenya, 1.05 million people in Somalia, and over 200,000 people in Djibouti remain vulnerable to food insecurity and require humanitarian assistance.  While the influx of Somalis fleeing into the Dadaab refugee camp in north-east Kenya has decreased, it remains the largest refugee camp in the world with some 425,000 refugees.<\/p><p>  There are over one million Somali refugees across the region, who depend entirely on humanitarian aid.  Continuing instability in parts of southern Somalia remains a major obstacle to the delivery of aid and has serious implications for border regions and nearby refugee camps.  We are following the political and humanitarian situation closely, through our Embassies in the region, notably in Addis Ababa, and in close coordination with our international and NGO partners.  Together with other donor countries, we have worked particularly closely with the UN&rsquo;s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to put in place new systems to improve the way in which aid is delivered and to ensure that coordination on the ground is improved through enhanced monitoring systems.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s direct engagement in the region has demonstrated that emergency assistance can effectively address health, nutrition, and water and sanitation needs, but cannot prevent future crises. Ireland will therefore continue to work on long-term programmes to build resilience and address the needs of the most vulnerable across the region.  Ireland has provided over &euro;290 million in development and humanitarian funding to the Horn of Africa since 2007.  We will continue to engage actively at EU and international level in pushing for a strongly coordinated approach to the humanitarian situation in the Horn.<\/p><p>  The situation in the region is reviewed regularly at meetings of the EU Foreign Affairs Council, which I attend.  The EU is continuing to implement vigorously its Comprehensive Strategy for the Horn of Africa which was adopted in 2011 and which covers the entire region including the situations in Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Kenya.  It addresses all dimensions on the different crises in the region including conflict, underdevelopment, and issues related to governance and human rights.  An over-arching role in implementation of the strategic approach is given to the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alex Rondos, who reports regularly to Ministers.<\/p><p>  Progress has been made on regional security with the support of the EU Common Security and Defence Policy missions, including the EU Training Mission in Somalia, the EU anti-piracy naval mission, and the regional maritime capacity-building mission, EUCAP Nestor.  Ireland is making an important contribution to these EU efforts by providing the Commander and a significant contingent of personnel for the EU Training Mission in Somalia, which is building the capacity of the Somali National Security Forces to enable them to take over responsibility for security and law and order.<\/p><p>  The EU also provides very significant humanitarian, development and economic support across the Horn of Africa, in close cooperation with regional bodies, including the African Union.  The EU SHARE initiative (Supporting the Horn of Africa&rsquo;s Resilience) has been developed in light of the 2011 crisis as a result of food shortages and conflict, and promotes a strongly integrated approach to vulnerable communities in the region.<\/p><p>  Last week, Ireland participated in the debate at the Human Rights Council in Geneva on the situation Somalia and Sudan, and highlighted concerns about human right violations in both countries, while welcoming the significant progress which has been made in Somalia in particular in the past twelve months.  It is clear that progress in the Horn of Africa will require a strong focus on human rights and an enabling environment for civil society.  This will remain a priority area for Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the countries of the region, and internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200069#WRJ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Membership Issues","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200069#WRJ01450"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[41386\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200069#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"about the extent to which he and his EU colleagues have discussed the implications for this country, Northern Ireland, the UK and the entire European Union in the event of the United Kingdom withdrawing from the EU; the extent to which public confidence in the EU project will prevail in the interim period prior to the holding of a UK referendum on the issue; if any particular steps are needed to minimise the damage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The involvement of child soldiers has been reported in most recent armed conflicts and in almost every region of the world over the last two decades. Each year, the United Nations Secretary-General issues a report on children and armed conflict which lists all armed groups - both state and non-state - that recruit and use children. The most recent list includes 52 state and non-state armed groups operating across three continents.  It is estimated that up to 300,000 children continue to be involved in more than 30 conflicts worldwide, including, notably, in a number of internal and regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa.<\/p><p>  Against this background, international legal efforts to curb the practice of using children in armed conflict have been stepped up significantly.  In 1996, the UN General Assembly voted to establish the post of Special-Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict<b>,<\/b> tasked to serve as an independent advocate for the protection and well-being of boys and girls affected by armed conflict. In 1999, the UN<b><\/b>  Security Council passed its first Resolution (UNSCR 1261) highlighting the impact of armed conflict on children and condemning violations carried out in that context. With the adoption of nine Resolutions and several Presidential statements since then, the Security Council has developed important tools to strengthen child protection and to promote compliance with international standards.<\/p><p>  The Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OPAC) was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 May 2000 and entered into force in 2002. It is considered the core international human rights treaty on child soldiers.  It lays out clear standards relating to the recruitment and use of under-18s by state armed forces as well as non-state armed groups which, if fully implemented, provide a strong foundation for long-term prevention of unlawful recruitment and use of children, and for assisting those who have already became involved in armed conflict. <\/p><p>  Ireland is a strong supporter of the mandate and the work of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General for Children and Armed Conflict, Ms Leila Zerrougui. At the most recent session of the UN Human Rights Council of which Ireland is currently a member, Ireland expressed particular appreciation for the work that SRSG Zerrougui has been carrying out to mainstream child protection in peacekeeping operations.  Ireland called on all parties to conflict to comply with international humanitarian law and to respect schools and hospitals as protected civilian objects.  Ireland also highlighted the particular challenges for the prevention of recruitment and the promotion of the reintegration of child soldiers in Mali and expressed concern about the difficult situations of children vulnerable to violence and deprivation in Central African Republic and eastern DRC.  <\/p><p>  Ireland has engaged on this issue in various ways including, crucially, through the core work of our aid programme in addressing poverty and under-development - major root causes of this problem.  Ireland has also supported more targeted and specific interventions from supporting agencies such as UNICEF and the International Criminal Court, to designing interventions in our bilateral programmes that address the needs of children affected by conflict.  Ireland places strong emphasis on the importance of prioritising protection and accountability at the national and international level.  The conviction of Thomas Lubanga by the International Criminal Court last year for the recruitment and use of child soldiers is a powerful message that no individual who violates international criminal law can be confident of impunity.<\/p><p>  We remain deeply committed to addressing this issue, as has been recently reflected in Ireland's new Policy for International Development, 'One World, One Future', where we have pledged to increase our engagement on the issue of child soldiers and children in armed conflict. We are actively examining options for strengthened action in this area.  Ireland will also continue to encourage all concerned countries to cooperate with UN mechanisms and to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on armed conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200070#WRK00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200070#WRK00550"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[41389\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200070#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which he continues to be in a position to engage with the US authorities in the context of the regularisation of undocumented Irish in the US; the extent to which agreement has been reached in respect of legislative proposals in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>This is an issue I treat with the very highest priority.  During my visit to the US last week, I spoke with several key contacts in the US Congress including leading members of the House Judiciary Committee, Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Chair of the Congressional Friends of Ireland, Pete King.  I also met with representatives of Irish community groups as well as some community members who are undocumented.   I am acutely aware of the difficulties they face as a result of their undocumented status.  I am more determined than ever to continue to work to find a solution to their plight.  A resolution of the situation facing the undocumented Irish in the United States remains a priority for the Government.  The Government also attaches great importance to seeking provision for future flows of migration between Ireland and the United States through the extension of the &ldquo;E-3&rdquo; visa scheme to include Irish citizens.<\/p><p>  In this context, we very much welcomed the US Senate&rsquo;s approval of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill by a 68-32 margin on 27 June last.  The comprehensive draft legislation, which was drafted over several months by a bipartisan group of eight US Senators, provides for extensive reform of the US immigration system. It includes provisions that would legalise the status of undocumented Irish people and provide a path to permanent residency.  It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US via the proposed E-3 visa.  The Bill is a very positive development.  Its provisions, if adopted, would help to end the great hardship and uncertainty faced by undocumented Irish in the US and their families here in Ireland.  The inclusion of a new provision to allow several thousand Irish citizens to legally avail of employment opportunities in the US every year is also particularly welcome.  <\/p><p>  The focus has now shifted to the House of Representatives for its consideration of the issues.  It remains to be seen whether a consolidated Bill can be agreed between the Senate and the House of Representatives.  It is generally accepted that securing overall agreement will remain a complex and challenging process, particularly at a time when Congress is preoccupied by budgetary and debt issues.  This was clear from my discussions last week and I believe the challenge to secure agreement has become even greater in recent times.  I am determined to continue to deploy all our resources at political, diplomatic and Irish community level to make progress on this vital issue.  <\/p><p>  In addition to my contacts last week in New York, I visited Washington DC on 11-12 July and held a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, including with key members of the House of Representatives and Senate, with the US Administration and with Irish-American community representatives.  I reiterated throughout all these contacts the Government&rsquo;s interest in all aspects of immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing an overall agreement reached which provides relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and a facility for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.  <\/p><p>  I wish to acknowledge the critically important role being played by a number of Irish community organisations, including the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform and the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.

The Code provides, inter alia, that mortgage lenders should allow for a flexible approach in the handling of arrears and pre-arrears cases and that they should aim, as far as possible, at assisting the borrower who is in genuine difficulty having regard to the specific circumstances in individual cases. In particular, the Code provides that a lender&rsquo;s Arrears Support Unit (ASU) must base its assessment of the borrower&rsquo;s case on the full circumstances of the borrower including:<\/p><p>-  the personal circumstances of the borrower;<\/p><p>-  the overall indebtedness of the borrower;<\/p><p>-  the information provided in the standard financial statement (SFS);<\/p><p>-  the borrower&rsquo;s current repayment capacity, and<\/p><p>-  the borrower&rsquo;s previous history.<\/p><p>In relation to the sale of the IBRC mortgage book, the Special Liquidators are taking professional advice on the appropriate method of disposing of loan assets and on the appropriate criteria for determining who should qualify to bid for loan assets.

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that rental profit for tax purposes is the gross rental income less allowable expenses incurred in earning that rent. In computing the amount of rental profit, only those deductions that are specified in section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 are allowable as deductions against the gross rental income.

In essence, an individual can make tax relievable pension contributions up to <i>the lower of<\/i>   the relevant age-related percentage of their actual remuneration and the relevant age related percentage of &euro;115,000.

The additional income tax that would be payable by single persons in those circumstances if tax relief was reduced from 41% to 30% is set out in the following table.<\/p><p><b>Table 2<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Gross Earnings<\/th><th>Pension Contribution at 10%<\/th><th>Income Tax Relief @ 41%<\/th><th>Income Tax Relief @ 30%<\/th><th>Additional Income tax Payable<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;60,000<\/td><td>&euro;6,000<\/td><td>&euro;2,460<\/td><td>&euro;1,800<\/td><td>&euro;660<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;70,000<\/td><td>&euro;7,000<\/td><td>&euro;2,870<\/td><td>&euro;2,100<\/td><td>&euro;770<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;80,000<\/td><td>&euro;8,000<\/td><td>&euro;3,280<\/td><td>&euro;2,400<\/td><td>&euro;880<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;100,000<\/td><td>&euro;10,000<\/td><td>&euro;4,100<\/td><td>&euro;3,000<\/td><td>&euro;1,100<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>In the last two questions, the scenarios outlined are ones where, in addition to a reduction in the rate of tax relief on pension contributions from 41% to 30%, the earnings limit is reduced from &euro;115,000 to &euro;70,000. As indicated earlier, individuals can make tax-relievable pension contributions up to <i>the lower of<\/i> the relevant age-related percentage of their actual remuneration and the relevant age-related percentage of the earnings limit. In both of these scenarios, for the individuals concerned, notwithstanding that the earnings limit at &euro;70,000 is below their gross annual earnings, the rate of contribution at 10% of their gross earnings leaves them unaffected by the change. In other words, as the following table illustrates, a pension contribution of 10% of &euro;80,000. i.e. &euro;8,000, is less than the maximum contribution allowed by the age-related percentage of the proposed lower earnings limit of &euro;70,000, <i>at all ages<\/i>. The same holds for a contribution of 10% of gross earnings of &euro;100,000.  In the particular scenarios outlined in the questions, therefore, no additional income tax would be payable as a result of the reduction in the earnings limit over and above that outlined in Table 2.<\/p><p><b>Table 3<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Age<\/th><th>Percentage contribution Limit<\/th><th>Earnings Limit<\/th><th>Maximum Tax-relievable Contribution<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Up to age 30 <\/td><td>15% of remuneration<\/td><td>&euro;70,000<\/td><td>&euro;10,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>30 to 39<\/td><td>20%<\/td><td>&euro;70,000<\/td><td>&euro;14,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>40 to 49<\/td><td>25%<\/td><td>&euro;70,000<\/td><td>&euro;17,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>50 to 54<\/td><td>30%<\/td><td>&euro;70,000<\/td><td>&euro;21,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>55 to 59<\/td><td>35%<\/td><td>&euro;70,000<\/td><td>&euro;24,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>60 and over <\/td><td>40%<\/td><td>&euro;70,000<\/td><td>&euro;28,000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200072#WRM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[41352\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200072#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the yield that would be achieved from abolishing personal tax credits for persons with income over &euro;100,000;

With regard to the extension of betting duty to online bets, it was announced in Budget 2011 that the necessary arrangements are being made to ensure that bets placed on the internet by domestic punters are subject to the same level of betting duty as applies to high street betting shops. This will serve to broaden the tax base and increase betting duty receipts.<\/p><p>  The Finance Act 2011 provides for the taxation of bets that remote bookmakers enter into with persons in the State. This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged. In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licences. <\/p><p>  The Betting (Amendment) Bill, which was published in July, will establish the regulatory framework for these licences.

In 2012, my Department provided approximately &euro;15 million in total to first and second level schools by way of book grants and the same level of funding has been allocated for 2013.  Schools participating in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) receive an enhanced grant under the School Book Grant Scheme.  The current per capita rates, as allocated to all schools, are as follows: Primary DEIS - &euro;21; Primary non-DEIS - &euro;11; Post-primary DEIS - &euro;39; and Post-primary non-DEIS - &euro;24.  Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the cost burden of textbooks on families.  In this regard, I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.  A survey of schools by the Department, published in May 2012, showed that 76% of primary schools operated a book rental scheme.  At second level, and of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community and Comprehensive sector also operated book rental schemes.  Savings of up to 80% of the cost of buying new books can be made where schools operate rental schemes.  This is significant for parents.<\/p><p>  I launched Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools on 28 January last.  The guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes and, in particular, to encourage those schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes to introduce them in light of the evidence for the potential of savings for parents.  A special Guide for Parents was also published to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.  I also published a Report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants, compiled by the Department of Education and Skills, in May 2012.  This report presented four policy options to encourage schools to establish textbook rental schemes.  My Department will continue to monitor the number of schools operating book rental schemes and consider further steps to encourage schools to do so if this proves necessary.<\/p><p>  In addition, DEIS schools have been given the autonomy to work within the guidelines for the appropriate use of DEIS funding and to decide how best to utilise DEIS resources, including the DEIS grant, to achieve maximum benefits to the most at risk pupils in line with their DEIS Action Plans and addressing educational disadvantage.  Embedded in the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL), which is available to all DEIS schools, is the belief that parents are the first and most important educators of their child.  The HSCL Scheme aims to enable parents to become active participants in their children's learning and to stimulate learning in the home.  At primary school level, packs are brought to the parents of infants entering DEIS schools for the first time by the HSCL co-ordinators.  These may contain an age-appropriate book, colouring materials, or a simple craft activity.  The parents are encouraged to engage in the activity or to read and interact with their child, so that the parent-child learning relationship is developed.  As part of the primary to post-primary transfer programme, some HSCL co-ordinators bring a literacy pack to the families of all first-year pupils attending DEIS post-primary schools.  Its aim is to improve the child's reading level and general literacy skills helping to maintain the parent-child learning relationship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200076#WRQ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Expenditure","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200076#WRQ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[41243\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200076#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount spent by institution, in each year since 2008, on rebranding or brand repositioning for each university and institute of technology here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1183","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":361,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department.

The objective of this differentiation is to ensure that resources provided to schools to support children who have additional learning needs are targeted to ensure that those children most in need benefit from these resources.  The rationale for the differing ratios is based on international literature on the incidence of disability as well as international and national surveys of literacy and numeracy which indicate that there is a greater incidence of disability\/learning difficulty in boys than girls.  The NCSE Report on the Implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, of 2006, also examined a range of sources to establish prevalence rates, including national databases, local and international studies and expert estimates, which indicated significantly higher rates of Mild General Learning Difficulty and Specific Learning Disability prevailing in boys, in comparison to girls.<\/p><p>  Resources are allocated to Gaelscoileanna on the same basis as to ordinary national schools, based on the number of classroom teaching posts in each school in the previous school year.

The Dangerous Substances Acts 1972 and 1979, together with a series of Regulations under this legislation, set out the legal framework under which petroleum and other dangerous substances are regulated.  The storage of petrol is governed by the Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) Regulations, S.I. 311 of 1979, as amended. The Act requires that all petrol storage facilities must be licensed.  The Regulations set minimum requirements that apply equally to private petrol stores and storage for the purpose of retail sale (petrol filling stations).<\/p><p>  The 1979 Regulations have been kept under continuing review and while operating within the regulatory regime set out above, Inspectors from the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority (HSA) are sensitive to the economic situation of the operators to which it applies.  This approach is in line with the general approach taken in occupational health and safety legislation and aims to avoid the imposition of undue hardship on owners of kerbside stations that do not meet the 1979 requirements.<\/p><p>  To clarify, the licensing of petrol stations, run by private operators, is a matter for Local Authorities [or Harbour Authorities].  Under the aegis of my Department, the HSA has an enforcement function under the Dangerous Substances Acts, and a very limited licensing function in that it is the body that licenses petrol stations run by a Local\/Harbour Authority. It also has a licensing appeals function.<\/p><p>  In the course of an inspection the Authority will normally require the operator to apply to their Local Authority (LA) for a Dangerous Substance licence if one is not already in place, and will advise the operator that they will be required by the LA to comply with SI 311 of 1979 as far as possible, bearing in mind also the specific exemptions allowed for older &quot;Kerbside&quot; petrol stations in S.I. 528 of 2012. These exemption regulations allow for derogations from certain provisions of the 1979 Regulations, for these &quot;Kerbside&quot; petrol stations, as they were in existence prior to the coming into force of the 1979 regulations, and for various socioeconomic reasons were allowed to continue in operation under the special exemption provisions.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the approach taken by HSA Inspectors in implementing the 1979 Regulations, it must be reiterated that petrol filling stations are particularly hazardous workplaces which require to be licensed by Local Authorities.  The HSA continues to provide suitable guidance to all petrol station operators to ensure that they can comply with the relevant legislation in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200080#WRU00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":441,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200080#WRU00950"},{"type":"question","counter":442,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[41401\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200080#WRU01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the way a memo dated 20 March 2002 from the Department and the facts therein, which had been the subject of numerous parliamentary questions in 2004, were denied and concealed by the Department until they were disclosed in a freedom of information inquiry to a third party in 2008.

My Department and associated agencies are participating in the development of specific measures to deliver on the 12 Actions set out in the Plan.  My Department has already ensured that, in accordance with EU legislation, advertising of antibiotics to farmers is prohibited and that such medicines may only be used on the prescription of a veterinary practitioner in respect of animals under his\/her care.<\/p><p>  My Department carries out extensive testing for antibiotic residues under the National Residue Plan, the results of which are published.  For example, in 2012, almost 9,500 samples were tested for antibiotic residues, of which 0.1% contained residues in excess of authorised levels.  The carcasses concerned had been detained in all cases and were prohibited from entering the food chain.  A follow up inspection takes place in all cases at the farm of origin and appropriate action is taken including mandatory additional testing and, where appropriate, penalties are applied under the Single Farm Payment Regime.

Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in recent years in services for children with disabilities.  In particular, there is now an increased awareness of the importance of early intervention for these children in terms of ensuring they get the best start in life and are supported as much as possible to reach their full potential.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for the provision of health and personal social services, including disability services for children.  Within this context and subject to the financial resources available, it has a responsibility to ensure that the health-related needs of children with disabilities are addressed and that these children are appropriately supported in pre-school and school settings.  This is done in a number of ways such as by providing grant-aid to support pre-school provision in community pre-schools and by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  It has also facilitated children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where these supports may be necessary.  The HSE&rsquo;s role in supporting children with disabilities involves it working in close co-operation with the disability service providers that it funds, with the education sector, with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and with the parents and families of the children in question.  The HSE's reorganisation of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children and young people with disabilities under the Progressing Disabilities Programme for Children and Young People (0-18) is also significant in this context.  This aims to increase the level of consistency and standardisation in the way both early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities are delivered and to have one clear pathway for all children with disabilities according to need.<\/p><p>  While the health, children and youth affairs and education sectors co-operate on a regular basis with a view to integrating their services for children with a disability as much as possible there is a need to strengthen these arrangements.  The Children, Adolescents and Young People with Complex Disabilities Unit led by a Principal Officer has been established in my Department.  This important development aims to foster greater collaboration between my Department, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on children&rsquo;s disability issues and to build on the cross-sectoral working arrangements that are already in place.  A dedicated Cross-Sectoral Team, comprising representatives of my Department, the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs plays a key role in this regard.<\/p><p>  A sub group of this Cross-Sectoral Team has been set up to examine the issues around the integration of children with disabilities into mainstream Pre-School Settings, building on previous analysis in this area.  Representatives of the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive and of the City and County Childcare Committees are members of this group and it is chaired by the Department of Health.  It is envisaged that the work of this Sub-Group will be completed later this year, at which point it will report to the Cross Sectoral Team.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200088#WRCC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":628,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200088#WRCC00550"},{"type":"question","counter":629,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[41234\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200088#WRCC00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the practical and financial assistance that will be given to residents of a home (details supplied) in County Dublin in finding alternative accommodation following announcement that the home will close in the next three to five years following budget cuts ","asker":"954","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":630,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200088#WRCC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":631,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200088#WRCC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":632,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[41237\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100200088#WRCC00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a medical card will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Carlow; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"968","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":633,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

In these cases, social and medical issues are considered when determining whether or not undue hardship exists for the individual in accessing GP or other medical services.  Discretion will be applied automatically during the processing of an application where additional information has been provided which can be considered with discretion by staff or a medical officer, where appropriate.  At Minister Reilly's request, the HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards, where a person exceeds the income guidelines but there are difficult personal circumstances, such as an illness.<\/p><p>  The HSE also has a system in place in relation to the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford.
