On 15 December last I raised this issue in the House during the Order of Business.  It relates to the Genealogical Society of Ireland, GSI, and its premises in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and the harbour company in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  A week before I raised the issue, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council passed a motion calling for the chief executive to convene an early meeting of the board of the Genealogical Society of Ireland to discuss the decision of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company to acquire its premises, which houses a unique archive and research facility of the society, and indeed to explore the assistance the council could provide in keeping the valuable cultural and educational facility in D&uacute;n Laoghaire open.  It was proposed by Councillor Shane O'Brien of Sinn F&eacute;in and seconded by Councillor Patricia Stewart of Fine Gael.<\/p> <p>I am very proud to call the Genealogical Society of Ireland a friend and to be a nominee of that society for the purposes of elections to this House, elections in which the society has been a nominating body for some time.  The charity was established in 1990 to promote an awareness, appreciation and knowledge of our genealogical heritage both in Ireland and among our global diaspora.  Our societal connection with the diaspora around the world is often a one-way street, but in this case it is not.  It is a representation of its great value that many people among the diaspora have availed of this national service.<\/p> <p>The society is devoted to the promotion and study of genealogy and related subjects such as educational leisure pursuits available to all the community, irrespective of age.  It exhibits at major events and it is based on the Carlisle pier in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I mention the senior citizen element of this and the increasingly ageing demographics of Dublin county.  Given that GSI service users are predominantly of an older age, it is imperative that we do all we can to ensure that this first-class service is not lost to those who avail of it.  I am sure that many of the Minister's constituents and friends avail of this important service.  The society engages in outreach.<\/p> <p>I call on the Minister to intervene with immediacy with the chief executive of the harbour company and the chief executive of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to have the decision rescinded pending the transfer the transfer of the harbour company to the council because this institution cannot close.

D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company is a commercial company established under the Harbours Act 1996.  It has a statutory mandate to take all proper measures to the management, control, operation and development of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour.  The company is required to conduct its business in a cost-effective and efficient manner.  There is no Exchequer funding for the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, nor indeed for any other port company.  National ports policy clearly outlines that the commercial port companies must operate on a commercial basis without recourse to State funding for any activities.  While I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, the company has informed my officials that it has permitted the Genealogical Society of Ireland to occupy premises on the Carlisle Pier in D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour on a rent-free basis for a period of over six years.  <\/p><p>When the Genealogical Society of Ireland's lease on its premises on George's Street, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, expired in 2010, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company offered the society the use of the company-owned premises on the Carlisle Pier under a licence agreement for a period of three years.  The premises, which is owned by the harbour company, was not being used for commercial purposes at that time.  It was firmly understood by the society at the time of occupancy that the use of the premises was being offered as a short-term solution only, to allow the society a period of time to search for an alternative premises in conjunction with the local authority.  The Genealogical Society of Ireland has now had the benefit of occupying these premises on a rent-free basis since 2010.  Indeed, the society has acknowledged its debt of gratitude to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company for the use of the company's premises on the Carlisle Pier when the lease on the society's previous premises had expired, and for extending that period for a further three year period, up to and including 2016.<\/p><p>D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company now requires the premises for a commercial letting.  It is understood that a commercial operator has recently expressed an interest in renting facilities on the Carlisle Pier.  This includes the premises currently occupied by the Genealogical Society of Ireland.  Given those circumstances, the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company gave the society three months' notice, asking that the society make arrangements to vacate the premises.  Furthermore, the harbour company has offered to assist it in any way possible with its move.  The society has acknowledged the support and assistance provided by the harbour company to the society over the last six years.  The society has described the harbour company as a very attentive landlord, always on hand to assist the society and its board.  The society has accepted the position that it must now vacate the premises and has notified its members that its archive and research centre at the Carlisle Pier is due to close on 14 February 2017.  <\/p><p>I am aware that a motion was passed by the area committee of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council at a meeting held on 5 December 2016 requesting the chief executive of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown to explore what assistance the council could provide to the society to secure alternative premises.  It was also acknowledged at that meeting that the society provides vitally important services for active retirement pursuits within the age-friendly county strategy.  I understand that the county council's executive has now undertaken to meet the society to explore options for alternative premises as a matter of urgency, and I hope that the meeting will bear fruit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#B00600","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I take it from that there is a refusal to intervene.

The trouble is that the harbour company is a commercial outfit and is obliged to run itself as such.

I will not interfere with the day-to-day running of either the board or the company or D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.

This matter concerns the provision of a direct flight service between Tel Aviv and Dublin.  Ireland's trade relations with Israel have increased at a notable pace within a considerably short period of time.  In 2005, Ireland's service exports to Israel amounted to &euro;64 million, while service imports amounted to &euro;80 million but within ten years they have increased twofold.  In 2015, Ireland's service exports amounted to &euro;1.673 billion, while service imports amounted to &euro;171 million.<\/p> <p>In recent years, the number of direct flights between and Ireland and international hubs of tourism and trade, such as Dubai, the USA and Belgium has been increasing.  Despite this there is no direct permanent flight service between Ireland and Israel.  Organisations in both countries have been campaigning for a direct and permanent flight service on the grounds that it would improve the level of production, collaboration and creativity between the two countries.  A number of multinational companies such as Intel, Microsoft and Apple all have offices in both states and many Israeli based companies will benefit hugely from flying their staff directly through Ireland's US pre-clearance airports.  Furthermore, in addition to the considerable tourism element, both countries are home to Irish and Israeli expatriates.  A permanent direct flight service would facilitate both communities remaining connected.  In addition to these considerations, a direct flight service between Ireland and Israel would improve Ireland's presentation as a global, connected and modernising state for British-based multinationals to relocate to following the result of Brexit.  Therefore, as the motion stated, I ask the Minister to work in conjunction with Ireland's commercial airlines in order to play an active role in seeking a permanent, direct flight between Dublin and Tel Aviv.  Such a development would be particularly beneficial to Ireland, its economy and global reach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#D00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Noone for raising this very important matter.

The network is an independent, non-political organisation, that promotes business contacts between Irish and Israeli companies.  The two countries have important high-tech sectors.  Naturally, a year-round direct flight service would help to facilitate trade and tourism between Ireland and Israel, which is something that we will encourage.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->New services, of which there are too many to mention, are being launched regularly.  Traffic and the number of routes have been growing at all of our international airports in the recent past.  Air services between Ireland and Israel are governed by the EU-Israel air services agreement which was signed in 2012.  The agreement provides a framework to open up and integrate the respective markets, strengthen co-operation and offer new opportunities for industry, including airlines and consumers.  It is essentially an open skies agreement that allows any European Union or Israeli airline to fly between Ireland and Israel.<\/p><p>Ireland fully supports the European Union's external aviation policy which seeks to negotiate air services agreements with non-EU countries such as Israel.  While a range of direct flights operate between the two countries, to date no airline has chosen to operate a year round service.  For a number of years Arkia Airlines, an Israeli airline, has operated a twice weekly scheduled service between Tel Aviv and Dublin and is expected to continue this service in 2017.  Israeli and Irish airlines have also operated tourist charter flights between the two countries.  The State agencies and my Department would certainly be very supportive of any airline interested in launching a year round service.<\/p><p>The Senator is right to point to the need for Ireland to be open to possible opportunities arising from Brexit.  Yesterday I hosted an all-island sectoral dialogue in Dundalk concentrating on transport and tourism matters.  As I stated at the event, transport and tourism are central to the economic and social fabric of the island of Ireland and my aim is to minimise any negative impact and seek positive opportunities that may arise in the coming years from the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union.  My objective in holding the all-island dialogue was to get viewpoints from stakeholders on the island of Ireland on how the United Kingdom's decision would affect them and what could be done by industry and the Government to mitigate these adverse effects.<\/p><p>To sum up, the EU-Israel air services agreement means that any EU or Israeli airline is free to launch direct services should it take the commercial decision to do so.  I would certainly welcome such a development.  My Department and the State agencies will continue their efforts to promote Ireland&rsquo;s air connectivity with the rest of the world.  I again thank the Senator for raising the matter.  My Department fully supports increased connectivity and competition in the market for air services in and out of Ireland.  We will work to facilitate any proposed direct service between Ireland and Israel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#D00400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I am very pleased with the Minister's response.

An ordinary punter would have more conditions attached to a proposal for an extension to a dwelling house.<\/p><p>Needless to say, An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision was met by a tsunami of disappointment, anger and frustration by the people affected.  If EirGrid believes people on the ground will take the decision lying down, it is very much mistaken.  The determination and resolve of communities opposed to the overgrounding of the North-South interconnector are immeasurable and were very much evident at a meeting I attended in Kells last Thursday night.  Opposition to the project is stronger than ever, particularly because people believe the process let them down.  Not only that, they believe it was rigged against them and that they were effectively dealing with a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.

Remarkably, the planning application was never presented at the oral hearing and it was EirGrid's responses to submissions that were used as the basis for the oral hearing.  This is a highly irregular approach.<\/p><p>People are very angry that the inputs of landowners and the public were completely ignored.  Contributions from local public representatives were not even recorded and county development plans from across the three counties were conflicted.  Most of all, the argument accepting that undergrounding was feasible and required further investigation was completely bypassed.  The communities fighting the installation of pylons for the interconnector have gathered evidence to show that undergrounding strengthens the grid and improves reliability so that undergrounding is now less expensive than overhead lines.  We were told initially told that undergrounding would be 30 times more expensive but with advances in technology, it is now possible that undergrounding is even cheaper than an overhead system.  Evidence for this comes from a project currently being undertaken between Belgium and Germany where undergrounding has been done.<\/p><p>In light of such developments it is clear the public has no buy-in to the project as it stands.  The Government needs to look very seriously at the underground option and to consider how a project such as this can proceed without public support.  It needs to ask why An Bord Plean&aacute;la only has responsibility for planning matters and no responsibility for impact on the public, such as the equivalent bodies have in Denmark and Belgium.

They raise suggestions that are often referenced in the debate on this project and I welcome the discussion on the topic.  I note that the Minister, Deputy Naughten, will meet local representative groups and public representatives to hear their views.  That meeting had been scheduled for last Friday but unfortunately a number of the representatives were unable to meet on that date and the meeting will be rescheduled soon.<\/p> <p>It is important to state that Government policy and the development of energy infrastructure precludes the Minister with responsibility for energy from directing EirGrid one way or another with regard to this development, or any interconnector.  This is a detail that appears never to be raised in a debate but it is an important one in terms of the parameters of the role of the Minister, Deputy Naughten.<\/p> <p>As detailed in the 2012 Government policy statement on the strategic importance of transmission and other energy infrastructure, the policy in this area is very clear.  It sets out that the Government does not seek to direct EirGrid and the ESB Networks or any other infrastructure developer to particular sites, routes or technologies.  EirGrid is the designated transmission system operator and its role includes the operation, maintenance and development of the electricity transmission network in Ireland.  It carries out its role independent from political direction.  Would it be appropriate if Ministers with responsibility for energy were to regularly direct it in the discharge of its functions?  I do not believe that such a scenario of interference would be ultimately beneficial for all of the people within our State.<\/p> <p>The potential for developing the North-South interconnector project underground has been examined and a number of studies have been carried out by EirGrid and independently commissioned by my Department.  All those studies were available to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as part of a recent planning process.  This statutory independent process concluded on 21 December last with the publication of the planning decision.  This decision approved, with conditions, the proposed overground North-South 400 kV interconnector project, although I agree that nine conditions seem a little light for a project of that nature, considering, as Senator Gallagher said, that many home owners seem to have many more such conditions attached to some planning permissions.<\/p> <p>The planning process carried out by An Bord Plean&aacute;la heard from my Department that the North-South interconnector is the key project in delivering the objectives of the national energy policy, specifically security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability.  This will bring benefits to electricity customers across the island of Ireland.  The planning process also heard testimony both in favour of and against the overground and underground solutions.  It examined those issues thoroughly and concluded that a high voltage alternating current overhead line is the best technical and economic solution for the North-South interconnector to achieve these national energy objectives.<\/p> <p>I stress that the statutory independent planning process has determined that the proposed North-South interconnector should be developed and neither I nor the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has any role in directing EirGrid to develop the project in a different manner.  I understand and acknowledge the grave concerns of local people, local councillors and all my Oireachtas colleagues in the affected counties.  This project has been debated on many occasions in our parliamentary party meetings and I am sure it has also been debated in the Senators' parliamentary party meetings.  I accept the concerns people have about the overground solution but the policy is clear, namely, that we do not have the power to direct the Minister, Deputy Naughten, to interfere in a decision on the role of EirGrid.  The planning process carried out by An Bord Plean&aacute;la was independent.  Obviously, I was not present at those proceedings.  The Senators have views on what was done, what was not done and what should have been done but, clearly, An Bord Plean&aacute;la's has an independent role from Government, which must also be acknowledged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#G00200","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

One would think it was a fair and detailed process.  However, it is only when one is close to it that one sees what happens.  Only those on the ground see it.  Monaghan County Council raised concerns when the first application was made, but they were not addressed.  It raised them again when the second application was made, but they were still not addressed.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la reached a decision on an issue, in spite of the fact that concerns raised by Monaghan County Council had yet to be resolved.  I appreciate that the Minister of State has outlined the legal constraints within which he has to operate, but it is important that the issue be examined as the people of counties Monaghan, Cavan and Meath feel wronged by the decision.  Given the improvements in technology, the entire project must be looked at again.

I compliment him on being a champion for the disabled in the work he has done since reaching the office of Minister of State at the Department of Health.  However, we are here to talk about St. Stephen's Hospital, Sarsfield Court, Glanmire, County Cork.  As the Minister of State is aware, I do not normally take on local issues.  I take on national issues, but this issues has ramifications nationally for the Department.<\/p> <p>The hospital caters for a small number of mental health patients in the main building, while a separate single storey building includes a child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, unit for children with learning difficulties.  Another adjacent building caters for teenagers in care.  The Child and Family Agency, Tusla, has offices there and there is also an Alzheimer's unit on the site.  <\/p> <p>I do not know whether the Minister of State has ever had an opportunity to visit St. Stephen's Hospital, but it is situated on a magnificent 117 acre site which offers ultimate potential for the development of an acute hospital.  Its location could not be better.  The hospital is located less than a mile from the M8 motorway and only ten miles from Cork city and there is no traffic congestion in the area.  There is excellent public transport and ample space for parking.  If developed, it would serve a huge catchment area, including not just Glanmire but also Watergrasshill, Mayfield and Ballyvolane, as well as the rapidly expanding towns of Cobh, Carrigtwohill and the wider east Cork area.  <\/p> <p>St. Stephen's Hospital is in the constituency of Cork North Central which has suffered greatly.  There has been little investment in the area.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

The current accident and emergency crisis, which is now an all-year-round problem, has occurred precisely because of the acute bed shortage, and Cork is no exception.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, the Health Service Executive, HSE, report on acute hospital services for Cork and Kerry found that Cork needs a new hospital within the next ten to 15 years to cope with the population growth.  The proposed development by University College Cork of a science park at Curraheen, with an acute hospital facility, has been put forward as an option on official planning documents by Cork County Council.  While the development of a science park has great merits, there is no guarantee if and when a hospital could be developed on a greenfield site.<\/p><p>Councillor Ger Keohane from Glanmire is a strong advocate of the St. Stephen's option and has asked me to invite the Minister of State to visit St. Stephen's, with his officials, to explore the possibility of redevelopment.  I agree with Councillor Keohane that the redevelopment of St. Stephen's would be an infinitely more cost-effective, efficient and timely option.  The hospital site could have an accident and emergency department, a minor surgery department, a primary care centre, an X-ray department, an ambulance depot, a 24-7 suicide prevention unit, a psychiatric wing and many other facilities.  Given the space available and the fact that there are ten derelict buildings on the site, the options are endless.  It would cost much less to redevelop St. Stephen's as a multi-purpose medical facility than to embark on a greenfield project on the same side of the county where there is already a major hospital.

Let us hope we can do something about the issue of developing disability services over the coming years but also deal with many other issues such as the one the Senator raises today.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this particular issue because I know he is a passionate advocate for health services but particularly for mental health and disability services.  In terms of the details, the hospital campus at St. Stephen's Hospital consists of approximately 114 acres which were developed as a regional sanatorium in the 1950s.  It is located approximately 14 miles from Cork University Hospital, CUH, and other hospitals in Cork, and has limited access to public transport services.  While some acute hospital services were previously based at St. Stephen's Hospital, those services were relocated to Cork University Hospital when it opened in 1979.  The vacated buildings were used to facilitate the closure of Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, with the transfer of mental health services to the campus.<\/p> <p>Mental health services currently provided at the campus include an acute mental health unit; four residential mental health units for patients requiring continuing care for enduring mental health conditions; an Alzheimer's unit; and the Child and Adolescents Mental Health Services, CAMHS, north Lee team.  In addition, the site at St. Stephen's also accommodates a Tusla residential child care facility, and children&rsquo;s outreach services.  Fostering services general and regional administration accommodation is also located at St. Stephen's, along with some local primary care services.<\/p> <p>There has been, and continues to be, a need to carry out significant works to the buildings from which inpatient mental health services are currently provided to enable continued use of these buildings and to meet the standards required by the Mental Health Commission for approved inpatient-residential centres.  Further works will also be required to the Alzheimer's unit to ensure its ongoing compliance with HIQA regulations.  We have to ensure that all these services are up to both national and international standards.<\/p> <p>The existing buildings at St. Stephen's Hospital, in the context of acute hospital services, are substantially to a 1950s standard in terms of the building fabric, the layout, the functionality and the engineering services.  These would require major capital investment to allow them be brought into use for patient services.  It is a matter for the HSE in the first instance, which has statutory responsibility for the planning and delivery of health and personal social services at local level, including any proposed infrastructural developments, to consider the issue raised by Senator Craughwell, taking account of agreed policy for the development of acute hospitals in the region and evolving service priorities and resource availability overall.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I will, of course, bring the Senator's concerns to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Harris.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#J00200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

The UK Supreme Court was asked to consider this: &quot;Does any provision of the NI Act, read together with the Belfast Agreement and the British-Irish Agreement, have the effect that primary legislation is required before Notice can be given?&quot;  According to the court at paragraph 131 of its judgment:<\/p><blockquote>[It] is unquestionably right, however, to claim that the NI Act conferred rights on the citizens of Northern Ireland.  Sections 6(2)(d) and 24(1), in imposing the EU constraints, have endowed the people of Northern Ireland with the right to challenge actions of the Executive or the Assembly on the basis that they are in breach of EU law. <\/blockquote> <p>While the court has ruled that the consent of the Northern Ireland Assembly was not required and it did not make judgment on the necessity or otherwise to amend the Northern Ireland Act of Westminster, which put into law the Good Friday Agreement, it made clear that Northern Ireland's citizens were given EU-based rights as a result of that legislation.  Its citizens, the majority of whom voted against Brexit, will see those rights stripped away from them two years after the UK formally notifies of Article 50 without having any say on the matter.  The citizens of this State, who voted in record numbers to amend our Constitution and enable Ireland to sign up to the Good Friday Agreement, will equally have no say over the stripping away of the rights enshrined in the Agreement.

I again thank Martin for all he has done and wish our new leader in the North, Michelle O'Neill, the very best in her new position.  She is a fantastic choice.

I ask the House and the wider Oireachtas to do everything possible to help her to secure this special status to ensure all citizens will be looked after.<\/p> <p>I would like to comment on the report presented yesterday on rural development.  I welcome any investment in rural Ireland, but I am at a loss to understand what is new in the report.  For example, in terms of rural infrastructure and connectivity, the key objectives include high speed broadband provision, improvements to rural transport services and implementation of flood relief measures.  These are all measures that have been announced previously.  I am sure we will be forgiven in rural Ireland if at this stage we say there is report fatigue.  We have had spatial and many other strategies which have never amounted to anything more.  It is welcome that the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, will come before the House soon when I look forward to having an indepth discussion with her on the report, but to me it is a regurgitation of a series of actions denounced previously.  I know that the Government will spin it as being the first comprehensive cross-departmental report, but that is something of which we should be very ashamed.

The issue has totally dropped off the radar.  From Blanchardstown to Finglas and Cork to Limerick, there is no longer a focus on revitalising disadvantaged areas.  The Revitalising Areas by Planning, Investment and Development, RAPID, programme was introduced by the former Minister of State Eoin Ryan, whom I commend for introducing such a focused and targeted measure.  Unfortunately, the areas included have been forgotten by the Government.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate, at his earliest convenience, on the need for investment in urban areas, especially disadvantaged areas that have dropped off the radar and been left behind.  In many cases, the only time one hears about disadvantaged areas in Dublin and Cork is when some unfortunate person has been murdered and a task force is then established.  We need a planned response to tackle disadvantage in urban areas. <\/p> <p>I do not support the call for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to attend the House today because he is scheduled to attend on Thursday.  I ask Senators to make an effort not to score political points when debating the issue of Brexit which presents one of the greatest challenges Ireland has ever faced, both North and South.  I will not be preached to by Sinn F&eacute;in that the Taoiseach must look after the interests of Northern Ireland.  He will look after the interests of the Thirty-two Counties as best as he can, but four Sinn F&eacute;in Members have been elected to the parliament at Westminster and collect expenses of &pound;500,000 a year.  They, too, must play their role by going to Westminster to fight for the Six Counties to make sure the North will receive special status.  Yes, the Government here must do its upmost to ensure the best possible deal is done for the Thirty-two Counties, but I will not be preached to by Sinn F&eacute;in that the Government must carry the load on its own.  If one takes the Queen's shilling, one should do the work.  Let the Sinn F&eacute;in Members go to Westminster to fight to secure a proper deal for Northern Ireland.

It is important that Senators make sure that the most vulnerable and most disadvantaged areas get the necessary funding going forward.<\/p> <p>I received several phone calls last night from county councillors.  It appears that yesterday evening the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney announced a new funding programme for councillors.  Most of us in the Seanad were councillors previously.  The abolition of town councils has had a detrimental effect on towns in Ireland.  Their loss has devastated many towns.  Funding has halved in many instances and the amount of funding provided to towns is unacceptable.  <\/p> <p>It is good to see that the Minister is willing to work with councillors.  Last June the Fianna F&aacute;il group tabled a motion in the Seanad supporting county councillors, criticising the loss of town councils and supporting calls from councillors for additional funding in view of the fact that their workload has trebled.  As Senators will be aware, that motion had the support of various groupings within the Seanad.  In that context, I am very disappointed that the Minister made an announcement regarding councillors yesterday but did not inform Members of this House.  We received no texts or e-mails and were not made aware of the details.  I received phone calls from the councillors with whom I work but was unaware of what was happening. That is unacceptable.

That is unacceptable and suggests that those councillors do not represent their areas as well as others do.  There is no need for that.<\/p> <p>I understand that the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, will hold a meeting on Thursday next.  I call on the Minister to explain what he has in mind.

Those who will be affected by the plan have been consulted widely.  The plan promoted cross-departmental co-operation and has some solid proposals to make it easier for people to continue living and raising families in Irish towns, villages and rural areas.  I was particularly interested to see measures oriented towards revitalising the main streets of our rural towns and villages, something the Green Party is particularly keen to encourage.<\/p><p>However, there was one aspect of the realisation of the scheme that as a Green Party member and a proponent of local banking models I did not welcome.  As part of the programme for Government, the Fine Gael Party committed to creating the legal structures necessary to permit a local banking model to emerge in Ireland.  Such a model could emulate the best aspects of the German <i>Sparkassen<\/i>model and the New Zealand's Kiwi bank model, allowing focused regional banking orientated towards investment and loans within communities and avoiding many of the pitfalls and inefficiencies of scale that conventional banking models can produce.  With this in mind, representatives of the German <i>Sparkassen<\/i>model had offered their services and advice to the Government in the establishment of such a system here in Ireland.  lf one looks at action point No. 23 in the enhancing local services section of the plan, it commits to investigating the potential of the German <i>Sparkassen<\/i>model and the Kiwi model for the development of local public banks that operate in defined regions.  This is a very welcome action point for any supporter of a more decentralised banking model, yet the delegated bodies for its development are the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Department of Finance, An Post and the Irish League of Credit Unions.  No mention is made of Sparkasse Bank as a partner, delegating the task rather to our own very fine institutions of An Post the ILCU.  How are they, as representatives of the existing savings systems, meant to be the best people in promoting its alternative?

I also fully support Senator Grace O'Sullivan's comments on the German Sparkassen and the banking system.  I hope Senators will attend a briefing in the audiovisual room next Wednesday by a group that is trying to develop a public banking service.  Notwithstanding my positive comment on the rural action plan, my difficulty is that it contains 276 actions.  In my experience in politics, no document with such a large number of actions has ever been followed through.  The &euro;60 million allocated over three years for 600 towns nationwide equates to &euro;30,000 per town per annum.  Based on an interview given by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, this will mean that every year one shop would be converted into a house and two public lights erected in each of the 600 towns.  That is not redevelopment and revitalisation of rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>The proposed revaluation of rates in nine counties and the exclusion of the other 17 beggars belief.  I do not see how this proposal will be workable.  I am also concerned about the proposal to convert shops into homes because it is intended that this measure will bypass the planning system, which means bypassing local democracy and local government.  This is a no-no and an insult to elected councillors.  <\/p> <p>The proposals to improve councillors' terms and conditions of employment are also an insult.  An increase in pay of &euro;20 per week for people who work up to 50 hours per week does not amount to an improvement in terms and conditions.  Furthermore, the exclusion of 250 councillors in the greater Dublin area, Galway and Cork from access to this paltry increase also beggars belief.  Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor called on the Minister to come to the House to discuss this issue.  I understand from the circular issued yesterday that the proposed changes will not take effect until 1 July.  Therefore, we have time to review the proposals made and I ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss them.<\/p> <p>Much has been made of the improvement in rural broadband services.  If one casts a cold eye over the figures, they show that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the previous Government, Deputy Brendan Howlin, allocated &euro;200 million for rural broadband provision, a single programme, yet rural areas are supposed to be revitalised with a sum of &euro;60 million.

It is a very significant part of our overall revenue stream and we must be vigilant as to how CCCTB develops.<\/p> <p>I echo the concerns of other speakers.  I welcome what the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has done in terms of councillors but I am concerned at the idea that 232 of 949, almost a quarter of the councillors, including all 183 in Dublin, 31 in Cork city and another 18 in Galway city, will not get the municipal district allowance.<\/p> <p>My former local authority is D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council where we had two area committees with 20 members each.  Those area committees were larger than many county councils around the country, for example, Sligo, Leitrim and Cavan in terms of members, and the chair of the committee got no allowance.  That was fine but people chairing municipal districts with as few as six members were getting allowances of &euro;6,000 a year for chairing them.  Equally, we are now being told members of municipal districts, which is about three quarters of councillors, will not get the allowance.  They deserve the money.<\/p> <p>I question the idea that councillors in Dublin city, Cork city and Galway city will not get an allowance or recognition that they are working as hard as everybody else.  In fact, quite often it is a function of having better broadband that one tends to get a lot more queries and more immediate responses are required for that reason.  Councillors in Dublin, Cork and Galway should be included in any measures and I do not believe it is appropriate to have a two-tier system for councillors.  I would like the Minister to come to the House and to address us on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#W00400","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I congratulate and thank the Minister for Health for going to the United Kingdom to invite the European Medicines Agency to come to Ireland.

I do not know whether it is the legacy of Conor Cruise O'Brien but it is a pity because we have a good platform in so many areas on which we agree.  However, it is a shame there is not that understanding.  For our part, our socialism does not stop at the Cavan border.<\/p> <p>I raise the issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I was at a meeting with union officials in the past hour.  The situation is extremely serious.  I want to point out how we got to where we are now.  The Fine Gael 2011 manifesto states: \"We will completely overhaul the bus market in Ireland by introducing competitive tendering for all bus routes in the country as soon as practicably possible.\"  Unfortunately, this is an issue of ideology; it has not come about by accident.<\/p> <p>Fine Gael has been in government for the past six years.  That is why Bus &Eacute;ireann is in the current mess.  It is a combination of ideological commitment to competition at the cost of rural communities coupled with a refusal to consider the issue of public service obligations.  I agree with Senator Mulherin that the Minister must come into the House but, with all due respect, the Members opposite are in government.  He is their Minister, so they should sort it out.  The top wage for a driver after 20 years of service is &euro;624.  The solution, which was given to us in our meeting, is to set up a sectoral employment order to put in place a level playing field for wages, whether it is a private or a State operator.  Our colleague, the Leader, is a good union man so I ask that in addition to inviting the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come into the House, he might also commit to the reasonable proposal that we establish a sectoral employment order to protect decent bus workers who have given a lifetime of service but who are facing the prospect of ruin unless the Minister acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#X00200","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I, too, support the comments made about the former deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, and wish him well in his retirement.<\/p> <p>I support Senator Mulherin and Senator Boyhan with regard to inviting the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to address the issues they raised but also on the increased number of pedestrians that have been killed on our roads and the increased number of cycling accidents.

One regularly sees people cycling in the hard shoulder of such routes, but doing so should be outlawed completely.  The relevant Minister should attend the House to discuss the increase in the number of accidents, particularly involving pedestrians and cyclists.  The Minister should also give an overview of what the Government and the Department are doing on the issue of driverless cars which are not that far from being introduced in many countries.  We need to plan for the driverless car era.  To be honest, it will be a welcome addition in rural areas where it might be the only thing to revitalise rural pubs.

I do not necessarily want to ban cyclists from using national routes, but we need to promote safer ways for people to travel.  We also want to encourage them to exercise to tackle the national obesity problem.  There are opportunities all over the country to provide safe cycleways and paths.  Parents should be able to bring their children out safely, but there are many roads in north County Dublin on which parents could not possibly allow their kids to cycle, but there is a wonderful opportunity in Fingal to do so on an excellent facility along the coastal route from Portmarnock and Malahide to Rush, Skerries and Balbriggan.<\/p> <p>I wish to address an issue that was raised by the Leader of the Opposition.

If those involved would find the journey to Carrick-on-Shannon a little long, they could always stay in Fingal where the Dublin Airport Authority has great plans to develop its lands as a business park.  One small example of the opportunities Brexit could bring involves Kelloggs which has an operation in Swords where it employs 300 people.  It sells its product worldwide, including into the European Union, as well as to South Africa, Australia and elsewhere.

Whitaker, and express my condolences to his family on his passing since the House last met.  Dr. Whitaker played a huge role in building a modern Ireland.  As Leader of the House, it is appropriate and important that I pay tribute to him on behalf of all Members and sympathise with his family on their recent bereavement.  He was a statesman and a state builder.  In time, we will have expressions of sympathy in the House, but it is important on our first day back to sympathise with his family and pay tribute to him for his legacy and the work he did in building a modern Ireland.<\/p> <p>I join the many Members of the House who paid tribute to the deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland, Martin McGuinness, who has announced his intention to step down.  As Leader of the House, I join the Cathaoirleach in lamenting the fact that we do not have the opportunity to have him in the House to listen to and engage with him not only on Brexit but on the future direction of our island.  It is important to wish him well in his recovery from ill health and to thank him for the role he has played in bringing an end to paramilitary violence and building a solution to events in the North of our country.  It is fair to say that we would not have had a peace process without him.  I thank him and his family for his work.  We may disagree with some of his past actions, but as a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, he was an instrumental, key, pivotal and monumental figure in the building of a peace process based on the Good Friday Agreement, which he was part of negotiating.  I wish the new Sinn F&eacute;in leader in the North, Michelle O'Neill, well in her job and hope she plays a positive role.<\/p> <p>It is regrettable that we are in an election cycle in the North of our country.  Those of us who watch events recognise that it could have been avoided.  It is a pity we have an election and I hope all of the parties in the North will not play the political card, green, white or orange, but rather play the card of community to build on the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>This Government, as was the last, is committed to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Senators McDowell and Reilly are former Ministers who engaged in North-South ministerial contact and played roles in different ways.  It is incumbent on all of us who are custodians of politics to play a role in continuing to build on the political goodwill that has been achieved and the changes that have happened.<\/p> <p>I do not want to be divisive but I note that the comments by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile regarding Senator Humphreys and the Labour Party were not helpful.  Partisanship like that does not help.  I ask the Senator to cast his mind back to the role that Dick Spring played in the building of the Anglo-Irish agreement and in his role in government with Fianna F&aacute;il leading up to the Good Friday Agreement and beyond.  We must recognise that all political parties have a role to play.  I hope very much that we do not go down the road Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile did this afternoon.<\/p> <p>Many Members have spoken today and some themes have emerged.  Senators Conway-Walsh, Humphreys, Murnane O'Connor, O'Sullivan and Landy referred to the launch yesterday of the action plan for rural Ireland.  I heard Senator Conway-Walsh on the radio yesterday.  It is important to welcome the fact that an action plan has been put in place with 275 points.  Senator Mulherin is gone but at Fine Gael Parliamentary Party meetings over the last five years she called weekly for an action plan for rural Ireland.  Following on from her interview yesterday, Senator Conway-Walsh should listen to Pat Spillane.  We now have an action plan which involves a whole-of-government approach.  It is a plan for investing and reinvigorating the fabric of rural Ireland.  It contains 275 action plan points.  Not even Sinn F&eacute;in can disagree that the Action Plan for Jobs was a success.  Unemployment is at its lowest level in a decade.  There are now more people back at work.  The Government is aiming to create jobs and to have 135,000 people back at work in rural Ireland by 2020 in the very towns and villages about which Senator Conway-Walsh speaks every day.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The plan is about developing primary care and supporting rural postal offices and education.  It is also about supporting over 4,000 community projects in addition to putting in place the building blocks to work with and improve the Leader programme and the rural development programme.  In addition, it is about investing.  A total of &euro;37 million will be invested in the village and town renewal scheme while &euro;275 million will be invested in national broadband, which is the very thing we need in rural Ireland.  A total of &euro;4 billion will be invested in developing and enhancing the rural development programme between 2014 and 2020 while &euro;250 million will be given to the Leader programme.  The aim is improve the life of rural Ireland.  It is a tangible list of projects that can be measured and delivered upon.<\/p><p>Rather than lamenting that it has taken until now to have an action plan, Members should remember that we had the worst recession in the history of our country.  There was no money available.  The previous Government was able to put in place the foundation so that our economy is now doing better and we can invest in the very fabric of society in rural Ireland.  I hope we will welcome the rural Ireland development plan and the action plan, which is built upon five pillars: creating sustainable communities; supporting enterprise and employment; maximising rural tourism and recreation potential; fostering culture and creativity in rural communities; and improving rural infrastructure and connectivity.  This is a plan that will deliver for rural Ireland.  It deserves to be worked upon and deserves a chance to be implemented.  People can then come back and review and critique it.  If it has not worked, let us have another one but let us not come in here and have old politics whereby we criticise the Government for investing in rural Ireland.  <\/p><p>Senators Craughwell, Conway-Walsh, Boyhan, Paddy Burke, Colm Burke, Reilly, Gavan, &Oacute; Donnghaile and Humphreys all paid tribute to Martin McGuinness, for which I thank them.  I wish all those running for election in Northern Ireland well and thank those who are stepping down.  I pay tribute to Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane who is stepping down.  I got to know her at the Constitutional Convention and we became good friends.  I wish her well and thank her for the service she has given along with all the members of the Northern Ireland Assembly who are stepping down.  <\/p><p>Senators Ardagh and Reilly referred to the Garda operation in Dublin Airport yesterday.  It is important that we congratulate An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the role it played in targeting illegal immigration and people smuggling at Dublin Airport.  The Senators are correct in raising the issue of security and the importance of securing all our airports.  It is important that we commend An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and work to ensure that our immigration officers at Dublin Airport, who process around 50 million passengers every year, are resourced and that we have constant vigilance in our airports and ports.  It is important that we ensure that we have safety and security in our airports and ports.  This is an evolving issue.  I know people are before the courts today but it is important to commend those involved in the Garda operation and thank them for the role they played and the work they did yesterday.  <\/p><p>Senators Craughwell and Ardagh raised the issue of Brexit at the beginning of their contributions.  I will not be accepting amendments, not because I do not want to, but because the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will be coming to the House this week to discuss matters pertaining to the issues raised.  The Seanad CPP is progressing with Senator McDowell's proposal around the Seanad motion on how this Chamber can play a role in and influence our stance regarding Brexit.<\/p><p>In respect of Senator Craughwell's comments regarding the role of the Government, it is worth noting that the Government has been preparing for Brexit for over 18 months.  Part of the difficulty is because it is an evolving situation - a term I used earlier.  We saw the UK Supreme Court decide by eight votes to three to refer the matter back to the UK Parliament.  It is about prioritising what is best for us, regardless of whether it is a hard or soft Brexit.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The important point is we take an island approach and both sides of the island work to protect our interests.  To be fair, the Taoiseach and Government are doing this.  The Taoiseach has engaged throughout Europe with a host of leaders, promulgating and advocating on behalf of Ireland and prioritising our national interest.  As a consequence, he has made European leaders better informed on the challenges and threats to us as a country and has informed them on Ireland's position.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach will meet Prime Minister May in the coming weeks in Warsaw.  She is going to Washington DC on Friday.  I hope she does not take an insular approach to her meeting with President Trump and that she uses the meeting to outline to the President of the United States that the devolved assemblies of Northern Ireland and Scotland must also have a role.  All of us would wish the UK was not leaving.  The Taoiseach is the line Minister responsible.  Many people jumped on the band wagon about having a specific specialised Brexit Ministry.  This is an holistic Government approach.  The Taoiseach has strengthened his Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, and the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, are playing a role.  It is important that we continue to keep a watchful eye on evolving events.  In saying this, it is important that Ireland plays a strong role in Europe and that our voices are heard.  This is why the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will appear before the House this week.<\/p><p>Senators Colm Burke, Feighan and Reilly made reference to locating the European Medicines Agency in Ireland.  Senator Feighan deserves praise for being the first to mention it and the Minister, Deputy Harris, deserves credit for making an attempt to bring the European Medicines Agency to Ireland.  Nine out of ten pharmaceutical companies are located in Cork, and as a Cork person, as are Senator Colm Burke and the Cathaoirleach, I hope Cork will be the location, given we have the Tyndall Institute, University College Cork and CIT, which play a strong role in research and innovation in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#Z00200","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Nice try anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#BB00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>We can discuss later where it should be situated in Ireland, but the important point is the Minister has made an attempt to have it located here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#BB00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>It will probably be in Wicklow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#BB00400","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I forgot to mention that on 9 February the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, will come to the House to discuss the action plan for rural development.<\/p> <p>Senators Murnane O'Connor, Devine, Landy, Davitt, Horkan and Boyhan spoke about councillors' pay and the decision by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, yesterday.

I look forward to engaging in debate with Senators as the Bill proceeds through the various Stages.<\/p> <p>As Senators will be aware, the Bill provides for a number of significant changes to adoption legislation arising from the children's referendum held in 2012 and given effect to in legislation in 2015.  The children's reference inserted Article 42A into the Constitution, providing that children have constitutional rights and protections and that the State must vindicate those rights.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to give legislative effect to Article 42A specifically with regard to adoption procedures and provides that all children are now eligible for adoption regardless of the marital status of their parents.  The Bill also provides for ensuring that the best of interests of the child and the views of the child are at the heart of the adoption proceedings before the authority or the courts.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Katherine Zappone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The Bill amends the Adoption Act 2010 and repeals Part 11 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  The provisions in Part 11 of the 2015 Act, allowing for cohabiting couples and civil partners to adopt, have been brought forward in the Bill to ensure they are encompassed in primary adoption legislation.<\/p><p>The Bill also contains new provisions that provide for step-parent adoption without the requirement for the other parent to adopt his or her own child.  The legislation will introduce many significant substantive changes to adoption, as well as technical changes.  <\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, adoption is, first and foremost, a child welfare measure that encompasses their well-being, happiness and health.  Often when one hears the word \"welfare\", it is associated with adults in difficult circumstances, etc.  In this case, adoption is a child well-being measure with the aim of providing a new family and home for a child who cannot be cared for by his or her parents.  Adoption is a hugely significant event in the life of a child, one that has life-long implications for him or her and his or her family.  An adoption order ends the legal link - there are others - between the child and his or her parents or guardians and transfers parental rights, responsibilities and duties to the adoptive parents.  This process is aimed at ensuring the child is provided with a secure and permanent family unit.  Given the life-changing legal implications of adoption, it is essential that the best interests of the child remain central to the adoption process.  The amendments I brought forward in the D&aacute;il will further strengthen procedures in this regard.<\/p><p>I will refer to the proposed amendment brought forward in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire on the adoption of a person over the age of 18 years.  I understand the intention of his proposal was to allow for the adoption of a person who had begun but not completed the adoption process before turning 18 years.  I am not aware of specific cases in this regard.  I understand both the Adoption Authority and the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, prioritise cases in circumstances such as this.  However, in the course of debating the issue a number of Deputies raised concerns that while it might not have happened to date, it could happen in the future.  Therefore, they called for procedures to be strengthened.  Having given careful consideration to the concerns raised, I requested the Adoption Authority to prepare a proposal, in consultation with the Child and Family Agency, for inclusion in its business plan to address the issue.  The Bill is about a child's welfare, well-being, happiness and encouraging care in the context of loving circumstances, which are all good, when difficulties or circumstances arise or there is trauma, neglect or lack of care.  This is a significant and a very good Bill that will no doubt be improved in this debate.  <\/p><p>I will address specific provisions.  As I said, the primary purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to the 31st amendment to the Constitution following the children's rights referendum.<\/p><p>Section 1 provides that the principal Act means the Adoption Act 2010.  Section 2 provides for the repeal of section 24 of the Adoption Act 2010 and Part 11 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  The repeal of section 24 is consequential on the inclusion of section 12 of the Bill which inserts a new section 23 into the 2010 Act.  Section 2 also provides for the repeal of Part 11 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and the insertion of the contents of its provisions, amended as required, into the Adoption (Amendment) Bill.  As I said, this ensures provisions allowing for the adoption of a child by civil partners or cohabiting couples will form part of primary adoption legislation.  Again, it is a significant measure.  <\/p><p>Section 3 of the Bill amends section 3 the 2010 Act to provide for the insertion of definitions of various terms in the Bill.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Katherine Zappone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Section 4 amends section 4 of the 2010 Act to replace the term \"birth parents\" with \"parents\" with regard to references to making arrangements for adoption.  Again, we are all so aware that language is powerful and this language change reflects a cultural change.<\/p><p>Section 5 amends section 12 of the 2010 Act by including the terms \"mother\" and \"father\" in the definition of \"guardian\" in the context of visits and enquiries pertaining to adoptions.  Section 6 amends section 16 of the 2010 Act and replaces the term \"father\" with \"relevant non-guardian\" in order that each person who is included in the definition of relevant non-guardian may give notice of his or her wish to be consulted on an application for an adoption order by a mother, step-parent or relative of a child.<\/p><p>Section 7 replaces the term \"father\" with \"relevant non-guardian\" in section 17 of the 2010 Act in order that each person who is included in the definition of relevant non-guardian is included in the category of persons with whom consultation is required prior to the placement of a child for adoption.  The term \"relevant non-guardian\" has been widened and so within each case we need to insert it as distinct from the term \"father\".  Section 8 is another example of this as it substitutes section 18 of the 2010 Act to replace the term \"father\" with \"relevant non-guardian\".  In this case the section sets out the circumstances wherein the authority may, with the approval of the High Court, authorise the placing of a child for adoption and dispense with the requirement for consultation with the child&rsquo;s \"relevant non-guardian\".<\/p><p>Section 9 of the Adoption (Amendment) Bill amends section 19 of the 2010 Act by substituting a new section 19 to reflect Article 42A of the Constitution and to provide that in any matter, application or proceedings under the 2010 Act before the Adoption Authority of Ireland or any court, the authority or the court, as the case may be, shall have regard for the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration in the resolution of such matter, application or proceedings.  The section also provides that in the resolution of any matter, application or proceedings referred to in the section, the authority or court, as the case may be, shall, in respect of any child who is capable of forming his or her own views, ascertain those views and such views shall be given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.<\/p><p>I brought forward an amendment in the D&aacute;il to strengthen the provisions of the new section 19 of the 2010 Act in enabling the views of the child to be heard in matters or proceedings to determine the best interests of the child.  The new section details the factors and circumstances relevant to the child that the authority or court shall regard in determining the child&rsquo;s best interests in any matter, application or proceeding before them.  One can imagine a child whose universe includes parents, prospective adoptive parents, a guardian or guardians and relevant non-guardians.  In that context it is very important to ensure that the best interests of the child in that circle are considered and his or her views are heard and given due weight.  The amendment came about as a result of engagement in the D&aacute;il and many Opposition requests that a more substantive provision be included in the Bill.  The factors to be considered include the child&rsquo;s age; the physical, psychological and emotional needs of the child; the likely effect of adoption on the child; the child&rsquo;s views on his or her proposed adoption; the child&rsquo;s social, intellectual and educational needs; the child&rsquo;s upbringing and care; the child&rsquo;s relationship with his or her parent, guardian or relative, as the case may be and; any other particular circumstances pertaining to the child concerned.  <\/p><p>The amendments I brought forward in the D&aacute;il also provide for the making of regulations to prescribe the procedures under which the authority or court best ascertain and give due weight to the views of the child.  This will include procedures to enable a child to present his or her views, in person or in writing and to nominate an appropriate person to present the child&rsquo;s views as well as the procedures that are to apply to any consultation by the authority or court with the child or appropriate person.  I intend to enter into a consultation process with children before the drafting of these regulations.  This is the norm in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with regard to matters of such importance and I look forward to the results of that consultation.<\/p><p>Section 11 amends section 21 of the 2010 Act by substituting a new subsection (2) to provide that the Child and Family Agency shall give notice of discontinuance of adoption proceedings to the authority, to any adoption committee concerned, to the mother or any other guardian and to each relevant non-guardian of a child.  Section 12 of the Adoption (Amendment) Bill amends section 23 of the 2010 Act to extend the eligibility for adoption to any child residing in the State who is under the age of 18 years and who has been in the care of the applicants for the prescribed period.  The section also deletes the reference to the eligibility for adoption in respect of a child who is an \"orphan\" - when was the last time Members heard that word? - or who is \"born of parents not married to each other\".  This is a very significant change, reflecting how society has moved on.  The section also provides that a step-parent may adopt a child where that child has had a home with the child&rsquo;s parent and step-parent for a continuous period of not less than two years at the date of the application for the adoption order.<\/p><p>Section 13 amends section 30 of the 2010 Act to replace the term \"father\" with \"relevant non-guardian\" so that all persons included in the definition of relevant non-guardian are persons with whom consultation is required under this section.  In the drafting of the Bill it was important to ensure clarity on whose consent is required in relation to the adoption process.  Section 14 of the Bill amends section 31 of the 2010 Act by substituting a new section 31 to provide that in circumstances where a child has been placed with prospective adopters and where, prior to the final adoption order being made, a person whose consent to the making of the adoption order is necessary fails or refuses to give consent or withdraws a consent already given, the applicants may apply to the High Court for an order giving custody of the child to the applicants for such period as the court may determine and authorising the authority to dispense with the consent to the making of an adoption order in favour of the applicants.  This is one of the many examples in the Bill of a thinking-through on the part of those drafting the Bill, in my Department and in the Office of the Attorney General, of the consequences of what is being written with the aim of ensuring that the bests interests of the child are to the fore.  In these circumstances, the section provides that the High Court shall have regard to the relationship between the child and the applicants, the child and his or her mother or guardian and the efforts made by any of those persons to develop or maintain such a relationship and any proposed arrangements of either the applicants and the mother or guardian for the future care of the child.  The section also provides that the High Court shall, in so far as is practicable, give due weight to the views of the child, having regard to the age and maturity of that child.<\/p><p>Section 15 amends section 32 of the 2010 Act to provide that the authority shall not make an adoption order in circumstances where the child, the applicant or applicants for an adoption order and every person whose consent to the adoption is required under section 26 of the 2010 Act are not all of the same religion, if of any religion, unless every person whose consent is required to that adoption knows, when so consenting, the religion, if any, of the applicant or applicants.  Section 16 amends section 33 of the 2010 Act to provide that a couple who are civil partners of each other, a cohabiting couple and a step-parent of a child are included in the categories of persons eligible to apply for an adoption order or for the recognition of an adoption order effected outside the State.  Section 17 amends section 34 of the 2010 Act to bring forward the provisions of section 115 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 into the Bill to provide that a couple who are civil partners of each other and a cohabiting couple are included in the categories of persons whose suitability for an adoption order or for the recognition of an adoption order effected outside the State must be satisfactory to the Adoption Authority of Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Katherine Zappone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Section 18 amends section 37 of the 2010 Act to provide that civil partners, a cohabiting couple and a step-parent are included in the categories of persons who may apply to the Child and Family Agency for an assessment of eligibility and suitability.  Section 19 amends section 38 of the 2010 Act by providing that the Child and Family Agency shall give notice of the discontinuance of an application for assessment under section 37(1) to the authority, the adoption committee concerned, the mother or any other guardian of the child and to each relevant non-guardian.<\/p><p>Section 20 amends section 40 of the Act by providing that civil partners and a cohabiting couple are included in the categories of persons in whose favour the authority may issue a declaration of eligibility and suitability.  There was a time when that was not the case.  Actually, there still is.  This change is only being introduced now.<\/p><p>Section 21 brings the provisions of section 119 or the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 into section 41 of the 2010 Act to provide that civil partners and a cohabiting couple are included in the categories of persons in whose favour the authority may extend the time period of the declaration of eligibility and suitability.  Section 22 amends section 43 of the 2010 Act to provide that a relevant non-guardian is included in the category of persons entitled to be heard by the authority on the application for an adoption order, as well as any guardian.<\/p><p>Section 23 amends section 45 of the Act in order to clarify that a child who was adopted may have a further adoption order made in respect of him or her and that, in those circumstances, the child shall be taken as the lawful child of the first-mentioned adopters.  Section 24 amends section 54 of the Act to provide for revised criteria under which the High Court may authorise the making of an adoption order without parental consent where a child's parents have failed in their duty towards him or her.  This is significant.  Under the revised criteria, the child must be in the custody of and have a home with the applicants for a continuous period of not less than 18 months and the High Court must be satisfied that the parents of the child have failed in their duty for a period of 36 months and that there is no reasonable prospect that the parents will be able to care for the child in a manner that will not prejudicially affect his or her safety or welfare.  These are heavy responsibilities.<\/p><p>Section 25 amends section 58 of the Act to provide that, upon an adoption order being made, an adopted child shall be considered, with regard to the rights and duties of parents and children in respect of one another, as the child of the adopter or adopters and that the child's mother, guardian or relevant non-guardian shall lose all parental rights and be freed from parental duties in respect of the child.  Section 26 inserts a new section 58A into the 2010 Act to provide that a child's mother or guardian shall not lose all parental rights in respect of his or her child where the child is adopted by a step-parent.  The section provides that a child who is adopted by his or her step-parent shall, upon the making of an adoption order, be regarded as the child of that step-parent and the step-parent's spouse, civil partner or cohabitant.  Section 27 amends section 59 of the 2010 Act to replace the term \"birth parents\" with \"parents\".<\/p><p>Regarding property rights, section 28 provides that, for the purposes of section 60 of the 2010 Act, an adopted person is to be regarded as the child of his or her adopter and not his or her pre-adoption parents.  For the purposes of stamp duty chargeable on conveyances or transfers of land, section 29 amends section 61 of the Act to provide that, subject to section 58A of the Act, an adopted person is regarded as the child of his or her adopter or adopters and not of any other person.<\/p><p>Section 30 amends section 62 of the Act on the ceasing of payments for the benefit of the child by a parent upon the making of an adoption order by replacing the term \"birth parent\" with \"parent\" in each place that it occurs.  Sections 31 to 34, inclusive, amend sections 68, 69, 78 and 79 of the Act to replace the term \"birth parent\" with \"person\" to allow for circumstances where a person other than a birth parent may be required to consent to the making of the adoption order.  Section 35 amends section 84 of the Act to provide that the entry of particulars in the Adopted Children Register are appropriate particulars in respect of the type of adoption concerned.<\/p><p>Section 36 amends section 85 of the Act to provide that, in the case of a further adoption, any reference to a previous adoption will be excluded in a copy or extract of the entry from the Adopted Children Register.  Section 37 amends section 97 of the Act to provide that the term \"father\" is replaced with \"relevant non-guardian\" in order that the Adoption Authority, when making rules regarding its procedures governing the consultation required with a person, shall include each person who is included in the definition of \"relevant non-guardian\".  Section 38 amends section 125 of the Act to provide that a civil partner of a parent of a child and a cohabitant of a parent of a child are included in the categories of persons who are not precluded from giving or receiving a child for adoption.<\/p><p>Sections 39 and 40 amend sections 144 and 145 of the 2010 Act, which relate to the prohibition of certain advertisements for adoptions and the prohibition of making or receiving payments for adoption, to clarify that the reference to a \"guardian\" in those sections is a reference to a \"guardian\" as defined in the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  Section 41 amends Schedule 3 of the 2010 Act to provide that the term \"marital status\" is replaced with the term \"civil status\" and that the Schedule includes the required particulars for all adoptions, including the particulars of a person who is married to or in a civil partnership or cohabiting with the adopter.  Section 42 is a standard provision setting out that sections of the Bill may be commenced by the Minister on a phased basis.<\/p><p>I look forward to hearing the opinions of Senators on the Bill and the important issues that they wish to address.

Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the Bill, as it gives legislative effect to Article 42A, which was inserted in the Constitution by the children's rights referendum.  Fianna F&aacute;il supported that referendum and I engaged in a great deal of door-to-door canvassing on it.  As such, I am delighted to see this Bill before the House.<\/p> <p>The Bill requires that the views of the child be heard and given due weight in adoption cases.  The Minister has comprehensively outlined the relevant provisions.  It removes a number of outdated anomalies, for example, that married parents may not voluntarily place their child up for adoption and a step-parent may not adopt a partner's biological child without the partner being required to adopt the child as well.  This is welcome.<\/p> <p>In discussing the Bill, it is important that we refer to its context as well as the changing face of Irish families and society.  I will cite figures from the 2011 census.  More than 200,000 households comprised lone parents, 17,378 one-parent households were living in multi-family situations, more than 49,000 households of cohabiting couples had children of under 15 years of age and more than 4,000 same sex couples were living together.  The Bill's provisions will assist the thousands of families making up these statistics - the numbers have certainly increased since - and, importantly, give additional rights to children living in such households.<\/p> <p>Regarding adoption in the case of parental failure, it is important that children in the care system not be allowed to drift and are given security.  The changes are welcome and sensible.  Of the 94 Irish adoptions that occurred in 2015, only 13 were from long-term foster care and most occurred when the children involved were approaching their 18th birthdays.  This was unacceptable and could not be allowed to continue because those children were deprived of security during their childhoods.  All children deserve security, be it with their biological families or as part of foster families.<\/p> <p>Approximately 600 children in full-time care are from families based in marriage.  The changes provided for in the Bill allow for the possibility that these children may be adopted if the circumstances allow.  That is welcome.<\/p> <p>While we support the Bill, further legislation or guidelines are required to give full effect to Article 42A of the Constitution in adoption proceedings.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In particular, guidelines on best practice for courts in ascertaining the views of the child should be considered in line with the Law Reform Commission recommendations.

The removal of this grant often acts as a barrier to adoption and in such circumstances only the child loses out.  I ask the Minister to consider extending the grant to families post-adoption. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#GG00200","speaker":"1376","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss an issue that is close to my own heart.  The Bill, which gives effect to our constitutional provisions, has been a long time coming.  In 1992, Ireland ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In 2010, it passed the Adoption Act and subsequently ratified the Hague convention on the protection of children and co-operation in respect of adoption.  In 2012, the Thirty-first Amendment to the Constitution (Children) Act was introduced and followed by referendum on children's rights.  We then had the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  At last, after this long journey, the Minister has introduced the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016.<\/p> <p>Having grown up in a children's orphanage in D&uacute;n Laoghaire where many hundreds of children lived, I have personal experience of this issue which I would like to share with the House.  I was only  a few days old when I entered the orphanage.  I lived there for sixteen and a half years, which is a long time.  I knew on the date of my seventh birthday that I would not be adopted because a family who wanted to adopt me and take me into their care were denied the opportunity to do so.  However, they continued to have a relationship and friendship with me that I cherish to this day.  From an experience such as this, one learns a few things and develops a great interest in this issue. <\/p> <p>The Bill recognises children as being at the centre of adoption.  We learned from the redress scheme and other stories that have been told of the great pain, anxiety, suffering and vulnerability of many children in care.  That was then, however.  Today, many hundreds of children are in care, some of them for five, six or seven years.  These children must not be denied an opportunity to be fostered or adopted.  Fostering and adoption are not for all children, however, and good State care is sometimes the best option.  For this reason, a suite of opportunities must be available to suit the needs of each child and his or her particular needs<\/p> <p>We must always recognise the heritage of children.  I got to know my parents and built with relationships with them, which I valued.  I am the youngest of seven children, all of whom were placed in care at different stages and in different institutions.  We are brothers and sisters and we meet and celebrate as family.  I cherish and love this tradition.  Let us not lose sight of the fact that parents bring children into the world with good intentions and to love and care for them.  They do not always want to abandon them but circumstances visit this upon them.  The church visited it on some families and single parents.  Likewise, families have forced people to abandon their children for inheritance reasons or for land, farms or other circumstances.  That is the history of this issue and it is also my history and the reason I can discuss it.<\/p> <p>It is important that we encourage and acknowledge the birth mother and father because they also have a role to play.  We must not lose sight of the fact that they will experience terrible regret and loss.  At the same time, we must acknowledge what children want, namely, care, love and affection.  Regardless of whether it is two men, two women, a man and a woman or one person, provided they can nourish, cherish, love and encourage a child, they will be the answer.  I salute the Minister because she has done a great deal of work in this area. <\/p> <p>When I was seven years old I knew I could never be adopted because at the age of seven, we were told we would stay in the orphanage until we were 16 or 17 years or until we could hack it in the world.  This is what we did but it is something no child should have to do.  I met children who returned from a fostering experience with terrible stories.  We must be careful about those to whom we foster children and those who are adopting children.  <\/p> <p>The Bill is wonderful and I thank the Minister for the 42 points she brought us through today.  However, it will all be meaningless if the necessary resources, including care packages, scrutiny and monitoring are not provided.  We need to ensure education, health services, care workers and advocates for children dovetail.  People talk about the need for advocacy.  Children need advocates.  I knew what I was doing at six or seven years of age, as did most other children, and sometimes I was good, bad, wrong or manipulative.  It is important to have advocates for children who can represent them.  <\/p> <p>A recent survey of care leavers shows that many of them would have liked the opportunity to have been adopted or fostered.  There are three or perhaps more options because not everything fits together.  I spoke about the important role of the birth family.  How could anyone not support a Bill that allows married parents to place their children for adoption in certain circumstances?  I have received many nasty letters from people in recent days in which they refer to the suitability of people, the erosion of the powers of the family and the constitutional provisions that make family a very special place.  This is not right.  When children are shown love, care and support, they will flourish.  It is important that cohabiting couples, those in civil partnerships and anyone else who is suitable, caring and loving and can provide stability for children be allowed to do so.<\/p> <p>I am convinced the Minister has done an exceptional job in bringing her insight, knowledge and experience to this Bill.  I feel this in every word she has written and spoken.  She is putting in place unique legislation and I am more than happy to support it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#HH00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the Bill before the House.  I also commend Senator Boyhan and thank him for sharing his personal experience.  I found his speech very touching and I feel like a bit of a bore speaking after him because what he had to say will be much more meaningful than the result of my examination of the Bill and some of its interesting provisions.<\/p> <p>The Bill is the result of the referendum on children's rights, which many of us will remember because in some ways it was sidelined by the referendum on Oireachtas inquiries held at the same time.  Certain referendums often receive greater emphasis on the day.  However, we cannot emphasise enough the importance of the provisions of this Bill.  This is open and forward-thinking legislation which provides a robust legislative basis for adoption.  I have some additional suggestions and comments which I will make before I conclude.<\/p> <p>As the Minister stated, the primary purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to the Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution, which inserted Article 42A in the Constitution.  I welcome that the Bill treats all children equally regardless of the marital status of their parents, allows for married parents to consent to and voluntarily place their child for adoption and standardises the threshold to be met before an adoption order can be granted.  Other features of the Bill which I welcome relate to step-adoption and the extension of eligibility to adopt to civil partners and same-sex couples.  It is crucial that all aspects of family law keep up to date with different family formations, as Senator Clifford-Lee stated.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The legislative changes arising from Article 42A of the Constitution and provided for in the Adoption (Amendment) Bill include providing that married couples may place a child for adoption on a voluntary basis in circumstances where both parents place the child for adoption and where both parents consent to the making of the adoption order.  It also provides for revised criteria so that where an application to adopt is made in respect of a child in the custody of and who has had a home with the applicants for a period of at least 18 months and where the child's parents have failed in their parental duty, as the Minister has discussed, the High Court may dispense with parental consent and authorise the Adoption Authority to make an adoption order in respect of that child.  The Bill also provides that the best interests of the child is the paramount consideration in respect of any matter.  In respect of applications or proceedings under the 2010 Act, the views of the child shall be ascertained by the Adoption Authority or by the court as the case may be and shall be given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.  <\/p><p>In addition to the legislative changes arising from the children's rights referendum, the Bill also makes a number of other significant changes.  The Minister has already spoken about each section but I will discuss a few of the more significant changes this legislation will bring about.  Provisions providing for the adoption of a child by civil partners and cohabiting couples are being made in the Bill by way of bringing forward the relevant section from Part 2 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 into the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016.  I welcome the fact that Part 2 of the 2015 Act requires amendment in order to ensure that the 2010 Act adequately protects the rights of those persons who consent to an adoption and generally ensures a robust legislative basis for an adoption.  This drafting approach will assist in achieving clarity and coherence in adoption legislation with the added benefit of providing for adoption law in adoption Acts.  <\/p><p>I welcome the fact that the Bill also provides for the adoption of a child by their step-parent without requiring the child's other parent to adopt their own child.  Previously, if a step-parent wanted to adopt, both the child's parent and the step-parent had to apply to adopt and the parent became an adoptive parent.  Under this Bill, the parent will continue to be a parent and the step-parent will become an adoptive parent.  <\/p><p>Section 45 of the Adoption Act 2010 provides that where a child's adoptive parents have died, a further adoption order may be made in respect of the child and that for the purposes of the order, the child should be taken to be the lawful of the deceased adoptive parents.  I welcome the fact that this Bill amends section 45 of the Adoption Act 2010 to provide for that.  <\/p><p>Most importantly, in respect of the best interests and voice of the child, the Adoption (Amendment) Bill amends section 19 of the Adoption Act 2010 to reflect the Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution regarding the best interests of the child.  In determining what is in the best interests of the child, the authority or the court shall have regard to all of the factors or circumstances it considers relevant to the child who is the subject matter of an application or proceedings concerned.  These include the child's age and maturity; the physical, psychological and emotional needs of the child; the likely effect of adoption on the child; the child's views on their proposed adoption; the child's social, intellectual and educational needs; the child's upbringing and care and relationship with their parents; and any other circumstances pertaining to the child.  Regarding the voice of the child, the court or authority will guarantee that informed views are expressed.  We must ensure that children are provided with clear explanations and information about adoption covering each individual stage of the adoption process. <\/p><p>The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 is intended to facilitate access to adoption information and provide a statutory basis for the provision of information related to past and future adoptions.  It will provide clarity around the information that can be provided and the circumstances in which it can be provided.  This provision is long overdue.  We must learn from the pitfalls of a closed adoption process that has long operated in Ireland and has posed countless problems for adopted people when gathering information about their origins.  <\/p><p>Is the Minister considering implementing a resourcing plan for this legislation given that the number of adoptions that go through the Adoption Authority could dramatically increase?  The Bill has further resource implications for Tusla.  As such, additional staff will be required to ensure all parties receive the best support possible.  Are those extra resources available?  This Bill provides that adoption now becomes a real option for some children in long-term care.  As such, it is imperative that judges are trained.  I feel passionate about this because I have spent time in family law courts.  As is always the way in a legal case, one is in the hands of the judge before which one appears.  If we are going to have more cases like that before the courts, it is important that training be provided because the decision is lifelong.  <\/p><p>From a practice perspective, there is an additional requirement of adoption and post-adoption services for both sets of parents such as advice and counselling as well as for the children and young people involved.  I commend the Minister and her Department for their work on the Bill.  The Minister's passion for the area is clear.  I support the Bill and commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#HH00300","speaker":"1406","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I am very pleased to support this progressive Bill.  As has been outlined by Sinn F&eacute;in in the D&aacute;il, it legislates for what is in the best interest of the child and modernises a system that previously held archaic and restrictive barriers.  It is the view of Sinn F&eacute;in that any adoption system must embrace a more modern and progressive view of the family.  Throughout the State's history with regard to adoption, the moral diktat of the church-State relationship endeavoured to protect the nuclear family model.  Non-traditional families were not appreciated or considered and were met by stigmatisation.  This was, as we know, was institutionalised in the Magdalen laundries and mother and baby homes and was State policy even in the Adoption Act 1952, which legally branded children born outside wedlock as \"illegitimate\".  \"Illegitimate\" people were banned from joining the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the State and banned by the church from becoming priests without special papal dispensation.  This clause was only removed in 1987.<\/p> <p>The disparity in application of equal family rights has been to the fore in recent years, not only with the children's rights referendum campaign but also with the civil marriage equality referendum, which highlighted a legal discrimination in terms of guardianship, kinship, succession and shared parental rights.  Not so long ago, same-sex couples were restricted from marrying but also from adopting children as a couple and having full and equal legal protection as a family.  I welcome the amendments to the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 which seek to remedy this.  I also welcome the provision that removes the barriers which require a birth parent to adopt alongside a step-parent who wants to adopt their spouse's child.  Furthermore, the extension of the adoption age from the age of seven to 18 and the removal of criteria that only allowed for adoption in exceptional circumstances have our full support.   <\/p> <p>The extension in powers of the High Court to further grant parental consent in situations where it is required and in the interests of the child strengthens children's rights and family rights. The broadening of the criteria in respect of adoption opens up many avenues to loving families, in whatever shape or form they may take, to have the opportunity to display their ability to look after a child and raise them to become an adult with the love and care they deserve and with their best interests at heart.  This Bill goes a long way to dispelling the notion that a family in Ireland is a nuclear family.  The family in all its function and dysfunction is diverse and takes many forms.  There is no single proposition for the family.  Where the rights and care of the child are paramount, the State should endeavour to support that family, the children and the parents.  The outdated and regressive view of the nuclear family has been destructive to Irish society and the biggest losers in that equation were children.  <\/p> <p>Should the Bill pass, many unnecessary obstacles will still exist for prospective parents, including legal costs.  Those who can adopt are stifled in their care for that child as hefty legal fees must be repaid.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed an amendment to aid foster parents with this cost when it went through the D&aacute;il only for it to be ruled out of order.  I ask the Minister to propose this amendment as it is logical and fair and would greatly improve parental prospects for so many loving people.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I also ask the Minister to make the tabling of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 a top priority of her Department.  I understand the Bill is ready for introduction to the D&aacute;il.  I do not need to emphasise the importance of reuniting relatives but I ask the Minister to consider the great impact it will have on many mothers and children who were separated that would benefit from such a Bill.  For the most part they are elderly and wish to be able to be reunited as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The Bill before us is a follow-up to the children's rights referendum in 2012 on the thirty-first amendment of the Constitution, in which the rights of the child became part of the fabric of society and the Constitution.  The referendum and this legislation require that the best interests of the child be considered paramount.  The Bill must be commended for the vast improvements it makes and I have no doubt numerous children will benefit from the Minister's work along with that of her predecessors.  However, Sinn F&eacute;in has some concerns and I feel there is a bit more to be done.  We will be happy to contribute in that regard.  Overall, Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support the Bill and we encourage the Minister in her efforts.  We reserve the right to propose amendments at later Stages.  I hope the Minister will take our suggestions on board.  I commend the contribution from Senator Boyhan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#JJ00200","speaker":"1372","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Zappone, to the House.  I wish her, her colleagues and all Members present a happy new year, if it is not too late in January to do so.  Like others, I very much welcome the Bill as the changes it introduces are very welcome.  It will bring some aspects of Irish adoption law into the 21st century and will modernise the law in a very welcome way.  Others have spoken very eloquently about the very positive changes the Bill will bring about, particularly in two respects in terms of allowing step-parents to adopt and ending the bizarre anomaly where the birth mother had to give up her child for adoption and re-adopt in order to adopt her own child.  It is very welcome to see step-parent adoption becoming simplified and updated in that way.<\/p><p>I commend Senator Boyhan for his extremely moving personal testimony.  Like others, I was really moved by what he said.  That, in itself, speaks for the necessity of ensuring that it becomes easier for children to be adopted out of long-term foster care.  I must declare some interest as a professional who has represented children and guardians <i>ad litem <\/i>before the child care courts, or the HSE courts as they were typically known.  I have seen at close hand the terrible heartbreak that arises when children are in long-term care with no real prospect of finding a resolution of their status even where they very much desire to be adopted by foster carers who may have been caring for them over a long period.  It is very welcome to see those provisions in the Bill.  Barnardos and others have strongly welcomed those aspects of the Bill.<\/p><p>As Senator Warfield said, in a very welcome development, the Bill also updates the language of adoption and recognises the diversity of family life in this country.  It reflects in particular the changes we saw come about through the Child and Family Relationships Act and the changes brought about by the marriage equality referendum.  The Bill is very much about bringing into law the changes brought about by the children's rights referendum - that other referendum Senator Noone and others mentioned in November 2012.  It is very welcome to see the best interests of the child and the voice of the child brought to the fore in this Bill.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister on her comments, particularly in respect of section 9.  She indicated that she brought forward an amendment in the D&aacute;il to amend section 19 of the 2010 Act to reflect more strongly the need to ensure the voice of the child is heard.  I am pleased she said she will enter into consultation with children prior to drafting the necessary regulations under section 9.  Again, that is very welcome.  When she was Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan conducted a very worthwhile set of consultations directly with children.  That is a good model and I know there are others also.  Those are all very welcome aspects of the Bill.<\/p><p>I wish to turn to an issue raised by my colleagues, Deputies Burton and Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, namely, the absence of provision for the other glaring anomaly in adoption law - the need to ensure legislation on information and tracing.  I know the Minister has moved in that regard.  In November the Minister published the heads of a Bill and there was a hearing before an Oireachtas committee.  However, the issue is long overdue to be tackled.  I dug out from my own records a speech I made in November 2014.  The Minister will recall it because she was in the Seanad at the time.  Our then colleagues, Averil Power, Jillian van Turnhout and Fidelma Healy Eames, brought forward a very commendable and robust information and tracing Bill in November 2014.  It was accepted on Second Stage by the Government.  We all spoke on it.  Many colleagues at the time spoke eloquently about their own personal experiences.  Averil Power spoke about her experience as an adopted person and Fidelma Healy Eames as an adoptive parent.  They spoke so strongly about the need to ensure that adopted children have the right to an identity.<\/p><p>It is something I saw at second hand as a representative of survivors of abuse before the Residential Institutions Redress Board.  We saw adults who had been utterly abandoned as children, failed by the State and horribly abused in institutions.  However, for them, alongside the dreadful physical and emotional abuse they suffered, something that really resonated with them all was their lack of knowledge about their origins and the need to know their identity and where they came from.  That was something Averil Power in particular spoke so eloquently about and Deputy Burton has spoken in the D&aacute;il about her experience as an adopted person.  The right to know one&rsquo;s origin has been recognised by the European Court of Human Rights yet it is currently absent from our law.  While the Bill is extremely welcome and introduces very welcome and overdue aspects to adoption law, we see still a failure to address the issue of information and tracing.  It is an issue the Minister spoke about eloquently when she was a Senator.<\/p><p>There is a problem with our law in terms of this sort of piecemeal reform.  We are bringing adoption law into the 21st century, but only partially in this Bill.  Until we have robust information and tracing legislation we will not have sufficiently or adequately modernised the system.  I accept the point has been made by others here and it has been made in the D&aacute;il but it deserves to be emphasised again.  My colleagues in the D&aacute;il introduced some amendments to seek to introduce into this Bill a scheme that would provide for information and tracing.  In the Minister's Committee Stage response in the D&aacute;il which I read, she said her own Bill is at an advanced stage and she hopes to bring it forward.  However, that is very similar to the response given by the then Minister in November 2014 to the Bill introduced by the then Senators Power, van Turnhout and Healy Eames.  It is important that we keep pressing this issue.  There is a justifiable concern that given the difficulties now under new politics of bringing forward Government legislation &ndash; the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Regina Doherty, has spoken about that in the D&aacute;il &ndash; there is a concern that we will not get to see the information and tracing Bill and that in fact this Bill, which is now at an advanced stage, might well be an appropriate place to introduce the relevant measures.<\/p><p>I understand the difficulty with the drafting of the Bill but many of the difficulties have now been overcome.  People have raised issues about the penal nature of the provisions around people who look for information where there is no consent from the birth mother.  Like other speakers I have had numerous contacts with individuals, both adults who were adopted as children and birth mothers.  One birth mother spoke to me of the anguish and absolute heartbreak of the mothers who gifted their children to adoption &ndash; an anguish that might be a shock for many who still do not realise that this was such an appalling heartbreak for so many women at the time.  Women were often coerced or felt utterly pressured into giving children up for adoption at a time in society when, shamefully, single parents and children born outside marriage were maltreated.  Senator Warfield addressed the issue.  It must be said that this country has a shameful history both in terms of the development of our adoption law and of the treatment of women and children.  The Minister has spoken eloquently and done so much in her own work to address the issue but, again, it is the context in which we bring forward the Bill and in which the debate is held.  It emphasises the need to ensure that we have some provision in the law to provide for information and tracing rights, as a matter of urgency.  We must also be very conscious that there have been much fewer intra-country adoptions that are non-familial in this State since the very welcome introduction of the single parent allowance.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In reality, there is only a small number of people of, it must be said, increasing age who this is likely to affect, namely, mothers who gave children up for adoption at a time when they did not wish information about their identities to be disclosed.  Their adult children are now also of advanced age.  Some of the concerns around sensitivities and so on might now be more easily addressed given the simple lapse of time and the changed context in which adoptions are now taking place.  Much more frequently, we are seeing international adoptions from outside the jurisdiction or intra-family adoptions such as step-parent adoptions which will be facilitated by this Bill.  That is long way to say I hope very much that the Minister will feel able to take the information and tracing amendments I will put forward on Committee Stage.  If she cannot, I hope very much that she will introduce her own Bill as a matter of urgency.  I would like us to debate it here first in the Seanad.  Let us introduce it here in the Seanad where we have less difficulty, albeit the deputy Leader may correct me, in getting Government legislation through than the current D&aacute;il does.  Certainly, there are many Bills which have lately been started in the Seanad and it would be very helpful to enable us to have a debate here.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill and quote Tanya Ward from the Children's Rights Alliance who said: \"The Bill does bring adoption law in Ireland into the 21st century.\"  In some very welcome respects that is true but we still need to see the other legislation brought forward as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#KK00200","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I pay tribute to all the Senators who have contributed on the matter, in particular Senator Boyhan.  It is something he obviously feels very strongly about.  I welcome the legislation which is very comprehensive and long overdue.  In the referendum, we amended the Constitution, Article 42A of which now provides for this Bill.  It is important to progress the Bill at the earliest possible date and that we cover all the angles.  Sometimes, legislation is found not to cover everything.  The Minister raised the issue of a person who is over 18 and I have come across that scenario in a court matter where an adoption was not processed and that is causing its own problems.  It is a matter that obviously has to be dealt with at some stage.<\/p> <p>When one is involved in the legal profession and in politics, one comes across some very complex cases.  People tend to come to one because one is involved in politics thinking one has a magic wand even though it is a very complex legal problem.  One issue that has arisen is where incorrect information is provided when a child is delivered.  I have come across that situation and it is a problem that is going to get more complex as one has different nationalities in the country and not all the information the maternity services receive may be correct.  I am not sure whether it is covered by legislation as regards trying to find information.  I remember being in the High Court where we could not identify either the mother or the father, not because the child was not delivered in a maternity hospital but because incorrect information was supplied.  There was a complication in that if an application to register a birth is not made within 12 months, an application must be made in court, which is complex, particularly if incorrect information is provided.  I raise this issue because it may be relevant later in trying to deal with adoptions.  I ask whether our maternity hospitals have sufficient procedures in place regarding the identification of those who are attending.  It is an issue I have come across and while it might be going slightly away from the issue before us, it is one I had to deal with.  It was complex and trying to ascertain information at a later stage was extremely difficult.<\/p> <p>The legislation is long overdue and it is important.  When children are in foster care, that insecurity still exists even though I know foster parents are providing the best possible care for them.  However, that insecurity exists and it would be useful if a child could be adopted rather than to stay in foster care for the rest of his or her life.  It is difficult when one comes across someone, as I did recently, who was in foster care from the age of seven but then found the natural parent had died, knew of the person's existence and yet had completely excluded the person from receiving anything at all from the estate.  It is very difficult to try to explain that to a foster child.  Even though the child was very well cared for in foster care, there was no opportunity to be adopted.  If the legislation had been in place, the person would have been adopted.  As such, the Bill is extremely important for everyone.<\/p> <p>The Minister outlined the provisions of the Bill very well.  My colleagues have gone through a lot of the sections, but the issue Senator Bacik and others have raised about tracing parents is an important one and we should prioritise it.  I agree with Senator Bacik that we should try to introduce legislation in that regard in this House and move it on.  We have already talked about the time that has passed since the referendum on this matter.  Hopefully, we will not have to wait the same length of time again regarding traceability.  I urge the Minister to bring forward legislation in that regard as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#LL00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and acknowledge her sterling role in preserving it as part of the Democracy Matters campaign before she became a Minister.  I thank her for being one of the leaders of the small group of people who stood up for the Seanad at the time.  I was struck at the time by the fact that referenda generally can never be regarded as foregone conclusions.  The children's referendum was a case in point.  I do not know what exact percentage of the population voted \"No\" but it was of the order of 30% to 40%.  It was not a foregone conclusion that it would be passed, therefore, even though there was no political party of which I was aware which actually togged out against it and no organised opposition to it.  It is in that context that I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Boyhan, for his very moving and sensible speech on why this legislation is needed.  He gave a very personal description of the plight of children who were marooned by the law, the Constitution and the institutions of our State.  He emphasised the fact that in the end what children need is love, care, nourishment and affection from parents or a parent or whatever to have any chance of functioning as fully developed and emotionally mature members of our society.<\/p> <p>One thing Senator Boyhan mentioned that struck a chord with me was that in the last few days he has received correspondence from people saying that the legislation is dangerous; that it strikes at the constitutional status of parenthood and damages and undermines the family as an institution.  I want to make one contribution on that issue.  It is funny that the minority of hardline Catholics who put pen to paper to write to Senator Boyhan and who write articles in the hardline Catholic newspapers do not seem to have any sense of conscience at all about the fact that it was the same hardline opinions that drove girls into Magdalen convents and parents into expelling their pregnant daughters from their houses and the like.  I received a letter from the author of a small history of the Archdiocese of Tuam on an interesting exchange between my grandfather, Eoin MacNeill, and the Archbishop of Tuam in the wake of the Black and Tans burning down the town as a reprisal.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=24\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When I read through the rest of his book, which is wonderful, I discovered that in the 1920s and 1930s a diocesan synod had been held in Tuam every year and that the then archbishop had laid down very clearly that if there was an extra-marital pregnancy which was known to members of the clergy in any part of the archdiocese, the fact was to be dealt with firmly from the altar in front of the whole community, albeit without mentioning the identity of the girl in question.  This was part of the social pressure which was brought to bear on families to turn on the most vulnerable member of the family unit in the most vulnerable period of her life, to expel her or to end the scandal of the pregnancy by sweeping it under the carpet.  <br\/><br\/>On another occasion I remember the late former Deputy Peadar Clohessy, a wonderful gentleman, telling me about a particular instance in his part of the woods in rural County Limerick in which a farmer had got a girl into trouble.  The farmer survived but the girl did not.  She was sent to a laundry in Limerick  She tried to escape, but garda&iacute; found her and brought her back to the laundry, even though she was over 18 years of age.  <br\/><br\/>The people who write harsh letters saying the approach adopted in this Bill which is child centred is an attack on the family, in effect, belong to the same morally conformist tradition that supported bishops when they took a hard line against extra-marital pregnancies.  They display an atavistic &quot;let us get back to the good old times&quot; attitude which seeks to forget about all of the progress made in the Catholic Church and among Christians generally.  There is one Catholic newspaper, published fortnightly, which yearns for a return to pre-Conciliar religion in Ireland, the good old religion.  The people who write such letters and read such newspapers are the ones who write letters to Senator Victor Boyhan to tell him that he is getting it wrong, that this legislation is wrong and subversive of some moral order and the family as a moral institution in society.  I wonder if, on occasion, any of them ever looks in a mirror and asks himself or herself if he or she is speaking from the same pulpit as those who decried unmarried mothers in the Tuam diocese and forced them out of their community or from a Christian, loving perspective.  I often think they confuse moral conformity, moral order and the notion that the family is a moral institution with the idea that at the heart of that institution - I do not like calling a family an institution - however it is structured, whether it be a one-parent or a two-parent family of whatever age or gender, is the glue of love.  If the price of maintaining the family is the exiling from love of children in the circumstances described by Senator Victor Boyhan, one must wonder what schizoid mentality can object to the Bill, on the one hand, and, on the other, preach religion and a moral view of life.  <br\/><br\/>I see no threat in this legislation to the moral order in Ireland.  The constitutional amendment is absolutely balanced.  Some might argue that it is overly balanced as to exclude the possibility of damaging a family which is operating and functioning as such.  I see no moral danger to Irish society and no threat to the moral structures of Irish society or the moral beliefs of Irish people in the legislation.  It is good that on this occasion, having passed the constitutional amendment, the legislation, with some stutters, has come into being fairly rapidly thereafter.  Its critics should not be worried by it.  If their criticism comes from some <i>a priori<\/i>religious commitment to the family as an inviolable structure to which the legislation is counterpoised as a danger, it is their view that is wrong and Senator Victor Boyhan's view and that of the Minister and, I presume, the great majority of Members of this House that is right.  I commend the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House and congratulate on for doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017012400002#LL00300","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485268200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and wish her a happy new year.

As a society, we had decided that children would have one chance and one chance only.  I do not think anybody would agree with this from a moral point of view.  Equally, the idea that two people in a loving and lasting relationship, one of whom was the parent of a child, would have to give up that child in order to have him or her adopted by both parents was ludicrous and such issues needed to be addressed urgently.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Bill and will not speak at length on it.

It was a privilege to be the Minister to listen to it.   As Senator McDowell stated, it was common sense and profound as well as pragmatic and practical with regard to identifying various ways in which we can offer care for the child through fostering, adoption and good State care.  Out of this, perhaps the Bill will enable a better way of children having the opportunity to go down whatever path is appropriate and good for them.<\/p><p>Senator Noone acknowledged how important the Bill is and that it treats all children equally regardless of the marital status of their parents.  This is critical, and why it is so important for me that the Bill has this aspect.  She also drew on her experience as a practitioner and raised the question of resourcing the legislation, particularly the plans to implement it with regard to Tusla.  This is something I very much had in mind in my negotiations with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, on the budget.  I hope Tusla is able to set aside the appropriate resources required.<\/p><p>It was great to hear Senator Warfield reflect in another profound contribution that this is a progressive Bill contributing towards the ongoing dispelling of the myth of the nuclear family, which perhaps one could say is part of the overall, and is one way of interpreting the institution that Senator McDowell spoke about and which various bodies in society may still wish to promote.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik stated the Bill brings some of the aspects into the 21st century and I thank her for her compliments on various aspects of the Bill.  She mentioned how long overdue it is and, as she always does, she welcomed significant aspects of the legislation.

He identified two issues which are integral to the Bill and long overdue.<\/p> <p>Senator Burke mentioned he came across a case regarding a child who is over 18 and I will ask him about this.  His points on incorrect information about a child are important.<\/p> <p>To answer some of the practical issues raised, we will bring forward the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill shortly and it is appropriate that it should start here.  It will help us to do the best job we can before we get it to the D&aacute;il.  The way Senator McDowell complimented his colleague in his reflection brought together much of what is underneath those comments, if not explicitly referred to, and causes me to ask the question what are the values that underlie what we are doing in the Bill.  Earlier in the session Senator Boyhan stated where there is love, children will be cherished.  The religious body and institutional organisation to which Senator McDowell referred, as he knows well, at least on its best days, draws on its greatest aspects of tradition, that what used to be called a revelation but is the profound insight, that God is love.  I hope the Bill can contribute towards ensuring more children have the opportunity to be cherished by the love of a family, even in the diversity we acknowledge exists now, and this is part of why Senator Boyhan is getting some of the responses.  Much of it has to do with resistance.  We need to have a diversity of families.  We have moved in this direction to ensure we have more opportunities where children are loved and cherished.  I note and acknowledge the contribution of Senator McDowell, which reminded us of this.  For us to have the child-centredness the Bill represents, we absolutely require the diversity of family which so many of us have struggled to bring into being.
