As the Chair mentioned, joining me today are Dr. Martina Lawless, Mr. Michael Tutty, Mr. Sebastian Barnes and Dr. &Iacute;de Kearney.  Members of the council secretariat are also present, namely, Mr. Eddie Casey, our chief economist and head of the secretariat, Ms Kate Ivory and Mr. Niall Conroy.  The council&rsquo;s work is enriched by its interactions with the committee and we continue to value these engagements.  We hope we can continue to interact meaningfully with elected representatives and I also wish to acknowledge the ongoing interaction between the secretariat and Oireachtas staff in support of these meetings.<\/p> <p>  The council published its 14th fiscal assessment report on 5 June.  The report covers all aspects of the council&rsquo;s mandate, as set out in the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 and the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2013, including assessing the Government&rsquo;s fiscal stance, assessing the Government&rsquo;s budgetary and macroeconomic forecasts, including the endorsement function, and monitoring compliance with Irish and EU fiscal rules.  The council notes that the Irish economy has experienced a rapid cyclical recovery since at least 2014, which is continuing at a strong pace.  Estimates suggest that the economy is producing close to its potential in 2018 and will move beyond it next year and thereafter.  In the near term, burgeoning pressures in the housing sector could yield a sharper than expected recovery in housing construction.  Although the immediate outlook is favourable, negative shocks will inevitably occur in future.  There are clear downside risks over the medium term, including Brexit, US trade policy and the international tax environment to name but a few.  Recognising this, the council notes a current window of opportunity that should be used to return debt to safer levels and make the economy more resilient to shocks.  Ireland&rsquo;s debt burden is still among the highest in the OECD and the burden is understated by standard gross domestic product, GDP, comparisons.<\/p> <p>  The council observes that improvements on the budgetary front have stalled since 2015 despite the strong cyclical recovery reinforced by a number of favourable tailwinds.  Although the economy has experienced a strong recovery, that has not translated into any notable improvement in the underlying budget balance, taking into account improvements driven by the cycle.  Non-interest spending has risen at essentially the same pace as buoyant cyclical tax revenue since 2015.  Allowing for the estimated effects of the cycle, the structural position appears to have deteriorated since 2015.<\/p> <p>  It is in that context that the council welcomes the fiscal stance adopted by the Government in the stability programme update, SPU, 2018, but the council notes that the Government should at least stick to its existing budgetary plans for 2019.  The council assesses that there is no case for additional fiscal stimulus in 2019 beyond those plans and that anything more expansionary is not likely to be appropriate.  In its assessment, the council defines an appropriate policy for next year as one in which spending is increased in line with the sustainable long-term growth rate of the economy.  That would imply an approximate limit for spending increases or tax cuts of up to &euro;3.5 billion, that is, the gross fiscal space, as the starting point for any budgetary plans for 2019.  The calculation is based on forecast price inflation and potential growth rate estimates for the economy.<\/p> <p>  The council considers a number of estimates of medium-term potential output growth, namely, the Department&rsquo;s preferred estimates of real potential output growth, which average close to 3% per annum over the forecast period 2019-21, the council&rsquo;s own estimates of 3.25% and recent estimates produced by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, of approximately 3.3%.  Allowing for inflation, which is forecast to be a little over 1% for 2019, this implies a growth rate of up to 4.5%.  Applying this to an adjusted measure of expenditure - the corrected expenditure aggregate in the expenditure benchmark - implies a nominal limit of up to &euro;3.5 billion.  The cost of previously announced measures, including sharp increases in public investment, means that the Government&rsquo;s scope for new initiatives in budget 2019 will be limited.  Departmental estimates provided to this committee note that spending pre-commitments of &euro;2.6 billion already have been made for 2019.  That is not necessarily the correct estimate to compare against the approximate limit of up to &euro;3.5 billion but it highlights that there is limited scope in the next budget.<\/p> <p>  A point that is often missed is that the objective of the rules is to ensure overall sustainability, not to prevent government spending.  Tax policies that increase revenue in a sustainable manner, that is, in a way that can be expected to last over the long run, allow a government to grow spending at a faster pace than the initial limits set by the rules.  Similarly, real efficiency gains in public spending that can be sustained allow a government to provide more services.<\/p> <p>  It would be desirable for the Government to improve the budget balance by more than planned, especially given the risks of overheating and the opportunity provided by favourable times.  Unexpected increases in tax revenues or lower interest costs should not be used to fund further budgetary measures, as has happened in recent years.  The window of opportunity should be used to return debt to safer levels and to make the economy and public finances more resilient to shocks.  Revenues arising from a faster than expected recovery in housing construction should be used to build buffers either through additional contributions to the rainy day fund or through faster debt reduction.  Moreover, spending should not be allowed to continue to drift up as unexpected and likely cyclical or transitory revenues arise.<\/p> <p>  Looking forward, the council assesses that the Government needs a credible plan for the medium term.  As we show in our report, relying solely on the fiscal rules would not have guaranteed sustainability in the public finances during the 2000s and is not likely to fully mitigate future crises.  Focusing on the right budgetary stance and being prepared to be more cautious than the fiscal rules allow is the correct approach for the Government to follow.  However, there are a number of challenges and no scope for complacency.  There is a danger that the current policy framework is insufficiently equipped to prevent a return to pro-cyclical fiscal policy.  Sensible policy tools such as the rainy day fund and a medium-term debt target, which were set up to help with medium-term budgeting, are only half-formed and need more development if they are to be effective.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of solutions which should be pursued.  The Government should make an explicit commitment to adhere to what it sees as a sensible medium-term path for spending growth net of tax measures.  This could be operationalised on the basis of, at a minimum, following the spending rule, also known as the expenditure benchmark, even when that is not formally required.  This should be informed by the Department&rsquo;s own medium-term estimates of potential output growth and of the natural rate of unemployment.<\/p> <p>  The proposed design of the rainy day fund should be strengthened.  The rainy day fund should be foremost a truly countercyclical fund, one that dampens swings in the cycle and alleviates pro-cyclicality in the rules rather than just allocating fixed contributions regardless of that.  A recent IFAC working paper outlines how relatively modest changes in the fiscal rules would help to achieve this.<\/p> <p>  The Government&rsquo;s forecast horizon should return to five years ahead.  The shortening of the horizon in the most recent projections from five to three years ahead is not compatible with the aim of achieving medium-term fiscal stability.  For context, budget 2016, released in October 2015, was forecasting as far ahead as 2021, which is the same endpoint as that of current plans.<\/p><p>This risks complacency seeping into medium-term planning and future publications should extend the horizon back to a five-year-ahead basis.<\/p><p> The Government's medium-term debt target, which aims for a debt level of 55% of GDP over an unspecified timeframe, would be better specified if it were clearly time bound, set against a more appropriate denominator than GDP, set as a ceiling rather than as a target, committed to in a credible manner and actually set at a low or prudent level.<\/p><p> An important area in which the Department has made progress, which the council welcomes, is its publication of alternative estimates of the output gap.  Understanding the economic cycle is an essential part of assessing the appropriate fiscal stance.  It can help us to understand whether current levels of tax receipts or unemployment benefits are temporarily high or low compared with when the economy is in a steady state.  A failure to do so can mean that deteriorations in the underlying budgetary position are not adequately recognised and another painful correction of the public finances might ultimately be required.  The economy's potential growth rate is also a critical determinant of how fast taxes will sustainably grow and how sustainable levels of spending and the public debt burden will prove to be.  The council believes these alternative measures should feature more prominently in future departmental publications and future endorsements.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for again providing us with the opportunity to attend today.  We look forward to taking questions and hearing the views of members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I will have to leave after I ask my questions as I have a meeting with a Minister to attend.

We would see it working not by putting in a fixed amount every year for a few years and then stopping.  Instead, we would base it on growing our expenditure in line with the long-term growth in the economy, while any more space beyond that would be put into the rainy day fund.<\/p> <p>  We should also be looking for mechanisms which will allow the fund to be used in a way that will be in line with the fiscal rules.

We would certainly prefer to see a rainy day fund, even on the Minister's basis, than no such fund.

We focused on those companies that are also large payers of corporation tax.  There are foreign companies in Ireland, say, in the retail sector serving the domestic economy, which would have a much larger impact on employment if they left.  The exit of one of those is likely to be followed by a replacement.  We will need the domestic retail sector to continue to be serviced.  However, in the FDI sector there is a possibility for a company to leave and simply not be replaced at all.  We wanted to assess what would happen if a sample company within that group were to leave.<\/p><p>The biggest relative impact would be on corporation tax, given the large payments made by a small group of companies.  There would also be an impact on earnings and employment in the economy.  Perhaps 4% of corporation tax receipts would leave the country if such a company was to leave, whereas the impact on employment would be approximately 0.1%, representing a much smaller overall impact.  <\/p><p> In terms of mitigation, we have warned in previous reports that corporation tax receipts are at an elevated level and have almost doubled in the past number of years, particularly in 2015 when it increased by two thirds.  Receipts from corporation tax are now close to record levels in terms of contribution to the Exchequer.  We feel the economy is going through a strong upward recovery, but public finances have been benefitting from tailwinds, whether through additional corporation tax receipts or lower debt interest costs.  These are all contributing to a strong position at present.  However, we are warning that we cannot expect that to continue indefinitely.  We could face a downturn in the economy for a variety of reasons, or we might experience losses of either revenue or employment in the foreign direct investment, FDI, sector.  While the economy is performing strongly now, we should not commit all those resources to permanent increases in spending or tax cuts when we may need to use them in future to offset the impact of some of these potential problems.  We should keep some of the benefits in reserve while we are getting them.  We would like to have fiscal capacity to deal with an inevitable downturn, whether in the domestic economy or in the international FDI sector.<\/p><p> The issue with many of the risks we are raising is that the policy advice is the same - some of the resources should be kept in reserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#C01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>The risk matrix diagram on page 54 refers to the housing supply pressures.

The risk we are talking about is primarily that this individual sector is likely to grow strongly - and there are many arguments in favour of such growth - but that it should not distort the overall balance of the economy in the way it did leading up to 2007, where the economy became concentrated and tax revenues became concentrated in revenues from a single sector.  Increased activity in the housing sector, once it picks up - we are not saying that it should not pick up - should be counterbalanced by a dampening down in other sectors in the economy.<\/p> <p>  With regard to immediate risks to competitiveness in the absence of an increase in housing supply, if increases in housing costs, both in house prices and in the rental sector, continue, there will be risks to the overall competitiveness of the economy in that these might feed into price pressures and wage pressures.  We have not seen much evidence of wage pressures in the economy, but there is a risk that continued increases in the cost of housing will feed into wage demands and a loss of broader competitiveness.  All of this can further reinforce the social argument for increasing housing activity and the building up of housing supply.  I emphasise that increasing housing supply and the extra activity taking place in that sector should be offset a little bit by dampening down activity in other sectors.  A previous estimate a number of years ago by the ESRI suggested that an increase of approximately 10,000 housing units generally added 1% to GDP growth.  That gives a sense of the scale of how increased activity in the housing sector will feed into overall economic activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Lawless"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528894800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>We have endorsed the macroeconomic forecast from the Department of Finance which shows reasonably strong growth over the medium term, including growth this year of more than 5.5% and between 3.5% and 4% over coming years.

Housing output could rise by more than 4,000 units.  That estimate is reasonably modest and, as Dr. Lawless has said, an issue with housing output is that it is a labour intensive sector, which might lead to distortions in the allocations of resources in the economy.  Given current forecasts, with the unemployment rate dropping down near to 5%, if there is a large increase in housing output, where will the workers come from?  Will they come from other sectors within the economy, which might lead to wage pressures and competition between sectors, or will they be brought in from abroad as we have done previously?<\/p> <p>  We would like an increase in housing output from the point of view of the competitive concerns that Dr. Lawless raised, but the issue is how we fit that activity, in a sustainable way, into an economy that is operating close to its potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.

These have now translated into problems with gross national product, and the CSO has tried to step aside some of these issues with its modified measures of national income.  When it comes to EU contributions, they are still based on official measures as set out in the internationally agreed standards.

Would it be beyond our capacity, or would it be outside of the European rules, for example, to find a way to put it into social rented or social purchased housing whereby there would be an absolute calculated rate of return, on the low side probably because it would be through rents and interest payments on socially affordable mortgages?  Going back to the demographics, the rent increases, particularly in the areas I represent, are not sustainable.

To me, where we should gear ourselves up and where we should invest is dependent on where those risks are most likely to come.  There is no doubt about demand for property and housing.  We have a demand and we have got to meet that demand, and there is no two ways about it.  Is Mr. Coffey worried about another speculative property bubble here and the fact that we are actually repeating the madness of the previous downturn, which largely resulted from property speculation?  What is actually happening is that there is an awful lot of speculation and not lot of building.  That is a recipe for a repeat of the previous circumstances, particularly when one considers that the level of demand is objectively big but that, in effective terms, it is weak.

I am not sure about the final one regarding whether a speculative property bubble is on the horizon.  In the context of where we are in the economic cycle, most indications point to the economy being close to its potential.  The unemployment rate is falling towards 6% and is set to fall just below it and the recovery we have seen in recent years is something that happened back in the early 2000s.  People who look at the Irish economy, which had grown strongly in the 1990s when the unemployment rate had fallen, asked what was in store for the Celtic tiger in 2001 and 2002.  The suggestion at the time was that we would return to our long-run potential growth rate of 3% or 3.5%, that we would not see an imbalance one way or the other, and that it was something the economy could maintain as the population grew, as we had moderate inward investment and as credit expanded at a moderate pace.<\/p><p>Of course, what we know is that the economy did not return to growth rates of 3% to 3.5%.  It stayed at 6% to 7% to 8% right through to the end of 2007.  That was achieved by two means - first, by large inward migration that facilitated that increase in output and, second, much of that increase was funded by credit expansion.  While the forecasts seemed reasonable at the time, what could not have been, and was not, foreseen was the huge increase in credit and the huge inward migration which allowed the economy to grow above its potential for a period of time.  It could not go on forever.  If something cannot go on forever it will stop, and it stopped in 2008.  We are in a somewhat similar position now.  The economy has grown strongly for a number of years, the unemployment rate has fallen and most forecasts are that the economy will grow between 3% to 3.5% over the medium term.  That is what the Department of Finance is forecasting, and that is what we have endorsed.  Overheating is a potential risk but it may not happen.  If the growth rates stay at 3% to 3.5%, the economy can sustainably do that for period of time.  The thing is the Irish economy does not do moderation.  We have looked at it over a 60 year period.  If one takes that 3% to 3.5% as one's middle point and if one reduces it down to 2% and increases it to 5%, and says that that is within the ballpark, over a 60 year period, the Irish economy is within that range of 2% to 5% less than a third of the time.  It has either been growing much more quickly than 5% or lower than 2%.  While the central forecast is for nice moderate growth of 3.5% and for an economy that is in a stable position, that is not something that tends to happen very regularly in the Irish economy.<\/p><p> The issue is about the direction in which it will go.  In the near term, we see some potential upside risk, as has been stated with housing.  As one moves out into the medium term, there are more negative risks that could lead to a downturn.  How much of a buffer would one need to deal with some of those?  The buffer does not need to be huge.  The impact of the previous crisis was quite large.  One simply wants to avoid getting into a position where one has to have forced austerity at a time when one's economy needs to be stimulated.  The average increase in budget deficits around the euro area in 2008 was six percentage points of GDP.  The issue was that overall budget deficits across the euro area were either in a small deficit or close to balance.  One went from being in a balanced position all the way down to an annual deficit of minus 6% of GDP.  One simply cannot keep borrowing 6% of GDP, particularly when growth is anaemic, which in a sense led to the debt crisis, as debts ballooned.<\/p><p> The buffer itself does not have to be very large.  If one had a one or two percentage points of a GDP surplus in the other direction, then one is only dropping, when the crisis comes, to 3% or 4%.  We know that the EU rules have what might be considered an arbitrary point of three percentage points of GDP for the annual deficit limit.  However, if one is just one or two percentage points in terms of running a surplus, one has sufficient space to deal with a reasonably-sized downturn.  With a downturn like we had in 2008, it is hard to know what buffer would have been appropriate to deal with that.  It does not have to be very large.  What one is doing is giving oneself the capacity to absorb whatever downturn is coming, in that one is not adding to the problems by having to cut back spending.  Just even cutting back spending growth can lead to problems.<\/p><p> If we believe the economy is growing at 5% or 6% and we are growing spending at 3.5%, that in itself is countercyclical.  Where the economy is growing faster, government spending in real terms is growing at a lower rate.  If we hit a downturn, and the economy slows to 1% or 2%, and if we keep spending growing at 3.5%, that is an injection.  That again is countercyclical.  The economy has slowed down but spending is now above it.  If we have this stable and steady increase in spending, to which Mr. Tutty referred, that can offer that countercyclical buffer that we are looking for.<\/p><p> Where will the downturn come from?  It does not matter where it comes from.  By and large, the impact of many of the risks we have identified will be the same.  This will be a reduction in economic activity, whether it is as a result of Brexit, trade with our nearest neighbour, US trade policy, trade with one of our largest trading partners or the international tax environment and our key policy plank of attracting foreign direct investment.  If one or all of them hit us, the impact would, by and large, be the same.  I do not think it necessarily matters which one affects us, as long as we identify there are potential risks out there.  Using the Mr. Donald Rumsfeld quotation, there are things there that we might not be seeing there at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#E01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy have a supplementary question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#F00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>In a way Mr. Coffey has hit the nail on the head.

It has built up significant cash reserves at the historically low interest rates to put itself in a position to deal with those redemptions as they fall due over the next couple of years.  I think there is close to &euro;20 billion available, with further debt offerings planned for this year.  After 2021 there will be a bit of a gap until 2023 or 2024, before the next bonds roll around again.  Even if there are interest rate increases, there is no doubt that the debt we have will be refinanced at lower rates.

It is more than &euro;8 billion and projected to hit &euro;10 billion by the, albeit shortened, forecast horizon of 2021.  It has moved in the reverse direction to interest.

I have not seen the report published today, but I think it is something we have identified as being a potential issue, that is, the volatility which has been referred to and the dependence on a small number of firms, with the top ten accounting for 40%.  Within that top ten, there is significant volatility and change in the amounts being paid.  To go back to an earlier point about things not being mutually exclusive, I think we can focus on the indigenous economy and also have a foreign direct investment, FDI, strategy.  It is not one or the other.  Our key point on corporation tax is to avoid building up and building in permanent increases in spending and permanent reduction in tax revenue on the basis that these revenues will be here forever.  I do not think that would be an appropriate approach for fiscal policy to take.<\/p> <p>  We have seen various proposals for how some corporation tax can or could be set aside.  Some of those might have been worth following through but over the last number of years, as the corporation tax has increased, much of it has been used to fund budgetary measures.

An economy growing strongly, surging corporation tax and falling interest costs are not feeding through into improvements in the public balance.  These benefits are being used.

It was said that because of the potential overheating of the economy, particularly as we ramp up housing, which we have to do, we need to look at other sectors or investment areas that we might scale back to avoid overheating.  I do not know how deeply the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council goes into specific projects, but I can suggest one project that might be a perfect candidate for such a contraction.  I refer to the motorway programme, where at the moment we are spending massively on upgrading the N11, the N2, the N3 and the N7, all on the approach to Dublin.  This will add to our traffic problems.  There will be more cars coming into a city where we are taking people's front gardens away because there are so many cars coming in.

It would be a win-win-win situation.  They would not have to drive from the far reaches of the N2, N3, N7, N11 and so on.  I do not know if the witnesses have any comment on that.  It would be a perfect counterbalancing, defeating the construction sector to allow us to build housing.<\/p> <p>  On that same issue, I was very taken with what a witness said about the interesting statistic that for every 10,000 units there is gross domestic product, GDP, growth of roughly 1%.  Again, we are discussing the details of economic strategy.  It seems to me that one of the key initiatives we are examining at the moment is the use of the cost-rental model for housing construction and public housing ownership.  It has a fantastic advantage in my mind in that I believe it could be done off-balance sheet, as it is done in other European countries.  It is the perfect counter-cyclical tool, because it is very much long-term investment, particularly over time, as an asset base is built up.  It creates a revenue stream and public housing construction which is not dependent on the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment of the day handing out a big wad of cash, which is the worst form of matching long-term investment requirements with long-term financing.<\/p> <p>  It makes sense to borrow for housing.  Cost-rental is the perfect public borrowing, and indeed housing association and local authority mechanism.  We are doing none of it.  I think we have got 50 houses in Enniskerry, but nothing compared to where we should be.  I do not know if the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is concerned with these matters.  We should change the nature of the housing scheme so that we avoid this boom-bust housing model.  When the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment does not have the cash he cannot build it and therefore there is an accentuation of the cyclical nature of the Irish economy, where housing contracts rapidly in bad times and then expands massively in boom times.  Cost-rental irons that out.  Do the witnesses think that would be a good economic response?  I will leave it at that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#G00700","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528894800,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I will take the Deputy's first point on the rainy day fund.  I am delighted that he thinks it is a great idea.  I do too, but it depends on how it is designed.  One thing that we noticed recently when we did a lot of work on Ireland's cycle and its output gap was that it actually looked almost exactly the same as the pattern we have seen in investment spending as a share of GDP.  During bad times it has crashed really heavily, in line with the overall economy crashing, and in good times it has risen to heights that have also been aligned with the economic cycle.  That pro-cyclical pattern in investment spending by Government is a really terrible thing.  There is good international research showing that construction companies find it very difficult to plan ahead on the basis of having projects for a long time-frame if they are taking on Government contracts.  It means that long-term productivity in that sector is impaired.<\/p><p>When we need to get projects off the ground, many of those businesses are not ready to do the project work we might desire.  Deputy Ryan mentioned motorway projects.  We are agnostic as to the types of projects but if we continue those at a steady pace and ignore the heights and troughs of the cycle, we should be better equipped to provide them as the need arises.

Our mandate relates to the fiscal side of things and not necessarily on the appropriate model for the provision of housing in Ireland.  However, we have looked at some of the changes that have happened and rather than seeing increased housing provision moving what we might call off balance sheet, with the reclassification of the approved housing bodies we have seen more of it come within the general Government sector, primarily because they are almost entirely funded from Government sources, whether they are capital projects with grants from local authorities or borrowing through the Housing Finance Agency.  Their current receipts for providing the properties come from the availability payments they get from local authorities, which top up the rent they receive to 90% of the market.<\/p> <p>  We compare it to other countries in terms of where their capital spending on public housing appears and if it shows up in their general government accounts, and it does not.  It is clear, therefore, that there is a different model out there and one of those might be cost rental housing where non-profit agencies charge possibly controlled rents but rents based on the cost.  In that way they do not have to be fully funded from Government sources and more of their income is coming through the rent they are charging the tenants rather than on subsidies coming through the Government sector that have been on balance sheet.  The current moves in Ireland are the opposite of what the Deputy is suggesting.  More activity is coming on balance sheet and it would require a change in the approach to have it move in the direction he suggests but that is possibly a question for the Housing Finance Agency, which deals with many of the approved housing bodies.  A change in the way the rental situation is addressed might move it in that direction but, unfortunately from the Deputy's perspective, the move is in the other direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I am new to this committee so I will start by asking a general question on fiscal advisory councils, which are relatively new in the process since 2011.

Unlike Deputy Ryan and Deputy Burton, I was not at the centre of the economic crash but I was listening to what was happening at a political level coming into 2011.  While my party was being blamed for the crash, many more promises were being made going into that election in terms of increasing spending.  To what degree have fiscal advisory councils in other countries been successful in keeping governments and opposition parties on the straight and narrow and making sure we do not get some of the things to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred?

I have been on the council since the beginning and the reason I am still on it is because I believe it does have an impact.  Having an independent expert body that does a huge amount of work looking over all these kinds of issues very carefully is of service to the system.<\/p> <p>  I would point out also that for one of the budgets, which I cannot recall now, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, said that his decision had been influenced by the council and that had it not been for the council's advice, he would have done something different.  That is reassuring to me that we are having a useful role.<\/p> <p>  Internationally, a huge number of councils have been set up in recent years, most of which are very new so it is a little too early to say if they have been successful.  However, there is a longer history of councils such as in the United States and Sweden.  The Office for Budget Responsibility, OBR, has been going a bit longer in the United Kingdom.  One of the determining factors in the success of those councils has been the political commitment around them.  In countries where people were not committed to sound public finances or listening to the council's advice, they were not very effective.  In systems where people were serious minded and concerned about medium-term stability, they found councils a very useful instrument to make that happen.  It is a bit like the rainy day fund.  It can be set up but if money is not put into it, it will not be of any help.  If a country is committed to making the hard choices not to spend money, it may work.

At the time, we were looking at the level of increase the Department of Finance was projecting from the stamp duty increase and it seemed to be assuming that the boom in commercial property would continue.  We were worried that we would use money from boom time commercial stamp duty to fund long-term expenditures once again.  We were querying whether it would bring in that sort of revenue over time.  The receipts so far this year have been behind what the Department of Finance was estimating so we may find that all the money is not coming in, even in the first year, not to mind that it will come in in later years.  Like corporation tax, we should not be making our long-term expenditure dependent on receipts from a cyclical type of revenue.  That commercial building will not last forever at the sort of rate it was taking place.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy spoke about the proposals that continue to be put forward by Deputies.  We do not have a remit to determine where our money should be spent.  We have a remit to examine the overall balance between expenditure and revenue.

The annual cost now is approaching &euro;1 billion so clearly it is something worthy of consideration again.  As Mr. Tutty said, we do not focus on individual measures but something which has a tax cost of &euro;1 billion is worthy of consideration by various bodies.  If we look at the broader environment, research and development is a cost.  Companies will be looking at the benefit they get from incurring that cost and that will be a reduction in their tax bill.  In Ireland, it will reduce the tax bill by 12.5% or whatever cost they incur.  In the United States, until recently, it would have reduced their tax bill by 35% of whatever cost they would incur because of the tax rate that applied in the US at that time.  That is the environment in which our research and development tax credit was established, given the nature of the companies here and trying to attract activity that might take place in other countries.  Given the change in the US tax rates, it might be worthy of analysis to see whether the research and development ax credit itself should be subject to changes.

The reason a fiscal account would be set up is to have that independent analysis and to have an institution that builds up a reputation and offers a view to the public it might not otherwise hear.

If the rainy day fund was to be strengthened and used as a countercyclical fund, what level of funding do the witnesses think should be diverted to it?  Are we currently putting enough aside?  On the rules at EU level which would need to be changed in order for Ireland to have enough flexibility to access a rainy day fund, what is required and needed to do that?<\/p> <p>  Getting back to some general things about the construction industry, it currently makes up 7% or 8% of GDP.  At the time of boom and bust it made up 20%.  What level do the witnesses think is a dangerous level to be at?  I ask that because a number of questions were asked around property speculators and all the bad words that developers are called which go under that umbrella.  We had a very interesting meeting yesterday at which we heard that 86% of landlords in our rental market own one or two properties.  In my estimation they are either accidental landlords or it is their retirement fund.  It is definitely not for profit, so to speak.  A very small percentage of our rental sector is made up of those bigger commercial landlords.  Some of the rent legislation we have put through in the last year or so has really helped to steady that market.  I refer to the rent pressure zones and further measures.  My fear is that some of the legislation coming at us again will push things too far and will affect that 86% heavily, meaning that they might pull out of the market, rather than affecting that very small 3% or 5% that have a greater number of units on the rental market.  I fear that will create a problem in the property market.<\/p> <p>  The other thing is around sustainability in construction, which we talk about all the time, and the skills shortage we have.  While we are improving the apprenticeship courses and trying to incentivise people to get back into these trades, one of the problems we have in terms of skill shortages is deciding how to incentivise and encourage people to go into these courses, to incentivise and encourage people who emigrated to come back, and to incentivise and encourage people who stayed, who retrained and who might be ten years in another career to get back into the construction industry with the vast experience and knowledge they would have had.  My view, and I would be interested to hear the views of the witnesses, is that they will only come back in when they see sustainability in the construction industry and when they do not see another cycle of boom and bust.  At the construction levels we have projected, will the national development plan help sustainability?  It gives a roadmap to the 500,000 additional homes that will be required in the next 20 years, to the 660,000 jobs that will need to be filled and to the infrastructure that will be required.  For the first time in a long time we have a statutory road map for the next 20 years so that people can actually see the sectors in which they will see growth and will be able to plan their futures in a far more cohesive manner. <\/p> <p>  A number of questions were asked already.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien mentioned cost rental.  He mentioned the pilot project in Enniskerry we are talking about.  While cost rental is just one measure of a general stock that will be required within the market, other areas at which I am interested in looking are projects such as rent-to-buy.  I know we do not want to get into specific projects or policies but, in simple terms, rent-to-buy, which we piloted years ago, means that local authorities develop schemes of, for example, 50 units.  People pay rent at a lower rate, for example &euro;1,000 a month.  After four or five years that rent is used as their deposit.  Do the witnesses see it as sustainable for the Government to introduce a policy such as that?  They may not want to answer that here but I can give them the information around it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#J00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>The Deputy has just under a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#J00300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I will leave it at that because a number of questions I had have been asked already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#J00400","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528894800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I will start with the rainy day fund.

A common theme throughout our comments on all aspects of the public finances, the overall balance of the economy and, probably, the construction sector in particular is very much an emphasis on long-term sustainability and avoiding the pattern of booms and busts such as we have seen in both public finances and individual sectors.  There should be a formulation in which there is a medium to long-term plan of investment both on the public and private sides that is facilitated by the smooth running of access to finance and the rules in terms of how the property sector gets planning permission and how infrastructure is put in place.  The overall objective would be to have investment in infrastructure and residential building proceed at a steady pace that grows in line with demographics and demand for housing and which avoids this boom and bust cycle.

Following on from that Yanis Varoufakis and others have been saying that we are riding on the back of European taxation policy and that we can raise funds in a different way from everybody else.

I do not agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan.  He was a senior member of the Green Party-Fianna F&aacute;il Government that drove the country off the cliff.  It is annoying to hear comments about connections to rural areas like the north west or my ancestral county of Wexford and that we will never have a proper road network linking all parts of this island.

Would there be any scope, for example, for additional personal taxation for the 300,000 tax units who earn more than &euro;100,000?

Deputy Broughan asked about spending and the term \"spending drift\".  The fact that spending is increasing is a good thing, in most cases.  The economy is growing and that is good news because that generates resources which, in turn, pay for increased spending in some of the areas mentioned.  Spending is not necessarily a bad thing.  We believe that spending in the good times should grow at a steady pace and in the bad times should grow at that same steady pace, such that we do not have a boom and bust in public spending for some of the reasons outlined by my colleagues.  A rainy day fund allows us to smooth this out.  As tax revenue goes up and down we want spending to grow slowly and sustainably to build the type of economy which I am sure members want.<\/p> <p>  Spending drift, however, is a different concept.  Spending drift is about money that comes in unexpectedly and how it is managed.  Over the past couple of years we have had favourable tail winds, some on the tax side, some on the corporation tax side and some in the form of lower interest payments, but this money has been spent.  Money that comes in that was unexpected is usually money that is less likely to be sustainable.  It is sensible to be prudent about this money and to save and ensure that it is available for the future.  The concern is around spending drift in regard to new money that comes in unexpectedly, over and above the fact that it was anticipated that the economy would grow.  This is very relevant in the context of budget decisions.  If by the autumn unexpected additional tax revenues over and above the strong growth that is already factored into the Government's forecasts appear this yield should be saved because there is a big chance it will be a transitory and unsustainable.  That that spending is rising in general is encouraging.  We are arguing for decisions to be made that will help to sustain that but the spending drift of spending money just because it is there is bad economically and it is risky as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528894800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I will take up the Deputy's questions on the research which received some coverage in this morning's paper on Ireland's status as a tax haven.  There are number of international definitions of \"tax haven\", including an OECD definition.  In those definitions the focus is on whether there is a zero or nominal rate of taxation on multinationals; they are treated differently from domestic firms; whether there is tax secrecy laws or restrictions on sharing of tax information with other countries and whether there is no substantiative activity associated with the multinational activity within the country.  It is pretty widely agreed across all of the international organisations that buy this set of criteria that Ireland is not a tax haven.  The research that was published this morning took a list of tax havens that had been put together by some academics in the early 1990s, drawing on data from the 1980s.  The issue is that it took Ireland's export tax relief, which was 0% in the 1980s, as special treatment of multinationals.  It was not particularly evidence of special treatment of multinationals in that it applied also to sales by domestically owned exporters.  In any event, this tax relief has long since been phased out over more than 20 years.  To the extent that there was initially a rationale in 1993 for Ireland's position on this list of tax havens, I do not think anybody would agree now that Ireland is a tax haven.  Ireland is a big base for foreign direct investment, FDI, but that is not in and of itself evidence that the country is a tax haven.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that in terms of the perception that Ireland may be unfairly competing for activities where activities are being booked, particularly digital activities where it is hard to distinguish the source of the sales versus where the value is being created, is a concern for Ireland's international image.  In terms of discussions at European level on how corporate tax could be differently allocated across countries - the common consolidated corporate tax base proposals - we have raised on a regular basis in our fiscal assessment reports that changes to the corporate tax environment across Europe could be a significant risk for Ireland.  If the proposals suggest that the tax revenues be allocated on the basis of where the sales take place rather than where the company is headquartered or the employment is, this would work against a small economy like Ireland that is exporting a lot of these services.  We pointed to this as a significant risk going forward for Ireland's economic structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martina Lawless"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528894800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>On the rainy day fund, our rationale for a rainy day fund is to avoid the booms and busts in the economy.

I am the director of the institute and I am joined by my colleagues Professor McQuinn and Dr. Wren.<\/p> <p>  This opening statement will be broken up into three sections.  We will discuss the macroeconomy and housing, and in this context we will probably go over some of the material covered with IFAC.  We will then turn to health, which will be a bit different, and we will end with some brief remarks on a number of areas that we see as being particularly important.  We will cover short-term and longer-term issues, and we will do so based on the view that a budget in any single year should be framed in the context of short-term and longer-term challenges.<\/p> <p>  The domestic economy looks set to register strong growth again in 2018 and into 2019.  Since 2014, Ireland has experienced the largest growth each year across the European Union and the euro area.  Initially, the recovery in economic activity was primarily export driven.  However, over the past number of years growth, due to investment and consumption, has been more prominent.  The ongoing resurgence of the economy serves as an important backdrop to the formulation of the budget.  The recent publication of the stability programme update provides the outline of the Government&rsquo;s fiscal strategy for the coming years.  This comes at a time when the discretion available to the Government in terms of fiscal space has increased considerably relative to previous years.  This greater discretion applies at a time when the foremost policy challenge is transitioning the economy from elevated growth rates as the economy experiences a rapid recovery to more sustainable growth rates over the medium-term.<\/p> <p>  It is clear that there are growing demands on the public purse.  The Government launched the national development plan, NDP, earlier in the year, whereby significant increases in capital expenditure are envisaged over the medium-term.  Also, the significant hardship experienced by many in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 financial crisis has resulted in calls for reductions in rates of personal taxation.  Given the very strong economic performance at present, it is imperative that fiscal policy does not risk overheating the economy.  Given the clear need for increases in capital expenditure, as articulated in the NDP, and ongoing pressures on current spending, it is difficult to see scope for significant tax cuts without adding to the risk of overheating.<\/p> <p>  It is generally understood that the current high price of housing reflects a substantial shortage of housing units.  Although prices are still below their 2007 peak, the sustained increases pose significant affordability issues, particularly for low income earners in the Dublin market.  Rising house prices are more likely to affect those at the bottom of the income distribution, for whom it is harder to obtain a mortgage and for whom housing costs have a much larger weight in the household budget.  Importantly, recent data from the Property Services Regulatory Authority indicates that the sharper growth rate in house prices is at the lower end of the price distribution.  Underpinned by strong housing demand, we expect housing completions to grow strongly this year.  We expect housing completions, as measured by electricity connections, to increase by 25,000 units in 2018, growing again to 31,000 in 2019.  However, this figure is still lower than the estimated structural demand for housing, which is approximately 35,000 units per annum.<\/p> <p>  In an Irish context, it is important to examine the interrelationship between fiscal sustainability and the financial cycle.  At present, given developments in the property market, mortgage credit levels are growing significantly.  While overall stocks of credit are still somewhat below the 2008 peak, it is evident that increasing house prices, coupled with growing levels of disposable income, are likely to bring about further increases in the extension of credit.  This likely increase in future household credit levels is a further reason for the Government to exercise caution in the formulation of fiscal policy.<\/p> <p>  At present, while overheating in the economy is a significant internal risk, there are also a number of external risks to Ireland's economic outlook.  Continued uncertainty as to the future of the European Union, whether through Brexit or issues in other member states, serves to remind us of the exposed nature of the Irish economy to external trade.  This exposure is further accentuated given the present volatile trade relations which were evident at the recent G7 meeting.  It has been established in a variety of research carried out by economists in the ESRI and elsewhere that any reduction in global trade and in global economic activity have direct negative impacts on the Irish economy.<\/p> <p>  We will now turn to our discussion of health, and in so doing we will take a longer-term perspective.  However, in order to meet the longer-term challenges that we will discuss, policy reactions in the near-term are needed.  Our remarks on health are based on our programme of research with the Department of Health, particularly the Projections of Demand for Healthcare in Ireland, 2015-2030 report published last October.  This report provides annual projections of demand for public and private health and social care services for the years 2015 to 2030.  I will list a certain amount of the main findings and I hope committee members can stay with me.  The population of Ireland is projected to grow by between 14% to 23%, adding 640,000 to 1.1 million people.  The share of population aged 65 and over is projected to increase from one in eight to one in six.  The number of people aged over 85 is projected to almost double.  Demand for health and social care is projected to increase across all sectors, with the greatest increases for services for older people.  Demand for home help hours is projected to increase by between 38% to 54%.  Demand for residential and intermediate care places in nursing homes and other settings is projected to increase by between 40% to 54%.  Demand for public hospital services is projected to increase by between 32% to 37% for inpatient bed days and between 24% to 30% for inpatient cases.  Demand for GP visits is projected to increase by between 20% to 27%, while demand for practice nurse visits is projected to increase by between 26% to 32%.<\/p> <p>  The report assumes no change in models of care.  However, further research is examining the potential effects of policy developments that could reduce projected demand in some sectors but which could increase projected demand in others.<\/p><p> The report also provides projections of demand for inpatient and day cases in public and private hospitals, maternity services, public hospital emergency department and outpatient services, pharmaceuticals, pharmacy consultations, home care packages, public health nursing and public community therapy services.  The report also includes the effect of unmet need and demand where possible.<\/p><p> There are important policy implications from the report&rsquo;s findings, many of which mirror and complement the implications of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The projected increases in the demand for health services, arising from increases in the population generally and in the older population in particular, come after two decades of rapid population growth, a decade of cutbacks in public provision of care and a consequent build-up of unmet need and demand for care. <\/p><p> The additional demand projected in the report for the years to 2030 will give rise to demands for additional expenditure, capital investment and expanded staffing.  This will have major implications for capacity planning, workforce planning and training.  Additional investment will be required in most forms of care to meet the needs of a rapidly growing and ageing population. <\/p><p> Before concluding, we wanted to touch on some additional issues that are enormously important and so should not be overlooked.  Each issue is part of a global trend and yet domestic policy has a key role to play.  Population ageing is one of these issues but has been discussed already in the context of health spending.  The other three issues are climate change, inequality and the productivity slowdown.<\/p><p> On climate change, the latest information from the EPA is that Ireland is likely to miss its 2020 target for greenhouse gas emissions and that emissions are projected to continue growing.  As it has been suggested that the bill for missing our 2020 targets could be in the region of &euro;500 million, there is a clear budgetary implication for inaction.  Apart from fines, Ireland needs to make more progress on our climate commitments if we are to be seen as responsible partners in this global effort.  Policy announcements such as the climate elements in the national development plan and the national mitigation plan are to be welcomed but the scale of the challenge may not have reached a wide audience yet.<\/p><p> The issue of rising inequality across many OECD countries has been discussed extensively.  Within Ireland, it strikes us that much of the debate in recent times has centred on how income is distributed across households and whether we see increases or decreases in measures of inequality from year to year.  According to this analysis, we know that Ireland is a relatively unequal country when judged by the distribution of market income.  However, we also know that Ireland&rsquo;s income tax and social welfare system is highly redistributive and so Ireland achieves a middle ranking in terms of inequality when household disposable income is considered.<\/p><p> With the greater availability of longitudinal datasets, through which the same individuals are tracked over time, we are able to get better insights into the following critical question: to what extent do the same people remain in poorer situations?  This question is not answered by the research I have described.  We will provide two examples from ESRI research which show the importance of tracking people over time.  First, in a study published in January, colleagues show how lone parents and the children of lone parents are much more likely to remain in poverty when compared with other groups.  Second, research published by colleagues in October 2017 and May 2018 shows how children differ by socioeconomic group as they transition into primary school and secondary school.  These results serve as a reminder that we should think about equality over the life cycle and design policy accordingly.<\/p><p> As a final note in this section, we will touch on the issue of the productivity slowdown, which is evident in many western economies.  While there is much debate internationally about the nature and causes of this slowdown, we will focus here on the challenge in Ireland.  Research from the OECD, the Department of Finance and others has shown that productivity rates in Irish-owned companies are low.  ESRI research has shown that Ireland&rsquo;s SMEs tend to be investing less than might be expected and this is not accounted for by restrictions on lending.  Hence, there is an ongoing challenge in developing the indigenous sector and this is all the more urgent in the context of Brexit.<\/p><p> We have moved across a range of issues and topics and have only touched on many of the complexities involved.  However, we hope to develop some of the themes in response to questions from Deputies.<\/p><p> I will chair the national economic dialogue, NED, again on 27 and 28 June.  Members of the committee have been invited and I take this opportunity to encourage their attendance.  While many representatives of different groups will be present, it strikes me each year at the NED that the broader public is only represented if public representatives such as committee members attend and participate actively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Barrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":84,"content":"<p>We have been reminded a number of times today about that event so I think there will be a better turnout.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#M00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528894800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Deputy Colm Brophy resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>The Chairman reminds us at every meeting about the national economic dialogue to make sure we attend.<\/p> <p>  Professor Barrett made two points about overheating.

Based on our experience in this country, and in many other OECD countries over the past ten years, it is very important that we focus both on fiscal policy and on what we call the financial cycle and in particular on how much credit is being extended in the real economy.  What we have been struck by over the last period, and we are not the only ones, is there has been a very significant pick-up in credit.  This is understandable in the context of the housing market picking up, more people buying properties and greater activity in the market.  We need to heed the lessons of the past.  The real difficulty we got into back in 2007 and 2008 was not all necessarily down to the fiscal policy side of things.  It was down to the combination of fiscal policy and credit policy.  It is certainly something we need to keep an eye on.  The committee has just heard from representatives of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  Their assessment is the economy is very near potential.  It is worth putting in context that the economy has been growing very rapidly.  The challenge, as we said in our comments, is to see how we can ensure we go from an economy that is growing very rapidly because we are recovering from a very pronounced downturn and to try to transition that to more sustainable rates of growth over the medium term.  Most other commentators, including the Irish Fiscal Advisory Service and the Central Bank, would not say the economy is overheating but they would flag it as a concern.  We need to broaden our understanding of it in terms of looking at it from both the fiscal and financial side of things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I can buy into that analysis.  We made a freedom of information request for some of the Minister's briefing documents on the issue of overheating.  One of the rationales for the rainy day fund is to prevent overheating.  It is almost being put up as the only solution.  When the EU Commission made a number of recommendations, particularly on how to prevent overheating, it mentioned investment, reduction of debt, broadening the tax base and preparing for the demographic pressures, which Professor Barrett touched on in terms of health.  It focused particularly on our childcare system and the investment in it, the investment in adult education, as well as dealing with the mortgage arrears issue.  It did not mention a rainy day fund.  We heard the spending drift mentioned and that when we get unexpected income, we should not spend it but should put it into a rainy day fund.  Is it not true that it depends on what it is spent on?  If it is spent on social welfare payments there is an impact on that when the economy takes a dip but what if we spend it on trying to avoid issues that may overheat the economy, such as plugging the skills gap?  We are talking about employment being around 4% but we still have a youth unemployment rate of approximately 12%.  We still have issues around the lack of investment in childcare and in certain sectors in the economy.  Is it not fair to say there are plenty of other options available to prevent the overheating of the economy and it does not always have to be that when we get the additional income or reach the balance targets, whatever the balance is, that anything in excess should be squirrelled away?  Is it not also fair to say that we could put things into capital investment and that in itself would prevent overheating?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#M00600","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528894800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I will deal with a number of the points.  We will focus on this in our next economic commentary, which will be out early next week.  We will look at and trace the impacts of increased investment in the economy versus the implications of cutting taxes and the related impacts of that on a variety of different economic indicators.  Our starting point would be the plans outlined by the Government as far as the national development plan is concerned, which signifies and indicates there will be a significant increase in investment over the medium term.  Some of that is already beginning, which can be seen from the figures.  Most people would agree that we need increased investment in a variety of different areas.  Many infrastructural deficits, to give it the technical term, have arisen in the past ten years, not least in areas such as housing, because of the cutback we observed.  What we were trying to do is to highlight the dangers that could arise from increasing investment that does not focus on productive areas and could cause overheating in the economy.  Similarly, we also wanted to look at the impact of cutting taxes on overheating of the economy and to look at the combined package of the two.  We think it is important to do this at this point in time.  The economy is growing very strongly and we are coming back to the potential level so it is very important how we handle the impact of investment on overheating in the next couple of years.  I do not think the rainy day fund in itself is purely about preventing overheating.  I think it is probably complex.  I am not here to support it or propose it.  I think it is about more prudent fiscal policy, the idea that one has a fund to which one can divert funds that one does not believe are ongoing current funds that are likely to there on an ongoing basis and then one can use those funds when there is an economic downturn.  For instance, some people have suggested as an example that if we had had the funds available in 2008 to 2009, which we did not, it would have been an lopportunity to spend money in areas such as social housing.  It would have helped to counterbalance the fact that the economy was going into a very sharp downturn and we could have offset some of the impacts by putting money into the economy.  If we had had the fund at that stage, that would have been a good practical use of it.  Obviously the funds that we had at that stage had to go into plugging holes in the balance sheets of the banks.  That is my understanding of what the rainy day fund is.  I would not necessarily focus on it as a means of solely preventing overheating.  It is more for prudent fiscal policy over the medium term.<\/p> <p>  I will outline one other area.   Deputy Jonathan O'Brien mentioned various measures to tackle overheating in the economy.  I think one crucial difference this time round from the last time - again it goes back to the idea of incorporating developments in financial markets - is the new macro prudential policy framework, which I think is very important because if properly implemented it will hopefully ensure that we do not see the unsustainable levels in credit growth emerging, which we clearly did up to 2007 and 2008.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#N00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Is Deputy O'Brien happy with that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#N00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Yes, I am.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#N00300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation.

On the figures for housing completions, which were based on the number of ESB connection installations, do the housing statistics on completions stand up?  One of my key objectives would be to build up the number of house completions to 35,000 to 40,000 units per annum.  I understand that during the boom we built 90,000 houses in one specific year, which is the level of houses that would be built in the UK.

There is an all-party commitment to Sl&aacute;intecare; is it possible to start putting real figures on health spending?  What does it mean for future budgets?

Mr. Martin Wolf has an article in <i>The Financial Times<\/i>this morning and he makes the point that productivity is everything.  When one is talking about medium-term growth projections, there is an assumption that there will be productivity growth over time and that is what delivers living standard increases over the medium term.  We are observing this productivity slowdown internationally which often comes as quite a surprise to people as everybody assumes that in the digital age with so much happening that productivity should be blasting ahead but it is not.  If one brings that into Ireland the situation gets a little bit more complicated because we have this twin track economy.  We have some incredibly productive companies, at least on paper, which are typically foreign owned and in contrast our core of domestic companies have much lower productivity levels.  This is well understood and well discussed.  There were two strands of ESRI research that tried to look at this recently; I referred in my introductory remarks to the fact that for quite a while we have been worried about under-investment in Irish SMEs.  For quite a long time coming out of the recession the assumption, for which there was good evidence, was that this was about a restricted credit supply to these companies, given the difficulties with the banks.  However, the most recent research would suggest that the under-investment in Irish SMEs is not related substantially to credit flows but is about something to do with risk appetite among Irish SMEs.  That is clearly a concern.  The second issue we have looked at recently goes to the following question and I will give 15 seconds to economic history.  When Whitaker proposed models of foreign direct investment and the opening up of Ireland, the theory was always that the foreign direct investment companies would come into Ireland, that the domestic population would gain entrepreneurial management experience and over time there would be spillovers from the international sector to the domestic sector.  In a sense this should have been a transition path.  I have argued this on a number of occasions.  I think that if TK Whitaker were still alive - perhaps he thought it in the later part of his life - he would have been surprised that 50 years to 60 years after his innovation we still had a relatively surprising dependence on foreign direct investment and what we increasingly see is that the sort of spillovers that were envisaged have not happened to the extent that we would have thought.  Again the ESRI research on this has tried to identify which companies achieve these spillovers.<\/p><p>There needs to be a sufficient level of human capital within the company to be able to absorb the spillovers.  We know something about the types of companies that do well here.  Again - and I referred to this in the opening statement in the context of Brexit - we need to look at the domestic industrial sector and issues surrounding investment, human capital, managerial training and a range of other things, and a programme of work could then be done.<\/p><p> To come to the second point the Deputy raised, one of the most interesting studies we did within the institute last year was on the question why there are so few women in the upper echelons of the Civil Service.  Both qualitative and quantitative research was carried out.  One of the key findings of this was that men and women are as likely to be promoted when they apply but that the big difference between men and women across the Irish Civil Service is that men are much more likely to apply for promotion than women are.  One of the qualitative pieces of research that came out of this made a point that I think everyone at one level knows, but it was interesting to see it written down.  If a man satisfies two of five criteria specified for a job promotion, he applies; if a woman satisfies four out of the five, she tends not to apply.  Again, there are a great many sociological reasons why this might apply.<\/p><p> Moving on, we have learned these barriers in the Civil Service.  Again, there has been research that shows there are barriers elsewhere.  There is broad international evidence that shows that the most productive workplaces are the most diversified.  The first time I came across this literature was in the context of migration.  It shows that diversified workforces tend internationally to be more productive.  It is similar if there is an age distribution, the theory being that whatever problem one is confronting, the diversity of views tends to generate a more innovative approach to it.  There could well be links between gender and productivity in Irish workplaces, but perhaps that is pushing it a little.<\/p><p> I will hand over to Dr. Wren, who will address the issue of health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Barrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528894800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Broughan for his questions.  To address first of all his question about the wide range in the demographic projections, they reflect varying assumptions on three factors, namely, life expectancy, fertility or births and, most importantly, migration.  The higher figure, 1.1 million, above all reflects assumed much greater inward migration.  This would be predominantly in the middle-age cohorts, that is, between about 15 and 44.  What we can say we know with some certainty, however, is that the people who will be 80 and 85 in 2030 are in the country now.  Therefore, between those two projections there is actually very little difference.  It is in and around 90% for 80 years and over and nearly 100%, nearly a doubling, for 85 years and over.  This rapid ageing that we project is in a sense a certainty.  One could say that the higher demographic growth overall projection is an optimistic one because it implies that we would have the younger people to staff the services, join the labour force and pay taxes and so on to support the needs of the older population.  Given our ageing, therefore, we need to hope for greater population growth in a sense.<\/p> <p>  In answer to the Deputy's question about what this means for future budgets, we are not in a position to answer that yet.  What I can say to him is that regarding the projections of demand we have done, which in the opening statement were expressed from 2015 to 2030, annual average increases are about 1% to 3% per annum across services.  In fact, for those services used more by older people, such as long-term care and home care, the figure is 2% to 3%.  For other services it is 1% to 2%.  When one considers increases in budgets overall, this probably sounds like a sustainable path but of course that is volume and the other component of expenditure is price.  We are currently working on developing our model to be able to project expenditures.  This will involve looking at issues such as potential pathways for public sector pay, for skill mix and for pharmaceutical prices.  We hope to be in a position in a year's time or two years' time to come back and to talk about these.<\/p> <p>  To make a further point on this, do we have a sense of where we are building from?  This work has not been done before in Ireland.  When the EU ageing reports, which project the effects on expenditure out to 2050 and which were referenced earlier by IFAC, were published, Ireland was one of three countries that could not supply an age cost profile - in other words, how much was being spent on health services by age within the population.  Ireland, Greece and Romania were the three countries that could not supply this because our data have been so poor.  Part of the big project in which we have been involved with the support of the Department of Health and with a great deal of involvement with stakeholders such as the HSE involves trying to improve the data sources in order that we can project with some certainty.  For instance, were one to use those EU ageing reports, the Irish projections are based on the assumption that Ireland's expenditure profile by age is the same as the EU average, which is a big reach.<\/p> <p>  Finally, regarding the Deputy's question about waiting lists, we have done our level best with the data available to include in our projections of demand what it would take to meet not only the effects of demographic growth and ageing but also current unmet demand.  We have used waiting lists where those data have been available and, where available, survey evidence on unmet need expressed by people who return the surveys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maev-Ann Wren"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528894800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>On the housing side of things, as the committee is probably aware, there has been quite a lot of discussion about the accuracy or otherwise of the housing supply figures released by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  They are now officially called the connections to the ESB.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has done quite a lot of work on looking into the figures and coming up with alternative sets of figures to reflect more accurately the current degree of activity.  My understanding is that the CSO will publish figures fairly soon as to the actual level of supply in the market or the level of activity in a given year.  Part of the problem is that there were more than likely close to 25,000 or 20,000 housing units built last year.  The issue is when these houses were actually built.  Were they half-built in 2007 and then finished last year etc.?  I think there will be greater clarity on this from the CSO fairly soon.  What we are looking at is the trend in respect of the level of activity, and one can clearly see there is an upward trend.  Perhaps the level is off in respect of the figures we are talking about but the trend is clearly upwards.<\/p> <p>  The second question the Deputy asked, if I understood it, concerned the implications in terms of capital expenditure and for the capital plan if we radically increase housing supply figures in the economy.  There was an earlier question in the previous session about when we will know that the housing market is beginning to unduly influence the level of economic activity.  The answer is when one sees housing supply levels significantly in excess of the structural demand estimates, which at present are in the region of 30,000 to 35,000 units.  If we go back to building double that, as we were doing back in 2005 to 2008 - I think on average we were building 85,000 units per annum over those three years - we will know that the housing market is beginning to unduly influence the level of economic activity.  Clearly, that is one metric that would show that things are getting out of control.  Regarding the overall capital expenditure, obviously, the vast majority of those housing units will be privately built, so I am not so sure what the implications will be purely on the capital budget but it is again a matter of the extent to which the overall activity levels would start to unduly influence activity in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kieran McQuinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Barrett for his presentation.  I do not so much have any questions except to say I agree with a lot of what was in it.  A question asked of the previous panel is whether the witnesses think the Government listens to them.  One actually sees much of what is in the opening statement translated into Government policy.  I was delighted to hear Dr. McQuinn talk about 2008 and 2009.  If we had had that rainy day fund then, we could have invested it in social housing.  As someone who was on a local authority back then and saw the withdrawal from central government funding and the knock-on effect of that, I believe it is very prudent that Government has a rainy day fund and it is broadened for adverse weather effects.  People of my generation and the Chairman's generation always grew up being told to put aside a certain amount of one's wage if possible for a rainy day.  This should be carried through in any policy.<\/p> <p>  I was delighted to hear Professor Barrett talk about gender in the workplace and some of the barriers women face to which he alluded, confidence, childcare and cost being the main ones.  We are doing a lot to address that but we could probably go much further.  He is right: men will apply for promotion if they reach two out of five criteria.  Women like to finish a job before they go on to the next one.  That is a given.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the data sources and the ESB connections, I am looking forward to the CSO figures coming out at the end of the week or next week, I think.  Regardless of whether a house was built in part in 2010 and not completed until last year or this year, it is still a new house.  People can argue over that whatever way they want; it still will put a properly built and sustainable roof over the head of someone who needs it.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Rebuilding Ireland, I think people forget where we have come from.  I hate going back to this all the time, but it is important to put it in context.<\/p><p>Rebuilding Ireland is a five-year plan, and we always said it would be the middle of year two or three before we start to see that impact.  The number of planning permissions being granted and planning applications going through, as well as commencement orders are increasing at a quicker rate than the last year or two, although they are not yet where we need them to be, that is putting some confidence and viability back into the sector.  It is going in a positive rather than negative direction.  Members in other parties do not want to accept that and, instead, bash us on the ESB connections or other figures.  When we drill down into them, progress is evident, and this does not come about on the back of a card; it has come about with proper policy, investment and communications with people who know this field.<\/p><p> I do not know even where to start with health.  I spent yesterday and last night in an accident and emergency department with a family member and I have every respect for people who work in the emergency services given the pressure they are under.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report has been completed for a good while but it was a policy document that had to be handed to the Department of Health to produce a financing roadmap on where to invest over the next ten years.  It is not something that can happen quickly.  Proper policy and planning takes time and doing something in haste sometimes brings poor results.  I would rather take time where possible and get the results we want.  I am a member of the housing committee, which is currently working on a policy for assisted and independent living for older people because of the projected demographics and because there are not enough options for people.  We are feeding into the projected figures for people over 65.  People want to stay within their community and even within a kilometre of where they currently live, if possible.  We must consider such housing models to free up other houses with a knock-on effect.<\/p><p> There is much in this and I enjoy reading these kinds of documents.

She asked first if we are listened to and it is always sobering to think about that.  In more recent years, the ESRI funding model has shifted a little.  Most people think we get a block of money from the Government and go off and do our own thing.  It is not quite like that.  Increasingly, the ESRI works on the basis of bilateral research relationships with Departments and agencies.  The health worker mentioned earlier is a case in point, as we have direct bilateral discussions with policymakers on an ongoing basis, trying to work out the big policy matters and how research can inform the issues being grappled with.  There is  direct communication and the chance, in a sense, of being at least heard improves, whatever about being listened to.<\/p> <p>  I will also pick up the issue of childcare, as it relates to a number of topics that have been raised.  It is partly an issue relating to the gender pay gap.  Many people will understand this and believe that one of the big reasons for the gender pay gap is the extent to which women are much more likely to have gaps in their career.  With such a gap, it is not just that the wages will just be low but they will be lower than they otherwise would have been for a long time.  Anything that can be done to facilitate more continuous work profiles would do much for the gender wage gap.  I can link this to something else that I said.  I mentioned in the presentation an observation about lone parent families.  It is not just if we look at a point in time that lone parents and their children are more likely to be in poverty.  They are more likely to be stuck in that position, and that relates to childcare.  Before this committee and others, we have made the case that investment in childcare gives a sort of win-win-win across a variety of points.<\/p> <p>  One of the worst research experiences of my life was writing on the issue of older people's housing.

One of the crucial elements of the policy, as we mentioned in the paper, was ensuring older people can move within neighbourhoods.

I saw a programme recently where this was discussed and it was portrayed as older people being shoved from their homes.  It is purely a choice that people do not currently have at the level that we should have.  It is about independence, security and the financial burden of running a house when that person might only live in three rooms of a three-bedroom or four-bedroom house.  It is not that we want the house but we want to give people security and offset the loneliness factor as well.  If we can centralise it there may be some way to help with home help hours and the knock-on effect of medical care that will be required.

That is a clear message.  Having attended a conference in the UK recently, adding to the housing stock every year is very much felt to be required in British housing policy.  If that does not happen, problems accumulate significantly.<\/p> <p>  I will finish by tying up two themes in the debate.  The first is the ageing demographic structure and the second is productivity slowdown.  I recently did some work with a colleague in UCD where we looked at the long-term implications of this for growth in Europe.  It has very significant implications.  Our population structure is ageing but we can consider the degree to which the population structure across Europe is ageing, particularly in Germany, and the long-term forecast is staggering.

We thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute to its deliberations on budget 2019.<br\/><br\/>In the context of budget planning, the tax base is central to the committee&rsquo;s discussion.  As much as 80% of corporate tax receipts come from foreign multinationals and out of the top 100 largest corporate tax paying companies, only ten are Irish.  Many domestic and international bodies have warned repeatedly and consistently of the risks in the our tax base because of the concentrated nature of our corporate tax receipts.  The Central Bank, IFAC, IMF, OECD and European Commission have all chimed on the matter in recent months.  The consistency of the warnings on the volatility in our corporate tax receipts is matched only by the consistency of the warnings on the need to focus on Irish-owned businesses.  While much work has been done on enterprise policy, the need to address the productivity of Irish companies cannot be ignored.  <br\/><br\/>The OECD has warned that the resilience of the economy hinges on unblocking the productivity potential of Irish-owned businesses, while at the same time highlighted that most of them have experienced a decline in productivity over the past decade.  Several issues must be tackled if they are to succeed in challenging these and tax policy or tax administration issues will be central to making that happen.  The OECD says that we need to give entrepreneurs what they need to grow their businesses and get rid of what is stunting that growth, and that, in some cases, access to finance holds individuals back from taking the step into entrepreneurialism. <br\/><br\/>The European Commission has also highlighted productivity issues.  The IMF has also stressed the need for the productivity growth of Irish companies, including through greater support for innovation, and enhancing partnerships of SMEs with research institutions that would help improve productivity.  Our tax policy on collaborative research and development has fundamental limitations in this regard.  <br\/><br\/>A step change is needed if we are to build on the brilliance and ability of Ireland's innovators, entrepreneurs and start-up businesses.  We must seek to unlock our potential.  Other countries have done so with strategic intent, and so can we.  Irish businesses need access to finance, and they also need help and expertise to make the right and the best strategic decisions.  They need finance for capital investment, human capital, innovation and research and development that will determine their future success.  The impact of policies such as the employment and investment incentive, EII, entrepreneur relief, our capital gains tax rates, the workability of the research and development regime for SMEs, and the effectiveness of our new share options regime are central to the strategic gear shift we need. <br\/><br\/>My colleague, Ms Gunnell, will outline in detail the issues within most of our critical business policies and tax policies.  Some research findings have given us the context for why they are so critical.<b><\/b>ESRI research on SMEs show that their investment is below what is expected.  The investment gap was more than 30% in 2016 and, therefore, Irish businesses have fallen short.  In addition, Irish companies remain heavily reliant on internal funds and on bank financing.  Close to 75% of their investment is financed using their own funds, which is substantially above the EU average of 60%.  This is relevant when one considers recent CSO reports on innovation, which highlight that a lack of internal finance is the main factor in hampering innovation activities by Irish companies.<br\/><br\/>The share of SMEs applying for a banking product has decreased since 2015.  The interest rates being charged are well above the eurozone average.  There is a need to consider alternative financing options such as venture capital and angel investment.  These involve people who are willing to undertake riskier investments.  It is not just about their money but about smart money.  They come with the crucial ingredients that Irish businesses need and that other countries have availed of such as mentoring, global experience, international business contacts and a hands-on advisory role.  While the tax system of other countries embraces angel investors, Ireland locks them out.  <br\/><br\/>In light of Brexit, the financing constraints for SMEs are relevant.  Research shows that it is likely to deter Irish companies from exporting.  It also shows that companies reporting to have experienced financing difficulties are less likely to engage in exporting activities.  The reasons Irish SMEs borrow give us an even deeper insight into Irish companies.  According to the Central Bank, they borrow for working capital above any other reason.  They are below the EU average for borrowing for fixed investment.  On the other hand, German SMEs more frequently report using financing for the development of new products, hiring of employees and refinancing of obligations.  It is no surprise then that among the German Mittelstand class, more than 42% of SMEs brought a product or process innovation on to the market in 2014.  The OECD has warned that Irish companies need to invest more in their own research and development activities, which will drive productivity. <br\/><br\/>The OECD has also stressed the need for human capital.  Ireland needs to think of ways to raise the capacity of businesses to implement new ideas and technologies.  We know from research that managerial skills in many Irish companies are too weak to allow businesses to identify and exploit the opportunities offered by global companies and global trade on their doorstep.  Wages in multinationals are 64% higher than in domestic companies and the difference is 74% in multinationals of non-EU origin.  Under these circumstances, Irish SMEs have difficulties recruiting and retaining skilled workers, thereby hindering their growth and exporting potential, and, therefore, our share option regime becomes critical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#Q01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Olivia Buckley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528894800,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Against that backdrop, we cannot allow our tax regime to block what is good.  We have dedicated agencies, educated talent, the ability of our people and an expanded global footprint within our diplomatic service.  We must have tax policies to match that.  Given the severity of access to finance for Irish business, I will first address the existing tax measures that promote investment.  We have two major schemes, namely, the targeted capital gains tax, CGT, relief for entrepreneurs and the income tax incentive for individuals who invest in Irish business, known as the employment and investment incentive, EII.  The backdrop to Ireland's high CGT rate makes analysis of the measures even more important.<\/p> <p>  CGT is a key determining factor for investment in businesses.  It can help or hinder the process.  It is unquestionably the tax that matters most to investors and influences their behaviour.  When we addressed the committee last year, Ireland had the fourth highest CGT rate in the OECD at 33%.  France was at the top of the table.  This year, President Macron, in his determined effort to attract more investment into French start-ups and tech companies, slashed the French rate to 30%, pushing Ireland into third place, 13 percentage points above the OECD median rate, a stark position considering what we are trying to do for Irish companies.  Our targeted revised entrepreneur relief is important in that, to a limited extent, it helps reduce the CGT burden on the sale of a business.  However, this tax measure is uncompetitive.  It compares poorly with the UK, which makes London a more attractive location for the investors we badly need.  The relief applies to a &pound;10 million gain in the UK but in Ireland the gain is limited to &euro;1 million.  From the point of view of an investor, there is no competition between the two offerings.  As Ms Buckley mentioned, the relief also locks out the important angel investors who invest not only money but also experience and industry expertise, which are vital factors when we consider the deficit of managerial capability in Irish business, as highlighted by the OECD.  While cities such as Paris, Berlin, Stockholm and Tokyo embrace angel investors, Ireland's tax regime excludes them.  The impact of this is that business angel investment in Ireland is low compared with that in other countries.<\/p> <p>  The second financing tax measure of Irish businesses is the EII.  It encourages investors to place finance in early stage and small businesses that have limited funding options.  Such businesses must very often rely on finance from family and friends.  The EII plays a vital role in scaling start-ups and small businesses to the next level of growth.  While the scheme is welcome, there are now many blockages within it.  Several design features of the scheme are barriers to investment, such as splitting the tax relief into two tranches, the annual investment limit of &euro;150,000 and the revised connected party rules following the Finance Act 2017.  The EU state aid general block exemption regulation, GBER, under which the EII operates, also has a significant impact on the scheme and adds to the cost and complexity of claiming EII.  It is particularly difficult for businesses seeking to raise a second tranche of EII funding and those wishing to raise EII after having been in operation for seven years.  A restrictive administrative process is stifling the use of the relief.  The GBER provisions are applied retrospectively to business plans prepared before its introduction.  The institute recommends that a full economic analysis of the impact of the GBER on the EII be undertaken and welcomes the consultation currently being undertaken in that regard by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.<\/p> <p>  As Ms Buckley mentioned, Irish companies need the best human capital and talent to increase managerial skills, innovation and research and development capability.  Given the high personal tax rates in Ireland, a workable share option scheme that can help Irish small and medium enterprises, SMEs, to attract talent to grow their businesses is essential.  We welcome the introduction of the new key employee engagement programme, KEEP, which provides an opportunity for SMEs to compete with listed companies to attract and retain such talent.  However, the scheme has limitations which could significantly impact its feasibility and, ultimately, its success in achieving its policy aim.  Issues surrounding the qualifying criteria for individuals, the design of the remuneration limits and the narrow definition of a qualifying holding company under the scheme rules are creating difficulties for many SMEs in qualifying for KEEP.<\/p> <p>  Innovation is a central ingredient in the strategic plans for other countries when it comes to growing their SMEs.  The link between innovation and productivity has been highlighted by the OECD, the IMF and the European Commission.  Ireland has an attractive research and development tax credit regime but administrative blockers are weighing heavily on its success in terms of the low take-up among SMEs.  Research undertaken by the institute in 2017 found that only 35% of companies surveyed intended to use the research and development tax credit over the next 18 months, although that would rise to 62% if there were more clarity on the criteria for qualification.  Of significant concern is the fact that the research and development tax credit regime restricts outsourcing and collaboration, a condition that is at odds with best practice by international standards, which actively promote outsourcing and collaboration with the university sector.  In Germany, the incentives are aimed at collaboration and partnership with universities is key.<\/p> <p>  From our submission in 2016, members will be aware that one of the key challenges in our current tax policy making process is the insufficient time available to scrutinise legislation announced in the budget.  Apart from key income tax changes and other sensitive measures, we believe that tax legislation should be published for consultation in advance of the finance Bill.  This could be done on an issue-by-issue basis throughout the year in the same way that consultation takes place on important policy matters such as controlled foreign company rules, share options and the tax treatment of entrepreneurs.  In their 2017 report on tax certainty, the IMF and the OECD stated, \"Legislative and tax policy design issues are a major source of tax uncertainty, mainly through complex and poorly drafted tax legislation and the frequency of legislative changes.\"  Given the importance of all the anticipated complex changes to the Irish tax code over the next two years arising from the EU anti-tax avoidance directives, the mandatory disclosure directive and the Coffey review recommendations, it is imperative that we address this problem.

The remuneration limits are causing difficulty, particularly the share option arm of the scheme where a share option cannot exceed 50% of annual emoluments.  In the high-tech sector, companies with high potential which are in the start-up phase are cash strapped and have cashflow issues so they incentivise employees by offering a higher proportion of pay in share options with a lower proportion in salary.  They will not qualify for KEEP.  Also, under KEEP, an individual has to work full-time for a single company.  An employee may, however, devote substantial time to KEEP company but if there is a holding company he or she may have some duties to carry out there, meaning they do not meet the test.  The legislation also states that a holding company must wholly own the shares in a KEEP company and not be doing anything else.

When we have a debate on a budget, it is hard to know where to get extra money from because there are many issues regarding all the taxes.  We want to be fair in a very squeezed and rising property market and we do not want to punish people whose incomes may not match the valuation of their property.  We are already getting a huge and disproportionate amount of money from corporate tax and personal taxation accounts for a very high percentage of our overall tax base, at around 40%.  A lot of people with low to middle incomes have very low tax bills by the standards of other countries.  We do a study every year of eight competitor countries and we know that we have a very low contribution but there has been much discussion about the pain people have gone through in recent years and the fact that the cost of living is very high in many areas.<\/p> <p>  Over many years of engaging with this committee and the finance committee, we have focused on the fact that we can only grow our tax base by growing the activity of our Irish enterprise.  All the international agencies and bodies tell us that we cannot afford not to have the necessary resilience and not to fulfil our potential.  We have a 30% investment gap so while our economy is growing, Irish SMEs are not matching it with investment and innovation and with managerial capacity building.  The best way to grow our tax base is to give support to the indigenous Irish sector.  The German economy does this very well, although it has been doing it for many decades.  It is a very good model - if not to adopt then to adapt - and we could certainly learn a few things about expanding our tax base.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018061300002#S00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Olivia Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming before us today.

They state that students can access autism classes in both national and secondary schools, and that schools will make provision for an autism class when requested to do so.  That is correct, but the issue is that the back up support must be timely.

Since the inception of the GAA in 1884, we have been concerned with the health and well-being of the people and the nation.  In a modern Ireland the association has worked tirelessly to respond to the ever-changing needs of our members and the communities we serve.  This may present in providing new and interesting ways for young people to enjoy physical activity which we know supports their health and well-being, particularly when it comes to being overweight or obesity, or providing safe environments that help to support their social and emotional development.  In providing part of the solution to the childhood obesity challenge facing Ireland the GAA takes an holistic approach to well-being, recognising that our members&rsquo; physical, emotional and social health needs are interrelated and linked.<\/p> <p>  We have endless reports telling us that children are failing to meet the recommended physical activity levels, both at home and in the formal education setting.  We have similar reports highlighting the explosion in childhood obesity levels, coupled with increased consumption of energy-dense foods by children and adults alike.  We know and see the personal and societal consequences of this shift in lifestyle behaviours which are exacerbated by conditions in the society in which we live - health inequalities, access to relatively cheap convenience foods, sedentary lifestyles and powerful marketing and promotion by big business.<\/p><p>Any attempt to address the consequences of the obesogenic environment in which much of modern society operates requires a multifaceted, all-of-Government, all-of-society response.  The GAA proudly plays its part by helping swathes of our juvenile population achieve their recommended weekly physical activity levels, while exposing them to positive values, experiences, habits and role models that scaffold them on their journey through life.<\/p><p> The 2017 GAA games development and research report highlights current participation levels in the various games development activities undertaken and outlines proposals for future initiatives that will further increase participation.  The highlights from 2017 can be summarised as follows: 142,467 participants on Kellogg&rsquo;s GAA C&uacute;l Camps - an increase of 11.5% on 2016 - making it the biggest child sport promotion in the world with 20% of all children of that age in the country; approximately 189,842 primary school pupils participating in the Hurling Go Games blitz programmes, with 217,532 pupils playing in five or more Gaelic Football Go Games blitzes, outside their traditional training with their clubs twice a week; more than 250,000 primary school pupils receiving coaching as part of a primary schools coaching programme; the total number of players participating in a Go Games blitz programme nationwide amounting to approximately 77,626 children; the launch of GAA fun and run, which is designed to provide access to our games for persons with special needs and disabilities and is primed to optimise participation within multi-ethnic and lower socioeconomic demographics; and the launch of the GAA five-star centres to significant acclaim from the INTO and teacher training colleges because of their potential to increase levels of physical activity through the medium of Gaelic games in primary schools.<\/p><p> In addition to our traditional games-based models, the GAA has broken new ground in its efforts to equip our members and communities with the opportunities to enjoy healthier lifestyles with the introduction of the healthy club project in partnership with Healthy Ireland, the HSE, the National Office for Suicide Prevention and supported by Irish Life through a CSR funding partnership.  This award-winning project, which has been heralded at European level through a joint initiative of nine sporting organisations across nine EU countries called Sports Clubs for Health, uses an evidence-based approach that has been independently evaluated by a team from Waterford Institute of Technology's behavioural health research department.  It has been successful in delivering health-promoting programmes, policies and partnerships to young and old through the medium of their local GAA club.  The model is based on the WHO's approach to health promotion, which targets the setting in which we live, work, play and learn rather than targeting individuals or specific health issues.  We believe that, with additional support, this project has the potential to deliver a healthier Ireland, one that engages and excites people, offering access to evidence-based health interventions and resources in a new way but through a trusted and traditional setting and one that is available in every community in Ireland - your local GAA Healthy Club.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018061300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Regan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Mr. Regan mentioned the 11% increase in the Kellogg's C&uacute;l Camps in 2016.

Those areas primarily focused on clubs reaching out to their older members and providing access to games for non-traditional cohorts, such as persons with special needs or the new Irish.  At present, we are in phase 3 with 150 clubs participating, including several in each county, and we are only limited by resources.  We want to reach all 1,600 clubs this year and, having invited expressions of interest in January, we had 220 applications.  We only had the capacity to take in 92, however, adding to the 58 that concluded phase 2.  There is great hunger for this and we deliver a two and a half hour training module, developed in consultation with our partners in the HSE, the National Office for Suicide Prevention and Healthy Ireland, to all participating clubs.  The same training is available to any other of the 150 clubs which are not in the evaluation model.  Last year we trained 400 GAA healthy club officers throughout the country, whose clubs are interested in getting involved.<\/p> <p>  On healthy eating, I am aware that Amanda McCloat from St. Angela's home economics teacher training college was here.  With Amanda and her team, and Dr. Crionna Tobin, a leading sports nutritionist, we developed a programme called Recipes for Success, targeting minor and under 21 panels.  We have a fantastic booklet with healthy recipes based on whole foods, endorsed by some of our intercounty stars.  These not only support a healthier diet but also boost performance.  The local healthy club reaches out to the home economics teacher training college and the teacher gives them a two-hour cookery demonstration class, in their own time as volunteers, in which they take the panel through at least two recipes.  They are at a critical juncture in their life development as many are finishing their leaving certificate and going on to third level or apprenticeships.  The classes arm them with an interest in nutrition and the skills to cook the healthy food that will boost their lifestyles and, it is hoped, even make them better players.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018061300002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the hard work the GAA does.

The drop-off is not only happening with teenage girls but everyone at that age, and it is across all codes.  We have introduced several initiatives that attempt to address that.  The Deputy is correct that the competitive element turns off some young people at that critical stage in their development.  When the Deputy has a chance, she might read the full submission.  In recent years the games development department has introduced super games centres which are non-competitive centres.  These are ongoing rather than summer-based, like the C&uacute;l Camps, but they are their equivalent and target that teenage cohort, both male and female, to offer them the opportunity to come together in a non-competitive environment.  It was only introduced in 2015, when there were only ten centres throughout the country.  That grew to 115 in 2016 and 793 of our clubs last year, almost half the clubs in the country, plus 381 post-primary schools engaged in at least three sessions exploring the concept of this super games centre.  It is driven by the young people themselves, rather than having a formal coaching-driven ethos.  The intention is for young people to come together and formalise and regulate their games, with fun and participation at the core rather than competition.<\/p> <p>  On where we move after the C&uacute;l Camp philosophy, the intention of the Go Games was that the volunteer coaches who put in so much time have realised that it is not necessary to introduce competitions to young people because they will find the level of competition they want themselves.  Any player pathway in any sports organisation must have an element of competition to allow for those who are striving towards being the best athletes or players that they can be in their code.  There has to be a pathway for elite players and that is the intercounty championships in the GAA.<\/p> <p>  We feel the Healthy Clubs project is an antidote, as it were, to the win at all costs ethos that, unfortunately, can permeate all sports.  It is detrimental to the children but is driven by the adults.  The Healthy Club project exposes children to nutritional advice, recommendations and best practice.  During phase 2, 60 clubs participated and more than half engaged in the Recipes for Success programme.  In addition to the partnership with St. Angela's, those clubs then adopted healthy eating guidelines.  When I was playing, traditionally it would have been the practice to be given a packet of crisps and a fizzy drink after playing.  Now they are given a bottle of water and fruit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018061300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>That still goes on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018061300002#E00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528878600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>It does, of course, but it will take a couple of generations to change that ethos and to reassure clubs that once the changes are made, it becomes the norm.  It has been embraced by the young people throughout the country.  For instance, St. Finbarr's in Cork, one of our leading healthy clubs, has entered into a very interesting partnership with the local SuperValu to provide the fruit and vegetables and bottles of water for the club's nurseries every Saturday morning.  It is win-win.  It has cost the club nothing, the local business gets positive promotion and the adults and parents are very grateful to the club for taking this positive step.  It requires a bit of thinking outside the box along with proper policy and support and the provision of guidelines from the national level down.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's second point about the fun and run and providing access for people who might not traditionally see themselves as a county star or be able to engage in games in their local club because of any special needs they might have, be they intellectual, physical or sensory, we are driving the implementation of the fun and run through the healthy club model.  For instance, Raheny in north Dublin has a Raheny all-stars programme every Saturday morning.  The Central Remedial Clinic is in its catchment area so Raheny has a large population base that can benefit from this targeted approach to people who want to engage in physical activity.  We know from research that people with special needs are a particular at-risk group for obesity and being overweight because the standard physical activity opportunities are excluded to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018061300002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I have one more question.

Each station around the pitch has a little mat and one must engage in an exercise which promotes the fundamental movements.  If one turns the mat over, there is also a wheelchair-friendly exercise.  When we launched it on the grounds in Trinity College Dublin last year, some of the pupils from the Central Remedial Clinic came down.

The space that the bar occupies is a financial resource for clubs, it has been good to me as an artist and musician and serves as a social space.  Is the GAA conscious of the space that it occupies?  Looking a generation ahead, is it something that Mr. Regan thinks might change?  Will we move away from a connection with pubs and alcohol?  We are working on obesity and childhood obesity.

Only a tiny percentage of GAA clubs have bars.  I am from County Leitrim where none of the clubs has a bar.  They would be largely urban-based clubs.  I imagine that less than 5% of 1,600 clubs have a bar attached to them.  I will find out the exact number and share it with the committee.  In 2006, the GAA introduced its alcohol and substance abuse prevention programme in partnership with the HSE.  At the time, Ireland was among the highest consumers of alcohol in the OECD.<\/p><p>Since then, more than 750 GAA clubs have introduced an alcohol and substance abuse prevention policy.  During my childhood, after an underage match we would be brought into the local pub for sandwiches.  After every county final, the pub was where the medals were handed out.  That idea or association has been completely broken.  The GAA sample club drug and alcohol abuse policy clearly indicates that no juvenile events should even take place in the local premises.  We do not allow sponsorship of any juvenile teams, gear or equipment by licensed premises.<\/p><p> As part of phase 2 of the healthy club project, more than half of the 60 clubs involved became completely smoke-free campuses.  More than half of the 150 clubs now in phase 3 have indicated that they will do the same.<\/p><p> A major cultural shift has been taking place.  It comes down to an appreciation that the GAA club is a setting for something beyond the delivery of the skills associated with Gaelic games.  It is a setting where people come together as families and as a community to socialise.  The idea is that this setting can promote positive health messages in a variety of areas.  Clubs are becoming far more mindful of how they can do that.  We are fortunate with some of the partnerships we have developed, including with Healthy Ireland, the HSE and the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  We have also received support from Irish Life through corporate social responsibility investment.  We have been able to development a community and health department in Croke Park that is solely responsible for trying to drive this shift.<\/p><p> It is also important to note that the association has no alcohol sponsorship at national level.  There has been no such arrangement since we parted ways with Guinness as the sponsor of hurling.

We have heard of a number of tremendous and positive initiatives.  It is good to have crystallisation of what the GAA is doing right down to the local community, because sometimes we think of the GAA in binary terms, whether hurling or football, camogie or handball and so on.  Often, we think of the GAA in binary terms and in an intercounty context only.  As policymakers we might not fully appreciate what happens across the land except perhaps through the prism of our individual clubs.<\/p> <p>  Given that we are good parochial people, I am keen to hear more about the fun and run activity.  My club in Mallow, County Cork, has world-class facilities.  We have a multimillion euro facility.  It is something that could be used as a hub for the Munster region for outworking in that regard.

Perhaps I will share more with Mr. Regan on that afterwards.<\/p> <p>  We cannot underestimate the metrics Mr. Regan has given us today.  The key metric is the top-line metric, which is a total of 142,467 participants in the C&uacute;l Camps.  It is the biggest child sport promotion in the world.  That is a phenomenal metric for what is an indigenous sport when we look at it in global terms.  We should be shouting that metric from the rooftops.  It is testament to the lateral thinking that now exists within the GAA.  The GAA sees itself as having a clear social function.

Deputy Sherlock referred to the metrics that the C&uacute;l Camps have reached.  Sligo footballer Charlie Harrison is the national C&uacute;l Camp co-ordinator.  He has done extraordinary work on the increase in this area in recent years.  The games development department is mindful of providing fundamental movement opportunities for young people in the educational setting, especially primary school.  These are not solely GAA-specific.  The idea is to engage with them in a way that excites them and gets them moving.  This allows them to learn the fundamental and functional movement skills that will support a physical lifestyle throughout their lives.  We are not selfish about whether the means are GAA-specific.<\/p> <p>  The games department has introduced a 5 star centre concept.  This is in response to the fact that only 18% of primary school pupils are achieving the recommended of 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity every week.  GAA coaches support schools that take up the challenge and participate in the have a ball programme and the fun and run initiative.  It is centred around basic movements such as striking and the catch and kick experience.  Those involved get to participate in the Go Games at Cumann na mBunscol level and the Go Games skills challenge as well.  Schools that meet all these elements are recognised by the GAA as 5 star centres.

A child, in legal terms, is under 18.

When these lads go back to their clubs after a year of conditioning with a dietitian, they are physically transformed and sometimes their clubmates say, \"Wow, I need to do whatever he is doing.\"  However, they access the supplements online, which is completely unregulated.  It could be coming in from any part of the world and could contain anything.

They want to be that senior player.  It might be something we could pop into our report in respect of enhancement.  I welcome the fact that the GAA is recognising that and has guidelines on it.

No doubt the GAA provides an extraordinary service to the State and has done for generations.  This particular venture for the GAA, in terms of healthy eating promotion, is to be welcomed and appreciated.  The GAA is in every corner of every county.  It has two clubs in some towns.  It is fantastic to see such a big organisation take such a lead on it and it is important.  There are many other sporting codes that do the same but it should be noted that no other sporting code has the reach that the GAA has.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on three themes.  The first, which is the most important one - because one can have all the C&uacute;l camps in the world but if one does not promote participation, and the sustenance of that participation, we have a problem, and it is the problem that we are facing in this country in terms of obesity rates - is, of course, participation.  Our opening speaker, Deputy Rabbitte, touched upon it but it is important to dwell on it for a moment.  As somebody who was very good at one particular code and dreadful at most others, I was a willing participant in all sports.  On that drop-off in participation, because of the exclusion of individuals, and the competitive nature of sporting organisations, I can speak to one section of my community in Dublin Fingal where there are two other sporting organisations that grew as a result of the exclusion of hundreds of people because of that one organisation - it does not matter what code it is or where it is.  The point is there are two other clubs that now have hundreds of members because of this competitive nature and it started at under 12s.  That is wrong.<\/p> <p>  Senator Richmond made a point yesterday which was covered in the media - I am sure other members have made points about it in the past - that there should be encouragement for children to participate up to a particular age where there should not be competition involved.  When I say there should not be competition, they should be given a run at every game or every second game.  It is not good enough for a sporting organisation to exclude a child who shows up week in, week out, trains just as hard as everybody else but maybe just does not have that talent or for it, for instance, to encourage him or her to participate in a team that might play once a month.  I would be interested to hear Mr. Regan's view on that matter.  I am not targeting the GAA at all.  It happens right across the spectrum of sporting codes.  I would be interested to hear his view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018061300002#H03200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528878600,"counter":271,"content":"<p>The GAA's view is exactly the same as the Chairman's.  We find that unacceptable.  The Go Games philosophy was introduced specifically to address that.  The Go Games philosophy requires - it is compulsory for all clubs - that children up to under 14 level enjoy an opportunity.  Everybody plays is the philosophy of the Go Games, as we heard from Deputy Rabbitte.  Deputy Rabbitte attended the f&eacute;ile hurling in Galway last week and there was a requirement for roll-on, roll-off substitutes for participation in that.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, there is still a culture driven by some coaches within our clubs where they seek to live vicariously through the underage teams with which they are working.<\/p><p>We also now have a requirement that all coaches working with juvenile teams in the association receive foundation level coaching.  It will take a generation to deliver that cultural and philosophical change but we believe that if every club steps up to the plate and requires every coach to receive that training, which directs them on how to address this challenge, we will see a sea change within the association over the coming years.  We are delighted with the fact that, as I mentioned, 220 clubs applied to get involved in the healthy club project.  One of their big motivations is to address that kind of culture within their own clubs.  We see that project as being a further antidote to the win-at-all-costs ethos that can unfortunately carry across all codes.  I played pretty much anything with a ball as I was growing up and I unfortunately experienced that attitude myself.  The drop-off rate is one of the factors but the issue is multifaceted.  <\/p><p> I am excited to hear that, when a club lost those players through bad practice, another club was ready and able to provide something for those young people.  It is essential that we have a sufficient network of opportunities for young boys and girls to enjoy physical activity regardless of whether they do so under our own particular code.  In fact, I would go further and ask how we imbue a love of not just sporting activity, but activity in general among young people during the formative years of their lives that they will carry right throughout.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018061300002#H03300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Regan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":273,"content":"<p>One of the other barriers-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018061300002#J00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I must give Mr. Regan my apologies.

In my experience it is especially the case with women bringing their children to GAA games and, indeed, soccer games and things like that.  That is my personal experience.  If a child is excluded or removed from the pitch or training ground - primarily the pitch because obviously there would not be much competition on a training ground - it is a bit of an issue.

I would actually go a little bit further and say that it is a big issue.  We introduced the respect initiative in 2009.  It outlines the behaviour that is expected on the sidelines in GAA grounds.  It has not had the impact we would have hoped that it would have had at this stage.  We launched our new strategic plan on Friday which covers 2018 to 2020.  It has explicitly called for a rigid implementation of the respect initiative right across the association.  Initially it specifically targeted juvenile games.  I know I keep returning to the healthy club project.  It is great to have a national code but an implementation arm is needed beyond even our traditional network of clubs.  We need clubs themselves to show leadership and to say that this is not acceptable within the club.  When the 150 clubs signed up at the provincial orientation days last month, they received a welcome pack which included pitchside signage outlining what kind of behaviour is accepted there.  At the moment the implementation committee for the new strategic plan is exploring how each of the actions are going to be distributed across the association.  I can assure the Chairman that the respect initiative will be getting the kind of support it needs to address that very important issue.  The healthy club project has provided an unexpected and very welcome development in that it has opened the door for female leadership within the association.  Some 50% of healthy club officers are female and 50% of the members of our national health and well-being committee are female.  The Chairman is exactly right.  We see that positive influence shining a light on these areas which the more male-dominated attitudes may, perhaps, have overlooked somewhat in previous years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018061300002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":278,"content":"<p>On that, and without being 100% serious about it, I am sure there are historic reasons for the fact that camogie is called something different from hurling and that it exists as a name.

I remind members to switch off their mobile phones or put them in silent mode.  The purpose of this meeting is an engagement with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee, on the work of the General Affairs Council.  I am glad she and her officials were able to take time out of their busy schedule to be here today.  They are all very welcome.  The next meeting of the General Affairs Council takes place in a couple of weeks.  The committee's engagements with the Minister of State on her work in the Council on the strategic issues facing the European Union are useful, particularly in light of what is happening in England.<\/p> <p>  The General Affairs Council agenda is likely to be full.  As we cannot cover all the issues, we will focus in particular on the Brexit negotiations, the future of Europe's work, the Government's position on the enlargement perspective for the Western Balkans and the future budget of the EU.  We had an interesting meeting yesterday with an official from the European Commission on the Commission's proposal for the future budget, which I am sure will be added to in today's discussion.<\/p> <p>  Before I invite the Minister of State to make her opening statement, I remind everyone that the normal rules of privilege apply.

As always, I am delighted to be here.  It has been a particularly busy period since we last met.  There have been many developments and so as mentioned by the Chairman I will confine my remarks to the four key areas.  If there are other areas on which members have questions I am happy to deal with them in the questions and answers session.  As highlighted by the Chairman the four key areas are the current state of play in the Brexit negotiations, which I am sure is top of most people's agenda at this time; the debate on the future of Europe, including the national citizens' dialogue which concluded last month - I take this opportunity to thank the chairman and all members who attended the events throughout the country and also the final event; the EU enlargement perspective for the Western Balkans, particularly following on from the summit in Sofia, which I attended with the Taoiseach; and the multiannual financial framework, MFF, which the committee addressed in detail yesterday with the Commission but on which members may still have questions.<\/p> <p>  I will start with the multiannual financial framework as it dominated much of the General Affairs Council which took place in March.  We had an initial discussion on the Commission's recent legislative proposal for the MFF, the EU's next seven-year budget framework.  This issue will also be discussed by the Taoiseach and other Heads of State and Governments at the European Council on 28 and 29 June, which is approximately two weeks away.  This is the beginning of the negotiating process between the Commission, the Parliament and member states, which will last into at least the middle of next year.  As the current framework runs to the end of 2020, it is crucial that agreement is reached before that deadline.<\/p><p>I warmly welcome the fact that Ms Jennifer Brown, an official from the Commission, travelled from Brussels to Dublin yesterday to address this committee and other interested stakeholders.  I am sure the committee is well-versed in the details so I hope I do not go over too much ground or repeat what was said by Ms Brown yesterday.<\/p><p> As with any organisation, it is fundamental that as EU member states, we agree on how much we can spend, how and when we spend it, and how to raise the money.  It is a question of adapting to the changing global environment and, most important, of prioritising competing and evolving requirements and demands.  Since last year, I have been running a series of citizens' dialogues or national engagements about the EU and we are asking citizens what they want to see, and this consultation on the future of Europe will feed into our position on how the EU allocates its resources.  The initial proposal was published by the Commission just over six weeks ago, on 2 May.  It was a highly anticipated publication and over recent weeks it has been further elaborated, with each sectoral package in turn being published.  These cover a wide range of areas in the EU's role, touching on agriculture, cohesion funding, the Erasmus programme, research and innovation, the EU's external actions including development aid, and much more.  The whole proposal runs to thousands of pages and it is now the subject of intensive analysis by all member states and the European Parliament.<\/p><p> The Oireachtas involvement has likewise begun, and I greatly appreciate this committee's engagement with the multiannual financial framework, MFF.  Given that the budget proposal by the Commission amounts to some &euro;1,135 billion and covers almost all aspects of our society and economy, it is only appropriate that a number of Oireachtas committees should offer their specific concerns and consider specific aspects of the package as they relate to their areas of responsibility.  Across all Departments, analysis is now being carried out, closely co-ordinated by the Department of Finance together with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Our representatives in Brussels will also be closely involved throughout the process.  Similarly, at EU level, a wide range of European Parliament committees and ministerial councils will closely debate and negotiate a final framework to ensure that our limited resources are spent in alignment with our agreed priorities.  The General Affairs Council, GAC, which I attend, will take a horizontal approach to the MFF negotiations, with input from almost all other council formations.  At the next meeting of the GAC, in two weeks, we will have a lunch discussion with Commissioner Oettinger, the first opportunity for member states to react in the round on the basis of all the sectoral proposals which have been published since the initial document six weeks ago.<\/p><p> The European Council meeting at the end of the month will also have an initial discussion on the MFF and it will give guidance on the likely timeframe for the negotiations.  There are strong arguments for completing the negotiations before the European Parliament elections in May next year.  There are strong arguments as to why such difficult and complex negotiations can take time.  Either way, the Government will not be found wanting.  The important thing, whatever the timeframe, is to get it right.  While it is too early to speak in great detail, we know so far that these negotiations will be particularly challenging for Ireland.  This is the first time that we will be negotiating an EU budget without the British contribution, and it is the first time that Ireland will be a net contributor from the outset.  As our economy recovers and grows, our contribution to the EU will grow.  In recognition of the broader value of our EU membership, the Government has stated that we would consider an increased MFF contribution from Ireland to address new and emerging EU priorities and challenges that we face.  We can only do so provided that our core interests are met and European added value is ensured.  Protecting the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, remains a priority for Ireland.  We are also supportive of a range of programmes to support jobs and growth, including cohesion funding, supporting research and innovation with the Horizon 2020 budget, digital Europe and the Connecting Europe Facility.  I am very pleased to see the proposal for increased funding for a further expanded ERASMUS+ programme.  I know the Commission has suggested that we double the amount of money being spent on our young people, which we need to consider in the overall context of the budget.<\/p><p> I will move on to the Brexit negotiations.  We moved on to a critical phase.  All phases have been crucial but we are now entering one of the last phases of the negotiations.  As members of the committee are aware, the overall objective is that the full legal text of the withdrawal agreement, as well as a detailed political declaration on the framework for the future relationship, should be concluded by the October meeting of the European Council.  In order to meet this objective, negotiations have been continuing between the EU and the UK teams in recent weeks and will further intensify in advance of the European Council in June, in less than two weeks.  The aim of these discussions is to make significant further progress on the outstanding withdrawal issues, including on the draft protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, and avoiding a border on the island of Ireland.  We see the UK's presentation last week of a paper on a temporary customs arrangement, which it sees as relevant to aspects of the island of Ireland backstop, as a welcome, though incomplete, step forward.  After its publication last week, Michel Barnier, while also welcoming this step, raised questions and concerns about the proposal.  The Commission is the Union&rsquo;s negotiator with the British Government on these issues.  We have to allow the Commission to address some of the concerns which it has already raised and to further negotiations on these issues.<\/p><p> The Government's focus remains on the outcome we need to see, of which a key element is ensuring the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  It is welcome that the UK&rsquo;s commitment to this is reaffirmed in its proposal and that the commitments and guarantees provided by the UK in the joint progress report of December 2017 and repeated by Prime Minister May in the March Council meeting and her letter to President Tusk in March have been reiterated.  While our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues, it remains essential that a backstop is agreed which provides certainty that, in any circumstances, and no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the wider EU-UK framework and future relationship, a hard border will be avoided.  We must have certainty in all scenarios on the commitments made on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  This certainty requires agreement on the protocol to the withdrawal agreement.  I therefore very much hope that there will now be further intensive negotiations and discussions between the British Government and the Commission before the European Council on 28 and 29 June.  As we have repeatedly stated, substantial progress is required by then.  We know that this week, more detailed negotiations are perhaps happening from a legal point of view and otherwise, and next week, higher level discussions between Barnier and Davis are to take place.  We will keep a watchful eye on how that progresses.<\/p><p> The debate on the future of Europe, which was energised by the UK's decision to leave the Union, is continuing across Europe.  This committee held its own very successful public outreach initiative and I look forward to seeing its findings when they are available.  Last November, the Taoiseach, accompanied by the T&aacute;naiste and me, launched Ireland's own national citizens' dialogue, which culminated in a major event at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham on 9 May, marking Europe Day.  I thank the Chairman for accepting our invitation to participate in the event, including as a panellist for one of the sessions.  It was very much appreciated not only by me but by all concerned.  I thank the members who attended and contributed on the day.  Between November and May, I travelled the country, covering 2,000 km getting to and from Galway, Cork, Limerick, Maynooth, Letterkenny, Navan and many other venues.  Hundreds of people turned out to our regional sessions and the level of engagement at each of them was impressive.  From the outset, we were adamant that this would essentially be a listening exercise.  To give some shape and continuity to the various dialogues, participants were encouraged to focus on the five questions posed to citizens deriving from the Bratislava Declaration, agreed by EU countries in 2016.  These centred on jobs; competitiveness and consumer rights; peace and security; better management of our natural and built environment; equality and fairness; and education and training in order to maintain the EU's competitiveness.  If there was a theme which emerged throughout these discussions, it is fairness.  People wanted to ensure fairness in an increasingly competitive world.  They want the environment to be protected so we can hand it on to future generations in a fit state.  There is also a demand for inter-generational fairness.  People want to ensure that our young people are given the best of opportunities when they start their careers and their families, and also that older people are able to enjoy their retirement in dignity and comfort.  Education at all ages and all stages in life played a key part in that discussion.<\/p><p> We are taking that information and compiling a report which I hope will feed into the wider consultations that are still taking place in Europe.  On 9 May next year, at a summit in Romania, EU leaders are expected to mark the culmination of this process with a renewed commitment to an EU that delivers on the issues that really matter to people.  We will be well placed at that stage to actively input into that summit based on the experiences of our national consultations.  Our consultations are over but we hope to continue our engagement with people in various different formats, so we will have a lot to input into next year's summit.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Let me now turn to the latest developments regarding EU enlargement.  Ireland is a supporter of the European perspective of the Western Balkans, and will continue to be.  I was pleased that the renewed focus on the region provided by the Bulgarian Presidency was reflected in the successful EU-Western Balkans summit on 17 May last.  At this summit, the Taoiseach and I were pleased to engage with our EU and Western Balkans counterparts across a range of issues.  In the summit declaration, the EU pledged unequivocal support for the European perspective of the Western Balkans, and the associated priority agenda set out six flagship initiatives to drive progress in the areas of rule of law, security and migration, socio-economic development, connectivity, the digital agenda, and good neighbourly relations in the Western Balkans.  It is our hope that implementation of these initiatives will lead to deeper continued engagement with the Western Balkans.<br\/><br\/>We believe that the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries must be a credible prospect in order to advance the stability and security of the region, and are clear that candidate countries must give the rule of law, justice and fundamental rights the utmost priority in terms of reform.  We need to encourage the Western Balkans to continue to pursue these reforms vigorously, and we, as the EU, need to give practical assistance and ensure our message is communicated effectively across the region.<br\/><br\/>The next discussions on enlargement will take place at the General Affairs Council on 26 June, which will review the European Commission country reports published in April and make recommendations for the coming period.  Four countries in the Western Balkans currently have EU candidate status.  They are Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia and Albania.  Of these, both Serbia and Montenegro are well advanced in their accession negotiations, while Albania and Macedonia have not yet opened negotiations.  Ireland will support opening negotiations with Macedonia and Albania in line with the Commission's recent recommendation.  Although significant work remains to be done in both countries, we feel they have made sufficient progress to warrant opening.  Opening would also serve as a signal of EU commitment and provide motivation to the region.  The Albanian Foreign Minister, Ditmir Bushati, visited Ireland last month.<br\/><br\/>I said I would touch on four topics but because I know the Chairman has a meeting later today I will briefly outline just one important issue that has been preoccupying the General Affairs Council, namely the issue of the rule of law and Poland, which was discussed at the May Council and which will be discussed again in the coming weeks.  Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans provided an update.  As the committee will know, the central issue here is the rule of law and its application in Poland.  Ours is a union based on shared values, including democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  It is essential that all these commitments be reflected clearly in the internal arrangements in all member states.<br\/><br\/>At the last Council meeting, the Commission informed member states that, while Poland had amended some of the changes recently introduced to the operation of the judicial system, these amendments did not address the primary concerns that have been identified by the Commission.  At the May Council, I welcomed the fact that dialogue had taken place and stressed that the dialogue should lead to an early outcome that addresses the very real concerns that have been identified.  This, I said, is clearly in all of our interests.  The Commission has now called for a hearing on the rule of law in Poland at the General Affairs Council later this month.  It is important that, in the time available, concrete proposals to address the outstanding concerns can be agreed by the Polish authorities and the Commission.<br\/><br\/>I understand the committee will be discussing this further with the Polish ambassador, who is to appear before the committee later this afternoon.  I wish the members well in those discussions.<br\/><br\/>As I said in my introduction, there are other issues I could discuss but I have taken up enough time.  I want to hand over to members to ask questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061300002#A00300","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The entire committee is grateful, as always, for the level of engagement she and her officials have had with it over her time in office.  It has been an interesting time, to say the least.<\/p> <p>  I will touch on all five key issues the Minister of State raised and work backwards.  On Poland, I agree absolutely that we need to protect the European values.  We must emphasise increased dialogue between the Polish authorities and the EU authorities over the coming weeks and months to ensure that when one signs up to the European Union one respects its rules.  A state has the ability to make the rules of the European Union but once it joins, it must implement them.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the multi-annual financial framework, we had, as Minister of State noted, a good discussion with the relevant Commission budget official yesterday.  I acknowledge the great challenge facing the Union as whole with the United Kingdom leaving and Ireland's position.  We need, however, to increase our commitment to the European Union.  It is actually a healthy reflection of the state of our economy and country that we are net contributors and that we will be required to increase our contribution.  We have received wholesale solidarity over recent years from the other 26 member states who are to remain in the Union, particularly regarding Brexit.  It is also important that we show that solidarity in turn.  I must agree, unfortunately, with the statement of our Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, that Ireland is not of a mind to contribute more to security and defence expenditure.  That is a matter we must examine.  The threats on the borders of our friends in Estonia, Greece and other countries are equally our threats if we truly believe in European solidarity.  I respectfully ask the Minister of State to bring this back into the discussions.<\/p> <p>  With regard to enlargement, I really welcome the agreement made by the Greek and Macedonian Governments on the name change, which will be put to the Macedonian people in a referendum.  Macedonia is a country I visited a number of times.  In a previous life, I was on the consultative committee on Macedonian accession.  There is considerable potential in this regard.  I truly believe in an ever wider and deeper European Union.  We need to examine the positives of enlargement but we must also examine the status of our candidate countries and make sure that we set down the Copenhagen criteria.  We require great sacrifices and changes but we also need to be returning the compliment.  We need to show there is a material benefit in order to make sure the pro-European sentiment remains in the countries in question and so we do not witness the kind of frustration that can arise among people who are waiting indefinitely to try to join the Union.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, with regard to the future of Europe project, I absolutely commend the efforts of the Minister of State in traipsing around the country over recent months.  The level of engagement between the Minister of State and European Movement Ireland at the civic dialogues was breathtaking.  It was fantastic to see crowds in places such as Letterkenny and beyond.  Huge crowds engaged with major questions.  To see the relevance of the European project in Irish people's lives now is phenomenal and reassuring.  Does the Department have a timeline for issuing the report on the future of Europe?<\/p> <p>  With regard to Brexit, I must consult a different page of notes, if the Minister of State does not mind.  Could she outline the process we can expect before the key Council meetings on 26 June and 28 June and the activities involving the EU negotiating team and its meetings with its British counterparts?  Irish officials were brought into various discussions in April.  Could the Minister of State outline where Irish Government officials may be required to have an input?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the paper produced by the UK Government last week, I agree it is absolutely incomplete.  It is not enough.  It does not respond to the political agreement of December or the repetition of that agreement by Prime Minister May in March, nor does it really acknowledge the European legal interpretation of those agreements.  Therefore, I welcome Commissioner Barnier's swift response and commitment to examining this.  I have been blown away by the solidarity on a European level.  It is such that we can hold a united, uniform position involving 27 sovereign governments, ranging from the far left to the far right.  It is very reassuring as an Irishman who is phenomenally pro-European.  It is also reflective of the European position by comparison with the British position, possibly.  A number of people have suggested that when we receive the paper, we should pause the negotiations.  I believe we need to do the exact opposite.  In the coming two weeks, we should intensify negotiations and really get the European and British teams get down to it and work towards a common path that will ultimately lead to what I hope will be a withdrawal agreement in October.  It will not be a good deal; there is no good deal.  Brexit will be bad.  This is a process of damage limitation and we need to engage in that process and try to limit the damage, not just for the rest of the European Union but also for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061300002#C00300","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, and her officials.

There is general recognition that the restoration of the 500-km Border is not a practical proposal so it will not be supported by the Irish Republic or the United Kingdom, nor will it be maintained by the European Union.

I am a former Minister of State with responsibility for trade and I was given responsibility by a former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, relating to the Single European Act.  I appreciate everything is possible within these negotiations and compromises can be made.  We should nevertheless look at the possibility of an economic zone within the European Union containing the United Kingdom and Ireland, both North and South.  This would guarantee the future of trade, unimpeded, between both islands.  That is absolutely vital to the interests of both islands.  All trade from the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland going outside that zone would be subject to whatever levies are agreed at the time and, naturally, the Republic would be part of the European Union and have the appropriate exemptions.<\/p><p> It is time for unique thinking in this.  We should look at the possibility that because we are in a such a difficult position compared with any other of the remaining 26 countries, we are unique.  In those circumstances, the Government must look at a different arrangement.  It should consider all possibilities.  What is in the best interests of this country and the United Kingdom?  We share the UK's interests and a good deal for the United Kingdom is a good deal for Ireland.  I also believe that unless there is a good deal for Ireland, we should do everything we can, whether that is vetoing the deal if it is not in our interest or negotiating it as far as possible.  I know our officials are in Brussels working hard; I also know the Government and the Minister are working hard.  We must absolutely state that Britain's removal from the European Union should not have a detrimental effect on Ireland.  It is my wish and I know it is the wish of most people.  It is a view shared by most of our friends at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in Sligo at the weekend who were very anxious for a deal to be made in the best interests of both countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061300002#C00400","speaker":"1393","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive overview of the issue.

I compliment her, her ministerial colleague and the Taoiseach on the tremendous stance they have taken and work done relating to Brexit in particular.  I will speak to the other issues in a moment.  I worry sometimes when I hear comments from negotiators on the British side resembling jingoism in the oldest form.  Reference was made by an individual in the past week to &quot;the enemy&quot; but we are not in a war situation yet.  If we allow ourselves to go down that road, we will eventually talk ourselves into it.  I refer specifically to the European Union.<\/p><p>There is much more at stake here than the UK and Brexit.  It is a brick in the wall and it could be the first brick to come loose.  The European Union has an obligation and duty to its member states to ensure the Union stands firm.  The EU did not decide that some member states should leave.  A member state decided to leave by itself on the basis of misinformation given by public representatives.  The information was erroneous and grossly misleading.  One member of the European Parliament spent 18 years undermining the European Union and its concept.  The only thing offered at the end of the day was nothing at all.  There were going to be benefits for everybody in the UK but there was nothing tangible when it came down to it.<\/p><p>European Union negotiators, including Mr. Barnier and his colleagues, should be complimented on the way they have handled this.  They are negotiating with us and on our behalf, so we must be very careful not to undermine them.  If we undermine them it would be an indication to UK authorities that all is not well and we are not all united.  In one fell swoop, the European Union could disintegrate.  That is what will happen.  If one brick is taken from the wall, it will come down.  There are people who want to hark back to older and better times, and so on, and I am not certain to what times they refer.  I am not sure if they refer to the empire that ruled before or the communist regimes of the past.  Do they prefer war when the last world war cost the lives of approximately 60 million people?  I do not know what some people are referring to when they are so determined to roll back the carpet.  We must be extremely careful and the Irish Government and European Union have adopted the most fortuitous position that could be found.  It is the only workable position, and deviation from it will lead to disaster.<\/p><p>It should be remembered that very little reference has been made by UK authorities to the fact that the Good Friday Agreement is an international peace agreement, signed, accepted and contributed to by the international community, including the EU and the United States.  All of a sudden it seems to be no longer relevant and is being pushed away.  We must be careful in the negotiations of compromises and what they might mean.  In the normal course of events it might be that compromises take place in negotiations but any compromise by the EU will be fatal.<\/p><p>I will very quickly go through other points, including enlargement.  I totally agree with the process and it is important that the western Balkans, a tinder box in the past, come under the strong influence of the European Union.  That includes compliance with the <i>acquis communitaire <\/i>and the regulations, as has been referred to with respect to the operation of the European Union.  In some countries there is a tendency to move independently of the European Union but membership entails compliance with the rules that prevail within the Union.  That is for a very good reason and the benefit of all, so no country can break out and make its own unilateral decisions for its own benefit, now or in the future.<\/p><p> I forgot to mention one thing on Brexit.  No country, however big or small, can be allowed to move away from the Union and improve its status as a result.  The Union would be finished then.  If one country breaks out and decides to get a better deal - for strategic, geographic or whatever reason - the Union is gone.  It cannot prevail in those circumstances.  We would be back to where we were in the \"good old days\", to which some people keep referring.  That is an appalling prospect.  I could spend time on other issues but I will not.  <\/p><p> We have all mentioned the peace process and the importance of ensuring the Union prevails.  The biggest single process in the history of Europe and the globe was the European Union itself.  It came together from the ashes of utter and total destruction when man's inhumanity to man saw new depths and the most appalling atrocities were accepted without demur.  We found out about them only afterwards.  Many people at the time, however, knew what was going on.  We need to learn from that.  It was a very bitter and costly experience.  If there are those who think there are advantages in harking back to that era, or something like it, they are wrong.  We do not need a war to prove that nor do we need the fragmentation of the European Union.  It has worked extremely well for the past 50 years and is capable of doing that into the future for as long as it takes.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061300002#D00400","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan.  From my own point of view, we know the Government and the Departments are going through the details but does the Minister of State have any initial impression or is it fair to ask whether Ireland can support the European Commission's proposal on the future budget?  I am thinking of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, in particular, following on from yesterday's meeting where we heard an outline of that.  From a constituency perspective, we are dealing with people worried about the future budget for CAP and what that will mean for our people on the ground and our farming community.  I often deal with people in that sector.  They are worried about the future for young farmers.  There is a drive on - I acknowledge work in this regard by the Commissioner - towards making it more attractive for a transition from the present generation of farmers to the newer generation.<\/p> <p>  As the Minister of State knows herself, farming in future will not be sustainable, unless the farm is large and has full time employment for any young man or woman wishing to take over a family farm.  I am worried and fearful for what future budgets are going to mean for transitions on what I call the family farm.  In the past, different schemes were available as incentives for farmers.  They were helpful because people, before they got older, were able to see the financial sense in transferring over to the younger generation.  Schemes such as the young farmers installation grants were helpful.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's view on this.

Things seem to be out of control for some time.  There was a bit of saving grace yesterday but there seems to be a lack of coherency.  I know one thing.  If it was our Government allowing things to carry on the way that things have been allowed to do so across the water, it would not be tolerated by the Government or by the Opposition.

I will come back with responses and the members can read them later.  I will address Senator Neale Richmond's comments first.  The increased commitment to the MFF does not identify what we are talking about in respect of that commitment and where that funding will go.  The overall negotiations are only starting to take place.  Senator Richmond's suggestions on increased security and defence will be fed back in and I will make sure the Minister hears them.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Senator on the status of the candidate countries from the western Balkans.  We need to support them as much as we can.  They have obligations to fulfil on the reform of the rule of law, justice and fundamental rights in their own countries.  We need to make sure we are extending the European hand of friendship and supporting them in all those areas.  The more visits we can make and the greater the presence we can have, at a European level, in those countries, the more beneficial it will be.  On the timeline for the publication of the future of Europe report, we hope to have it published by the end of this summer.  We will ensure that all the members of the committee receive the published report and afterwards, if needs be, we could discuss it here if any of the members want to go through it.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Richmond also asked about the process between now and the June summit, and in particular the negotiations and discussions taking place following the publication of the document by the UK Government last week.  A further round of intensive discussions and negotiations is considering some of the legal aspects.  The legal team is looking at the document, how feasible elements of it are and whether it is a basis for further discussions and negotiations.  That will then feed into the fifth round of negotiations between Mr. Michel Barnier and the EU task force and Mr. David Davis and the UK Government.  That will be the fifth of five.  The last one was last week.  <\/p> <p>  A question was also asked about the Irish involvement leading into the summit.  Our officials, here in Ireland, in Brussels and throughout Europe, are engaging daily with the EU task force.  Any information needed on the Irish issue or protocol is, of course, fed into that process.  Mr. Michel Barnier and Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker will visit Ireland next week.  They will make known their thoughts and sentiments on the discussions to date on the proposal paper published last week.  We will have in-depth discussions on that and we will make known our comments in the summit the week after.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Richmond raised the fact that there are a number of concerns on the customs document.  Mr. Barnier was very clear, when it was published last week, that three questions needed to be addressed. First, is it an operational text and will it ensure there is no hard Border on the island of Ireland.  The answer to that is \"no\" because it is only one part of the Irish protocol - regulatory alignment is another key part of it.  It is, however, an element of it, so we have to welcome that part.  Does it impact on the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union is the second question.  Questions on that, and the more technical detail, have been asked this week.  The final question is on whether it is an all weather solution and will it work in all circumstances.  Concerns were raised because of suggestions of a 2021 date mentioned in the document.  A backstop for us is what it says it is.  It is there unless and until another solution is found.  We and the EU task force have been very clear on that.  We have to allow continued discussions and negotiations on the document to happen.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked as well on a pause in the negotiations.  We do not see that happening.  It would only further jeopardise the process and the likelihood of us reaching an agreement by October.  Instead of pausing it, we need to increase and intensify the discussions and negotiations in as much as we can.  Senator Leyden suggested we need to think outside of the box.  I agree.<\/p><p> On the idea of a specific economic zone for just Ireland and the UK, it would essentially suggest Ireland also leaving the EU if we were to have in place a different system or measure from the rest of Europe.  The most recent survey undertaken shows that 92% of Irish people want to remain within the European Union, so I would not agree with any suggestion that we be in any way separate or different.  We have a huge amount in common with the UK, not just in terms of trade but also historically and in the links between our people.  There is &euro;65 billion worth of trade between Ireland and the UK overall.  However, this represents between 16% and 17% of our trade, although that percentage is much higher for agriculture.  The EU represents 35% of our overall trade.  While we are very much focused on getting the best outcome with the UK, that will be achieved through the wider EU-UK future relationship.  Separate from the backstop, we are focusing our energy to make sure we have as close and comprehensive as possible future relationship between the EU as a whole and the UK.  I agree that we would want there to be as little disruption as possible to the lives and livelihoods of our Irish citizens.  That is our key priority.<\/p><p> Senator Coghlan raised the issue of the votes in the House of Commons yesterday.  While I do not want to get into internal UK politics, the votes are still being discussed and there have been a number of amendments.  It is very clear that come what may, whatever result we have in terms of an overall agreement on the withdrawal Bill, come October the House of Commons will have a part to play in the overall agreement of the deal that is reached.  We also know, however, that other member states will have to bring back any deal to their own Governments for ratification.  We want to ensure this happens by October so that other countries have an opportunity to ratify the agreement in their own individual Parliaments.  <\/p><p> Deputy Durkan raised the issue of supporting Monsieur Barnier.  I fully agree.  At every General Affairs Council we have attended, Ireland and the other 26 member states have fully endorsed the manner in which he and his negotiating and task force team have been carrying out the negotiations and this support will continue.  He made it very clear that no country can be better off outside of the EU than it was when it was inside it.  A number of outlines have been made in respect of ensuring that the Single Market's four freedoms of movement are upheld, particularly in terms of the customs union.  It is clear there can be nothing that interrupts the integrity of either of those and that is our position also.  <\/p><p> The Deputy is absolutely right that the EU is the best example of a peace process that we can see anywhere in the world.  While the EU is not expressly mentioned very often in the document of the Good Friday Agreement, the EU membership of Ireland and the UK, and hence Ireland North and South, has through our membership of the Single Market and customs union removed those physical barriers and infrastructure.  Our EU membership has thus played a key part in bringing about the peace process and has allowed people to go about their lives as they have for the past 20 years.<\/p><p> The Chairman made some remarks on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  We are in the very early stages.  Various sectors have been publishing their initial reports on it over the past six weeks.  There is still a lot of discussion to be had on the CAP.  The Minister, Deputy Creed has met a number of his counterparts from Spain, France, Portugal, Greece and Finland to suggest that the proposed 5% cut should not happen and that we should essentially have the same budget as the last time.  That is why we are saying we are willing to pay more money.  However, we want to see that our key concerns and priorities around the CAP, cohesion, research and innovation and investment are upheld as well.  The discussions will be going on for some time.  We will give our initial reaction in the next two weeks at the General Affairs Council.  We will do everything in our power to make sure our key concerns, particularly the CAP budget, will be addressed and we will make every effort to ensure that budget is impacted as little as possible.<\/p><p> By the June European Council we have said we want to see as much significant progress as possible.  If we do not see it, the idea of reaching an agreement in October will be in jeopardy.  While we have had an additional proposal on the customs element of the backstop, we would very much like to see additional progress on the regulatory alignment piece of the backstop, which is in a sense bigger than the customs element as a key part of ensuring we have no border on the island of Ireland.  We have two weeks left.  Intensive discussions are happening this week and a further round of negotiations is taking place next week.  We will then have a greater sense of whether anything else will be proposed by the UK Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061300002#E00500","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":324,"content":"<p>It is very important that I clarify something.  I am speaking in my own capacity as a Member of the Oireachtas and one of its longest serving Members.  I am floating these ideas at this stage to at least get people to think.  I floated them in Sligo at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and there was a tremendous response from all sides.  All who were there felt there was some merit in looking at this.  It is like the regulatory arrangement about which the Minister of State is talking.  That is a special arrangement.  I am not advocating in any way that Ireland be a lesser member of the European Union after Brexit takes place.  We must consolidate our position but we must recognise that we make up about 1% of the population of the EU.  The effect on us as an island off an island is unique within the European Union.  The Good Friday Agreement, as mentioned by my colleague, is unique within the EU and was endorsed by it and the United Nations.  There are cross-border operations in place which must continue after Brexit.  I am talking about joined tourism, fisheries and all those issues.  They are unique and cannot be scrapped after the UK leaves, if it actually leaves.  That is not certain yet.  Those bodies will still continue and will have to be recognised by the EU and will have to continue in place.<\/p> <p>  I understand the unionists' point of view that they will not accept a border on the Irish Sea.  The border between the United Kingdom and Europe will be across the Channel.  I can understand their worries in that regard but other than that, they want to see the continuation of trade between North and South.  This is a unique situation.  I am saying to the Minister of State's officials here and in Brussels that they should be prepared to think outside the box.  From my experience as a Minister of State with responsibility for trade, when we and the UK put forward proposals, they were supported by our colleagues in the European Union.  We never had a vote when we negotiated the Single European Act and the representative at that stage was John Redwood, MP, who is now a Brexiteer - but that is another day's work.<\/p> <p>  I am throwing out this as a point of debate today.  I ask the Minister of State to at least consider these issues as a possible last resort solution.  The Minister of State must not feel that Monsieur Barnier and the European Union will reject unique situations in the context of Ireland's unique position.

Michel Barnier, the task force and the 26 other member states have already recognised that Northern Ireland is a unique scenario.  That is why we have the Irish protocol.  It is why the Irish issue was one of the three key issues in phase one and continues to be one of the key issues being discussed.  It will be probably the main issue for discussion at the June European Council in terms of the overall Brexit discussion.<\/p> <p>  As the Senator has pointed out, there are indeed many areas of co-operation North and South, including electricity, tourism, health and agriculture.  At least 142 such areas have been already identified by the UK Government itself.  That is very much part of the Irish protocol and it is what we are working towards.<\/p><p>The task force has been very clear that the backstop and the unique scenario for Northern Ireland cannot be applied to a whole-of-UK position.  This is one of the concerns that was raised when it was suggested that customs proposal could apply to the UK as a whole, including Northern Ireland, but as a temporary backstop measure.  We have consistently said that the backstop would be specific to Northern Ireland and that business would not have to change rules and regulations more than once.  The transition is there to ensure it has the time to adapt if it was then, as a whole, to have to change.<\/p><p> Essentially, we are talking about the future relationship and obviously the backstop is very separate from the future relationship.  In terms of Ireland and the UK having the best relationship possible into the future and Ireland getting the best outcome out of this because, while North-South is important, east-west is equally important and that will have to be dealt with.  We have to work to the best possible outcome of a future relationship between the UK and the EU as a whole.  Obviously that is our priority in terms of dealing with the Border issue and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, but we must have the backstop separate from that to ensure our interests are protected.  In that regard, it cannot apply as a whole to the UK; it must be specific to Northern Ireland.  We will obviously work to ensure that what was agreed before Christmas in the December joint report is translated in full into a legally operational text that will apply and that will be part of the withdrawal agreement in October.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061300002#F00300","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528894800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>The problem is that the DUP will not accept that.

That is not the way those negotiations should take place.<\/p> <p>  A country decided to leave the European Union of its own accord.  It has been repeatedly stated that Brexit means Brexit, regardless of what anybody else thinks.  That is fine, but there are consequences arising from that for the country leaving as well.

I think it shows a weakness in its government and its opposition.  There is no alternative.  There is only one show in town, which worries me.  Brexit means Brexit and so they are going anyway.  If others want to follow, they can do so.  That is what it means.<\/p> <p>  We are at a very precarious point.  We need to hold our nerve.  We need to fix our vision firmly on the interests of our European Union, uphold the principles in that and not deviate from it.  If we do, we will be the weak part.  We will become an appendage of the UK, which will be a dangerous place to be.  They will be speaking for us because they are going.  We need to be cautious about it.

However, the British cannot dislodge the fundamentals of the European Union on their way out.  They cannot destroy the European Union on their way out.  They cannot reform it in such a way as to make it unworkable.  They cannot create an option for others to follow that will entitle them to envisage an improvement arising from being outside the European Union.  In other words, as the saying goes a house divided within itself cannot stand.<\/p> <p>  Based on my reading of European history, we are in a very precarious position.  Of most concern to me is that the UK authorities seem to be hell-bent on going in this direction.  They treat the debate as if they were releasing themselves from oppression.  When we listen carefully to the dialogue, we pick up many warnings that we need to keep in mind.  In the course of negotiations, there is only one place we can be.<\/p> <p>  The UK never took ownership of the European Union.  It never regarded the European Union as being part of its territory - politically, socially or economically.  It was always a them-and-us situation.  If the European Union member states wish to go about it in that fashion, they could all decide at some stage to go back to the old days when they were much better.  Were they much better then?  That is salutary thought for us all.

I am joined by Dr. Kathleen MacLellan, director of the patient safety office, and Mr. David Keating, principal officer in the patient safety office.<\/p> <p>  The legislation has been developed to facilitate the creation of a comprehensive, far reaching system of regulation to oversee all hospitals in the State, public and private, as well as providing the Minister for Health with powers to designate certain activities as carrying a sufficiently high risk as to warrant their providers also coming within the ambit of the new regime.<\/p> <p>  The committee's agreeing to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny will contribute significantly to our progression of this important legislation.  As the committee is aware, the health service has been striving in recent years to place the safety of patients at the forefront of the work that is done.  There have been a number of initiatives in this regard over the past decade, including the creation more than ten years ago of HIQA, which is also represented here this morning, and the updating of much of the legislation on the professional regulation of healthcare workers across individual professions.  There is, however, something of a lacuna at present, whereby no specific legislation is in place on the operation of hospitals or other health service entities to minimum standards of clinical governance.  The proposed legislation seeks to rectify this.<\/p> <p>  The Bill has been developed over the past number of years by officials in the Department and a working group made up of key stakeholders from the HSE, HIQA, the Private Hospitals Association and the Forum of Professional Regulatory Bodies.  The introduction of a licensing system along the lines envisaged in the Bill was a key recommendation of the Madden report in 2008.  While acute hospitals are currently subject to thematic monitoring by HIQA, the powers of HIQA in this regard are limited.  The introduction of a system of licensing, however, will ensure that all hospitals, whether they are public or private, will operate to appropriate standards and will have the requisite governance arrangements in place to enable the delivery of the safest possible service.  We will, therefore, be able to have assurances, which we cannot fully have at present, on the patient safety operating frameworks that will need to be in place in all hospitals.  Such a framework will require management support and buy-in, a critical element of patient safety as the committee is aware, as well as patient engagement and accountability.  Clinical audit, as well as implementation of clinical guidelines, will be regarded as an integral part of this overall approach.<\/p> <p>  It should, however, also be acknowledged that the delivery of healthcare is an inherently risky activity and it is inevitable that things will go wrong.  As we say, the science is not perfect, the people are not perfect and the processes are not perfect so risk is part of the everyday delivery of healthcare.  For example, studies of adverse events worldwide have demonstrated that between 4% and 16% of patients admitted to hospital may experience one or more adverse events, up to half of which may be preventable.  In work published last year, the OECD estimated that more than 15% of hospital expenditure goes towards correcting technically iatrogenic, or preventable, medical mistakes or infections that people catch in hospitals across its member countries.  Expenditure in this country in excess of &euro;350 million is attributed by the State Claims Agency to healthcare patient safety claims for the years from 2012 to 2016.<\/p> <p>  The ability of the Irish health service to learn from mistakes and system errors also requires improvement.  We have, as the committee is only too well aware, seen similar issues emerge across many hospitals after an incident has occurred, often related to weaker than desired governance and leadership.  This legislation is part of our system-level efforts to respond to this situation but on its own it will not be enough, and in and of itself it will not provide an immediate solution to some of these issues.  In considering this, it is important to recognise it is part of a wider programme of reform, being driven primarily by the patient safety office in the Department of Health, which I mentioned.<\/p> <p>  There are a variety of other initiatives in this regard, including the publication of monthly patient safety statements by all hospitals in the State, which started originally as patient safety statements relating to maternity services, the establishment of a national patient advocacy service, the introduction of what we call a patient safety surveillance system, the measurement of national patient experience, the extension of the clinical effectiveness agenda comprising clinical audit and implementation of national clinical guidelines, the roll-out of a code of conduct for health service staff, the publication of annual reports of the national healthcare quality reporting system the next report of which is imminent, and the planned creation of a national advisory council for patient safety.<\/p> <p>  In addition, as the committee is aware, Government approval has recently been secured to prepare a new patient safety Bill that will provide for mandatory open disclosure of serious reportable events.  The Bill will also legislate for mandatory external notifications of incidents to the appropriate regulatory body for clinical audit, as well as the extension of HIQA's remit to the private hospital system.  This legislation will build on the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, enacted towards the end of 2017, which will provide a framework for the operational delivery of open disclosure, the regulations of which will be signed before the end of June.<\/p><p> As I have mentioned, the licensing Bill will apply to both public and private hospitals.  It will be an offence to operate a hospital without a licence.  Concerns have been expressed in the recent past about some private providers of cosmetic surgery services, for example.  We have had some direct experiences with providers that may not be operating to the expected standard.  This legislation will give us the capacity to respond to such situations.  We have simply not had that capacity up to now.  As I have said, the Bill will apply to designated high-risk activities which are conducted in other settings, such as private clinics.  The nature of the activity, as opposed to where it takes place, will determine the requirement for the licence.  Such activities might include the use of general anaesthesia.  As a result of recent experiences, screening services will also be included.  While such activities do not carry significant risks in and of themselves, we are aware from what has happened with the CervicalCheck programme that the highest standards must apply.  The activities to be designated will be determined after a full consultation process has been completed.  That will be subject to change on a continuing basis, given the powers that the Minister will have conferred on him through this legislation.<\/p><p> HIQA will be the licensing authority.  It will process applications for licences and monitor the performance of licence holders.  Regulations to be signed by the Minister will be used to establish the standards that licence holders will be required to meet.  The regulations will be enforced by HIQA.  This will ensure a level playing field across public and private services.  They will be closely aligned with the existing national standards for safer and better healthcare.  Where it is necessary in the interests of public safety, HIQA will have at its disposal a series of measures, up to and including the cancellation of a licence, which can be utilised.  HIQA will have the power to attach conditions to licences and to require improvement plans to be submitted.  The heads of the proposed Bill provide for a number of other offences and for the imposition of fines or terms of imprisonment, or both, depending on the nature of the offences.  In line with the recommendations in my 2014 report on the deaths of babies at Portlaoise hospital, a licensed provider must prepare a patient safety statement with information on clinical activity, outcomes and patient safety incidents.  Such statements must be updated monthly, published and made available to those who use these services.  Fees will be set by the Minister and will be payable with licence applications and applications to remove or vary a condition of the licence.  An annual levy is also proposed, with the intention that the system will be self-funding to the greatest extent possible.<\/p><p> The aim of the licensing legislation is to ensure health providers in Ireland are operating to minimum core standards so we can all have confidence in the clinical governance, safety, quality and effectiveness of the services being provided in the public and private systems.  As a key element of the wider patient safety systems approach we are bringing forward, we will look to have a greater degree of awareness of issues that arise within the system.  We will seek to provide assurances that patients are being informed of errors as they arise and that such errors are being reported appropriately to regulators.  Improved complaints and advocacy processes are being developed to assist patients who are unsatisfied with their experiences.  Ultimately, all the data generated through these activities should be used to provide insights for managers and clinicians within the health service regarding how to improve their own services before the cycle begins again.  I hope the committee will welcome this initiative.  I will be very happy to take any questions that members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528876800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Holohan.

I am joined by Ms Mary Dunnion, who is the chief inspector of social services and director of regulation; and Dr. M&aacute;ir&iacute;n Ryan, who is the deputy chief executive and director of health technology assessment.  We are pleased to be here to discuss the general scheme of the patient safety (licensing) Bill.  HIQA has 11 years of experience of regulating and monitoring Ireland's health and social care services.  Over that time, we have developed our knowledge of systems and models of international best practice.  Therefore, we are well placed to provide observations and advice on the significance of this legislation.<\/p> <p>  Before I discuss the main provisions of the general scheme, it is important to explain HIQA's current role in the healthcare sector.  Although HIQA is known as the State's health and social care regulator, we do not have the power to regulate public or private hospitals.  Our remit does not extend beyond monitoring the safety and quality of HSE-funded hospitals against the national standards for safer and better healthcare.  We monitor a number of key areas of risk, such as medication safety, antibiotic resistance, infection prevention and control, nutrition and hydration.  We have conducted full service reviews against the national standards.  Under section 9 of the Health Act 2007, we can conduct statutory investigations if there is a concern about the health and welfare of people using health and social care services.  Similar to our monitoring function, the recommendations HIQA issues on completion of investigations are not legally binding.  We do not have the power to oversee or insist on the implementation of our recommendations which, in the past, have gone unheeded.<\/p> <p>  I emphasise that HIQA has no role in the monitoring or regulation of the private healthcare sector.  In effect, there is no statutory oversight of private hospitals in Ireland.  Any organisation or individual is free to establish a private facility without restriction.  Last month, the Government approved a different patient safety Bill - based on a previous Health Information and Patient Safety Bill - which will extend the remit of HIQA to private hospitals and provide for mandatory notification of serious patient safety incidents to HIQA or the Mental Health Commission, as appropriate.  It is important to be clear that even under the provisions of this new Bill, HIQA will not have any enforcement powers, which will make Ireland an outlier in healthcare regulation internationally.  The new patient safety Bill will simply extend to the private sector our current powers to set standards, monitor compliance and undertake investigations.  My concern is that when this legislation is enacted, the public may be of the impression that the private healthcare sector is now regulated and, as a result, they, as patients, are protected.  Interestingly, a Red C poll conducted for HIQA last year showed that 83% of people believe private hospitals in Ireland are already subject to regulation.<\/p> <p>  I will discuss the general scheme of the patient safety (licensing) Bill as it relates to HIQA.  The Bill sets out the legislative framework for the introduction of a mandatory system of licensing for public and private hospitals and other providers of high-risk healthcare activities, which are known as \"designated activities\".  Under the Bill, as the licensing authority HIQA will process licence applications, monitor the performance of licence holders against regulations and standards and take enforcement measures to address non-compliance where there is a risk to the health or safety of the public.  Under the proposed scheme, HIQA will grant a licence to an applicant when a number of criteria have been satisfied.  When HIQA is considering a licence application, it will assess whether the licensed provider and the person in charge are fit and proper persons.  Persons in charge are nominated by the licensed provider and are described in the general scheme as the person with responsibility for managing the service on a day-to-day basis.  While HIQA must be satisfied that the person in charge is a fit and proper person for this role, the Bill does not explicitly outline the specifics.  It appears that this judgment is to be made at HIQA's discretion.  In the absence of any statutory underpinning of hospital groups, the licensed provider in a statutory hospital will be the HSE or a voluntary organisation funded under a section 38 arrangement.  In the case of private hospitals, it is likely that the licensed provider will be the body corporate - the legal entity that owns the hospital.  We understand that in situations of sustained non-compliance in an individual public hospital, enforcement will centre on the HSE directorate as the licensed provider.  Therefore, clarity on the status of the legal entity to be licensed is essential.<\/p> <p>  When determining whether a licensed provider of a private facility is a fit and proper person, HIQA will need to assess the character and competence of the licensed provider as well as all of its principal officers.  Principal officers are defined as directors, secretaries or members of the management committee.  This reasonable measure is broadly in line with how HIQA currently assesses the fitness of providers in designated centres.  However, the Bill explicitly precludes the regulator from assessing the character and competence of the principal officers of the HSE or voluntary hospitals.  This means HIQA will assess the fitness of the HSE or the voluntary organisation as a whole and will not be required to assess the character and competence of its principal officers.  In effect, this approach will treat private providers differently from public or voluntary providers and will limit the regulator's power to assess the fitness of individual managers in public hospitals.  It could result in circumstances in which the oversight of governance arrangements and competence of decision makers in public or voluntary hospitals is less rigorous.  Clear lines of accountability are essential to ensure hospitals, which are large and complex organisations, are well governed and provide good-quality and safe care to the public.  Our experience has shown that many failures in the provision of health and social care can be traced back to poor governance and a lack of accountability.<\/p><p>Applying different approaches to the regulation of private versus public and voluntary providers, specifically in terms of governance and financial capability, could lead to a lower standard of care in public and voluntary hospitals compared to private hospitals, and could be open to legal challenge by private providers and patients.<br\/><br\/>An additional point to note in this context is the requirement to assess the financial viability of the service provider.  According to the Bill, licensed providers will be required to submit evidence of their financial capability to carry on the business of a hospital.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, will assess the ability of the intended licensee to meet the costs of carrying on the hospital or the designated activity and also the licensee&rsquo;s insurance indemnity provisions and other financial assurance instruments to cover liabilities.<br\/><br\/>HIQA welcomes this measure, and it is something we advocated for in our discussions with the Department of Health.  However, this test of financial capability only applies to private providers, not to Health Service Executive, HSE, and voluntary organisations. There may be an argument for excluding the HSE from such a test as it is fully funded by the State; however, it would be prudent to require voluntary providers to also prove their financial capability.<br\/><br\/>In this context, it is crucial that legislators recognise that healthcare is continually evolving and that current service models may not be suitable in the future.  We believe reform of the way HIQA registers and regulates services is needed to respond to the various existing and emerging models of care in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>I am sure many members would question the readiness of the acute hospital sector to meet the regulations and standards that will arise from the proposed licensing system.  When independent regulation was introduced into the social care sector, significant investment in many nursing homes and residential centres for people with disabilities was required to make them compliant with the regulations.  It is reasonable to expect that the hospital sector will be no different.<br\/><br\/>I note that the Department of Health proposes to carry out a regulatory impact assessment, RIA, to examine the costs and benefits of introducing a licensing framework.  The results of this RIA must be examined closely as it is likely to give an indication of the level of public investment needed to bring the hospital sector up to the required standards.<br\/><br\/>There has been a good deal of discussion in recent years about reforms to our health service.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report and the health service capacity review both looked at our future needs and, if implemented, will require significant levels of funding.  This level of investment, coupled with the resources required to meet licensing regulations, could represent a massive commitment of public funds.<br\/><br\/>Based on our research on healthcare regulation internationally and our experience of social care regulation, HIQA strongly supports the proposal to introduce a system of licensing to the healthcare sector to bring Ireland in line with our OECD peers.  HIQA&rsquo;s experience in the social care sector has shown that regulation drives improvement, and we welcome the proposals contained in this Bill.  Retaining the <i>status quo<\/i>is simply not a viable option.  Nonetheless, a number of issues still need to be ironed out.  Clarity on the legal status of the licensed provider is necessary, as is a greater emphasis in legislation on effective governance and clear accountability at the level of the provider.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Health must be realistic about resourcing HIQA as the regulator of hospitals and other designated activities.  Hospitals and clinics providing healthcare services are complex organisations, different from the types of services HIQA encounters in social care regulation.  The proposed model of regulation will require competent and robust assessment by an adequate, skilled and knowledgeable workforce, not only in the area of front-line inspection but also in terms of managerial, administrative and technical support.<br\/><br\/>I wish to thank members of the committee for inviting us here this morning.

Why exclude the private sector from the supervision and monitoring that is required?  That leads to my next question.  If the private sector is excluded, I cannot ask for a comparison between the number of incidents reported from the private sector and the public sector, which would be crucial information for the purposes of this exercise, so I will ask the question in a different way.  From the cases already appearing in the public arena from the public and private sectors, it must be possible to have some idea as to where the incidents are originating, even with the limited supervision taking place now.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the procedures in hospitals, from the experiences and the litigation to date, has it been found possible to take steps to the operation of various hospital inpatient or outpatient clinics or whatever the case may be to reduce the degree to which accidents or incidents can take place?<\/p> <p>  The next question relates to the costs associated with that.  It appears to me that the costs arising from litigation are rising rapidly.  That may or may not be true but it appears to me to be so.  What procedures are being followed?  For example, would it not be better to examine a case in a without prejudice setting to see what can be resolved without necessarily going through the entire litigation process?  I have nothing against litigation but if the problem can be resolved quicker and as effectively, it should be followed.<\/p> <p>  Finally, from the cases already referred to that have been resolved in the courts to the satisfaction of the offended party, what percentage of the total of those were resolved on the steps of the courts without judgment in the formal way?  Is that information known?  It should be known.  It is a statistic that should be readily available.  Of the settlement costs accruing to the complainants, what are the associated legal costs?  I ask that question to determine if it would not be better to have a resolution process dealing with these cases that would short-circuit the long legal process and the payment of legal fees and try to accommodate the complainant, not accepting liability that could be abused in the future, which could be examined?  I would like information on those issues.  I have raised questions about them many times in the House previously.  I believe we have come to a juncture now where it is imperative that we learn from past mistakes, put in place measures to ensure we do not find ourselves in that position again and that the complaints are dealt with in a way that is cost effective and efficient and meets the requirements of both sides to the best of our ability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#K00500","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528876800,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murphy O'Mahony for her questions.  To answer the one about how one would monitor, there is a benchmark, the national standards for safer better healthcare which exist already and are mandated.  The monitoring activity around issuing a licence would be aligned to what the licensing regulations will be.  Dr. Holohan spoke about them and they will be determined by the Department of Health.  The normal process thereafter is that we will monitor compliance with those regulations.  There is nothing secret in that because that monitoring activity will have beside it guidance for people and it has a judgment framework, which shows how to make the judgment on the compliance.  One would welcome the concept of licensing in healthcare because we can see its benefits in social services.  It is important because there will be a huge engagement with the sector first.  While public hospitals are used to seeing the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, in a certain way in the context of monitoring, the private sector has no exposure to it.  There will be engagement with people to bring them to an understanding of the approaches we take.  Any monitoring activity is coupled with guidance in terms of documentary evidence and a dialogue between the providers and us.  Then, so that somebody does not get a surprise, we always engage at the end of an inspection with those responsible for delivering the service in order that they know what we have seen, found and what our judgments are.  How we make the judgment and what is expected when that judgment is made is very clear in the legislative framework and in our communications with providers.  That is compounded by our experience which evolves all the time and we, as regulators, are maturing because we have been here for 11 years.  The greatest learning is that the people we inspect understand how we make the judgments.  That is always available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#L00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Dunnion"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528876800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I will address one point that Deputy Durkan made.

In his opening statement Dr. Holohan referred to a range of initiatives being promoted through the National Patient Safety Office.  We work in partnership with several of those initiatives.  The national patient experience survey, the health technology assessment, the development of standards and regulation all play their part in creating a safer environment and promoting a higher quality service.  That is HIQA's involvement in prevention.  I do not know if colleagues from the Department would want to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528876800,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I will reply to some of the questions.  In response to Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's first question on why we are excluding the private, we see what we are describing here as ultimately a full set of licences that will apply to public and private.  The step we are proposing along the way, as part of the proposed patient safety Bill recently approved by Government, is to pull out the patient safety parts of what was the health information and patient safety legislation which was considered by this committee.  The committee made substantive observations about the non-patient safety parts of that legislation and recommended it be broken into separate components.  That is happening now and the patient safety legislation is moving forward under its own steam and will move faster as a consequence.<\/p> <p>  One part of that will be to extend HIQA's existing powers.  That is fully recognising the point made earlier by the chief executive officer, that we know those powers are not adequate.  It is a stepping stone to take us some way towards being able to address issues that currently arise but we are not at all saying we are satisfied that it is enough.  Licensing ultimately will be the full set.  It will take time to get to a point where that legislation is enacted, where the regulations are in place, where the system is prepared in the way that Ms Dunnion described, for that to be fully operational.  Our proposal is that we extend of HIQA's existing powers, even though we know that is not the full ideal.  One example, which the committee may recall because it considered it, is the case of the defective breast implants some years ago.  A group of women dealt with completely in the private hospital system found themselves unable to seek any form of engagement or redress.  This brought home the extent to which the public is vulnerable in that situation and the limited powers we have other than to simply appeal, as we did, to reasonable people, who turned out not to be reasonable, and to the providers of those services asking them to respond to, and fulfil their duty of care to, those women they had brought into their services.  People were harmed and exposed as a consequence.  The extension of HIQA's existing powers, although not ideal, will allow us to address some of those kinds of issues.  Cosmetic surgery comes up from time to time as an issue when people seek services outside the public system without protection.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked a broad question about patient safety.  Without giving a full treatise, it is important to point out that everything we do in patient safety is not just a question of regulation.  There are other systems of regulation.  The professions in most of the major healthcare providers, such as the Medical Council or the Nursing and Midwifery Board, are either currently regulated or new professions being brought into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU, and we are continually extending the powers and modernising those frameworks.  A great deal of work has been done on audit and clinical guidelines.  We have established that the national level of capacity for the Minister to approve national clinical guidelines on major issues and many of the recommendations coming out of important reports such as the Halappanavar report, the material we prepared on the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise and further recommendations arising from previous HIQA reports, have led to major national clinical guidelines being developed with the aim, or in the interest, of creating a common standard.  One example is the idea of an early warning score to allow patients be monitored in a hospital environment so that those who are deteriorating can be picked up.  The international evidence is very clear that this can have an important impact on in-hospital mortality.  We now have that national standard in this country.  Through these means we are giving ourselves a stronger mandate to be able to support and assure the implementation of those standards because, even though we have mandated that standard, I could not sit here, hand on heart, and say this is being fully implemented and in the best way possible in every clinical situation in which it should be.  Giving ourselves the means of being able to see and assess that is part of what this legislation aims to do.<\/p> <p>  We have increased the range of reporting and referred to the patient experience survey.  There is a range of other matters such as reporting of serious reportable events, which now forms part of the monthly public relations reports of the HSE.  We will in time make all of that mandatory as part of our mandatory disclosure.  There is already an administrative system providing those reports in public and we have mentioned our national healthcare quality reporting system.  These all involve increasing the level of reporting and transparency.  It is not easy for the healthcare system to put itself in a situation where it puts more and more of this kind of information out into the public domain because, of course, it creates questions.  It is a necessary part we believe of engaging with the good and the not so good in the delivery of healthcare and not putting our heads in the sand.  The first step in improving patient safety, as in most other aspects of life, is acknowledgement and acceptance of the scale of the problem we have in the first instance.  Every country that has been trying to do this has had this experience.  Much has been said, and we have had an opportunity to talk to this committee on many occasions, about open disclosure and we can talk more about that.  We have a national open disclosure policy and we are supporting that with legislation to create the safe space and mandatory reporting of serious reportable events.<\/p><p>That has been done because, as I have stated, the only thing in which we are interested from a health system point of view is full, proper and well structured open disclosure in respect of every clinical incident.  Patients simply must know, and that has been our policy position all along.<\/p><p> Patient involvement is another key element.  We have increasingly involved patients in the development of policy, the oversight of its implementation and a range of other measures.  Without boring the committee with all the details, I will cite some examples.  There was direct patient involvement in the development of the cancer and maternity strategies.  The patient experience survey is an example of that.  Two patients were directly involved in the committee overseeing work done in the recent past following an escalation from HIQA in regard to the national management by the HSE of serious infection by carbapenemase producing enterobacteriaceae, CPE, which are a type of superbug.  It is not always easier to have patients in the room when those decisions are being made but it is better and it works.  I offer those examples as a flavour of our efforts in this area.  We do not say that all our eggs are in the basket of regulation or the basket of licensing but it is an important additional strengthening of our implementation and oversight.<\/p><p> On the question of whether all activities will be licensed, the idea is that, without ruling anything out in the future, what everybody would understand to be hospital-type activities will be licensed.  Activities that do not take place within hospitals but are the kind of things that one would expect hospitals to undertake will be the subject of requirements for licensing.  That is why I mention things such as general anaesthesia.  If a person gets a general anaesthetic in a non-hospital environment, the fact that they are having a general anaesthetic generates------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528876800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>It is to do with the procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#M00200","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528876800,"counter":356,"content":"<p>Yes.

I think Mr. Quinn addressed some of the question regarding incidents and litigation.  We can get information to answer some of Deputy Durkan's specific questions on the proportion of cases because the State Claims Agency has been asked for and is providing that information to other committees which are considering similar questions.  I do not wish to mislead the committee.  The vast majority of cases dealt with by the State Claims Agency do not go to full hearing.

We are happy to come back and clarify that question.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's question on costs and rising costs is a fair one.  I point out in a general sense that the consideration of litigation is of importance and that we look at trends.  There has been a significant trend, in particular in regard to birth injuries.  The proportion of State Claims Agency claims relating to obstetric activities is very high and is increasing in this country.<\/p> <p>  The so-called patient safety surveillance was mentioned in passing in the opening statement.  It arises from work we did in Portlaoise, where it became clear that in respect of that hospital there were different pieces of information in different parts of the overall health system.  Some of the regulators, such as the Medical Council, HIQA, the HSE or the State Claims Agency had dealt or had engagement with issues there.  Different agencies at a national level had small pieces of the jigsaw but nobody was putting the whole picture together.  The claims experience of a service is one part of the picture.  The Department is trying to build and strengthen that so-called patient safety surveillance system so that we have a profiling of all the pieces of the jigsaw at any one point in time in respect of every hospital.  That is part of the function of the patient safety office.  If an incident occurs in a certain setting, one is able to put that into a better context than might previously been the case because one now has a better understanding of the care and practice in that setting.  Claims and understanding the claims experience is one of the aspects which feed into that system of patient surveillance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1528876800,"counter":359,"content":"<p>Is open disclosure practised in all hospitals?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#M00600","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528876800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Open disclosure should be practised in all hospitals, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1528876800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>That does not answer my question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#M00800","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528876800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I know it does not.

Rather, it is properly supporting a patient from the moment at which harm is recognised through fully helping him or her to deal with that and any consequences therefrom because his or her health can often be significantly impacted, sometimes in life-altering ways.

Front-line inspection activity would not be the only requirement.  Deputy Durkan discussed statutory notifications and reporting.  All regulation is reliant on information and intelligence.  We need information in order to derive risk profiles from across the sector.  It is not just information that we collect at the point of inspection but, also, that which we receive by way of statutory notification, complaints and unsolicited information from the public.  Although we absolutely need resources in respect of the management and front-line assessment of services, we will also need technical and administrative support to help us in the receipt, risk assessment and administration of large pieces of information.

We have worked closely with HIQA through our working group to look at the types of resources and requirements that will be required for HIQA to do this.  It is important to note that this year we secured through the Estimates an increase of &euro;3.5 million for HIQA to build on its functions over this year.  That is a significant increase to allow it to start preparing and to take on new functions.<\/p><p>Our intention in this Bill is for the licensed entity to be as close to the hospital as possible.  Hospitals are not established homogeneously across the public and private sectors.  We will work with the Attorney General's office and drafters to pin all of it down through the general scheme.  Internationally, it is felt that the closer a licensed entity is to the coalface of the delivery of a health service the better the processes.<\/p><p> Deputy Durkan mentioned clinical incidents and asked about the tracking of incidents across private and public hospitals.  We support that.  All hospitals are obligated to record all incidents, regardless of the level, on the national incident management system.  This builds capacity and resources in the public hospital system but we do not have access to incident management across the private sector.  However, as we move forward with the legislation we expect that the private sector will participate in the support systems by making the information available.  As Dr. Holohan said, we are looking at an analysis of incidents across the system because while they are tragic, requiring some issues be managed for individual patients and families, they provide significant learning for the system.  The international patient safety science field is about learning from patient safety incidents as quickly as possible, rather than over a year or two years, and acting as quickly as possible.  This is something we need to focus on in our healthcare system.<\/p><p> As the chief medical officer said, we have introduced a number of national clinical guidelines on foot of major patient safety events.  In addition to the early warning system, sepsis management has reduced mortality rates across all inpatients and the clinical handover is another clear patient safety measure.  The patient safety licence system gives us a real opportunity to ensure these measures are fully integrated across the whole system so that the public can be reassured.  Every month, patient safety statements will be published for everybody - the public, hospital staff and clinical governance within hospitals - to read.<\/p><p> We fully accept that we need to develop these systems much further within the private sector.  We have engaged very strongly with the private sector on the national clinical effectiveness committee and the sector has agreed, in principle, to implement the national clinical guidelines.  One of the current audits is of radiology and we have discussed how it can be implemented with both the private and public sector.  The first clinical audit was the trauma audit and that has contributed to the development of trauma strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#M01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kathleen MacLellan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528876800,"counter":369,"content":"<p>The legislation is expanding licensing but it is not introducing elements of enforcement.

I have come across open disclosure on many occasions.  If an incident occurs in which the medical team does not know exactly what went wrong, it can decide on an external review.  However, I have seen cases where there was agreement as to who would carry out the review but where the HSE administration interfered and the review was still to be completed 18 months later.  The medical people had a problem meeting the patients concerned because they did not have all the answers and they felt an independent medical review was the best way to get the correct information for those patients.  How do we intend to manage situations whereby a medical team does not know exactly what went wrong and wants a second opinion so that accurate information can be given to the patient?  What about the timeline in such cases?  We want open disclosure but we have to ensure the medical team does not give one view without having all the answers, while an independent review leads to a different opinion.  How does the office co-ordinate that?  Open disclosure is very important.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Holohan said that &euro;350 million was paid out between 2012 and 2016.  My understanding was that it was far higher than that.  Is it possible for the health committee to get the exact figures, both for compensation and legal expenses, for each of the past four years?  These are important because we are supposed to be learning from the process so that we can reduce the level of claims and the risks involved but it appears to be going in the opposite direction.  How will we deal with it without a handle on the number of claims that are coming in?  We need to learn from mistakes made in the past.<\/p> <p>  My third issue is the movement of personnel in the HSE.  Somebody spoke about learning from previous mistakes but how can we do that when a hospital has ten hospital managers in 18 years?  The average hospital manager stays in one hospital for 18 months so how can we have continuation and improve the standard of care if the administration keeps moving, meaning mistakes which have been made are not learned from going forward?  This is a question of accountability in respect of both the administration and the medical team.  There is a constant movement of people and some of them have responsibilities for one area on 1 January but for another area on 1 June, which is a big issue for the HSE.  It is something we need to deal with by giving people fixed-term contracts, especially at senior level in the HSE administration.<\/p> <p>  There have been examples of administrators overruling medical personnel.  I was speaking to a consultant recently who told me the administration had started dictating to them how to run their operating lists, asking consultants to do minor procedures first and then complex work at the end of the day.<\/p><p>As the Chairman will be aware, if one is doing a complex case, one should be fresh doing it.  It is probably the first thing one should be doing.  An administration was dictating how medical people should provide a service and do the work in a particular hospital.  How is that dealt with?  We want to reduce risk and improve the level of care but we have non-medical staff dictating to medical staff about how they should provide that level of care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#N00500","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528876800,"counter":374,"content":"<p>The witnesses should bank those questions while I bring in Deputy Louise O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#O00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1528876800,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I apologise for not being present earlier but I had to do a radio interview.

If they have, I will check the Official Report so the witnesses should not feel they need to answer them again.  I will go through them in the order in which each issue appears in the heads of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  My first question is on head 4, which excludes alternative and complementary therapies.  Will they be regulated elsewhere?  Is it the Department's view they do not need to be regulated?  I need to understand where that is coming from.  <\/p> <p>  Head 5 states: \"HIQA will continue to set non-mandatory standards for hospitals and designated activities and will monitor compliance with those standards.\"  I am not trying to be smart but, presumably, if they are non-mandatory hospitals, they could just say they are not doing it and HIQA would have nothing to monitor.  Was consideration given to making these standards mandatory given we have had difficulties and disagreements over what should and should not be mandatory?  People came down on the side of mandatory standards because that would be better.<\/p> <p>  Head 9 deals with statistical information to gauge compliance.  They may or may not provide it.  We are all discussing the availability or otherwise of information for a particular cohort of patients.  A lot of the work the witnesses do will be based on the information provided to them by providers.  If that information is not forthcoming, would it be safer to use the word \"should\" rather than \"may\" to make this compulsory?  <\/p> <p>  I have a concern about section 39F because the hospital groups comprise groups of hospitals and, therefore, there may be issues with individual hospitals and not with the group.  This is a question for the future.  When the hospital trusts and the groups are fully established, is it the witnesses' view that additional legislation will be required to take account of individual hospitals or will it be applied to the hospital group?  That will be difficult.  <\/p> <p>  Section 39Q refers to an appeal being brought to the District Court and section 39R refers to a belief there is a risk to the life or serious risk to the health and welfare of the patient.  It also caters for the service continuing to be delivered.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  I do not propose to go into that.  One of the issues we discussed at length was the difficulty of grading risk.  Doctors, consultants and medical staff appeared before us and said they did not feel comfortable grading risk.  That means risk would have to be graded.  We would have examine whether there is a serious risk to allow it to continue.  Perhaps a definition is needed under the section.<\/p> <p>  In the same vein, section 39AK provides  a hospital that has not applied for a licence can be allowed to operate until the outcome of the licence application is known.  That does not sit well with me.  If something is up and running and established, it becomes harder to revoke the licence.  It is also dependent on many other factors.  It is worrying that there could be a scenario where a facility is operating without a licence, notwithstanding the fact that some of the measures are not mandatory and so on.  <\/p> <p>  Under head 20, the proposed section 101A(2)(j), states there should be an appropriate system in place for the management of patient safety incidents.  Does this mean legislated for and mandatory open disclosure or something else?  I will introduce a Bill next Thursday that will provide for mandatory disclosure.  Is that what this means?  What is the appropriate system for the management of patient safety incidents?  I do not want to open a debate about mandatory versus non-mandatory because we have had that previously.

I accept his point and his description of the scenario is not unrealistic.  The key thing in the first instance is the maintenance of effective communication between the medical team and the patients.  At all times, the patient should feel that whatever information is available, including the limitations of that information, has been shared with him or her.  If the trust and confidence can be maintained in that way, that is the best means of ensuring patients are properly supported.  Patients often find themselves in a position where they have no recourse other than to litigation to get answers to basic questions because they feel the system has closed ranks and communication has stopped and broken down.  It often is not the situation that patients do not know something because the team does not know it.  Unfortunately, it is often because the team has stopped communicating effectively with the patient.  No relationship, in any walk of life, can be maintained in such a situation.<\/p> <p>  There are other factors that are part and parcel of the answer to the question.  The time that some investigations have taken to complete has been unacceptably long.  It should not take 15 months, as in the case the Senator mentioned.  Unfortunately, we have examples of investigations that have taken even longer than that to complete.  Work has happened, and is happening, on the setting of standards and outer limits for the period of time that should apply.  We can set out some more detail for the committee on that.  The nature and depth of an investigation should determine the time it takes.  Whatever information is known at a point in time should be shared with a patient.  That includes doctors telling patients they are not sure but they have a particular concern or worry and they are sharing it with the patient.  That constitutes the right kind of disclosure environment as opposed to one where doctors tell patients they cannot tell them anything until they know the outcome of something that will be months away.<\/p> <p>  On the question on the breakdown of costs, we will get the Senator the information.

It is not good, in terms of stability, to have continuing change of the nature he described.  An additional dimension is the movement of medical teams and other services.  By design, the provision of medical services involves the movement of staff on a continuing basis.  Work that has to happen in the future and which we have to get better at as a healthcare system relating to putting standardisation in place.  As a random example, junior doctors moving from one location to other may have to interface with a different prescription system for prescribing and writing up medicines.<\/p><p>Why should that be different in every hospital environment?  Why should it be a new learning that must take place separately in every hospital?  If teams are changing on a continuing basis, in as much as possible there should be standardisation of that which can be standardised and that reduce the risk to patients.  I refer to the ways in which medications are stored and all those kinds of things.  A lot of work is happening in the HSE as things stand to try, through its quality improvement programmes, to push on some of these kinds of issues.  However, I offer that just by way of example and I take the point the Senator made.<\/p><p> Regarding the question of administrative decisions, I would not support the idea that an appropriate medical decision be taken by someone other than the person who is appropriately medically qualified.  It is also fair to say, however - and I do not make this particular point in the context of the example the Senator has chosen - that there must be a situation in which doctors, in the provision of services, are open to the idea that there are ways and means of doing things that work better in some situations than others.  Sometimes one can encounter resistance.  Sometimes it can be the case that doctors will cite things like medical autonomy as a reason not to engage in something in which they do not want to engage.  I do not say that is what is happening in this situation.  It can be the case that there is good evidence around how one organises and schedules theatre lists, for example.  Perhaps not every surgeon will welcome such engagement coming from his or her leadership, and that does not mean they are wrong.  I see both sides of that argument.<\/p><p> All of Deputy O'Reilly's questions are new so perhaps I can address some of them.  Under head 4, alternative and complementary therapies are excluded.  There is no proposal at this point in time to make regulations in this regard.  I had an opportunity to talk a little about this in the context of our recent discussion at this committee about chiropractors.  As it stands, we have no plans to regulate alternative and complimentary therapy.<\/p><p> Regarding HIQA, I take the points Deputy O'Reilly has made about the monitoring of compliance.  The regulations the Minister will have power to make under the Act will essentially set out the mandatory standards and HIQA will set other standards, which will be non-mandatory.  Perhaps this \"need\" to do things which will be the subject of mandatory standards is too loose a way to describe it.  Then there will be things that will be, dare I say it, nice to do.  In any environment, one has a floor set of standards that must simply be in place for basic safety, governance and operation of a service.

As we move into hospital groups, more and more services will be organised at group level rather than hospital level, and it is a matter of trying to reflect this in the flexibility of a scheme that will have to operate not just now, but into the future.  We, therefore, want hospitals to buddy up in respect of services that no one hospital provides safely on its own.  For example, we should not be in a situation whereby a hospital that is too small to operate fully does not derive some benefit from the fact that it is part of a group with a larger hospital providing similar services and co-operation is not developed.  The HSE's plans regarding hospital groups will take us into all that.  The licensing arrangement should be supportive and reflective of that.  That is the flexibility we want.<\/p> <p>  There are some other perhaps more technical points about some of what I have been saying and some of the other heads the Deputy asked about.

This is the transitional arrangement.  Our working group, which comprised HIQA, the Private Hospitals Association, the HSE and ourselves, had quite a bit of discussion about this as to whether one would turn around and say \"You cannot operate until you have a licence\" or \"You can operate without a licence\".  The reason we came down on this was that someone operating a hospital, be it private or public, must apply for a licence within three months.  Once the hospital applies for a licence, it will come in under the purview of HIQA.  Ms Mary Dunnion will probably speak quite well about a well-established risk assessment process as to which hospitals to go into first.  We talked about the logistics of this as well in the working group.  We probably have up to 60 hospitals, perhaps even more, that will need to be licensed.  It is not feasible to check through all those mandatory regulations within a month, two months or three months.  It is important, therefore, to create a system.  Within the general scheme we have created a system whereby all these hospitals will come under the authority of HIQA as quickly as possible.  They may not have their full licence but they will come under the regulatory gambit then as per the licensing Bill.  This gives a much stronger case of regulation of those hospitals, if that makes sense.

The intent was that licences would be processed as quickly as possible.  Going back to some of the earlier heads in the Bill, the first document a hospital must put forward in order to apply for a licence is its statement of purpose, that is, to clearly outline who they are, how they operate, who the person in charge is, that they are publishing their patient safety statements and so on.  A significant volume of information will be provided to HIQA.  It will be up to the authority to decide how it processes the applications, but it would be expected that in those self-declarations for some hospitals, it would be clear that they can proceed quickly to licence.  However, others may have to do significant work to meet the requirements for a licence.  Looking across our whole system, there are different areas of risk in some hospitals, as Dr. Holohan said.  The intent is not that this would go on for a long time.  We cannot underestimate 60 hospitals coming forward at one time to be licensed and processed within one, two or three months.  However, it is important that as they continue to operate, they come in under this stronger regulatory framework under HIQA as quickly as possible.  We hope the patient safety Bill and the work up to this will allow hospitals to start preparing quickly in order that when they put in their applications, they will be as ready as possible.<br\/><br\/>I will come back to the mandatory regulations and standards because Deputy O'Reilly was a little concerned about them.  We are conscious there are many technicalities within this Bill and that it is quite lengthy.  Head 20 outlines the areas that will form part of mandatory regulations.  They are based strongly on current standards for better healthcare.  The regulations relate to:<\/p><blockquote>(a) the provision of person-centred care,<br \/><br \/>(b) the provision of effective care,<br \/><br \/>(c) the provision of safe care,<br \/><br \/>(d) the promotion of better health and wellbeing,<br \/><br \/>(e) leadership, corporate and clinical governance and management,<br \/><br \/>(f) planning, organising and managing the workforce,<br \/><br \/>(g) the use of resources,<br \/><br \/>(h) the use of information,<br \/><br \/>(i) dealing with complaints ...,<br \/><br \/>(j) the management of patient safety incidents.<\/blockquote> <p>They are extensive in terms of clinical governance, and the requirement is for a strong clinical governance framework.  There will, therefore, be a significant step forward in terms of the requirements that an organisation will have to meet and the opportunities that HIQA, as the licenser, will have to provide it to be able to go in and examine this.<br\/><br\/>Section 39Q concerns appeals to the District Court, the grading and the serious risk.<\/p><p>The Deputy's point is very well made.  Perhaps Ms Dunnion from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, could look at how risk assessment applies and how problems are identified.  HIQA do this on a day-to-day basis in that it looks across the system to see if risk assessment processes are in place.  It might be worthwhile if that was taken on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#P00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kathleen MacLellan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528876800,"counter":388,"content":"<p>To continue on from Dr. MacLellan's point. that will be contained in the detail, in the context of the issuing of a licence.  We are very familiar with the existing public hospitals as they are currently structured but it is envisaged that the licensing system will have, as was explained, mandatory notifications.  While HIQA might not be on site in a hospital it will, through the mandatory notifications, have oversight of what is happening in the hospital.  In tandem with that, it will use what is publically reported in performance information incident reporting, and of course the patient safety (licensing) Bill will also mean that more information flows to HIQA.  Each hospital has a profile.  We will base our method of implementing this Bill on what we have learned from the regulation of social services.  This job involves allocating a risk rating to a service, if that is what is required.  There will be quite a significant matrix of how we do that.  It allows us to respond where risk is identified and where were are notified about risk, which may be aligned to mandatory notifications.   We then schedule inspections, both announced and unannounced.

The principle in discussion at our working group is that there would be equal assessment across private and public in this area.  In fact, there is a technical piece in section 39F on this with regard to application of a licence.  Our policy intent through the general scheme has been that we would meet a number of checks and balances around character and competence.  There are a number of pieces that allow for that within section 39F, which is evidence as to the character and competence of the intended licence provider.  In the HSE case it is focused on the hospital as an entity.  It is also intended that the declaration by a principal officer relating to capacity as a provider applies to both public and private hospitals, bearing in mind that the HSE and a number of hospitals are corporate bodies.<\/p> <p>  Section 39F also refers to evidence as to the character and competence of the person to be designated in charge relevant to his or her management role and that is across all hospitals, public and private.  For the HSE that is likely to be an assessment of the character and competence of the CEO or general manager.  There is no intention regarding exclusion of HSE or voluntary hospitals from these important checks.  We believe that working through the formal drafting and with the Office of the Attorney General we can encompass all of that.  This is quite a technical part and we would not wish to lose anything in that translation.  We are all in the same position with regard to the principle of the character and competence of those in charge of those licensed entities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kathleen MacLellan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528876800,"counter":416,"content":"<p>It might be helpful for clarity to explain what we mean about the fitness of the person.  When we talk about the fitness of the person of charge, whoever that might be in the hospital or wherever, we talk about basic but important things to begin with.  Is the person competent in safeguarding people and patients in the hospital?  That involves Garda vetting.  Has the person the appropriate qualifications?  Those might be in the general management context.  One looks at the person's regulatory history.  Has this person in charge been responsive in a positive way to findings relating to adverse events or regulatory non-compliance, if that is the case?  One also sees if the person took a proactive approach to the planning of the service, and if that proactive approach is cognisant of both the clinical and the corporate governance arrangements.  It takes in what Senator Colm Burke was describing in the context of where there might be divergence of views.  Is the person's approach proactive in that?  Also, is there a good system of peer review?  If one looks at that, it might be in one hospital and where the Senator referred to individual hospitals and groups, one would hope to see that the person in charge demonstrates that he or she can learn from what is happening in his or her hospital but equally, that such learning is shared across a group or through the legal entity, be it the HSE or whatever else.

On whom do the witnesses depend for that report now, and on whom will they depend for such a report after the passing of this Bill or other legislation?  For example, there is a freedom of information officer in virtually every public body.  That person decides on the status of the information requested and so forth.  I do not see anything comparable in this case, which is much more serious.  For example, somebody might decide that an incident is not reportable and should not be reported.  Some incidents, while small and seemingly insignificant, might well have a permanent impact on the lifestyle of a patient.  I am mindful of a number of incidents which I do not propose to discuss here.  There is a need for more streamlined instantaneous reporting of an incident.  It is not much good reading about it in the newspapers two or three years later.  One can do nothing about it then and we certainly can do nothing about the quality of attention and care available after the event.  There should be a learning process after any such event whereby actions should be taken.  What action can be taken in those circumstances and how does one do it?<\/p> <p>  The other question is about the fitness of somebody to practise in a particular area.  HIQA does not have an input into the appointment in the first place.  If it is subsequently proven that a person is unfit for fulfil a role or to practise in a certain capacity, there are two different bodies involved.  One is the appointing body that fills the post and the other is when something is found out afterwards.  One could look back and ask why something was not spotted earlier.  There might be a situation where some unusual incident occurred but, generally, if the person is not fit to practise now he or she was not fit two years ago either.<\/p><p>The Deputy might bank that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#R01400","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528876800,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I will bank it.

One is on the enforcement powers and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  It is a direct question to which I would appreciate a direct answer.  There are people in the media and others who have commented that the powers of HIQA are weak and limited.  The question is simple.  If the legislators were minded to give HIQA stronger powers of enforcement, presumably with the attendant resources, would that be welcome and does HIQA think that is necessary?<\/p> <p>  My second question is on Head 20.  Head 20 is extensive and it references the provision of person-centred, effective and safe care.  It also references the Sl&aacute;intecare report around putting in place a hospital or designated activities, the necessary clinical and corporate governance arrangements to ensure that we have the effective and safe care.  My question is on the influence or otherwise of persons outside of the hospital on the clinical governance arrangements - we are all having a debate about the separation of church and State and where that might lead, so I refer specifically to the influence of a religious ethos on the provision of person-centred, effective and safe care where there may be a conflict.  Does this head give HIQA the authority to override that or in any way scrutinise it or is that ethos of any given institution something that is seen to be separate?  Will HIQA go in and monitor on the basis of the overarching philosophy or ethos or whatever word HIQA wants to use?  It could be read a number of ways.  I would read it as saying that it does give HIQA the power to take a view on that or question it if it were appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#S00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1528876800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I have a question of my own before we begin to wind up.

In time, when we come to designate that list I expect to see  ionising radiation, the use of general anesthesia and other such criteria on that list.  We have not developed all of the criteria as yet, but it will essentially be that set of high risk activities which represent potential risks to individuals if things go wrong in the context of an individual case.  There is work done in other jurisdictions that are a little ahead of us in terms of some of this.

First, I concur with the Deputy.  The first patient safety principle is that if something has happened we secure the safety of the individual patient, then we secure the safety of the patients around that patient and then we secure the safety of the patients across the system.  In terms of management at local level, a new incident management framework was launched in January last across the Health Service Executive which provides significant guidance around the management of incidents.  We have our national incident management system and all incidents, regardless of level of risk, should be reported to that system.  An earlier question from the Deputy was about how close to the site that happens.  It happens at the level of each organisation.  Just as the Deputy talks about a freedom of information officer there should be a risk management officer, a patient safety and quality officer or a clinical effectiveness officer there.<\/p> <p>  That all fits very well into what we are proposing within the Patient Safety (Licensing) Bill, which is strong structures and enforcement powers around clinical governance.  Clinical governance is the patient safety culture management system across a hospital that allows patient safety incidents, patient safety issues, clinical audit and all those good pieces to happen in a timely way.  That requires that every organisation should have a patient safety and quality operating framework.  We strongly believe that is part of clinical governance mechanisms.  Part of HIQA's role will be to be assured that there are such clinical governance mechanisms in place in a standard way across the country so every organisation has the requirements in place to meet those standards be they, depending on the size of the  hospital, level of risk managers, patient safety and quality officers and so forth, so those people are on site training, supporting and ensuring that the reporting of incidents is happening.<\/p> <p>  I should also say that we commissioned both HIQA and the Mental Health Commission to develop standards for the conduct of reviews.  That refers back to some of the previous questions about the time it takes for reviews and the reporting of incidents.  They are published and are now being implemented across the system.  These are the types of standards that we would like to see monitored by HIQA across the system.  It is already monitoring them.  There are processes in place.<\/p> <p>  The other piece is that the quality assurance and verification division is in the process of developing a patient safety alert system across the system.  It is very similar to what the Deputy described.  An alert can go out very quickly to the system if an incident occurs that requires information to go across the system and should happen very quickly.  All those pieces should fit within a strong, structured, legislated for clinical governance framework, which was a key element of the Sl&aacute;intecare report as well.  We would very much support that.  With regard to clinical governance, it is not the single issues or actions that make the difference but the combination of all the actions.  We see clinical governance as encompassing education, continuing professional development, clinical audit, clinical guidelines, clinical effectiveness, risk management, openness, patient engagement and so forth.  All of those would be key components of the mandatory regulations and they would be regulated.  There are significant powers and opportunities being proposed and outlined within this Bill.  There will then be significant enforcement powers through HIQA's work in providing licences to organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061300002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kathleen MacLellan"},{"type":"speech","time":1528876800,"counter":444,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee I thank the witnesses for taking the time to attend the meeting this morning.

The Bill is welcome and we support it in the main.  The purpose of this amendment is to address a lacuna.  Certain web content may not have been available to preserve a historical registry of the <i>.ie<\/i>domain name content.  A web archive is like any other kind of archive such as a library or copyright.  We took advice from people like Professor Eoin O'Dell in Trinity, who is the foremost expert in this area, a constitutional expert and an intellectual property expert.  His advice is that this measure is needed to strengthen the provisions.  Essentially, the idea is to ensure that Internet content is treated in the same way as any other content for copyright purposes, such as content in a library or any other schedule.<\/p><p>That is the intention.  It is put forward in good faith and comes from academic authority.  I am interested in hearing the views of the Minister of State.  I am always interested in hearing different views.  If there are concerns about it, I am open to hearing them.Deputy Quinlivan may also wish to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018061300002#B00500","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":453,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018061300002#B00600","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Quinlivan happy with that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018061300002#B00700","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Deputy Lawless has covered it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018061300002#B00800","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I am pleased to bring the Copyright and Other Intellectual Property Law Provisions Bill 2018 before the committee and I thank it for the opportunity to do so.  I have brought a number of Bills through the Houses but this is the most technical and detailed legislation with which I have had to deal.  It is necessary to update and modernise the copyright regime in Ireland.  I thank the representatives of all parties who were constructive and who, in general, support the Bill.<\/p><p>I will comment on the amendment put forward by Deputy Lawless and Deputy Quinlivan.  I have listened to the rationale.  I will explain why I do not propose to accept it.  I spoke to the Chairman about the matter earlier.  The amendment proposes the inclusion of a section that will permit a deposit institution, in other words, a board or authority, to reproduce any work made available in the State through the Internet - if the website is not paywall-protected or password-protected - without infringing the copyright of that work.  Essentially, the amendment is to provide for a full digital deposit system that would facilitate the recording and making available of websites with Irish domain names, the <i>.ie<\/i>domain, that are not currently archived.  Such action has been referred to as capturing or preserving the web.<\/p><p>In the first instance, the problem we have is that this is a matter for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which is responsible for policy is this area.  That makes matters a little difficult for my Department.  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is currently undertaking a detailed and extensive examination and analysis of the proposal, after which it may then be presented to Government to seek approval to pursue this policy change.  Such a change would include all necessary legislative amendments and seek Exchequer funding for the purpose proposed.<\/p><p>The Department and I understand the desire of the Deputies to capture the web for preservation purposes.  However, it is essential that sufficient time is allocated to conduct the appropriate level of analysis and consider the potential impact such a proposal may have on the rights of right-holders.<\/p><p>I will cut to the chase.  The difficulty we have is that if we were to go back and include this amendment and go through all the details of including the amendment, it would possibly set back the Bill.  It could delay the 11 October deadline and delay all 28 member states from ratifying the treaty.  Sections 24 and 26 include several changes in this regard.  I could go through a great deal on the matter but basically this will go back to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which is responsible for policy in this area.  It is out of my remit and the remit of my Department.  It was considered by my Department as part of Professor O'Dell's report in 2013.  That is where we stand in terms of the amendment.<\/p><p>I could easily say to the Deputies that I am not accepting the amendment but I do not want to go down that road.  I hope the Deputies will not call for a vote on it.  We should let it go to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which is responsible for policy in this area and see where it lies.  If we include the substantive provision, we would have to go through a legal process.  We would have a great deal to do and that would set us back months.  That is the position of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018061300002#B00900","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":457,"content":"<p>If the amendment is withdrawn, will the matter be referred back to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht?

The fact that something might impact on EU directives or regulations is not really a sufficient or good reason for us not to do it because our job, as legislators, is to scrutinise, challenge and produce the best case possible.  Sometimes we can lead the European Union and do not have to accept its lead.  The Minister of State has said there is work under way within his Department and others to analyse the position and perhaps come back with a better way of doing things.  I am absolutely open to that approach and look forward to hearing the response.  I am a little confused about the timelines because I have heard two dates being mentioned - October and before the recess.  The Minister of State has mentioned that this has to be done by late October, but we are also hearing that there is a rush to get the legislation through before the recess.  Perhaps the position might be clarified.  It is an important objective and the amendment would do something important which we still need to do.  However, if there is another way to do it, on which either the Minister of State's Department or another Department could come back to us, I look forward to engaging on it.  I ask the Minister of State's Department or the relevant Department to engage with me and Deputy Maurice Quinlivan, perhaps even offline, and we can work something out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018061300002#C01100","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":471,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018061300002#C01200","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":472,"content":"<p>On that basis.

Amendment No. 3 inserts a revised version of section 127A into the Patents Act.  The purpose of section 127A is to open the national route for patent co-operation treaty, PCT, applications by allowing current patent applicants to choose to convert an international patent application into a national patent application.  Applicants may choose to do so for a number of reasons.  During the international applications process which usually takes approximately 31 months to complete applicants may discover that an international patent is not suitable.  This may be due to the high costs involved, the patent not being commercially viable, protection in international markets no longer being necessary or the results of the search report and written opinion precluding the patent from being granted in certain countries.  Section 127A facilitates the opening up of the national route for PCT applications which will provide an additional choice for applicants which has not been available up to now.<\/p><p>The differences between the revised section 127A and the version included in the Bill, as published, are a new section 127A(1) and a revised section 127A(2)(d).  The new section 127A(1) allows the controller to assign the all-important patent filing date where an international PCT application has been refused a filing date owing to an error or omission by the international patenting organisation.  The national patent application can then be accepted and processed in the normal way on the basis of this filing date.<\/p><p>Following publication of the Bill, users of the PCT route suggested an additional instance in which a PCT patent applicant might opt for a national as opposed to an international patent.  The revised section 127A(2)(d) takes this on board.  Under this provision, a PCT patent applicant may at any time within a 31 month period apply to the controller for that application to be treated as a national application, while the PCT application could be pursued separately.  For example, the applicant may want a national patent for the purpose of securing an investment opportunity or to pursue infringement proceedings.  Recognising the merit of the users' proposal, I am happy to be able to facilitate the proposal by way of the amendment. <\/p><p>Section 127 of the Patents Act provides for the handling of international patent applications.Amendment No. 2 contains three technical amendments to section 127 that are consequential on amendment No. 3.  The amendments take into account that an international application designating the European Patent Office may also be treated as a national patent application under section 127A 2(d).  I know that this all sounds exceptionally technical, but if the committee requires any further information or a breakdown of the detail, we can supply it to members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018061300002#C02600","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I will take the Minister of State's word for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018061300002#C02700","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":487,"content":"<p>The Deputy need not worry;

I was keen to fulfil an invitation to launch the national crime victims helpline to raise awareness of the important statutory right that victims have under the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017.  I was pleased to convey the good wishes of the committee to those present.<\/p> <p>  I welcome this opportunity to meet the committee on this extensive list of topics.  The breadth of matters the committee has indicated it wishes to discuss reflects the wide range of matters that come under the ambit of the Minister for Justice and Equality and the many different issues on which I and my officials are working.  Members will be familiar with many of these as we have discussed them previously.  In order to make full use of the reduced time available to us I will not address all the matters referred to in the letter of invitation.  I will, however, briefly provide some context for some of the matters we are about to discuss.  <\/p> <p>  One of the matters to which the Chairman referred is one which he has pursued in particular, namely, the Crowley report into the tragic and needless death of Aidan McAnespie.  I know the Chairman has a longstanding interest in the matter and that he is very familiar with the McAnespie family.  I would be happy to update the committee on the issues surrounding the family's desire to have the Crowley report published in full.  As members are aware, this matter is not straightforward.<\/p> <p>  The committee has indicated a wish to discuss Garda oversight and accountability.  Garda reform, including in respect of the architecture and operation of oversight, has been a major focus of this Government.  An element already delivered in this regard is the Policing Authority.  It is a sign of the success of the authority that in its short time in existence it has, as intended, already become a central part of the policing landscape.  Its establishment is one of the most significant policing reforms delivered since the foundation of the State.  As in all democratic countries, it provides independent oversight of policing.  Given that its mission is to drive excellent policing, I welcome its publication of the policing priorities and policing plan for 2018, as well as its role in the development of the new code of ethics that is being firmly embedded within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  The committee wishes to discuss homicide statistics.  This issue highlights some of the areas where improvements are required in the Garda organisation, including data management.  The Policing Authority is playing an important role in scrutinising how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na resolves these issues and records data and this scrutiny is necessary and welcome.<\/p> <p>  We also have the Commission on the Future of Policing, which is conducting a root and branch review of policing in Ireland.  I look forward to receiving an extensive report in September which I expect will map out an ambitious future for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the coming decades.  The commission&rsquo;s remit is to examine all aspects of policing in Ireland, including the full range of bodies that have a role in providing oversight and accountability for Garda activities, namely, the Policing Authority, the Garda Inspectorate, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, my Department and the Government.<\/p><p>It is in that context and in the context of the opportunity that will present for reshaping and enhancing the oversight organisations that we have to look at proposals for new powers and changed roles in the future.<\/p><p> On penal policy, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the recommendations and conclusions of the committee's report on penal policy and sentencing.  As the committee is aware through its long-standing interest in this subject and the extensive consultation it has undertaken on this and previous reports, a large amount of progressive reform and modernisation of the prison system has taken place in recent years.  Many of the committee's recommendations are linked with and complementary to the current reform programme of penal policy which is being implemented, as set out in the report of the penal policy review group, PPRG.  The report emphasises rehabilitation, reduced reliance on imprisonment as a sanction and an increased focus on alternatives.  The implementation and oversight group for the penal policy review group report, under the chairmanship of Dr. Mary Rogan, has presented five reports to me, all of which have been published on the Department's website.  The implementation of the PPRG recommendations constitutes the broad reform programme of penal policy currently being undertaken.  The committee's report is comprehensive, detailed and has many implications for the services involved.  It will take some time to examine the report in detail to ascertain how we might progress from here.  I am happy to continue engagement with the committee.  I am very open to discussing these recommendations in more detail and I look forward to doing so.<\/p><p> The final issue in the committee's letter that I intend briefly addressing is the matter of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the recast EU reception conditions directive, which pertains to the procedures to allow asylum seekers to work.  The Government responded to last year's Supreme Court judgment by deciding to opt in to the recast directive, which will result in a wide range of reforms in the protection system.  This opt-in will allow for effective labour market access for protection applicants who have not received a first instance decision within a designated period.  I am confident the decision to opt into the directive is a positive development for the entire protection system, including applicants, their families and communities while they await a final decision on their application.<\/p><p> In addition to labour market access, the directive also includes important provisions relating to children's rights, health, education and material reception conditions for applicants, which include housing, food, clothing and a daily expenses allowance.  In the period between the Supreme Court ruling coming into effect and the application of the directive, I introduced a temporary scheme allowing access to self-employment for protection applicants, and a number of people have successfully taken advantage of the scheme.  In the intervening months, protection applicants have been treated in the same way as other third country nationals and have been allowed to apply for a work permit, as administered by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The full application of the directive will allow for much fuller access to the labour market.  It is unfortunate that there has been misinformation which has sought to present the interim arrangements as permanent.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for engaging in this process and I look forward, over the next weeks, to being in a position to announce the consequences of the application of the opt-in in Ireland.  There has been close engagement with the European Commission over recent months with regard to our compliance with the terms of the directive.  My intention is that the new labour market access arrangements will be in place by the end of the month.  Given that a further Government decision will be required before then, there is a limit to the extent to which I can give precise details of the proposed arrangements.  However, the committee will be aware of the terms of the directive with which we will comply.  As such, what is being proposed should be clear in general terms.  I thank the Chairman for inviting me today.  I look forward to the committee's discussions and I thank it for its input.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018061300002#D00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I was surprises to learn that on any one day there may be fewer that 50% of the members of the Garda on front-line duty.  I raised this issue with the Garda in the context of my regular meetings with the management of the force.  A new rostering duty management system is being introduced and that should deal with the issue in a way that ensures a level of public satisfaction.  I regard availability and visibility on the part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as being core to their duty.  We have had a debate on Garda resources and numbers.  I am pleased that we are on track in respect of Garda numbers.  The overall strength of the Garda should be 21,000 by 2021.  I am attending at Templemore on Friday next, 15 June 2018, to see a further complement of 200 new, ambitious, energetic garda&iacute; coming on stream, all of whom will be stationed in posts throughout the country in two weeks or thereabouts.  I acknowledge that the deployment of personnel is a function of the Garda Commissioner but, having fewer than 50% of garda&iacute; on front-line duty is something that must be improved upon.  The programme of civilianisation needs to be accelerated because the more civilians we have doing work that might be more appropriate to them in terms of bookkeeping, finances, accounts, form-filling and so on, the more that will allow for a greater level of availability of garda&iacute; for front-line duty and service.  I agree with Deputy O'Callaghan's viewpoint.<\/p> <p>  On the question of infrastructure to allow the immediate detection of the status of a person's driving licence in the context of whether he or she has penalty points or a disqualification, not having that vital piece of infrastructure is unsatisfactory.  There is a role for the Road Safety Authority and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in this regard but I am disappointed that this type of infrastructure is not available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly having regard to the unprecedented level of funding - of the order of &euro;1.6 billion - available for disbursement by the Commissioner and his team.  I expect that the ongoing roll-out of IT services will facilitate, at an early date, the type of detection and scrutiny that is important.  Having regard to the fact that everybody who is disqualified from driving, While the fact that a person is disqualified from driving might not be listed on his or her licence and thereby immediately know to the Garda, if he or she drives, he or she is effectively doing so without insurance.  This is a very careless and dangerous practice for anybody who thinks he or she can evade the law.

I am not sure that will happen, but I hope he is correct.  A number of matters flow from that.  Is the Department concerned that, in the interim, it has been working in flagrant breach of the Supreme Court decision by, in effect, putting in place the temporary arrangement in a manner which has denied asylum seekers access to a right to work in everything but name?  Was there concern about that temporary arrangement being in flagrant breach of the Supreme Court judgment?

External advice to the Department would have been welcome, particularly by the IRC, but that did not happen.  Based on what the Minister has said, they were not engaged with other than a note of thanks for the submission to be put in the drawer.  They did not get the engagement that they wanted.  They would have benefitted the work of the Department.<\/p> <p>  A feature of some of my other questions is that the Department - this is not personal - has been found wanting on a range of issues, including this, and taking advice from persons outside the net might help everybody in the future.  We have many other issues.  I will not dwell on that.  The Minister has answered as best he can.  It is somewhat related to the role of the Department.  I will go into other aspects, the first being the coroners Bill.  Without giving myself a heart attack, it is a year since we discussed with senior officials in the Department a legislative timescale to deliver through Report Stage prior to last summer.  The Taoiseach told me in February the heads of Bill would be published and the Minister told me the same in March.  We are still here and if we are lucky, we might get something at the end of Jul, which is incredible.<\/p> <p>  I will link to that the issue of the criminal negligence claims and the legal system in the UK.  The UK introduced pre-action protocols for clinical negligence claims 12 years ago.  Such protocols were introduced under the Legal Services Regulation Act in 2015.  Two and a half years later, that section has not been commenced.  It is directly relevant to the cervical cancer cases and all  other clinical negligence claims.  The judicial working group recommended protocols to the then Minister in 2011.  Opinions were sought from the legal profession a long time ago.  What is causing the delays at the heart of the Department?  Why is it, on any issue, the next matter that will come up is delays or excuses?  If one looks at these or if one looks at the Judicial Council Bill 2017 which I would include in this category as well, the theme is progress is slower on legislation than Ministers want.  The Minister is on the record as saying he is behind this Bill.  The former Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, definitely was.  I believe the Minister is and his predecessor definitely was.  The Minister stated he is behind the Judicial Council Bill 2017.  Who is ruling the roost?  Two Ministers have told a Department these were priority Bill and we are no nearer processing them.  How can that be and how do we address that?  For us, as a committee, that is incredibly frustrating.  What is going on regarding the three Bills - the coroners (amendment) Bill, pre-action protocols and Judicial Council Bill 2017?  Who is ruling the roost?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018061300002#G01000","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I certainly do not want to induce any heart attack for the Deputy.  I want to assist the committee in any way possible.  As far as the coroners (amendment) Bill is concerned, we are making progress, albeit at a pace that is regrettable.  This is taking considerably longer than I anticipated.  I may have been speaking about this issue to the committee previously.  It was my intention that the Bill would be ready by now.<\/p><p>However, it is not true to say we are where we were a year go, because we are not.  We have made a lot of progress.  My office briefed the Deputy's office on the issue yesterday.  There was a further engagement last Friday, when departmental officials met officials from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  There are outstanding drafting issues.  I am keen to receive a full third draft as quickly as possible to allow us to proceed to publication.  There is no lack of intent or willingness on my part or on the part of the Department.  As the Deputy will appreciate, this has proven to be a complex issue.  I hope we can report greater progress over the coming weeks before the end of the D&aacute;il term, if that can be used as a benchmark.<\/p><p> I was in contact with the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel recently to discuss the Judicial Council Bill 2017.  It is intended that amendments of a pretty reformative nature in the Seanad will improve that Bill substantially.  I am keen to report progress on that.  I ask committee members to bear in mind that there is significant legislative activity.<\/p><p> I would like to mention in passing something that relates directly to the issues we are discussing.  I received approval yesterday to proceed with legislation that will facilitate a constitutional amendment on the matter of blasphemy.  In the normal course of events, I would expect to make that legislation available for pre-legislative scrutiny.  In the circumstances, the committee might consider a waiver.  I would be keen for the relevant Bill to be published, debated in plenary session of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and enacted before the recess to facilitate strict statutory deadlines.    I am flagging it with the committee and I do not want an answer now.  I would appreciate it if the committee would consider my request.  If pre-legislative scrutiny is required, I would be happy to agree an early date between now and 13 July to facilitate that.<\/p><p> I have mentioned the Department's unprecedented volume of legislation not as a defence or an excuse, but as a reason.  This legislation is compounded by the amount of work being done by Parliament under new politics in respect of Private Members' Bills, all of which I welcome but I do so in the knowledge that it presents a challenge.  Deputy Jack Chambers has been the architect of many positive submissions.  All of this work presents a challenge for me, for the Office of the Attorney General and for the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I acknowledge that the coroners' (amendment) Bill is a priority.  I hope we can do something in the next four weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018061300002#G01100","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":546,"content":"<p>We note the Minister's request regarding the blasphemy proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018061300002#H00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I do not think I have ever heard as brutal a response from a Minister at this committee.  I do not mean it in a personal way when I say it was absolute and utter waffle and nonsense.  Given that we are talking about legislation which has been prioritised by two Ministers, it is ridiculous to flag legislation that has not even been drafted yet.  The legislation in question has been in the pipeline at this committee since the previous D&aacute;il.  I have asked the Minister why it has not been advanced and he has referred to legislation we have not yet seen.  It is beyond disrespectful to those who have lost their wives in cases of maternal death to fail to deal with the issue of pre-action protocols.  Women are before the courts today dealing with the HSE because the Department of Justice and Equality has not enacted legislation which has been passed by these Houses and put in place the necessary protocols.<\/p> <p>  I do not agree with the Minister when he says we realise and appreciate that the coroners (amendment) Bill is a complex issue.  I know it is not a complex Bill.  When the Chairman and I sat with officials from the top echelons of the Department of Justice and Equality almost a year ago, they assured us they had a strategy.  That was the second time we met them.  We also met them when Deputy Frances Fitzgerald was Minister for Justice and Equality.  They assured us that they would deliver this in six weeks.  It is of no solace to assure me now that it is a priority because I was given a similar assurance 18 months ago.  It is really disrespectful to waffle on about other Bills that are not published.  It is for this precise reason that the committee wanted officials from the Department to come before it.  We are sick of being fobbed off with nonsense.  Legislation that is being advanced by this committee and both Houses is being allowed to sit there.  It is expected that we will be satisfied by being thrown a few crumbs about something else.  It is disgraceful.  I am not going to comment on it further.<\/p> <p>  In the committee's report on penal policy, we recommended that resources should be made available urgently to ensure appropriate mental healthcare for all prisoners.  Will the Minister indicate what action the Department is taking to implement this decision?  Deputy Wallace and I have received a letter from a seriously ill long-term prisoner in one of our prisons.  He told us that he feels he is being sedated, dulled and kept in his place for a period of time.  He is not getting the help he needs.  It is indicative of the situation throughout the Prison Service.  What has been done since we made our recommendation in our report?<\/p> <p>  What is the position with the Prisons (Solitary Confinement) (Amendment) Bill 2016?  In its report on penal reform, the committee called on the Government to facilitate without further delay the passage of that legislation.  I am not talking about getting a promise that something might be drafted before the summer; I am talking about a Bill that has been passed by the D&aacute;il on Second Stage and referred to this committee.  A money message was requested by this committee and the Houses in February 2017.  More than 15 months later, nothing has happened.  Is the Department content to ignore the democratic wishes of the House and the committee?  Is the Minister okay with this?  What is he doing to facilitate it?  There are people in these conditions in prison now, and they need assistance.<\/p> <p>  What is the story with these two Bills?  When the Minister is responding to my questions, I ask him to deal with the point I have made about pre-action protocols, which is linked to the claims and the cases before the courts at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018061300002#H00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I want to make it clear that I mean no disrespect to any member of the committee, the Chairman or the committee as a whole.

My new target in this regard is to proceed to publication as a priority within the next four weeks before the end of the current D&aacute;il session.  I acknowledge the Deputy's frustration.  I am happy to have ensured that the Deputy and her office have been taken through the process.  Nobody is sitting back or fobbing anybody off.  Nobody is saying this is not a priority.  We are anxious to get the legislation through.  In spite of what the Deputy said, this is a complex issue.  Many of these legal reforms derive from the comprehensive 1962 Act.  The 2007 Bill proved that this is a legally and technically complex area.  I expect that we will be in a position to advance it along the lines suggested by the Deputy over the next four weeks.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, I am keen to report progress on the pre-action protocols.  I understand the importance and the urgency of this matter, which is being examined by senior counsel.  The Deputy will agree it is important to have external consultations.  I will set a benchmark of 13 July, which is the indicative date for the end of the parliamentary session, on that.  I am sure we will have a further opportunity to engage on it.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the importance of the committee's report on prisons and penal policy in the context of the relationship between this committee and the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>The contents of that report are being fully examined by my departmental officials.  We have not enjoyed sight of it for a considerable time.  However, aspects of it are both interesting and attractive where policy issues are concerned, and I am happy to make a more formal reply on that in the autumn.<\/p><p> The provision of appropriate mental health services is a challenge, but it is important that we have an effective programme of healthcare in prisons.  I have had the opportunity over the past 12 months to visit a number of prisons and speak to prisoners.  I speak with prison representative groups and members of visiting committees.  There are some challenges, one of which is the health and welfare of prisoners.  The use of imprisonment for people with enduring mental illness in inappropriate and unacceptable, especially having regard to the fact that prisons are not therapeutic environments.  I accept that there is work to be done, and the Irish Prison Service is concerned is keen to ensure these issues are dealt with in a satisfactory way.  I have not seen the letter from the person who has written to Deputy Daly, but it is symptomatic of the challenge that we need to work on addressing.  I hope to be in a position to prioritise these issues in the forthcoming budget in the context of my engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018061300002#H00400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I refer again to the Prisons (Solitary Confinement) (Amendment) Bill 2016, and the money message to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018061300002#J00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I will get back to the Deputy on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018061300002#J00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I just want to set the record straight on the Minister's liaison with my office, and to acknowledge my staff's work.

I do not accept that as a great bonus.  It has tied us in a huge amount of work, chasing something that should have been delivered by now.  The Minister can answer by talking about challenges, complexities and issues being examined, but we know they are challenging and complex.  That is why we have come up with recommendations concerning all of them as a committee.  We wanted to hear from the Minister how they are being implemented, and not excuses about why they are not being implemented, which is a key feature.  Regarding the pre-action protocols, the Department circulated a draft set of proposals but that was months ago.  They have not been implemented yet.  One of our key points is that the Department of Justice and Equality clearly operates in a different time zone to most other people when it comes to delivering change.  Something has to give on that.  It is a feature of every legislative issue, and victims are suffering as a result of that delay.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Garda, we touched on some issues last night in the debate on the appointment of the new Garda Commissioner.

People with mental illness coming in contact with the criminal justice system is an issue that involves more than just the Prison Service.  I acknowledge the importance of the engagement on the part of the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others involved in an interdepartmental group.  I stress the importance of ensuring mental health and well-being are a priority when persons with mental health issues come in contact with the criminal justice system or are given prison sentences.  In that regard, I acknowledge the dedicated wings, namely the D2 wing in Cloverhill Prison and the high-support unit in Mountjoy Prison, which are working towards that.<\/p> <p>  We have been engaging with GSOC over the few weeks since the business plan was delivered to my Department.  A formal business plan is essential.  A further submission was received from GSOC yesterday on resources.

As I said earlier in the year, I am positively disposed to the provision of resources to the commission that will allow it to do its job.  We are making progress on that with the commission and actively engaging with it.

My Department, the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Housing, Planning and Local Government, Dublin City Council, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Road Safety Authority have got together a view to seeing how this issue might be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I have discussed the matter with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of the precise point of legislative change.  I have drafted a letter to the Attorney General seeking legal advice on the interpretation of the existing legislation in terms of definitions.

I have also mentioned this to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, who has responsibility from a transport point of view.<\/p> <p>  I wish to respond to Deputy Jack Chambers by saying that this is an urgent issue.  I am very sorry that there has been an accident.

The Minister has also assured us today that the report of the change and implementation group set up under Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in will be finalised by the end of this term.

There have been reports recently and parliamentary questions have been tabled to which I do not believe direct responses has been received.  Parliamentary questions have been tabled by Deputy Broughan and others on the capacity of front-line garda&iacute; to give chase.  That is a very serious issue in rural areas, in particular where people might be a significant distance from a station, in terms of response times to burglaries and so on.  My understanding is that those questions have not been fully answered but the Garda Representative Association believes that almost 50% of front-line garda&iacute;, that is, the core units of garda&iacute; attached to district stations as opposed to specialist units - do not have the required competency based driving, CBD, level two training that would allow them to give chase.<\/p><p>This is a serious concern.  I believe that the person on the street, and most of the Members in the Houses, would assume that the vast majority of garda&iacute; would be in a position to give chase whenever they see a crime being committed and where they feel there is a need to do so.  I do not believe that the Minister or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have released the figures in full.  If they have, I have not seen them.  Perhaps the Minister could outline the figures and what he intends to do so that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or the vast majority of front-line members of the Garda, are in a position to give chase in such instances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018061300002#O00900","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":647,"content":"<p>I have seen those issues.  When I was criticised by Deputies in the House for an absence of training, it coincided with a visit I made to Tralee Garda station, where I attended a continuing professional development, CPD, class with up to 25 ordinary rank and file garda&iacute; from Kerry who were engaged in ongoing CPD on the day of my arrival.  It is fair to say there is an ongoing programme of continuous professional development, which is only right when having regard to the legislative change we introduce here on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>  The Senator referred specifically to driver training.  Of course it is absolutely essential that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are in a position to give chase.  I am very keen they would have the appropriate resources to do so.  The Garda fleet has seen a significant cash injection in recent times to allow for state-of-the-art vehicles to come on stream.<\/p> <p>  I have raised the issue of driver training for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Members will appreciate the fact that not all 13,500 members of the Garda need full training in rapid chase expertise.  If there are four garda&iacute; in the car, for example, then one is a driver and three are garda&iacute;.  I have, however, raised the issue with the Garda Commissioner and I expect that it will be addressed in the context of training and there will be greater concentration on specific, expert driver training.  That level of expertise has been attained by just under 3,000 members of the Garda in the past four years.  I will be happy to communicate further details once I have a response from the Garda Commissioner about the current driver situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018061300002#P00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":648,"content":"<p>Does the Minister have the figures for release?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018061300002#P00300","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I would be happy to release them if I had them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018061300002#P00400","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":650,"content":"<p>Garda visibility, which I raised with the Minister previously through parliamentary questions, is a problem all over the State, but I will refer to the stations in my constituency.  Every Garda station in and around Cork city district has had its numerical strength reduced since 2010.  This is a fact.  Some of the stations have had their numbers reduced substantially.  Mayfield Garda station went from 51 garda&iacute; down to 42 in the past 12 months alone.  I believe the situation is the same in Dublin.  Assistant Commissioner Pat Leahy said the situation in Dublin has hit \"rock bottom\", or at least that was the case in January.  I am not sure if much has changed in the past four or five months.<\/p> <p>  I understand that probationers are coming out of the Garda College in Templemore but because of the increased importance being placed on vital specialist units - the Garda National Protective Services Bureau and some of the other specialist units do a vitally important job - they are increasingly taking the focus.  From speaking with members of the Garda, I gather that experienced, qualified garda&iacute; are being moved into these specialist units and the probationers are, essentially, only taking the place of those senior garda&iacute; in the core units.  Therefore, the numbers in the core units and Garda districts have not increased and while they might be at the same numerical levels, they have lost quite a lot of experience.  This is having an impact on their ability to focus on community police work.  This is combined with a 40% decrease in the number of community garda&iacute; over the same period, which is particularly acute in areas such as Donegal and Limerick but which is having an impact right across the board.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on this point.<\/p> <p>  It seems as though there is a commitment to have 15,000 sworn members in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by 2021 - and we are almost at that figure already - but units are barely keeping pace with the position that obtained six or seven years ago before the significant reductions in numbers.  Does the Minister believe there is now a need to reconsider whether that figure of 15,000 for sworn members needs to be revised to ensure the complement of core units of district garda&iacute; out on the beat can be restored to a reasonable level to re-establish visibility in order that people can have confidence in the visibility of the Garda in their communities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018061300002#P00500","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":651,"content":"<p>The question of numbers is a subject matter of ongoing monitoring by Government.  I am very pleased that the targets are being observed.  I am looking forward to the passing out ceremony at the Garda College in Templemore on Friday.  By the end of 2018, we will have seen a further 500 garda&iacute; come on stream, similar to last year's figure.  The moneys allocated will facilitate the recruitment of 800 new recruits per year.  When one takes into account retirements, which is in the region of 270 to 300 members per year, there is a net intake of 500 members of the Garda per annum.  These are well-trained garda&iacute;, albeit subject to gaining some experience.  This is why supervision across the stations is so important.  I am keen that these targets remain firmly on track and I am confident they will.  I seek, however, a greater level of progress on the matter of civilianisation.  I seek to have 4,000 civilians assisting the 15,000 sworn members by 2021.  I also want to see an enhanced Garda Reserve with an increase in its numbers up to 2,000 by that point.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the importance of the specialist units.  There is some lacking of appreciation of community garda&iacute;.

As the Minister said, there has been some confusion regarding people presenting the interim solution as the long-term solution.  I understand it is not the long-term solution.  My concern is that the long-term solution would far too closely resemble the interim solution.  Regarding the threshold being asked in terms of the interim solution, self-employment has been marginally better but of the number of people who have sought employment permits, I understand only two or three people have successfully done that.  The threshold required would be very high for most Irish citizens; people born, raised and educated here would have difficulty reaching it.  It cannot be the case that the long-term solution would resemble anything like that.  I ask that it be addressed in as short a period as possible.  The nine-month period is too long and there should be as minimal restrictions as possible. <\/p> <p>  The Irish Refugee Council raised the point that asylum seekers have had difficulty seeking readmission to direct provision centres in circumstances where they may have been living with a friend and so on.  Obviously, they are not entitled to social housing.

In that regard, I am keen to ensure it is broadly based.<\/p> <p>  I note the point the Deputy made about readmission to direct provision for asylum seekers.  That is important in terms of essential food and accommodation.  Direct provision currently is at 99% capacity, which is a challenge.  It is one, which, in the context of my deliberations with my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, is ongoing in terms of ensuring there is an appropriate level of accommodation available for everybody in this State and, of course, I include those who have an entitlement.  I acknowledge the fact that the directive allows for a readmission.  Our current practice allows for readmission and that will continue but it will continue against the background of a very challenging scheme of direct provision where we are at 99% capacity.

Will Ireland meet this better standard, especially as under the International Protection Act 2015, applicants should receive a decision within six months?  I will ask all my questions together, a Chathaoirligh, if that is okay.<\/p><p> The directive contains provisions on ensuring respect and dignity for asylum seekers.  Will this affect how direct provision is run?  Is the Minister satisfied, for example, that &euro;21 a week is enough money to ensure dignity, even though it makes it almost impossible to pay for clothes, books, travel and other vital aspects of daily life?  I know of a woman who was heavily pregnant who had to walk five miles to the local hospital in labour because she could not afford a taxi.<\/p><p> The directive states that especially vulnerable asylum seekers will have access to special reception conditions more tailored to their circumstances.

I acknowledge the helpful suggestion the Deputy made some months ago that contact be made with the 40 or so witnesses, but it is not only about persons named in the report.  Throughout the report, evidence given and information tendered refers to third parties and involves other people.  This causes a difficulty with any publication.  Looking back - and the Crowley report was compiled some years ago - there still remains a very heavy burden on Government and a very strict legal duty on the State that cannot be easily set aside or surmounted, even having regard to the changed circumstances and the passage of time.  I say that against the background of my desire to be as open and helpful as possible.  I will continue to engage with the Chair and with other parties in order to see how best we can deal with this vexed issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018061300002#S00400","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his frank reply.

We have been in contact with the Garda Commissioner and the Attorney General.  I will meet with the family.

I hope that it will still be possible to do as the Minister said at the outset in his first reply to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile and that progress can be made on this issue.  That is what I would like to see.<\/p> <p>  Moving on from that, my questions are in no particular order but I will go straight to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and an area which has not been addressed with the Minister at all, namely, the issue of garda&iacute; who retired before 1 October 1976.<\/p><p>The Minister will remember that we corresponded with him and we met with representatives of those garda&iacute;.  We have done an exercise on correspondence and replies to this committee.  It took five months to get a response from the Office of the Garda Commissioner to correspondence that I issued on this matter.  Describing it as anaemic is putting it very mildly indeed.  As the Chair of this committee, any correspondence I issue is on behalf of the committee.  I will give the Minister the statistics in respect of his own Department shortly.  They cover a nine month period.  The poor co-operation and response times - and no responses in many cases - have frustrated me.  On the case of this group of former garda&iacute;, it took five months to get a reply that could have been written the following day.  It offered nothing as a response - it was not a reply.  These garda&iacute; were not represented in the engagement that took place and which was signed off on the arbitrary date of 1 October 1976.  <br\/><br\/>We have met some of them.  Some have been more fortunate in life than others who are now in very stretched financial circumstances.  It was not going to break the Bank of Monte Carlo to exercise outreach in this instance.  There were fewer than 20 people.  There was an instance where a garda had received the pension.  He had taken a particular course before that 1 October date.  Why was fish made of one and flesh of another?  I feel angry that they are in that position given their service.  It is a significant number of years in some cases yet they were left high and dry.  It is wrong.  That was a unanimous position supported by the colleagues of the Minister representing his party on this committee.  We were of one voice, <i>una voce<\/i>.  On behalf of the committee, I appeal to the Minister - even if his first response is that he may not be able to do anything - to look at it again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018061300002#S01100","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528878600,"counter":685,"content":"<p>The Chair is right on both counts.

We do not, however, as a committee, deal with standalone individual cases.  We could not cope with that.  In respect of the full public inquiry and the whole idea of transparency, I do not know where the Private Members' Bill from last evening will go when voting decisions are made tomorrow.  Leaving aside some of the Minister's positions from last evening and just looking at it here, this is a very serious matter.<\/p> <p>  I refer not only to the tremendous hurt of the O'Farrell family but the litany of failings added to that.

There is a societal requirement to address properly all of these failings.  Will the Minister give us any hope or expectation?

That vote will take place tomorrow.  I am also conscious that an independent body, GSOC, is continuing an investigation which could well result in disciplinary proceedings being taken against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I acknowledge, however, that there have been a number of failures across the criminal justice system.  A means to address these failures must be found.  I am keen that GSOC would conclude its work as early as possible.  I acknowledge that the previous unrelated investigation did take a number of years.  I would, however, like to see these remaining investigative procedures and practices take a much shorter period of time.  I would like to see it completed soon for a number of reasons, not least of which is the public interest, as the Chair himself stated.

The Act is at a very early stage of preparation.  I do not wish to raise the expectations of the committee.  I do not expect anything over the course of this summer but I expect we will be in a position to move matters forward somewhat by the end of the year.  On the capital side, I am very keen that we proceed on the new family law headquarters in Dublin.  A site has been identified.  I am anxious to ensure an appropriate level of funding to allow that to commence.  In the meantime, I engage regularly with the Courts Service to ensure that people engaged in family law cases can have their matters dealt with expeditiously and effectively.  I am a little concerned about the fact that oftentimes, in both Circuit Court and District Court, there is a less than dedicated family regime.

Is the Minister himself or are his officials aware that there is a requirement on each Department to reply to a committee regarding recommendations contained in a report submitted for the Department's attention and address within a three-month period?  This has only recently been confirmed by the Taoiseach himself.  The matter came before a meeting of the Working Group of Committee Chairmen, which I attended.  We highlighted the difficulties that this and other committees have in this regard and this was the Taoiseach's confirmation.  We have submitted a number of reports over the period since this committee was established this time two years ago, immediately prior to the summer recess of 2016.  That three-month requirement in respect of a detailed, considered response to recommendations made has not been adhered to.  I am not looking to go back in time over anything; I am urging the Minister's address of this matter into the future.  That is the purpose of my highlighting it.  I have reflected on an earlier period but I am looking at the list of correspondence over the same two-year period in respect of individual case referrals, confirmations of engagements with chairpersons designate, reports sent and matters forwarded for attention.  We received ten replies and six acknowledgements.  Where an acknowledgement at least was due in 22 cases, none issued to the committee.  I am only reflecting this to the Minister.  It is an exercise that the secretariat carried out at my request in advance of today's meeting.  I am not interest in pedalling back over all that.  What I am asking is that, as Minister, and with his senior officials with him today, Deputy Flanagan take on board that there is a frustration within the committee.
