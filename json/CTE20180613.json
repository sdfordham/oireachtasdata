Certain web content may not have been available to preserve a historical registry of the <i>.ie<\/i>domain name content.  A web archive is like any other kind of archive such as a library or copyright.  We took advice from people like Professor Eoin O'Dell in Trinity, who is the foremost expert in this area, a constitutional expert and an intellectual property expert.  His advice is that this measure is needed to strengthen the provisions.  Essentially, the idea is to ensure that Internet content is treated in the same way as any other content for copyright purposes, such as content in a library or any other schedule.<\/p><p>That is the intention.  It is put forward in good faith and comes from academic authority.  I am interested in hearing the views of the Minister of State.  I am always interested in hearing different views.

I have brought a number of Bills through the Houses but this is the most technical and detailed legislation with which I have had to deal.  It is necessary to update and modernise the copyright regime in Ireland.  I thank the representatives of all parties who were constructive and who, in general, support the Bill.<\/p><p>I will comment on the amendment put forward by Deputy Lawless and Deputy Quinlivan.  I have listened to the rationale.  I will explain why I do not propose to accept it.  I spoke to the Chairman about the matter earlier.  The amendment proposes the inclusion of a section that will permit a deposit institution, in other words, a board or authority, to reproduce any work made available in the State through the Internet - if the website is not paywall-protected or password-protected - without infringing the copyright of that work.  Essentially, the amendment is to provide for a full digital deposit system that would facilitate the recording and making available of websites with Irish domain names, the <i>.ie<\/i>domain, that are not currently archived.  Such action has been referred to as capturing or preserving the web.<\/p><p>In the first instance, the problem we have is that this is a matter for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which is responsible for policy is this area.  That makes matters a little difficult for my Department.  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is currently undertaking a detailed and extensive examination and analysis of the proposal, after which it may then be presented to Government to seek approval to pursue this policy change.  Such a change would include all necessary legislative amendments and seek Exchequer funding for the purpose proposed.<\/p><p>The Department and I understand the desire of the Deputies to capture the web for preservation purposes.  However, it is essential that sufficient time is allocated to conduct the appropriate level of analysis and consider the potential impact such a proposal may have on the rights of right-holders.<\/p><p>I will cut to the chase.  The difficulty we have is that if we were to go back and include this amendment and go through all the details of including the amendment, it would possibly set back the Bill.  It could delay the 11 October deadline and delay all 28 member states from ratifying the treaty.  Sections 24 and 26 include several changes in this regard.  I could go through a great deal on the matter but basically this will go back to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which is responsible for policy in this area.  It is out of my remit and the remit of my Department.  It was considered by my Department as part of Professor O'Dell's report in 2013.  That is where we stand in terms of the amendment.<\/p><p>I could easily say to the Deputies that I am not accepting the amendment but I do not want to go down that road.  I hope the Deputies will not call for a vote on it.  We should let it go to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which is responsible for policy in this area and see where it lies.  If we include the substantive provision, we would have to go through a legal process.  We would have a great deal to do and that would set us back months.  That is the position of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018061300002#B00900","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>If the amendment is withdrawn, will the matter be referred back to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht?

The fact that something might impact on EU directives or regulations is not really a sufficient or good reason for us not to do it because our job, as legislators, is to scrutinise, challenge and produce the best case possible.  Sometimes we can lead the European Union and do not have to accept its lead.  The Minister of State has said there is work under way within his Department and others to analyse the position and perhaps come back with a better way of doing things.  I am absolutely open to that approach and look forward to hearing the response.  I am a little confused about the timelines because I have heard two dates being mentioned - October and before the recess.  The Minister of State has mentioned that this has to be done by late October, but we are also hearing that there is a rush to get the legislation through before the recess.  Perhaps the position might be clarified.  It is an important objective and the amendment would do something important which we still need to do.  However, if there is another way to do it, on which either the Minister of State's Department or another Department could come back to us, I look forward to engaging on it.  I ask the Minister of State's Department or the relevant Department to engage with me and Deputy Maurice Quinlivan, perhaps even offline, and we can work something out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018061300002#C01100","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018061300002#C01200","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>On that basis.

Amendment No. 3 inserts a revised version of section 127A into the Patents Act.  The purpose of section 127A is to open the national route for patent co-operation treaty, PCT, applications by allowing current patent applicants to choose to convert an international patent application into a national patent application.  Applicants may choose to do so for a number of reasons.  During the international applications process which usually takes approximately 31 months to complete applicants may discover that an international patent is not suitable.  This may be due to the high costs involved, the patent not being commercially viable, protection in international markets no longer being necessary or the results of the search report and written opinion precluding the patent from being granted in certain countries.  Section 127A facilitates the opening up of the national route for PCT applications which will provide an additional choice for applicants which has not been available up to now.<\/p><p>The differences between the revised section 127A and the version included in the Bill, as published, are a new section 127A(1) and a revised section 127A(2)(d).  The new section 127A(1) allows the controller to assign the all-important patent filing date where an international PCT application has been refused a filing date owing to an error or omission by the international patenting organisation.  The national patent application can then be accepted and processed in the normal way on the basis of this filing date.<\/p><p>Following publication of the Bill, users of the PCT route suggested an additional instance in which a PCT patent applicant might opt for a national as opposed to an international patent.  The revised section 127A(2)(d) takes this on board.  Under this provision, a PCT patent applicant may at any time within a 31 month period apply to the controller for that application to be treated as a national application, while the PCT application could be pursued separately.  For example, the applicant may want a national patent for the purpose of securing an investment opportunity or to pursue infringement proceedings.  Recognising the merit of the users' proposal, I am happy to be able to facilitate the proposal by way of the amendment. <\/p><p>Section 127 of the Patents Act provides for the handling of international patent applications.Amendment No. 2 contains three technical amendments to section 127 that are consequential on amendment No. 3.  The amendments take into account that an international application designating the European Patent Office may also be treated as a national patent application under section 127A 2(d).  I know that this all sounds exceptionally technical, but if the committee requires any further information or a breakdown of the detail, we can supply it to members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018061300002#C02600","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I will take the Minister of State's word for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018061300002#C02700","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1528904400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>The Deputy need not worry;
