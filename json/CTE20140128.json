I am accompanied by Mr. Enda Monaghan and Ms Deirdre O&rsquo;Shea, our forestry secretary.<\/p><p>  The IFA supports the need to update the Forestry Act 1946 to reflect the scale of private sector involvement and support the development of a modern forestry sector.  The expansion of the sector is dependent on farmer involvement and the Bill should create a legislative framework that will support farm level timber production, as well as satisfying the multifunctional aspects of forests.  It would be useful to provide a brief summary of the forest resource.  <\/p><p>  The total forest area in Ireland in 2012 was 730,000 ha or 10.5% of the land area.  This compares with a European average of 43%.  A total of 47% of the forest area is in private ownership.  Counties with the highest proportion of forest area are primarily distributed along the western and south-western seaboards.  Nearly 17,000 farmers have invested in forestry.  The farm forest resource is fragmented, with an average plantation size of 8 ha.  The age distribution of these forests is young; most of them were established in the past two decades, with approximately 20% entering production stage.  <\/p><p>  The socio-economic importance of the forest resource is significant but often underestimated.  The forestry and forest products sector contribute &euro;2.2 billion to the economy.  Forests contribute to rural development and the sector provides 16,000 jobs.  Ireland possesses the climate and soils to grow forests at a faster rate than most other European countries, yet we fail to exploit our natural advantage, with afforestation rates falling in recent years to the lowest in over 25 years, despite our national strategic plan of 17% forest cover by 2035.  In 2013 only 6,200 ha of new forest were established, well below the sustainable level of 15,000 ha per annum required to achieve the strategic plan.  In the past three years we have consistently failed to plant the 7,000 ha budgetary allocation for the afforestation programme.  A combination of policy and funding measures has undermined farmer confidence in the forestry programme in recent years and contributed to the decline.  Production from the national forest estate is forecast to more than double to 7 million m3 by 2028, with almost all of the increase in supply to come from the private forest estate.  The mobilisation of the private forest resource at the scale required to achieve these targets represents a major challenge for private forest owners and the forestry sector.<\/p><p>  The IFA is concerned that the Bill, if enacted without significant amendments, will create a restrictive legislative framework that will be extremely detrimental to the expansion of the sector.  The primary reason farmers plant trees is to produce and sell a timber crop to realise the best potential from their land.  There are certain sections within the Bill that will act as a barrier to farmer involvement, increase management costs, impede timber production and reduce the financial return on investment.  Private forest owners must have the right to manage their forests in accordance with their own management objectives, as long as the management is consistent with the principles of sustainable forest management.  The requirement to submit a management plan which may be approved, rejected, revoked or revised at any stage is an unnecessary barrier to afforestation and the mobilisation of the timber resource.  It will increase the administrative burden, management costs associated with an operation and create huge uncertainty for private forest owners. <\/p><p>  The Bill proposes to confer wide-ranging powers that will permit the Minister to attach unspecified conditions to, or vary the conditions of, a felling licence, including the power to dictate the type of trees to be replanted or to refuse a felling licence outright without any consideration of the potential financial loss to the forest owner.  Forest owners must be compensated for any financial loss incurred if the conditions attached to management plans or felling licences reduce the economic return on investment.  To confer such broad functions on the Minister, without regard for the management objectives of the forest owner, creates uncertainty and is a major disincentive to farmers considering forestry as a land use option.  In several reports commissioned by the Department the replanting obligation has been cited as a deterrent to the expansion of the forestry sector.  The Bill fails adequately to address this issue and the mandatory replanting requirement should be removed.  In fact, the Bill goes further and proposes that a felling licence or the replanting order may be registered as a burden on forest land.  This is counterproductive to the expansion of the sector and a major deterrent to farmers considering forestry.<\/p><p>  Another major concern for farmers is the penalties and extremely draconian powers given to authorised officers for the purposes of enforcement.  The penalties and powers being conferred are disproportionate to the possible offences and a serious intrusion on the property and basic rights of landowners.  As a farmer who has invested part of my family farm in forestry, I have serious concerns that the Bill will not support me to realise the full potential of my forest.  The level of bureaucracy will significantly increase my management costs, from the proposed introduction of fees to the requirement to have a management plan.  The power to place unspecified conditions or restrictions on, or to review my management plan at any stage, without any regard for my objectives, is not warranted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014012800003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Fleming","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390918800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The Irish Timber Growers Association, ITGA, welcomes the opportunity to make this presentation on the potential impact of the Forestry Bill 2013.

The membership of the association mirrors the wide range of timber growers and the current membership includes farm forest owners, forestry co-operative members, private woodland estates, forestry investors and forestry pension funds.  The 2014 forest industry yearbook, as circulated to the committee, is an example of one of our publications and contains statistics and information on the industry.  We encourage committee members to consult it.<\/p><p>  In considering the Forestry Bill it is important to look at the forestry and timber sector and its many attributes.  While Mr. Fleming has gone through some of them, I will outline the main points again.  <\/p><p>  We must bear in mind that in the last three decades those involved in the private sector were strongly encouraged by the Government to plant their lands which they were giving up from other agricultural activities.  This happened to such an extent that, effectively, all afforestation in the past decade has been undertaken by private sector growers with their own land.  When one considers that 42% to 43% of the European Union's land area is under forest, the most recent forest inventory for Ireland which was launched just last month by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, showed that only 10.5% of Ireland's land area was under forest.  This is despite the fact that in Ireland trees grow considerably faster than in most other European countries.<\/p><p>  The forestry industry is very important to the economy and an emerging industry.  Total annual output is approximately &euro;2.2 billion, with 90% of output from the panel board industry being exported, with some 60% of Irish sawmill output.  In addition, in terms of the environment, the contribution to tackling climate change by Irish forests absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is approximately 4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, or about 6% of our total greenhouse gas emissions.  The Council for Forest Research and Development has stated maintaining the climate change benefits of Irish forests will require continuation of the national afforestation programme at a rate exceeding 15,000 ha per annum in the next two decades.  In six of the last seven years, however, we planted under 7,000 ha per annum, which it is important to note.<\/p><p>  Forestry is a significant employer in rural areas and, if the Bill is put in place and amended as we believe it is important to do, it can be a catalyst for further employment in the sector.  After wind energy, wood fuel is the largest contributor to renewable energy generation in Ireland.  Again, there are implications for this if the level of afforestation falls below 15,000 ha.  Annual visitor numbers to Irish forests have been estimated at in excess of 18 million, another very important attribute of the sector.  Moreover, forest plantations provide suitable habitat for a wide range of native flora and fauna and make a positive contribution to biodiversity conservation.  Much good research demonstrating this has been undertaken and funded by the Council for Forest Research and Development.  Unfortunately, the Bill, as drafted, is likely to have a negative effect on afforestation rates and employment in the sector, with wider consequences for climate change, renewable energy generation, recreation and biodiversity.  Confidence in the future of the forestry sector is critical and the Bill must play a central role in building this confidence.<\/p><p>  While we have circulated our formal submission, I would like to raise some specific points in this regard.  The first concerns potential financial losses for growers.  Under the Bill, the Minister effectively will have the right to refuse a felling licence to somebody in the private sector who has been growing his or her plantation for many years.  However, the legislation does not provide for appropriate reimbursement for the grower's financial loss.  Therefore, the Minister is being empowered to refuse a felling licence for the area where the grower has been trying to make a financial return for his or her family and, possibly, his or her pension fund, but there is no requirement for the State to reimburse the grower for his or her loss.  This is a critical issue.  As we have seen, all planting is now effectively undertaken by the private sector.  If we want to encourage the private sector to plant more, with all of the benefits that come from that, it is important that this issue be tackled.  <\/p><p>  Reimbursement for financial loss must also be provided for where legislation or regulations involve, direct or authorise the destruction of a grower&rsquo;s trees.  The Bill states the Minister can effectively require the destruction of a grower's tress without reimbursement for loss.  The risk that a grower may not receive a felling licence for a forest crop owing to environmental or other reasons is a source of real concern.  We have no issue with the environmental reasons or the Minister not giving a felling licence as long as the woodland owner is reimbursed for his or her loss.  That is the important point.  The potential risk of this occurring is increasing.  As I said, the national forest inventory, NFI, was launched last month by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes.  It showed that over half, or 51%, of the national forest area had one or more environmental designation in the reference year of 2012, compared to 43% in the 2006 NFI results.  Therefore, the area of forest with one or more environmental designations increased by 8% of the forest area in the intervening six years.  While that is not the issue, I draw the attention of the committee to the point that if there are such environmental designations, there is a risk the Minister may, for whatever reason, decide a felling licence may not be granted for a particular area, which would represent a very significant loss for the timber grower.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014012800004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Whelan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390918800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>It has been widely accepted that forestry has great potential in providing jobs and contributing to the environment, recreational amenities and the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014012800004#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Lacey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390919400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lacey and invite Ms Murray to give her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014012800005#F00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390919400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us here to speak today.  We are here from Environmental Pillar, which is an advocacy coalition of 27 national environmental NGOs.  We have six working groups and one of these is the Treecover working group, which produced the report before the committee today.  I am sure all of the members have read the submission we circulated.  Sustainable development is the crux of what we are talking about from an environmental perspective.  The classic definition of sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  There has been political agreement on the need to reach this objective, although in many sectors implementation is still very much lacking.  This is also true of Irish forestry.  Many Irish people care deeply about sustainable development and the benefits it provides to the country but, as a State, we have still not taken serious on-the-ground action.  Irish forestry and forest management still lacks many elements that would make the industry truly sustainable, and we look for this Bill to incorporate these elements to ensure the transition to sustainable development in Irish forestry.  The Bill is an opportunity to reform forestry practices in line with the principles of sustainable development.<\/p><p>  Our first precise request, which is in the document provided, is for sustainable forest management to be defined in the Bill.  It is referred to in the Bill although there is no actual definition.  There is also a reference to a sustainable yield of forest goods and services in the wording which is not appropriate for or capable of achieving sustainable forest management.  <\/p><p>  The second main request is compliance with nature conservation legislation.  Afforestation has a number of very serious impacts on the natural environment, including the key impacts of planting new forestry on habitats.  There are many issues with regard to breeding waders, pollinating insects and a diversity of wild flora, many of whose habitats are native and semi-natural grassland habitats.  These are of a protected type and their extent and quality have declined drastically in recent years.  Forestry is but one of the pressures on these species-rich grassland habitats.  I use this as an example.  There are several habitat types that are under threat from poor forestry practices, so what we have been seeking, which echoes a major recommendation in the BioForest report produced by a couple of different academic institutions, is for all afforestation sites to be surveyed for the presence of semi-natural and species-rich grassland before consent is granted for afforestation.  This is a legislative issue and not something that should be left to policy makers, who have for years neglected to address this issue satisfactorily.  The forestry Bill 2013 must ensure compliance with the birds and habitats directives, particularly in respect of protected habitats.  We have recommended a very specific wording in our submission.  <\/p><p>  Water quality is another issue.  There are serious impacts on water quality from afforestation and forest management, particularly in upland areas near areas with thin or otherwise fragile or erodable soils.  The impacts include nutrient enrichment, sedimentation and consequent loss of ecosystem services.  Water pollution presents a very real cost to society in terms of the loss of valuable ecosystem services, damage to fisheries and increased costs for the treatment of drinking water.  The reference to the water framework directive in the Bill is thus welcome but it needs to be strengthened.  Again, we have put in very specific recommendations for the wording that needs to be amended.<\/p><p>  At the moment, there exists a set of guidelines for forestry and the environment, which were published around 2000 and 2001.  These need to be updated.  There has been some discussion for a while and there is no disagreement about the fact that they need updating.  We also seeking for the Bill to put these on a statutory footing.  They need to be binding rather than being a suite of recommendations that the better foresters go to the trouble of adhering to and others choose to ignore.  <\/p><p>  Native woodlands are another issue.  Ancient native woodland habitats are a relatively rarity in Ireland.  They make up only 0.1% of Ireland's land cover.  These sites are very ecologically and culturally important.  There is a lack of positive conservation management in these ancient native woodland habitats.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014012800005#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anja Murray","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390920000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Murray for her comprehensive submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014012800006#G00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390920000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>May I add a little more?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014012800006#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew St. Ledger"},{"type":"speech","time":1390920000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Certainly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014012800006#G00400","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390920000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity.

The onus is on us as legislators to get the Bill right and to listen attentively to all sides of the argument.  I am conscious of the importance of forestry to the west, particularly the south west, where there is a great deal of marginal land with no prospect of an income other than from forestry.  It is of benefit to local communities and the farmers themselves.  The figure of 16,000 people employed in the sector has been disputed, but that is a side argument and does not matter.  The sector creates employment and is of significant benefit to rural, marginal land communities.<\/p><p>  Without going through the Bill in great detail, I have a number of concerns.  The witnesses have articulated their positions and broken them down well in their presentations.  For someone from that background, it is difficult seeing challenges being created for people who are trying to marry environmental concerns with generating an economy.  It is a question of a happy medium.  No one involved in the industry is deliberately trying to damage the environment, but something must be in place to help people when making decisions.  When they go out of their way to protect the environment, it should not be at a loss to their incomes.  This is a major problem for those in the private forestry sector.<\/p><p>  I also have concerns about the powers that the Bill gives the as-yet-unspecified people who will police it.  Those persons will enter people's property and land without warrants.

What is involved that would be different under this legislation in terms of the administrative burden involved in applying for felling licences?  I agree totally in terms of the timelines for the processing of licences within the Department.  The Department officials are working to amend the proposed legislation in respect of that.  They are also looking at amending the 28 day period for the forest inventory.

We know that many logs are being imported at the moment and the sawed timber is exported again, so that has to be positive for the economy.  It is very important that we continue to grow more trees.  The freedom should be left with the farmer - the point was made by Mr. Fleming - to plant and to manage the trees, and if he feels that an area of land should be taken out after it is felled, it is important that the decision is left to him and that he is not penalised.

The farmer takes on this role in a commercial entity, at the discretion of a forest inspector or the Minister, but he may not have a commercial entity in the second rotation.  That creates a huge problem.  It is not within our control.  A farmer can have a commercial crop in the first rotation but there is no guarantee of a commercial crop in the second rotation, or the farmer may not realise the full amount of the area which has been planted.<\/p><p>  In answer to Deputy Pringle's questions, we see sustainable forest management as managing forestry in an environmental way in which we can realise the potential of our crop and continue to rotate that crop in the same fashion.  There is a cost to a felling licence because a farmer must employ a qualified person to make the application for it.  Senator Comiskey asked about the importation of wood.  We currently are importing approximately 30% of our gross saw log.  We have the capacity, with one of the fastest growth rates in Europe, to produce timber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014012800007#H01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Fleming","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390921200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin Ferris asked whether we had raised the issue of compensation.

Drawing up a management plan would be a significant imposition on owners of smaller areas of forest as they would have to bring in outside expertise.  If one is running a forestry business or any type of farm business, it clearly makes sense to plan.  However, it is not the role of the forest service to tell owners how they should manage their forests.  If they manage their forests badly, they will be exposed to losses, which is their responsibility, as owners.<\/p><p>  Senator Michael Comiskey pointed out that there were jobs and log inputs.  This clearly demonstrates that there is significant demand for timber in this country and that we have the resources and potential to meet it.  This is the reason we are addressing the joint committee.

Under the current arrangement, as provided for in the Forestry Act 1946, fees are not imposed on applications for felling licences.  As well as my role as technical director of the Irish Timber Growers Association, I am also a working forester and manage a number of plantations for farmers and forest owners.  One of the big issues facing them is the time it takes to obtain a felling licence through the system.  The Bill proposes that greater detail will be required in respect of management plans and potential inventory information to receive one's felling licence through the system.  In addition, it proposes that a felling licence will only last for five years, notwithstanding that it is standard management procedure to thin conifer plantations every five years.  The forest service and the Department have limited resources, as do all Departments.  We are concerned that the Bill will impose so many requirements on the sector to obtain a standard felling licence - this is in addition to the other points we have made - that it will cause a logjam in the system.  This is already happening.<\/p><p>  The National Council for Forest Research and Development has produced forecasts for the private sector and found that timber output from the sector will increase tenfold in the next 14 years.  The current system is not fit for purpose.  The Bill proposes a much more detailed application process.  There are approximately 19,000 forest owners in the private sector, all of whom will require a felling licence.  There is no way the system will be able to cope with this level of applications.  This is the issue we have.  It is not the case that we are being negative about the Department.  The critical issue is that, based on our experience, the proposals are not workable.<\/p><p>  Mr. Lacey responded to the point made by Deputy Martin Ferris on compensation.  One of the major issues giving rise to the loss of confidence in the forestry sector is that it takes between 40 and 50 years before a woodland owner obtains a return, although it is an important one.  In the past three or four years forestry has come within the tax net, having previously been tax exempt.  The reason it was tax exempt was that it was such a long-term investment.  Revenue from forestry is not taxable as income tax but comes within the ambit of the high earners' income restrictions.  The issue with this is that it takes 40 or 50 years to obtain the main return from a crop, yet it is effectively taxed as one year's income.  If one wants the private sector to thrive, such barriers must be removed or ameliorated in some way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014012800008#J01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Whelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390921800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Deputy Ferris spoke about the problems in the south west.  I am aware of the concerns in regard to unenclosed land in the south west.  Nationally, if we are to achieve sustainable development of the sector we need to balance interests.  Ideally, forestry should be a positive for the environment.  Pragmatically what we should be aiming for in the meantime is, at least, that it is not damaging to the natural environment and water quality.<\/p><p>  In terms of burning, there can be enormous issues with burning in terms of the release of greenhouse gases from peat and soil erosion.  However, there is good and bad burning.  It is a complex issue.  Problems can arise in this area but we are not quite at the stage where the control of burning is balanced.  It is a huge issue for the forestry industry also.  <\/p><p> Deputy Pringle asked about the convention on biological diversity.  Ireland has signed up to that convention.  It is implemented in each signatory state by way of its national biodiversity plan.  Ireland's national biodiversity plan was published in 2011.  It contains four or five recommendations in relation to forestry, which were developed in conjunction with the forest industry.  That, effectively, is how the convention on biological diversity will be introduced in Ireland.<\/p><p>  On management plans, which I know we were not asked about directly, money from the national Exchequer is financing forestry.  Different interests need to be balanced in forestry.  From our perspective a management plan is a good way to incorporate all of those interests.  For example, as eight hectares is the average size of a forest, this can be an issue for small farmers.  We have seen in other areas how collective development of management plans that can apply to a number of different landowners might be another way around this.  A management plan is a really excellent way of ensuring all of those considerations are balanced.  This should be required where the forester or land owner is in receipt of Exchequer funding over a 20 year period to develop a forest.  My colleague, Mr. St. Ledger, may have more to say on those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014012800009#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anja Murray"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390921800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>A management plan should include support and incentives for farmers and help in achieving the returns being sought from sustainable forest management while balancing the responsibilities to the environment.<\/p><p>  Deputy Pringle also asked about the Rio convention.  There is a set of forest principles attached to the Rio convention, which Ireland signed up to.  The concept of sustainable forest management derives from those forest principles, the aim of which is to balance the social, economic and environmental aspects of forestry for the long-term benefits of all.  An SFC certification process is used to verify sustainable forest management in Ireland.  Those principles come from the Rio convention.<\/p><p>  On the employment figures, while I mentioned the figure of 11,500 earlier, there is room for much more employment.  In mentioning that figure I was not trying to challenge the IFA.  I believe there is potential for much more employment, as there was in the 1950s in the west of Ireland under the Sean McBride-Bulmer Hobson 10,000 hectare afforestation programme, which preserved the economic life of the west of Ireland.  <\/p><p>  Senator Comiskey referred to the recreation aspect of forestry.  This is also forms part of the Rio forest principles.  In other words, there must be benefits to the public.  In Switzerland all forests, public and private, are accessible to the public.  The Rio convention is enshrined in the Swiss constitution.  Its forest strategy and management is dedicated to achieving the forest principles.  It is one of the countries in the world that is seriously considering sustainable forest management for economic, social and environmental returns.  We could do with studying where it is coming from.<\/p><p>  Going back a little in history to 1904, the first recommendation of the committee which considered the reafforestation of Ireland at a time when it had less than 1% coverage was that a shelter belt be implemented along the whole west coast of Ireland, with the benefits that were known for farming, agriculture and communities coming inland.  However, that never happened.  Only some of the recommendations of that committee, particularly those relating to timber production, were picked up on.  It would perhaps be worth revisiting that committee's full report in terms of the different multiple industries that committee believed could help Ireland regenerate its economy, using forestry as a backbone.<\/p><p>  On jobs and funding for forestry, there is provision in the rural development programme, by way of EU funding, for forestry.  It appears at this stage that Ireland will not avail of this under the next rural development programme.  That is an issue.  Funding will then have to come from the Exchequer, as has been the case since 2007.  As such, there will be less funding available for more narrow policies, namely, timber production and primacy of profit.  We will miss out on the opportunity to achieve the other objectives of sustainable forest management.  One of the better forest service elements of the native woodlands scheme, namely, conservation, has been dropped.  This relates to the management of semi-natural existing woodlands, in which area additional employment could be created.  An opportunity is being missed to tick boxes regarding the environmental, social and cultural aspects of forestry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014012800009#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew St. Ledger"},{"type":"speech","time":1390921800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Pringle wish to ask a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014012800009#K00400","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1390921800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>In regard to the management plans and the administrative burden in terms of costs and so on, the witnesses did not clarify the current cost of a felling licence and what new costs are anticipated as a result of this legislation.

It is reasonable in my view that management plans should be put in place given the State's investment in this area into the future.

I wish to make it clear to Deputies that farmers make a contribution.  They are tying up the land for life, forever.  There is an incentive for 20 years and that is important because they have no source of income for the first 20 years when they are taking on the commodity.  They are committing their land forever and they have no level of compensation for the second rotation or whatever.  It is a once-off payment.  The value of that land will be greatly reduced once it enters forestry.<\/p><p>  Deputy Ferris raised the fact that we have not reached the target of 7,000 ha of planting.  That is quite correct.  This year we reached 6,200 ha, last year we reached 6,500 ha and year before that 6,250 ha.  As we said in our initial statement, forestry works on confidence.  There was an 8% cut on premium in 2009 and that certainly dented confidence.<\/p><p>  Another aspect had a major bearing on the matter as well.  In 2009, the Department reduced the premium for marginal land from approximately &euro;99 per acre to &euro;65 per acre.  In 2010, the Department came back and put an arbitrary 20% figure on the amount of ground it would allow through the system.  In other words, a farmer had to plant four acres of a good field to get in one acre of marginal land.  This had a major bearing on the figure as well.  It is probably not the entire explanation of why we are not achieving our figure, but certainly it had a major bearing in the reduction and why we are not getting our figures.<\/p><p>  We must look forward and consider 2020 and whether to grow other products, perhaps dairy, beef and sheep.  That will have to come out of the good land.  We must give our marginal land consideration.  If the land has the productive capacity to grow timber and it is not tripping up any environmental constraint, surely we must consider planting the land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014012800010#L01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Fleming"},{"type":"speech","time":1390922400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>There is a certain diversity of perspective on the Forestry Bill and afforestation.  One thing that is agreed is that Ireland should try to up its percentage of land cover under forestry.  By way of context, for anyone in Wicklow who wishes to plant, the matter is asset sensitive.  A grower must have four water tests carried out, from February to May, inclusive, on the area he proposes to grow.  A 15% biodiversity area is mandatory in all new plantations.  This area must be set aside for biodiversity.  One of the barriers to native woodland species approvals in Wicklow has been deer.  Only one has been granted in the past three years and that is almost in County Dublin.  None the less, it is a consistent problem.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to vegetation.  For the purposes of the new rural development programme, Wicklow Uplands Council, Burren Life and others are putting in upland environment management plans which include burning.  There is no point in saying otherwise.  However, it is in a managed way and it is traditional.  It is done for a variety of reasons, including to improve the vegetation and to allow deer to migrate up to where their more native territory would have been.  It is also done to prevent spreading fires, which are a danger to everyone and woodland.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to open access.  Consideration must be given to young plantations in particular and to not allowing any access until they are well established.  I live in the middle of the Coillte forest estate.  One of the greatest problems is that there are water tankers on stand-by at all times in Trooperstown, where the public play, in case of fire.<\/p><p>  The concern on the other side relates to not having some form of default position with an obligation to replant.  The concern I have is that this leaves it wide open to speculators to purchase the land, clean the timber and walk away.  Perhaps at the time the felling licence was granted a decision was made but there may be reasons a grower would not plant now where he planted 25 years ago, especially if he is aware of issues relating to the yield class, the environment or whatever.  We should be cognisant of the fact that if we simply state that there is no replanting obligation, we are leaving ourselves open to be pillaged.  That is a personal opinion.  I am concerned there may be no safety measures in place for that.  I say that as someone who is a private forest owner and grower, albeit a small one.  None the less, it is something we should bear in mind.<\/p><p>  It is interesting that the Irish Forestry and Forest Products Association welcomes management plans.  The association maintains they should not be mandatory.  There is a size above which they should be mandatory, but certainly for smaller plantations they should be incorporated into the conditions of an afforestation grant, which should be sufficient, and the felling licence should take care of the rest.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to the 28 day timeframe.  That is ridiculous when we consider there is a three month period for planning applications to be processed.  Purely from the point of view of efficiency, a five year felling licence with the amount of licences that will come down the path in the coming years is unworkable given the level of manpower available at the moment.

I am accompanied by Mr. Martin Shanahan, Ms Nina Brennan and Mr. William Parnell.<\/p><p>  I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to discuss the Action Plan for Jobs in general.  We are all aware of the scale of the jobs challenge continuing to face Ireland and the wider European Union at this time.  Behind every job lost there are families and businesses struggling to cope with the impact of the downturn.  This is not what we want for the economy or society, which is why in Ireland the Government has put the jobs and growth strategy centre stage and made job creation our key priority, matching the priorities agreed in Europe through the Europe 2020 strategy and the various flagships, including the industrial policy flagship.  Overcoming the jobs challenge will be greatly enhanced by improving Ireland's and Europe&rsquo;s competitiveness.  This will reduce the cost of enterprises doing business here and also make our economies attractive for multinational corporations in which to invest in their latest projects.<\/p><p>  In essence, every economy must continue to adapt to be able to compete and win when faced with the constant flux in global supply and demand.  Ensuring we are competitive will give us that ability to adapt and win.  As a tool to give us that adaptability, the Government has put in place the Action Plan for Jobs with a dual mandate of encouraging growth and creating and maintaining jobs in the economy.  The intention is to transform the economy that suffered so badly during the economic crisis into an economy built on enterprise, exports and innovation.  The Action Plan for Jobs does not purport to be a silver bullet that will change our economic fortunes overnight, rather it is about grinding out transformations in how we support business, one by one, to make Ireland a better place in which to do business.<\/p><p>  Since it was introduced in 2012, the Action Plan for Jobs has been one of the Government&rsquo;s key instruments to support job creation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800003#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390917000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy for that update.

I also welcome his comments on Forf&aacute;s.  I acknowledge the presence of Mr. Martin Shanahan and pay tribute to him and all the team  in Forf&aacute;s for their work.  I knew it was to be morphed into the Department this year and ask the Secretary General to comment on this as the transformation process happens.  Will he give a commitment that the research budget of Forf&aacute;s will be ring-fenced within the Department and that the independence of Forf&aacute;s will be maintained in terms of research?  At times it publishes reports that challenge the system.<\/p><p>  On the Action Plan for Jobs, I am not enthusiastic about it.  There is no doubt that progress has been made, which is a tribute to many people, including the delegates and many agencies.  However, I am frustrated that one publishes the fact that 92% of actions are achieved because when one begins to drill down, it is very difficult to get the details.  <\/p><p>  I want to focus on the issue of finance for SMEs.  It has been stated the two pillar banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, have lent &euro;2.5 billion, a figure we accept to be true.  However, when I sought details in a parliamentary question to the Department of Finance as to the where the money had been lent, whether it was to be used for new facilities or to refinance existing facilities, I was informed it could not share the information because it was commercially sensitive.  How are we to judge the quality of the lending of &euro;2.5 billion in supporting business and creating employment?<\/p><p>  The Secretary General mentioned the new instruments, Microfinance Ireland and the credit guarantee scheme.  Microfinance Ireland's team appeared before the joint committee in October when it made a very good presentation.  Will the delegates bring me up to date and indicate whether there has been a change in its staffing?  It had lent &euro;2.16 million up to the end of last year and the plan was to lend &euro;8 million.  What difference will we see in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 in the case of Microfinance Ireland?  Similarly, under the credit guarantee scheme about &euro;68,000 is being lent per month.  The target was to lend &euro;150 million.  What other changes will we see in that regard?<\/p><p>  In regard to IDA Ireland, its recently appointment chairman, Mr. Frank Ryan, appeared before the committee before Christmas.  Its end of year report showed that it was not reaching its Horizon 2020 targets in terms of having a regional spread.  It has been mentioned that it is important we do not lose our competitive gains as the economy begins to grow.  That was a major problem as it grew the last time.  If we continue to coral inward investment in Dublin and Cork - 64% or 65% of prime business went to Dublin and Cork last year - it will drive up property and service prices.  In the meantime, the rest of the country is not being a given a chance to grow.  I genuinely believe we are in a position to begin to put pressure on in terms of legal fees and property prices that skewed our competitive position on the last occasion.  Will the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 include a provision to address regional imbalances to have more of a focus on the regions in terms of inward investment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800005#E00300","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1390917000,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I welcome the Secretary General and his team.  There is no doubt that there has been good news on the jobs front in recent times.  That the live register figures have dropped from 15.1% at their peak in 2012 to 12.8% is good news.  However, it appears there is too much of a focus on the percentages.  It seems to be a case of \"never mind the quality, feel the width\", which seems to permeate through the review of the Action Plan for Jobs, which does not deal with the many concerns of people and businesses about the economy and the labour market.  For example, the report does not focus on the impact of emigration to a great extent.  It does not look at the rise in the casualisation of labour and the number of part-time jobs.  The figures show that more part-time jobs have been created than full-time jobs in recent years.  A decrease in weekly earnings also features in yearly reviews from the ESRI and Government figures.  The use of zero hour contracts and the issue of youth unemployment do not feature heavily in the Action Plan for Jobs and, as far as I can see, there is no real focus, either in the Secretary General's presentation or the report, on long-term unemployment and regional disparities, which the previous speaker mentioned.  In fact, some of the actions included in the original Action Plan for Jobs in this regard have been dropped.<\/p><p>  The report on the Action Plan for Jobs refers to competitiveness and labour costs, but it does not deal with energy costs, upward-only rent reviews, an issue raised by members of the committee on several occasions, telecommunications, legal and insurance costs.  There is much box-ticking in this respect.  These big issues are almost like herds of elephants in the room and not being dealt with.  There is a focus on quantity but not quality.  <\/p><p>  The issue of upward-only rent reviews featured in the original Action Plan for Jobs, but it was dropped in the review.  What was the reason for this?  Also in regard to regional disparities, the target set for IDA Ireland by the Government in the original Action Plan for Jobs was that 50% of all IDA Ireland jobs should be created outside Cork and Dublin.   It has not reached this target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800005#E00400","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390917600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>There are several questions for you, Secretary General.

The first question was about the integration of Forf&aacute;s.  I am pleased to say we have worked closely together on delivering the Government decision and in particular on delivering the set of objectives and principles which the Minister laid out.  Deputy Calleary raised two specific points.  The research budget for Forf&aacute;s is not being reduced.  There will be a research budget.  It will be managed as part of the overall research budget for the Department.  There is no intention to reduce the resources for research.  The policy staff within Forf&aacute;s have reduced in number in recent years but there is staffing in the Department.  The staff are being kept in a strategic policy division and I will add some resources to that.  There are certain dependents.  We have given a good deal of thought to that.<\/p><p>  Forf&aacute;s, on its own account and through bodies such as the National Competitiveness Council, has provided a strong analytical evidence-based critique of policy and implementation deficits over the years and we have no wish to lose that capacity.  In fact, I see it being strengthened by the organisation being part of the wider Department and by being more plugged-in to the wider range of policies that the Department deals with, when able to call on resources throughout the Department.  Certainly, it is our intention that this capacity to say uncomfortable things - whether it is about the Department, other agencies of the Department or across Government - should be retained because that provides a service to Government.  Certainly it is our intention to maintain that.<\/p><p>  A question was asked about Action Plan for Jobs.  I will cover the question raised by Senator Cullinane as well.  The Minister has not been box ticking on access to finance, particularly in the case of Microfinance Ireland and the credit guarantee scheme.  We established those two schemes.  We have acknowledged that the take-up has not been what we would have wished.  The Minister brought forward the review of the credit guarantee scheme because of that concern.  We intend to identify several changes we can make to the credit guarantee scheme which would improve its operation.<\/p><p>  The case of Microfinance Ireland is relevant to the question raised about trying to get at the detail of access to finance more generally.  We have been working closely with the cabinet committee on access to finance and mortgage arrears, the Credit Review Office and the Central Bank to examine the statistics and what they mean qualitatively as well as quantitatively.  We have asked whether there are areas where access to microfinance can be made more readily available.  For example, should we wait until someone has been formally refused?  Are there other things that could be put in place which would facilitate access?  We will look at changes to improve its operation.<\/p><p>  I am unsure what the question on Microfinance Ireland staff is about exactly, because MFI operates at arm's length.  It is not formally an agency of the Department.  It is a sub-agency of the Social Finance Foundation.  I know there was a change in staffing before Christmas at one level and I understand a post is advertised at the moment.<\/p><p>  There were questions about regional targets.  We have not abandoned those targets.  However, we have acknowledged that they are difficult to meet.  We are not corralling investment in Dublin and Cork.  It is not possible to corral investment in any particular part of the country, much as we might like to.  We must accept that companies will locate their projects where it best suits their requirements.  There is limited scope to influence that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1390917600,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I asked why it was dropped from the review.

That target will remain until the end of this year, when that strategy runs out.  There is an absolute commitment to try to achieve that target but, as the Secretary General has said, there is also an acknowledgement that it is remarkably difficult to achieve that.  We do not control companies' decisions.  The IDA can influence companies and assist companies in making their decisions but the agency cannot direct them and we should acknowledge that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800006#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Shanahan"},{"type":"speech","time":1390917600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I have no difficulty in acknowledging that.

That is the only measure we have.<\/p><p>  This comes back to my first question to the Secretary General in terms of the breakdown of the &euro;2.5 billion.  I understand a good deal of that money has gone to agriculture.  That is great and there has been significant employment growth in agriculture.  However, when we meet people from small and medium-sized enterprises who are not involved in agriculture, we hear they are frustrated because they maintain the money is not being lent.  I have no wish to know every company that got a loan from Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks but even if we had general headings we could make a call on the action plan and the targets being met.  I realise the job of the IDA is difficult but when we consider the nature of client visits, it suggests to me that there will be no change in terms of the actual job announcements and the regional spread of those job announcements in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800006#F00800","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390917600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>There has been a change because in 2013 the proportion of investments outside Dublin and Cork rose from 25% to 30%.

Are there any key recommendations that have not been implemented, or not fully implemented?  What would be Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s priority in that regard?<\/p><p>  In the 2013 plan Mr. Murphy referred to business trading online.  One would support the idea to increase the number of businesses trading online.  I made a submission on the 2014 plan regarding the rural economy and broadband.  There are many businesses that still do not have the basic rural broadband.  The ESB (Electronic Communications Networks) Bill 2013 was published last week, which will allow the piggybacking of communications infrastructure on the network.  That is a welcome development.  There is a lot of work in that area.  Are there any specific recommendations for the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources?  The previous national broadband plan looked well and I appreciate it was a realistic attempt, but it was not successful.  Many areas were mapped as having adequate broadband cover but the reality on the ground was not that good.  That should be a key recommendation for the whole area of rural business.<\/p><p>  When the committee focused on the rural economy, we did a tour, visiting several towns, including Ballinrobe, Castlebar and Ballinasloe, to investigate some of the problems retailers have.

I thank Forf&aacute;s for the great work it has done, in particular in the area of mentoring, on which I worked directly with it last year.  It was very effective.  I am really glad to see that entrepreneurship has finally made it onto Action Plan for Jobs plan in a big way.  That is a huge part of driving investment into regional development.  I spoke to some business colleagues in north Cork yesterday about how to keep our regions and towns alive.  Some interesting points came up about social enterprise, which is the responsibility of the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sherlock.  That is a new buzzword in Europe.  We could consider the co-op model with small offices and businesses.  If the services are not provided in small towns, business moves to big towns.  A social enterprise co-op model might help small businesses, which are a social enterprise, to get off the ground.  We are developing something at the moment which might be a pilot scheme.  When companies come into Ireland and want to invest where the market, skills and infrastructure are, it is very challenging to bring them down to the regions.  We have to be realistic about that.  It is a matter of getting them in and hopefully the effect will be felt everywhere eventually.<\/p><p>  It is a bit harsh to say that the microfinance guarantee is not working yet.  It takes a lot of time to get that out and for people to understand it.  People have come to my office recently and talked about setting up business and it has been good to have information to give them and to be able to offer them choices that did not exist before.  It is difficult but I hope that when the LEOs are up and running later this year there will be better distribution of information.  It is hard to get the message out.  The committee has often discussed this issue.  Unless people listen and are interested they will not know what is available for entrepreneurship.  I understand that there will be a change in mentoring under Action Plan for Jobs 2014.  Does Mr. Murphy want to comment on that?  I thank him for being here today.<\/p><p>  When we were in Brussels we heard many compliments paid to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and its team of civil servants, particularly for the work they did during the European Presidency.

It is very difficult to say.  One of the arguments made by Forf&aacute;s at the outset of the action plan is that all these actions need to be done, whether big or small.  Sometimes it may seem unwieldy when the actions are set out but they are all important for business by making it easier for business to do business and ultimately to create private sector jobs.<\/p><p>  The JobsPlus initiative was introduced during 2013.  The take-up of such an initiative is immediately evident.  The reaction has been very positive and much more positive than for the preceding schemes.  It is evident that we are going in the right direction.  Some actions are not always successful and it may be necessary to review and change them.  Other areas where there has been a direct impact are areas such as ICT skills.  There was a significant focus on ICT skills in 2013.  We can see the output from the programmes coming on stream now.  Jobs are available for those people who have completed those programmes because there is a shortage of skills in those areas.<\/p><p>  The legislative commitments in the action plan are equally important although it takes time for them to work through.  The action plan is all-encompassing and there will be a continued focus on certain areas.  One would expect a continuing focus on competitiveness, costs, productivity, research and innovation, support for small and medium enterprises, and foreign direct investment.  These are the stock-in-trade of the enterprise agencies and on which they will need to continue their focus in the 2014 action plan.<\/p><p>  The Deputy referred to broadband provision.  The Department is responsible for enterprise and Forf&aacute;s is the enterprise body.  We are continually in discussion about how to improve broadband services and provision.  The current action plan includes a commitment on online trading.  A trading online pilot scheme has been running in 2013 and a further pilot scheme will be beginning in the next month and the scheme will be rolled out during 2014, with a view to getting a significant number of companies trading online.  Undoubtedly this is an expanding market area.<\/p><p>  With regard to the rural economy, the action plan addresses the entirety of the country and does not exclude any area.  There are multiple enterprise supports such as provided by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland has a suite of enterprise supports which are available throughout the country.  The local enterprise offices will be established and will provide another layer of support.  All these layers together will impact on rural development and development outside the main urban centres.<\/p><p>  We are conscious of the need to help those areas make themselves attractive for enterprise.  There is scope for leadership at a number of levels, including at local level.  The provision of advance infrastructure such as factories is part of the support.<\/p><p>  Deputy Collins has worked closely with Forf&aacute;s last year on the aspect of mentoring and entrepreneurship.  We hope to publish the outcome of that work in the very near future.  It has been very informative to hear the views of businesses and we will build on the work done by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  Forf&aacute;s published a report on social enterprise during 2013.  We identified scope for a significant development in the area of social enterprise and allied job creation.  If we were to achieve a level of social enterprise relative to the rest of Europe, the number of jobs may be of the order of 25,000.  However, it would require work on establishing the correct environment.  Coherent governance was one of the issues identified.  Since the publication of our report, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, has been given responsibility for this area, supported by an interdepartmental group which is working through the various recommendations with a view to implementation.  Bringing coherence in the first instance is a significant advance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800008#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Shanahan"},{"type":"speech","time":1390918800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing the previous two meetings of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800008#H00300","speaker":"1031"},{"type":"speech","time":1390918800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>The Deputy's apologies are accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800008#H00400","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1390918800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Two members who spoke earlier emphasised and highlighted what has not been achieved in the economy.

It is vital that we continue on our current path when it comes to job creation.  There is a fear out there that our cost base may be starting to increase, with significant implications for our competitiveness.  Mr. Murphy indicated that the Department is working with six companies on issues such as reducing red tape, although that was not the phrase he used.  Can he identify those companies?<\/p><p>  We have spoken on several occasions about the need to ensure that information on the various schemes and options available to people is readily available.  I cannot help but think of the For Dummies series of books which offers comprehensive guidance on a range of subjects.  I do not mean to cause offence by using the word \"dummies\", but I am regularly asked about the type of assistance that is available, how people can get started, source finance and so on.  There is a range of schemes at all levels and the evidence is that people are failing, for whatever reason, to access the information on those schemes.  It might be useful to put together some type of document setting out all the information in one place.<\/p><p>  One of the most pressing aspects of the unemployment issue is youth unemployment.  I agree with Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins that there was great praise for the Department at all of the meetings we have attended in Brussels in terms of its efforts to restore the economy.  I proposed at one of those meetings that Horizon 2020 should incorporate a provision on youth unemployment.  Will Mr. Murphy indicate whether the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is the lead Department on Horizon 2020?<\/p><p>  When I met recently with the president of the students union at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, he referred to the requirement for graduates to wait up to six months before being eligible to access the various employment activation schemes.  I accept that the long-term unemployed are a priority under these schemes, but many of these well-qualified graduates are struggling to enter the workforce.  The jobs market has changed dramatically in recent years.  When I was going to school, a person leaving with a junior certificate could expect to get a job.  Now, one needs a primary degree if there is to be any chance of getting into the labour market.  In fact, a fourth level qualification is a requirement in many cases.  The president of the students union in Maynooth pointed out that the requirement for graduates to be unemployed for up to six months before they can access a scheme means that some will end up disappearing, either out of the country or out of the education system.  Would it be possible to amend the action plan for 2014 to accommodate these graduates?  They need a pathway into full-time employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800009#J00200","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1390919400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>To back up Deputy Lawlor's last point, we have had feedback from businesses which are interviewing for internship positions that graduates are very frustrated when they discover they must be unemployed for up to six months before qualifying for JobBridge and other schemes.  We accept that these programmes are primarily designed to get people off social welfare and back into work, but people coming out of college would benefit greatly from participating in them.  Some graduates find the notion of having to sign on for three months or six months offensive and simply will not do it.  There is a danger of people falling through the cracks, which would be a shame.  Amending the scheme in some way to accommodate new graduates would be helpful.  It is an issue being raised by both students and witnesses who have come before the committee.<\/p><p>  I congratulate Mr. Murphy and Mr. Shanahan and their teams on the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs.  The concept is perfect and makes total sense.  I agree that in some cases it is about getting back to basics, which involves a certain amount of box ticking.  The reality, however, is that if the boxes are not ticked, we cannot make progress on the larger issues.  The overall concept has been right from the start and has proved very productive.  Driving it forward is the key.  The cross-departmental nature of the initiative is vital to its success, because it facilitates the decision-making progress.  Witnesses have told us they are getting answers more quickly than in the past because there is co-ordination and momentum.  It is the aim of every Department to find ways of creating jobs. What we finally have, in other words, is a whole-of-government approach.<\/p><p>  I understand there was an opportunity for interested parties to make submissions on the proposals for 2014.  Did many business people or organisations avail of that opportunity?  Again, it is a question of the availability of information and whether it was widely known that the opportunity was there.  If the take-up was not high, we should focus on more effective advertising of the process for 2015.  It makes sense, as the action plan is rolled out for the third year, to involve as many stakeholders as possible.<\/p><p>  Mr. Shanahan mentioned the success of the JobsPlus initiative.  Can he give us updated data in this regard?  The feedback that came through to the committee initially was that the scheme needed to be simplified, which I understand was done in the Action Plan for Jobs and is working well.  Will Mr. Shanahan comment on that?<\/p><p>  The plan for 2014 includes measures to help new businesses to grow, enhance their export capacity and so on.  However, we are still seeing cases where people have an idea for a product or concept but do not want to form a company or are not in a position to do so.  It is difficult to point such people in the right direction in terms of how they can progress their idea.  We have the potential exporters division in Enterprise Ireland, the enterprise boards and so on, but where people have an idea or concept but do not necessarily want to set up a company, it can be difficult to point them in the direction of investors.  There is a gap that needs to be addressed in terms of moving ideas through the system.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to the various Forf&aacute;s reports that have been published, including the report on future skills needs.  That is an issue on which the committee has done some work and which we intend to return to in future.  Another report dealt with the shortage of language skills among the Irish workforce, an issue that is not addressed in the Action Plan for Jobs.  The ICT action plan, to give an example, has worked very well, but there has been little more than talk when it comes to developing jobseekers' language skills.  Will this important issue feature in the plan for 2014?  It is a problem that will persist for years.  As it stands, significant numbers of jobs cannot be filled by our own people because they do not have the necessary language skills.<\/p><p>  My final question relates to the immigrant investor programme operated by the Department of Justice and Equality.  There is potential for a great deal of money to come in through that scheme but it is not working to its full potential.  I understand it was reviewed last year and various changes were made, but it should feature more prominently in the Action Plan for Jobs.  Perhaps there is a certain fear around it because it gives access to multi-entry visas and so on.  There is a lot of money out there that could be tapped into by way of the scheme, money we badly need in this country.  Although the programme comes under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality, it might need to be driven to some extent by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800009#J00300","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390920000,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I was referring to disruptive reforms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800010#K00200","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390920000,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I will reply to some of the points and I will then hand over to Mr. Shanahan and anyone else among our number who may wish to comment.<\/p><p>  I will deal with the points in the order in which they were raised.  Deputy Conaghan stated that we should focus on what has been achieved as well as on the negative.  I hardly expected him to disagree with that.  There is no room for complacency.  When the economy starts to recover, we must be careful that we do not allow cost or other pressures to get out of hand.  We will, therefore, be keeping a very close focus on that.  We are conscious that there are significant pockets of disadvantage and categories within the labour force that have not benefited as much as we would like.  We need to keep addressing those and identifying what works.  In the context of ICT skills, for example, we have had considerable success in terms of increasing the number of graduates.  We have overachieved on the targets that were set.  However, there is a significant demand for people who do not necessarily need degree qualifications.  Rather, these individuals must be tech savvy and, critically, they must be employable.  As a result, they need to possess other skills.  We must focus on this aspect to the same degree that we focus on the number of projects involved or whatever.  A large number of people, including individuals on the live register, who might well be highly tech savvy and who think the only jobs in the area of ICT are for graduates.  That is actually not true.  It is important to foster very good communications between industry, education providers and the labour market - I include the Department of Social Protection in this regard - in order that we might identify suitable people, make them ready and put them forward, at the levels to which I refer as well as at the higher levels.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is absolutely correct that there is potential in terms of the social economy.  Mr. Shanahan referred to this matter earlier.  We do not control some of the policy levers or instruments that can be used.  There are already quite a number of Exchequer measures in place which can support the social economy or which are already supporting it.  However, it is not all necessarily as well joined up as should be the case.  That is one of the particular difficulties in the sector.  I am of the view that we are not maximising the value of Leader, Pobal and the other smaller initiatives that exist.  We do not own those levers and, quite frankly, I have no desire to own them in light of what we have on our plate at present.<\/p><p>  Deputy Lawlor referred to keeping up the pressure in respect of the cost base.  As already indicated, we are very conscious of the need to do that.  He inquired about who we are working with in respect of red tape.  We like to refer to it as the \"administrative burden\".  We have been working on measures to simplify that burden on business.  An exercise was carried out across Government in respect of an EU target relating to reducing the administrative burden on business by 25%.  We have met that target, as have a number of other Departments.  The remaining Departments have found it more difficult to do so.  This is something we will be continuing to pursue.<\/p><p>  In the context of ensuring that businesses are aware of what is available, I must admit that I have not read any of the books in the For Dummies series but perhaps I should.  Ensuring that people have the right information at the right time is a constant issue.  There will be a particular challenge for the LEOs in the context of putting in place first-stop shops which bring together the resources of local authorities which relate to all of the issues which can arise for someone starting a business, including planning, rates and various other administrative requirements.  Then there is the issue of start-up capital for these individuals.  The Chairman referred to someone who has an idea about a product or service but who does not have much else going for him or her.  It is exactly this kind of person which the county enterprise boards, which are going to become the LEOs, are designed to help, including through the provision of low-level funding for feasibility studies.  If people are serious about going into business, then they must get beyond merely having an idea and reach the point where they can draw up effective business plans and either present them to banks in order to obtain funding or secure other forms of financing from, for example, the microfinance initiative.  There is a fair amount of work to be done but the LEOs should act as the filter in this regard.  County enterprise boards have been doing it for the past 20 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800010#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1390920000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>It will be within their scope to do a great deal more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800010#K00400","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390920000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>We want the service to be enhanced.

The Government has set a target of securing &euro;1.25 billion between now and 2020.  We will be working in conjunction with Science Foundation Ireland and the other research institutions in this regard.  We must ensure that we can source international partners because that is a critical requirement of Horizon 2020.  Having such partners on board will facilitate us in putting forward the right kind of proposals forward in order to secure the return that is sought and underpin job creation.  A much higher proportion of the new jobs being created by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland companies are based on the output of research and innovation or on new products and processes.

There are a number of ways of feeding into the action plan.  In the first instance, there is an open invitation and a facility on the DJEI website, whereby any member of the public can make a submission on the action plan.  I write specifically to individuals and particularly to representative groups seeking an input.  The Minister has met a significant number of groups and individuals, whom we felt might have something to say and offer in terms of suggestions on the action plan.  They range from entrepreneurs, particularly young entrepreneurs, to business people managing significant businesses to representative groups of multinationals, indigenous and small businesses.  We invite comment from across the public system as they are the ones who will be delivering a good deal of this and thereby seek their input in the first instance.  The employee representatives - the unions - have been invited to make submissions, as have the representatives of the unemployed.  We have met the INOU, among others.  Those operating in academic and other think-tanks have also been invited.  To give a sense of the scale of the process involved, it generated in the region of 700 possible suggestions, although they overlap and involve a good deal of duplication and a different take on different matters.  Our own research, analysis and so on act as an overlayer and it is then a matter of trying to bring it down to something more manageable.<\/p><p>  On the Secretary General's point on language skills, we must recognise that it is quite an ask of the education system.  There are multiple areas in which we see the need for additional skills, whether they be ICT or selling skills to sell abroad.  Having language skills is not only a requirement for those taking up jobs in international companies here, they also give people the ability to go abroad and sell, which is probably a significant issue for us at this time.  Technical skills, the output from apprenticeships and ensuring good connections are all issues.  We are constantly in discussions with colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills about trying to ensure there is a match in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800011#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Shanahan"},{"type":"speech","time":1390920600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>The reason I raise the point is that while I accept that the Department of Education and Skills has a good deal to do, in presentations made to us through the colleges it has been indicated that students do not necessarily understand the importance of having a  language.

It would be useful if we could use the Action Plan for Jobs as an opportunity to highlight the issue again.

The Secretary General spoke about entrepreneurship and the Chairman responded to his comment on a person who had an idea for a product.  This is a key area in which mentoring comes into play.  When a person goes into a local enterprise office, the first thing he or she needs is to have a mentor appointed for him or her.  It is very important that mentors be properly educated and connected, an issue which is covered in a report about to be published.  <\/p><p>  Also, in regard to regional development, when the layers are developed, I stress that it is important that they extend outwards.  I only know about the position in Cork; I cannot talk for the rest of the country.  There has been an issue for Cork County Council in that when local enterprise offices were set up in various towns throughout the county, the council had to fund their establishment.  It would be useful if a person from the local enterprise office came to a region one day a forthnight which would ensure more of a spread.  People do not know where to go and if we are to get the word out, we need to have more of these offices.  That is an important point.<\/p><p>  Mr. Shanahan was the first person to mention apprenticeships.  That is an issue we need to re-examine.  There are a great number of skills that could be learned.

However, critically, it needs the right relationship with industry.  Much of the work in which Forf&aacute;s has been involved is about identifying, classifying and drilling down into the skills needs of enterprise and industry.

One is to state one should forget about environmental targets and simply focus on a cheap energy policy but that is not a sustainable solution.  As for the climate change policy, we recognise there are significant reasons for taking a leadership role in Europe on climate change.  A second way to look at this is to manage demand for energy and in the research and innovation area, much of the focus has been on smarter ways of doing that.  Part of the agenda for manufacturing must concern ways of addressing energy costs, smarter ways of manufacturing and all that.  Nevertheless, the reality is that our energy costs are substantially higher than in the United States, for example, and this issue must be addressed.  Mr. Murray referred to how the United States is bringing back manufacturing because it has become more cost-competitive and we must recognise this.  This is the reason there has been a focus on having greater flexibility in how we reach climate change targets to avoid, through having a rigid target, imposing additional costs on business.  We must try to take a more balanced approach.<\/p><p>  The Department has a focus on having a better internal market in energy.  A fair bit of progress has been made on an all-island energy market and I have looked at the east-west energy links but for Europe as a whole, there must be a more efficient internal market in energy and more work remains to be done in this regard.  Our focus is very much on these other major policy pillars, which must reflect the concern for competitiveness and this is where we will seek to make that input.  However, we will seek to make it in a way that also recognises the importance of the other policy agendas, just as we would hope those who are pursuing environmental or other policy goals would recognise the enterprise agenda. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800014#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1390922400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>In a practical, functional way, do the witnesses make this input or have that influence directly or through the other Departments?

One actually must have a starting point, which is, what is our industrial policy, what do we seek to achieve and how can we achieve that, while taking into account our other policy objectives?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800014#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390922400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>It is interesting that in its recently-published climate change package, the Commission has decided not to renew the so-called 20-20-20 target, that is, a 20% improvement in efficiency, a 20% increase in the use of renewable sources and a 20% reduction in carbon emissions.  Some would state the best energy efficiency is no energy and therefore, energy usage should be reduced and that probably is the best way to go.  Rather than that, the Commission is proposing in respect of renewable sources at least 20% of the total energy mix - I emphasise \"total energy mix\" - binding only at European Union level.  In other words, the target would be reached in a combination of the entire European Union.  The message about competitiveness, certainly from our perspective in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is one we would welcome.  Our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government may not share that particular perspective but the way it is going at European level, certainly because it is being put to the fore at Heads of Government level at the European Council in March, will give a better focus to the competitive aspects of all this.  Moreover, the 40% emissions targets is the one on which the Commission now is concentrating.  Ultimately, that will be agreed by leaders and thereafter, the Commission then will propose a legislative package for 2015 around the whole area of European Union emissions targets but that would be the only binding target, as far as I understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800014#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thomas Murray"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390922400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I wish to pick up on something Mr. Murray mentioned in respect of trade.  The European Union is negotiating a comprehensive suite of trade agreements across the world.  Members are familiar with the proposed transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, with the United States but there also is an agreement with Japan, as well as the one with Canada that was politically agreed on last October.  There also is a range of such agreements with ASEAN economies such as Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand, which all are economies that are growing rapidly.  If we are going to expand the European Union's manufacturing base, we must have access, as well as more, cheaper and easier access to global markets.  The objectives of the trade agreements are both to reduce tariffs - with some economies, such as that of the United States, they are very low - and to address the technical barriers to trade.  I refer to different regulations third countries have to give a preference to their own domestic manufacturers, which impose higher costs on European Union manufacturers.  For example, if one takes the car sector, in a trade agreement we will try to get the third country to recognise the international United Nations standard for car parts, which lowers the cost of our products entering into the global market.  Picking up on another point in respect of the benefits of free trade agreements, in energy and raw materials, for example, cheaper and easier access to raw materials helps our manufacturing base and the objective of the free trade agreements would be to reduce or eliminate export taxes on raw materials, which would include energy, for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800014#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Monk"},{"type":"speech","time":1390922400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>This has been an interesting discussion on the area of competitiveness and energy.

There is discussion on some mainstream media channels about this issue, the question being, why should we do something while large polluters such as China will not engage?  While I suppose this is an ongoing debate, I believe the Chairman asked a question regarding the lead Department.  While I imagine the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are involved, if one takes an important area for Ireland, namely, agriculture, I presume the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and its Minister would be involved in any negotiations in this regard.  While improving competition is one thing, there are quite specific differences between agriculture in the European Union and agriculture in the United States.  This definitely is the case when one compares Irish agriculture with that practised in the United States.  In general, agriculture in the United States is conducted on a larger scale and entails more factory farming, as well as the use of hormones and the use in dairying of bovine somatotropin, which increases yield and has some health effects and cows.  Approximately 20% of farms there use this substance.  In addition, there is the debate on genetically-modified food and so on.  Quite specific issues exist regarding the quality and standards the European Union imposes on its people, as compared with those which obtain in the United States and this is an important area for consideration.  Obviously, the Minister is cognisant of this in the context of any trade negotiations between the European Union and the United States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014012800014#O00800","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390922400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Absolutely, and while I will invite Mr. Monks to cover this issue in a bit more detail, I mentioned earlier the need for having both offensive and defensive strategies and we are acutely aware of some of the issues raised by the Deputy.

It is not that trade agreements deliver a one-way competitive advantage for one party because there is a mix.  The access the Canadians will have to the EU agriculture and food market will be phased over time.  Right now, the European Union is negotiating what the phasing will be and the extent to which it will be delivered to the Canadians.  It is a two-way street where both parties benefit.

On foot of what Deputy Lawlor said, a common message emerging from the European players at all our meetings concerns engagement by national parliaments.  The main reason we went to Brussels was to elaborate on our new role as a committee in the Lisbon process.  We do a lot of EU scrutiny here and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is a major help in equipping us for that.  However, we want to go further with the process.  It is very clear from all our meetings that, in order to influence emerging EU legislation, we need to have early engagement in the legislative process at national parliament level by way of impact assessments.  When EU legislation comes from the Commission to us, and probably the Department in some cases, it is too late.  The Department was told it would be involved at an earlier stage, but it can be a bit too late for ourselves.  We want to have much earlier intervention.  It is up to us to watch out for the white and green papers and to be part of the process.<\/p><p>  The second comment is that during a meeting with the director general of the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry, Daniel Crespo, he referred to the need to update the state aid rules to reflect the need to finance SMEs.  Since then, a communication was adopted.  I refer to the guidelines on state aid to promote risk capital investments.  Does that change the state of play here?  Have the delegates any thoughts on that?  Will it benefit our SMEs?  Mr. Rochford might answer those questions.  Mr. Paul Cullen might respond on the state of play regarding the European semester and our reform plan.

Part of the process is a review of the various guidelines in place.  One of the more important ones for Ireland concerns regional aid.  The Commission is also examining areas such as de minimis aid, broadband, research and development, and the risk capital guidelines.  In the past six months, new regulations have been adopted for regional aid, <i>de minimis<\/i> aid, broadband and cinema communication.  Other regulations are outstanding and they will have to be adopted in the next six months.  I believe the deadline is July 2014.  Of note for Ireland is the group block exemption regulation.  It effectively covers categories of aid that are block exempted by the Commission.  Covered in this regard are regional aid, risk capital and environmental aid.  This means that one develops schemes under the block exemption.  The likes of Enterprise Ireland and the IDA would develop schemes with regard to regional aid and they would not have to notify every support to every company to the Commission.  Once there is notification under the scheme, it is fine and it is considered that it is complying with state aid guidelines, thus allowing those concerned to work away.<\/p><p>  At present, regional aid is one of the more important categories for us.  Reference was made to SMEs.  Regional aid tends to be investment aid for companies to go to disadvantaged areas of Ireland.  The main issue is that we are currently compiling the regional aid map for Ireland.  It will be presented to the Cabinet in the next two weeks and there will be a Government memorandum after that.

They are some of the building blocks of the semester.  As the Secretary General said, we will be in receipt of country-specific recommendations this fourth semester.  This is the ultimate in cross-cutting in that the semester and package of country-specific recommendations address research and development, energy, credit support for SMEs and employment issues.  It is in the employment sphere that the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation facilitates and seeks to integrate the contributions of the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills.  As the Minister said back in December, we can expect country-specific recommendations this year on labour market participation, active labour market policies, poverty and social inclusion and education and skills.  Those are four of the six areas at which country-specific recommendations are usually targeted under the employment and social pillar.  The other two areas are wages policy issues and what is called labour market segmentation, which is the problem in southern Europe where young people are excluded from jobs because of the over-reliance on fixed-term contracts.  Broadly speaking, the Commission acknowledges in the range of reports that we do not have problems in either of those two spheres.  To some extent, we know what its targets will be because it is also telling us that there will not be such a great shift from what we understood to be our concerns in the context of the memorandum of understanding and the relations with the troika.  So it will be looking to some extent at the continuation of projects such as Pathways to Work, SOLAS and the roll-out of the education and training boards.  So there will not be that many surprises.<\/p><p>  That is also one of the issues that member states have been critically conveying to the Commission.  The manner in which the Commission has sought to allay the concerns of the member states is through what has been a steady evolution of the semester.  In this fourth semester, the ground is being laid through a series of three bilaterals.  The first took place in November, the second will take place within a fortnight and the third will take place in April at the stage when the member states are presenting their national reform programmes.  In our case, the kind of framework of reference for the CSRs will be the history of how we emerged from the memorandum of understanding and what we are putting into the national reform programme.  That is building on the Action Plan for Jobs, Pathways to Work and the strategic plan for SOLAS and how it will give messages to the education and training boards that will emerge from the Department of Education and Skills in March.  <\/p><p>  It is interesting that while we were not part of the semester other than being observers, we were in a management role in the context of the Presidency.  We were credited with smoothing out some of the recurrent problems within that and reinforcing the role of what are called the preparatory committees that service the respective councils.

Producing compost is effectively a means of using what we once considered as waste and did not see much advantage or profit in it.  It is environmentally-friendly and economically beneficial to us, especially when engaged in on a large scale.  It is a key ingredient in organic farming, which is a growing sector in Irish agriculture, and it is also important as a natural cover in landfill sites and as a source of energy through the generation of biogas.<\/p><p>  Composting on a large scale can help protect and develop ecosystems by control erosion, assisting in the reclamation of land and in the construction wetlands.  On a smaller scale, many people engage in simple composting in their domestic gardens and this is also good for the environment.  Nowadays it is a very common feature of housekeeping to see compost bins in people's back gardens.<\/p><p>  Much of the same can be said in regard to biofertilisers.  These can be used as a natural fertiliser and pesticide and help reduce the use of artificial fertilisers and pesticides.  They contain living micro-organisms which help to restore the natural nutrient cycle in the soil and greatly enrich its fertility.<\/p><p>  I hope the witnesses will assist us in our consideration of this very important topic.

It gives our association the opportunity to highlight the need for certain legislative changes we believe would improve the way sewage sludge is managed and protect our food safety record.  This is an important topic as it affects our environmental sustainability as well as our food production and marketing.  I am accompanied today by a colleague, Mr. Maurice Cremin, who will also be a witness.<\/p><p>  In 2008, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland published a report on the management of organic materials going onto land in Ireland.  On pages 18 to 21 of this report, it examined the management of sewage sludge in Ireland.  The report outlined that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland had concerns about food safety.  These were based on a number of exemptions provided for in the Waste Management (Use of Sewage Sludge in Agriculture) Regulations.  The authority, in its report, made a number of recommendations and got commitments from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to make legislative changes to help protect food safety in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Five years later in 2013, Cr&eacute; decided to examine the current state of play on the management of sewage sludge.  We compared the findings and recommendations of the 2008 Food Safety Authority of Ireland report to the current situation.  Cr&eacute; determined the facts by sending a survey to local authorities using the European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007.  The results of this survey were collated and formed the content of the Cr&eacute;<i><\/i>report, The Management of Sewage Sludge in Ireland, which I have provided to this committee.<\/p><p>  The main results from the 2013 Cr&eacute; report were: the vast majority of local authorities were making it a requirement in contracts that sludge is managed according to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's Code of Good Practice for the Use of Biosolids in Agriculture; five local authorities did not make the code of good practice a requirement - a further local authority said it made the code of good practice a requirement but was using the exemption in the legislation to spread the sludge untreated onto land; and approximately 23,793 wet tonnes of untreated sludge were land spread in Ireland in 2012.  In addition to this figure, one local authority reported that it land-spread untreated sludge but the figure was provided in cubic metres and could not be included in the tonnage figure.<\/p><p>  Cr&eacute; has reviewed the management of sewage sludge in Ireland and is making the following recommendations: the Code of Good Practice for the Use of Biosolids in Agriculture should be put on a legislative footing; and a number of exemptions and provisions in the current regulations should be removed as they conflict with the code of good practice and give rise to food safety concerns.<\/p><p>  Specific examples of the legislative changes required include: the regulations should be changed to prevent untreated sludge being land spread or injected into the soil; the regulations should be changed to prevent untreated residual sludge from septic tanks being land spread; the regulations should be changed to remove the exemption for wastewater treatment plants with fewer than 5,000 population equivalents; and in regard to section 51 of the Waste Management Act, lime stabilisation plants are exempt from a waste permit-licence if sludge goes onto agriculture land but this should be changed.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that Cr&eacute;'s recommendations are aligned with those in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland report of 2008, which I mentioned earlier.  In its report, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland outlined the commitment the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government gave to it that a limited revision of the regulations would be provided.  This revision has not been carried out to date.<\/p><p>  In its end of year report, Bord Bia valued Ireland's food and drinks exports at &euro;10 billion, which is a major achievement and is worth protecting.  The application of raw sewage sledge on land has the potential to put this in jeopardy.  Cr&eacute; believes the situation needs to be addressed now by the legislative changes outlined.  This issue could easily become the next horse meat scandal.<\/p><p>  I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for providing us with the opportunity to present an update on the management of sewage sludge in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012800004#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Percy Foster","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390920000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Foster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012800005#E00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1390920000,"counter":220,"content":"<p>It was Deputy Corcoran Kennedy and not me who suggested we should invite this group in.

Has Irish Water engaged with Cr&eacute; on this issue to date?  I would like to ask about the tertiary treatment plants, the largest of which are taking in tankerloads of sewage in increasing numbers.  A plant in my local area is causing all sorts of problems because the size of the tankers means that certain access routes have to be used.  It appears that the new septic tank regime will lead to an increase in arrangements of this kind.  The dry material that comes out at the end of the tertiary treatment process goes into landfill.  Is that material of value for spreading on the land, or does it have to be sent to landfill?  My final question relates to industries that discharge large amounts of waste into treatment plants.  It could be problematic if certain substances used by industry as part of the manufacturing process - heavy metals, etc. - were found in the material that is discharged by such industries.

The best place for that liquid is to stay in the septic tank, with the solids being removed periodically.  The technology that is available on the Continent is quite advanced.  Householders there can avail of the services of a contractor who sets up on site for approximately an hour, desludges the septic tank and takes away a small volume of material.  The volume in question might be half a tonne if the septic tank is regularly maintained.  It would be a question of taking away half a tonne of material, as opposed to the four tonnes of material that would be taken away if the entire thing were removed.

When the representatives of Cr&eacute; talk about composting, they are talking about anaerobic digestion and the aerobic version of the process.  Have they encountered problems in getting the facilities in question?  I will explain why I am asking that question.  Local authorities give planning permission for such facilities every now and then.  I am thinking particularly of my local authority in Roscommon.  The only factor that seems to be considered when planning permission is given for the development of a facility in a certain area is whether it is likely to be the subject of relatively little objection.  In other words, the facility is located where the residents are least likely to cause trouble about it.  The proximity principle always seems to be completely ignored when decisions are being made on where to locate these facilities.  As a result, the amount of energy required to bring the stuff to the facility is greater than the amount of energy created by the facility at the end of the day.  It seems - in my county, anyway - that planning decisions are made on the basis of how the wool can be pulled over people's eyes.<\/p><p>  I will spell out what the consequence of that attitude is when something like anaerobic digestion is mentioned.  This phenomenal and brilliant technology should be more widely used.  We should look at what is being done in Germany.  When the development of an anaerobic digestion facility is proposed, however, people use words like \"incinerator\" and assign to it every negative connotation they can think of.  We seem to be in a heap in this regard at a time when facilities of this nature are needed.  At present, meat processing plants have to transport material like belly grass to one of these facilities, whereas ideally they would be able to do this work on-site.  One of the main worries that people in many of these areas have from a planning perspective is that there might be a smell in the local area.  I suggest that those living near some of the plants to which I refer might have to endure less of a smell if there was one of these facilities on-site.  It seems that the proximity principle is being ignored, sadly, so that people can be codded.  As a consequence, we have very few facilities of this kind.  Are there many facilities out there?  Is there much hope of getting new ones?  What way should we go with this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012800005#E01100","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390920000,"counter":229,"content":"<p>There are composting and anaerobic digestion facilities across the country.

Where there is no guarantee that all the sewage sludge can be treated and processed to ensure no pathogens are introduced into the environment, I am concerned about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012800006#F01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Percy Foster"},{"type":"speech","time":1390920600,"counter":241,"content":"<p>As I am not a member of this committee, I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity.  The witnesses are right in pointing out that, as a consistent feed, sewage sludge is a very useful fertiliser for land spreading and the Chairman outlined its numerous uses.  I ask the witnesses to comment on residues such as lead, arsenic, etc., that can be found in sludge.  How frequently is that happening?  I believe Deputy Catherine Murphy asked about chemical discharges from plants into sewage treatment facilities.  How can those residues be eradicated?<\/p><p>  Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan asked about the processing capacity.  There are the issues of aerobic and anaerobic digestion.  What direction should we take in that regard?  I believe we should choose the anaerobic digestion route because there are problems not only with planning but also with environmental issues regarding aerobic digestion and composting, such as smell and the location of such facilities.  Particularly with anaerobic digestion, is there not also an issue with the consistency of the feed going in?  When dealing consistently with sewage sludge, then a consistent product is coming thereby making it very easy to have a consistent product going out.  If it is operating effectively there should be very little down side or smell.  However, when septic tank sludge, which is a completely different product, is going into it, it can cause problems.  The same applies when other feed is going in, including belly grass.  I ask the witnesses to comment.  These are genuine concerns over the industry as it operates at present.<\/p><p>  Cr&eacute; has proposed having no land spreading.  Are the witnesses satisfied there is sufficient capacity to treat the existing sludge coming from municipal facilities throughout the country if the land spreading facility disappeared overnight?  I have heard estimates of 1 million tonnes of untreated sludge coming from septic tanks every two to three years once the desludging regime comes in.  That represents a significant additional loading on the system.  Do the local authority facilities have the capacity to cater for the additional loading if land-spreading was not permitted?<\/p><p>  I ask Mr. Foster to explain further his comments about the FSAI.  Is there not a difference between land-spreading and trailing shoe?  There are also different risks associated depending on the production type and whether it is arable, vegetables or livestock on the farm.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that issue.<\/p><p>  The witnesses made a valid point about the removal of solids rather than liquid because the liquid is the feed that can be used to keep a septic tank running effectively.  How do we deal the elephant in the room?  Local authorities do not have the capacity to deal with the sludge they have at present never mind septic tank sludge coming in on top of it.  That is a very inconsistent feed even if they are only taking the solids because of the nature of it.  Considerably more than just sludge is coming into that, including stones and other debris.  How can they deal with that inconsistent feed?  Local authority systems are not able to cater for that type of feed coming in at the moment unless it is highly diluted.  Does taking the solid off it not cause more problems than it solves?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012800006#F01100","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390921200,"counter":242,"content":"<p>The question on the removal of heavy metals is a good one and I will revert to the committee with information.  I have not studied the area in great depth.  The next question was on capacity with regard to composting versus anaerobic digestion.  Each has its own merits.  Anaerobic digestion has the potential to produce a biogas from which electricity can be produced.  Having a consistent product like sewerage sludge is good because one must be careful not to shock an anaerobic digestion system with dramatic changes of feedstock.  A way around this is to slowly introduce a new feedstock over time.  I am not against land spreading across the board; what I am against is land spreading of untreated sewage sludge.  The code of good practice states there should be no land spreading of untreated sludge.  If sludge is treated to a certain standard by composting, lime stabilisation or drying, it can be land-spread.<\/p><p>  The committee may not be aware of the study done through the EPA's STRIVE research programme on septic stank sludge and capacity.  I believe the report will be concluded shortly and I look forward to seeing its conclusions and recommendations on how we can deal with septic tank sludge.  After mobile dewatering one does not necessarily have to bring the dewatered sludge to a local authority wastewater treatment plant.  It can be brought directly to a composting plant, a lime stabilisation plant, a drying plant or an anaerobic digestive facility.  It can be diverted away from local authority wastewater treatment plants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012800007#G00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Percy Foster"},{"type":"speech","time":1390921200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Mr. Foster's proposal on land spreading septic tank sludge pre-empts what will come out of the EPA report.

We are speaking about up to 1 million tonnes of sludge per annum, which is a serious amount of material.<\/p><p>  Mr. Foster is correct that one cannot introduce a new feedstock into an anaerobic digestion system.  Does that not mean that a new feedstock ends up being stored on site until the bugs have built up a tolerance to it so the system is not shocked?  If one was dealing with consistent sewage sludge from the local municipal wastewater treatment facility and then decided to take in belly grass, the belly grass would be on site composting on its own while it was slowly introduced to the feedstock before it could be processed.  Does this cause problems with neighbours for these facilities and reputational problems with regard to smells?<\/p><p>  I am surprised Mr. Foster has come before the committee advocating land spreading of treated sludge when he has not dealt with the issue of heavy metals, which is the downside.  It is a fundamental question.  How does one deal with the heavy metal issue?

Before dealing with the specifics of genealogy as it concerns the GRO, I will set out some of the history and structure of civil registration in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Let us consider the nature and purpose of a system of civil registration.  The UN defines a system of civil registration as &quot;the continuous, permanent, compulsory and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events&quot; primarily for the purpose of providing legal documents and to be a source of vital statistics.  The system in Ireland complies with this definition.<\/p><p>  The GRO and the system of civil registration as we know it was first established in 1845 following the passing of the Marriages (Ireland) Act 1844.  That Act provided for the registration of civil and religious marriages, excluding Catholic marriages.  The system was extended to encompass Catholic marriages, births and deaths in 1864.  At the time, the national system of civil registration was administered by the Registrar General through the GRO, while local registration services were administered through the poor law unions.  Local registration functions were taken on by the local authorities when they were established in the 1890s.  Registration of adoptions was provided for under the Adoption Act 1952.  Responsibility for local registration services was transferred from the local authorities to the health boards in 1972 and to the HSE on its establishment in 2004.  Registration of stillbirths was introduced in 1994.  Other significant developments included the requirement to give three months notice of intention to marry, which was introduced in 1995, and the assignment of a surname at birth, which was introduced in 1997.  The GRO moved from the then Department of Health and Children to the then Department of Social and Family Affairs in 2008.  Civil partnership registration was introduced in 2011.<\/p><p>  In 2000, a radical programme of reform was embarked upon jointly by the then Department of Health and Children and the then Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  This entailed the design and development of new business processes and procedures and enhanced management structures; the introduction of modern technology; the capture and storage in electronic format of all historical paper-based records from 1845; and the reform of the legislation to underpin the delivery of a modern service and to facilitate the wider e-Government agenda.<\/p><p>  The Civil Registration Act 2004 underpins the reform programme.  It provides for enhanced management structures and for more efficient processes and procedures; a more active citizenship by requiring births, stillbirths and deaths to be registered by parents and relatives; streamlined preliminaries for marriage; a system of marriage licences and the giving of notice of intention to marry in person; the establishment of a register of solemnisers for religious and civil solemnisers of marriage; a greater choice of venue for civil marriages; electronic registration; and the capture of additional data in the registers, for example, PPS numbers.<\/p><p>  The civil registration computer system, CRCS, was developed to replace the manual registers.  The system was first deployed in 2003 and was rolled out nationwide by the end of 2004.  Since then, the registration of all vital events has been electronic.  Key features of the system include the creation of a national vital events database that facilitates online retrieval of registration records; the capture and storage in electronic format of historic records, thereby facilitating the production of certificates of all vital events; the online registration of life events; the use of electronic pads to capture informants' signatures; and interagency data transfers.<\/p><p>  I will now move on to matters more relevant to genealogy services, the purpose of today's discussion.  Critical to the modernisation programme was the separate, but related project to capture all of the manual records dating back to 1845 in electronic format.  Each register entry has a corresponding index entry to facilitate efficient searching.  This was the system that was in place from the commencement of registration in 1845.  The project entailed the conversion of 27 million index records from manual and older electronic database sources to a single, comprehensive database of index records; the microfilming and scanning of 5 million register pages and creation of a quality electronic image of each page; the quality assurance and validation of electronic records; and the matching of index data to the appropriate register page.  This was an incredibly complex and painstaking enterprise, given the volume of records involved and the fact that there was no precedent project to call on for guidance.  All of these records are now available in electronic format.  The manual registers are stored in a purpose-built, atmosphere-controlled facility in Roscommon town.<\/p><p>  The last phase of the project was the conversion of these data to the live CRCS environment.  To date, all births from 1864 have been converted to the live environment.  Marriages from 1903 to date and deaths from 1924 to date have also been converted.  These conversions are adequate to meet most business needs.  Obviously, there are significant gaps in the availability of clean data in the live environment going back to 1845 in respect of marriages and 1864 in respect of deaths.  It is estimated that it will take approximately three years to complete the conversion of the remaining marriage records.  Unfortunately, we have not been in a position to progress work on the conversion of the deaths records, but we hope to do so shortly.  We hope to be in a position to work on the conversion of the deaths data concurrently with marriages.<\/p><p>  The civil registration modernisation programme has been recognised internationally as an example of excellence in public sector reform.  In 2003, the programme was awarded winner in the category &quot;Business Applications of IT Services&quot; and overall &quot;Bronze Medal for Business Innovation&quot; at <i>The Wall Street Journal<\/i> European Innovation Awards in London.  In 2004, a Computerworld honours commemorative medallion was awarded at the Computerworld honours ceremony in San Francisco for the originality of concept, breadth of vision and significance of its benefit to society.  The programme exhibited at the European Institute of Public Administration, EIPA, e-government conference in Italy in 2003 as an example of best practice under the theme &quot;A better life for European Citizens&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012800008#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Feely","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390922400,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Feely for his opening statement and now invite Mr. Dalton to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012800009#J00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390922400,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to the Central Statistics Office to attend today's meeting.  The Central Statistics Office operates under the terms of the Statistics Act 1993, which sets out the mandate of the office and the standards by which it must conduct its business.  Independent, objective, trusted and high quality official statistics are the cornerstone of any developed democratic society.  A key element in ensuring that trust and quality is the legal guarantee in regard to the confidentiality of statistical returns made to the CSO.<\/p><p>  The CSO compiles a broad range of official statistics across a range of subject areas, including social, environmental, economic and business statistics.  Some of its key outputs include the measures of GDP and GNP, debt and deficit, employment and unemployment, income and poverty, inflation, travel and tourism, demography and the related indicators of migration and population.  Official statistics have always played an important role in informing decision-making across a whole host of users of statistics, including those in the policy domain.  This is still very much the case and is a considerable focus of the CSO.  However, increasingly official statistics are being used for monitoring purposes by a range of institutions, national and international, and by the markets in terms of monitoring the ongoing performance of our economy and society as a whole.  This shift has been evident to all of us over the past number of years.  The CSO has been very conscious of the focus placed on its data by the IMF, ECB, EU Commission and, of course, the markets.  As a result of this shift in focus many of the activities of the CSO are now the subject of formal monitoring and compliance visits by the EU Commission to validate our statistical processes and adherence to the prescribed statistical rules and methodologies.<br \/><b><\/b>As set out in the Statistics Act 1993, the functions of the CSO shall be the collection, compilation, extraction and dissemination for statistical purposes of information relating to economic, social and general activities and conditions in the State.  The CSO's mandate does not include any formal role in respect of genealogical activities.  However, we are acutely aware of the strong genealogical interest in historic records and the success of the online release of the Census 1901 and 1911 records.  Section 35 of the Statistics Act provides for a 100 year rule in regard to the release of subsequent census of population records.  This is the only exception specified in the Act.<\/p><p>  Due to the nature of its work, the CSO is entrusted by its respondents, business and person-based, with a large quantity of extremely sensitive information.  The legal guarantee provided by the CSO to these respondents is central to its ability to collect information and is central to many of the official statistics compiled by CSO on a regular basis.  The information give to the CSO is subject to the conditions on use of information and statistical confidentiality as set out in sections 32 and 33 of the Statistics Act 1993.  It may only be used for statistical purposes and must be kept confidential.  <\/p><p>  In this context, maintaining compliance levels or response rates is a continuous challenge for all national statistical institutes.  A key element in the achievement of this objective is the integrity and reputation of the CSO in terms of protecting information provided to it for statistical compilation purposes.  The CSO recognises the work of the committee and the plan to capture the full value of our genealogical heritage within existing legislation.  We are happy to explore ways that this office can contribute to furthering the goals of the committee, while maintaining the integrity of the confidentiality commitment given to respondents and the confidentiality of the information provided by the CSO.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012800009#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton"},{"type":"speech","time":1390922400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dalton for his opening statement.

When will the first set of historic records be made available online?  Those who are interested in this information will be aware of the changes applicable from 2000 onwards and the ongoing project in Roscommon.  I welcome that the indexes will be available on the <i>irishgenealogy.ie<\/i> website in the near future.  I acknowledge these are already available through other sources such as the Church of Latter Day Saints and <i>roots.ie<\/i>.  However, access to the records is key and has been described as most genealogists as the game-changer.<\/p><p>  The committee met prior to Christmas with four other groups on this issue.  During that meeting it was stated that four sets of records are critical, namely, church, civil registration, land and census records.  I note that one of the witnesses stated that birth records from 1864 onwards have been fully digitised, that while work on the marriage records is somewhat behind it is ongoing and that work on the death records is at this stage indeterminate.  Is the plan to not release any of the records until all are available or will what is available be released in an incremental way?  Also, by what Department will this be done?  <\/p><p>  We are all aware of what is happening in this regard in Northern Ireland.  It would be nice if, as will happen in the North in the near future, our records were available online soon.  We would like to see genealogy developed on an all-Ireland basis.  Release of the records here is important from that point of view.  It is essential to reinforce people's dissatisfaction in regard to the location of the research rooms, although I note this accommodation was selected by the Office of Public Works.  The history in regard to this has been very difficult in that the Lombard Street office was very unsatisfactory.

The criticisms have been well aired at this committee and by users of the facility, and they have been passed to the Office of Public Works, which has control of the matter.  We have raised it with that body on more than one occasion, so I can really say no more on that.<\/p><p>  I agree with everything that Deputy Murphy said about genealogy services being brought into line with those of Northern Ireland, on an all-island basis, as soon as possible.  I am not answering questions in order but I will address all of them.  If I leave out anything, it can be picked up later.  All of the index records are available in data format and all of the register pages are available as digital images of microfilms.  There are no gaps.  All of the birth records from 1864 have been converted and are available on a live computer system.  Deaths from 1864 to 1923 are not on the system, along with marriages from 1845 to 1902.  It will take approximately three years to clean that data and ensure it is in a fit state for conversion.<\/p><p>  It would be possible and desirable for the data to be put into an on-line and searchable facility without it being complete.  It is largely complete in any case, and the births, which are the most important records, are all there.  When that will happen is dependent on a number of issues.  The law needs to change and I am told by the Department of Social Protection that the Minister intends to include appropriate provisions in the civil registration (amendment) Bill which is intended to be published this year.  That will be subject to the parliamentary schedule, and members are probably just as able to comment on that as I would be.  After that it is a technical exercise to extract data and pass it on to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for inclusion in the <i>irishgenealogy.ie<\/i> website.<\/p><p>  Typically, these projects depend on the type of searchability that is included, and there are a number of technical questions to be addressed.

The first point to note that the census projects for 1901 and 1911 were undertaken under legislation where there was no provision laid in respect of confidentiality of the data recorded.  In 1926 the Statistics Act 1926 applied, and the legal framework at the time was that there would never be provision given to the census records at the time.  That is the distinction between the 1911 and 1926 records, and it is why work on the 1911 project was able to commence well in advance of the 100-year rule; it did not apply to the 1911 census.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the release of data in the US.  Data is released after 72 years there, and in Canada the period is 92 years.  In Australia the period is 99 years and the UK and New Zealand have 100 years as the period.  There is a range of countries in Europe where census records are destroyed after a prescribed number of years, including Sweden, Luxembourg, Belgium, Portugal, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, France and Russia.  I could go on.  There are varying practices in that range of countries.<\/p><p>  We can only operate within the law, and as it stands that is the Statistics Act 1993, which states that census records can only be put into the public domain after 100 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012800010#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390923600,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na daoine at&aacute; anseo inniu.  I wish to declare an interest just like I did at the beginning of the hearings.  I am chairman of the Irish Family History Foundation.<\/p><p>  I shall avail of this opportunity to compliment the GRO and the CSO on their impressive work to date.  This is an occasion for us to exchange views.  Mr. Dalton has clearly stated his position on the 1926 census, a subject that I shall return to in a moment.<\/p><p>  I am delighted that the GRO and CSO are present to develop a plan to capture the full value of our genealogical heritage.  Many players have attended the hearings and we have heard all of the players, some of them are statutory in nature, some are voluntary-community in nature and so on.  There is great enthusiasm for the subject and it would inspire a person to bring about a plan that would correlate and lead to co-operation between all of the players.  I have got the feeling from the hearings to date - and I do not mean from today's meeting - that this has been a public relations exercise for us all.  I include the Irish History Family Foundation in my conclusion.  We have all set out our individual stalls.  On the other hand, I understand the statutory obligations that belong to the two sets of witnesses attending today.  I like to think that efforts to develop a plan will go beyond this stage because a great deal can be gained from co-operation.   <\/p><p>  There is a lot of information available because we have the exceptionally important civil and church records and we also have a lot of private collections of material.  People would contribute to the scheme if there was a single focus that did not undermine the distinctive autonomy of each group involved.  One cannot make progress by undermining their  autonomy.  Without doubt the genealogical heritage is a national treasure because it tells us who we are as a people and from whence we came.  We all know that Irish people are very proud.  Even in the most challenging  of times and with a small population we virtually think that we own the world.  We do own a bit of the world if we accept that there is an estimated 75 million people of Irish extraction located around the world.  I have an immense feeling of pride wherever I travel.  I had the same feeling last week when I was in London and it has happened when I travelled to China, Japan, South Korea and even North Korea.  Wherever I have travelled I have found some understanding of the great Irish story.  <\/p><p>  There is great goodwill towards Ireland.  One of the main reasons for it is that we never colonised any other country.  Therefore, we are always viewed as having contributed to a developing world.  I say that by way of explaining why our genealogical heritage is such an important subject for us.  It is not just statistics.  It is so much more than statistics.  <\/p><p>  Let us think in terms of employment.  Many of the players who have attended here employ a large number of people, not just the State bodies but non-State bodies as well.  I can say that applies to the Irish Family History Foundation as it employs quite a large number of people.  I do not know if anyone has seen the publication of the top 100 global genealogical websites but I am particularly proud that the Irish Family History Foundation's website <i>rootsireland.ie <\/i>has been ranked top of an Irish group of three genealogical websites and in the past week has moved up another five points.  The only reason that I made the point is to emphasise that it is good news when any player makes a contribution.<\/p><p>  My next question will be difficult to answer for an organisation with a statutory background but let us consider the title of these hearings.  Does either organisation see a way for us all to co-operate instead of setting out our own stalls yet protect the autonomy of each organisation and tap into the great potential that exists?  <\/p><p>  Only three months ago I introduced a Bill in the Seanad on the issue of the 1926 census.  Interestingly, every Senator who spoke in the Seanad, both Government and Opposition, were in favour but the Government had to say it was not in a position to accept the Bill.   <\/p><p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy has outlined the importance of the 1926 census.  It is the first census to be conducted since the foundation of the State which makes it very important.  All of us, not just people in Ireland but all over the world, who have an interest are focused on the 1926 census.  I have received messages from all over the world and groups of visitors who are involved in genealogy have met me here in order to focus on the 1926 census. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012800011#L00200","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390924200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Mother.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012800012#M00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1390924200,"counter":272,"content":"<p>-----I would have thought that it is the general view of people of a certain age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012800012#M00300","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390924200,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I thank the committee members for their interesting observations and questions.  The CSO already plays a strong role in trying to support genealogy.  We are the custodians of census records from 1951 to date.  The years 1951 to 1981 are being held by the CSO, and the years up to 2006, in two different locations.  The National Archives of Ireland stores the material from 1926 to 1951.  In a sense, we are already making a big contribution in that we are trying to contain and protect the integrity of those records so that future genealogists can access the wealth of information.  It is very important and we are already working with the Department and the National Archives of Ireland to see how we can move things forward for the release of the 1926 data in 2026.<\/p><p>  Genealogy is a broad domain and there are significant number of resources and records that are of importance.  The census is just one and I appreciate that is a very important one.  The CSO must think about the fact that not a night goes by without the responsibility of the job weighs on this.  We are very conscious that if we make a mistake on something like inflation, GDP or GNP or if we undertake any action that may undermine our ability to compile accurate and high quality statistics in those domains, it will not just have an impact on the CSO as they are of systemic importance.  Let us think about what has happened in the past five or six years and how official statistics are now front and centre in monitoring how the economy is progressing and moving.  The CSO is no different and our focus, role and responsibility is on the production of high-quality official statistics.  Confidentiality is a cornerstone of it but it exists for a reason.  It is there to maintain response rates and for us to maintain quality.<\/p><p>  There is a direct link between confidentiality, response rates and quality.  The retrospective nature of any potential change is what is of particular concern.  The integrity of the confidentiality guarantee we provide will come under serious scrutiny, and not just for the census.  We get detailed information from businesses, enterprises and householders.  It will be very difficult for us, if the laws change a second time, to state the case for the ongoing protection of the data.  Despite the fact there are statutory obligations on businesses to provide data to us, we find ourselves in the courts trying to ensure the legal requirement on enterprises is upheld by the law in terms of the provision of data.  Response rates are very important because it is directly related to quality.<\/p><p>  One of the points of concern to us is trying to protect this heritage for the future.  We are all agreed on that point.  One of our concerns is the storage of census forms.  The National Archives of Ireland is the expert on storage and has examined how we are currently storing some of census data.  While the storage facilities are sufficient for the short term, trying to protect this information in the longer term for future generations and future genealogists means there must be some examination of how the records can be maintained into the future.  We are not experts in data warehousing or protecting records of this nature.  We do our best but, like everyone, we have limited resources.  It is a significant issue that the committee could examine and see how we could be protected in the future.  It is an important issue.<\/p><p>  We are not trying to be resistant for the sake of it but our function is the provision of official statistics and we have a responsibility to take all of the precautions to ensure that we can ensure the publication and dissemination of official statistics to the highest standards.  Our activities are now monitored far more closely than previously.  We have study visits from the European Commission and the European Central Bank where they can come in and audit our books.  Legislation going through the European Parliament will broaden that formal scrutiny beyond the key economic indicators and into the social domain.  The world in which we operate has changed.<\/p><p>  At the time of the Statistics Act 1993 and the debate about the 100-year rule, there was no such thing as access to data online.  It was not perceived in the same way as it is now.  Making information online means it is available to anybody in the world.  It is a very different world to the one in which the 1993 decision was taken.  I hope the committee can understand where we are coming from.  We want to help to the greatest extent and work with the committee but we must do so within the existing legislation.  If the Legislature decides to change the law on the access to census records, that is within its remit.  If we are asked for our position, it is as we have outlined because of our core functions and responsibilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012800012#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton"},{"type":"speech","time":1390924200,"counter":274,"content":"<p>The 1911 census was released earlier , which I accept was within a different legal framework at that point.<\/p> <p>It did not have any significant impact on the future collection of census data.  People did not refuse to fill in the forms because the 1911 census records were released early.  The roof did not fall in.  I have used census records for a variety of reasons, as has everyone else here.  The records are a very valuable source of information and are incredibly useful in the context of planning for the future, in terms of the likely demand for schools, houses and so forth.  We understand that the data is statistical in nature but of all of the records that are kept, the census records are unique.  I did not realise that many European countries have destroyed old census records.<\/p><p> It would be great if we could go back to 1922 and get our hands on those who put a match to the public records office, with so little regard for the importance of that resource.  That was a terrible act of vandalism for which we are still paying a price.  The data from the 1901 and 1911 census became even more important because we did not have the 19th century records and I can understand why there was a demand for that data to be released early.  Indeed, that is part of the reason why things like the records of the General Register Office, GRO, have a higher premium here than they have in other countries which still have their 19th century records.  Usually the data on births, marriages and deaths would not be one's first port of call; one would go to the census records.  That is all the more reason for making such data immediately available.  People expect to find records in one location but we have quite a fragmented range of records but together they are a wonderful resource.  We must consider ways to provide an easier route to that data for researchers.  <\/p><p> I completely accept that the witnesses have their point of view on this but I have a completely different view of it.  I believe the 100 year rule is wrong - it is too long.  I do not believe that a second change compromises the other elements of the records that are kept.  Records on inflation, GDP, GNP and so forth are released almost as soon as they become available.  We do not hold onto that data and then release it after 100 years.  In that sense, one is not comparing like with like.  The 100 year limit is as arbitrary as 90 years.  As a compromise, redacting the names of people who are still alive is one possibility.  I must disagree with the witnesses on that point because the historical value of these records, in addition to their genealogical value, given the era that we are in, sets them apart.  People are quite able to differentiate between the different sets of records that are collected for different functions.  We will see if there is a willingness to change the law.  It is referred to in the programme for Government and is something that I would welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012800012#M00500","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390924800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I have just three brief questions.  The first relates to the storage of all of these records, which is a big issue.  How big do we make the warehouses to store these records?  Is there an argument for digitising all of the records that are in storage?  They can be released at whatever stage the law dictates but should they be digitised so that there is no risk of them being damaged or lost in the future?  Digitising them would also reduce the enormous costs associated with their storage.  This problem will just get bigger and bigger.  I presume that in Mr. Feely's facility, now that everything is electronic, this issue does not arise in the context of new records.  However, with the CSO, the issue will continue to arise into the future.<\/p><p>  On a parochial note, I wish to compliment Mr. Feely and his team for their work on the translation project on the Racecourse Road in Roscommon, which led the way in the context of where we are today.  We now have the GRO headquarters and Property Registration Authority, PRA, offices in Roscommon town.  However, those who come to the town with the intention of accessing records are very confused about where exactly they should go.  I urge the witnesses to speak to the OPW about erecting signage for all of the public buildings which have a public desk so that those travelling by train or car into the town can find the buildings easily.  <\/p><p>  I wish to touch on an issue which is not directly related to today's agenda but which is related to records.  The local authorities all over the country have vast volumes of records, often held in basements in buildings, many of which are deteriorating.  There does not seem to be any legal requirement on the local authorities to preserve those records or to store them appropriately.  Perhaps that is an issue the committee could examine further.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Feely and myself have had conversations about amendments to the Civil Registration Act and I have tabled parliamentary questions on same.  Those amendments have been long-promised but have not yet been delivered.  Is Mr. Feely confident that the legislation will be ready this year and laid before the Oireachtas?

Copies of the Revised Estimates and briefing documents on the two Votes by subhead have been provided for Deputies.  As they are aware, the annual Estimates are being reconfigured along programme lines to ensure greater transparency in Government expenditure.  The Department of Health is working towards the development of programme budgeting and changing the structure of the health Votes to reflect this.  This will take some time, however, as the financial systems in the HSE will have to be adapted to allow for it in the context of the financial reform programme under way.  In the interim, the appendices to the Revised Estimates for the health Votes have been constructed along programme lines, based on the HSE's national service plan, to provide a high level programme breakdown of health expenditure.  In addition, two programme subheads, concerning the PCRS and long-term residential care, are now included in the Revised Estimates Volume.  The third programme for which information had been extracted - the children and families directorate - is now funded through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs following the establishment of the Child and Family Agency.<\/p><p>  Before dealing with the Estimates in detail, I will make a few general observations about the overall budgetary situation facing the health sector.  As members of the committee are fully aware, the Government is committed to tackling Ireland's very serious deficit problem.  Current health expenditure in 2014 will account for 27% of gross current expenditure, meaning that fiscal realignment must, of necessity, affect health sector spending.  The challenges facing the health system at a time of growing demand mean that the Government must press ahead with major health sector reform.  I will continue to deliver the Government's programme of health reform throughout the course of the year and I am pleased that the HSE has set the advancement and implementation of the reforms at the centre of its planning for 2014, including but not limited to phased implementation of a money follows the patient funding system in hospitals; the transition to hospital groups, including appointment of new group CEOs, where required; the establishment of new community areas with associated governance and organisational arrangements; and the establishment of a patient safety agency.<\/p><p>  In 2013 we published Healthy Ireland, the strategy for improving the health of Irish people and enhancing their health and well-being. It is an ambitious strategy that aims to embed health and well-being across public policy and services.  It sets out a whole-of-government and cross-sectoral approach to address the demands placed on health and social care services from the growing incidence of chronic illnesses, together with the challenges presented by an ageing population.  Chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and chronic respiratory disease and diabetes are the leading causes of mortality and account for over three quarters of all deaths in Ireland.  The risk factors associated with the increased prevalence of chronic diseases such as obesity, a lack of exercise, unhealthy eating patterns, the over-consumption of alcohol and the use of tobacco products are generally preventable.  Healthy Ireland is critical in enabling the required shift in emphasis towards health prevention, promotion and improvement in the years ahead.  The 2013 edition of Health at a Glance,<i><\/i>published by the OECD, shows that Ireland continues to make substantial headway in improving health outcomes.  Mortality due to cancer fell by 21%, ischaemic heart disease by 59% and cerebrovascular disease by 54% between 1990 and 2012 and in all three cases the rates of improvement in Ireland were above the OECD average.  Life expectancy in Ireland has increased by a full four years since 2000 to reach 80.6 today, again above the OECD average.<\/p><p>  I will now address the Estimates for health in some detail.  The Revised Estimates for 2014 for the health group of Votes provides for gross expenditure of &euro;13.164 billion for health services.  Of this amount, some &euro;12.774 billion is for current funding and &euro;390 million for capital funding.  A further &euro;544 million, that is, &euro;537 million in current funding and &euro;7 million in capital funding, for child and family services is funded through the newly established Child and Family Agency under the aegis of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Significant cost extraction is required, with &euro;619 million in savings to be achieved in 2014.  The primary aim in targeting savings is to cut the cost of services, not the services.  This will be achieved largely through efficiencies and reconfiguration under the Croke Park and Haddington Road agreements, new charging arrangements for private patients in public hospitals and curtailing the growing cost of pharmaceuticals.  The required savings have been incorporated in the HSE's service plan published on 18 December 2013 and are recognised in the Revised Estimates.<\/p><p>  The funding for Vote 38 provides for gross expenditure of &euro;206 million.  This comprises &euro;16 million in capital funding and &euro;190 million for current expenditure.  This represents a 6% reduction on the provisional outturn for 2013 and a 17% reduction on the 2013 budget.<i><\/i>All health agencies funded by my Department were required to achieve further efficiency savings this year, with the Department's administrative budget being reduced in line with the moratorium on recruitment and the provision for legal costs and statutory inquiries also reduced.  The provision for the National Treatment Purchase Fund has also been significantly reduced, pending consideration of its future role in the context of the structural reforms set out in Future Health.<br \/><i><\/i>In addition to the funding reduction, some &euro;22 million was transferred from the Department's Vote to the HSE in the context of the drugs initiative.  The funding will be used to support approximately 220 drugs task force projects, in respect of which the HSE has acted as channel of funding for a number of years.  The HSE also provides funding for a significant number of the same drugs projects from its own Vote.  The HSE-funded projects are subject to the standard governance and monitoring procedures of the HSE.  Separate reporting, accountability and monitoring arrangements had applied to projects funded by the Department through the channel of funding arrangement.  Allocations to drugs task forces will continue to be based on drugs task force recommendations and focus on tackling the drugs problem.  The transfer of operational responsibility for the funding administration of drugs task force projects to the HSE is a key priority in the HSE primary care operational plan for 2014.  Some &euro;7.4 million remains in the Department of Health's Vote for 2014, &euro;6.6 million of which is in respect of expenditure on 100 community drugs projects.  The remainder funds the activities of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol, the Family Support Network and the citywide drugs crisis campaign which represents the community sector.<\/p><p>  The gross provision for the HSE is &euro;12.958 billion, comprising an Exchequer contribution of &euro;11.553 billion, plus appropriations-in-aid of &euro;1.405 billion.  This is made up of &euro;12.584 billion in current expenditure and &euro;374 million for capital expenditure.<\/p><p>  As Members will be aware from discussions on the national service plan, some &euro;537 million has been transferred from the Vote of the HSE to the Vote of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs following the establishment of the Child and Family Agency which is now responsible for funding child and family services.  In addition to this adjustment, the Revised Estimate for the HSE includes additional health funding of &euro;47 million over and above the budget provision and &euro;22 million for the drugs programme.  The HSE is required to achieve savings worth &euro;619 million next year to remain within the 2014 health expenditure ceiling.<\/p><p>  As with last year, the significant cost of drugs and medicines has been targeted for savings measures.  In recent years a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced, primarily through pricing and supply agreements with the pharmaceutical industry, and we have made good progress in addressing the cost base.  With the passing of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, we now have a robust system of reference pricing and generic substitution and have already reduced the cost of atorvastatins by some 70%.  More reductions will follow in 2014 and some &euro;50 million in targeted savings is built into the budget for the PCRS.  This saves patients&rsquo; and taxpayers' money, allowing us to focus on maintaining front-line services.<\/p><p>  The 2014 Estimates provide for the full-year effect of the reductions to professional fees paid to general practitioners and pharmacists under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  Overall, these reductions will save in the region of &euro;70 million in a full year, half of which was achieved in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12014012800003#D00200","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390929900,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and apologise for being late.

I was listening to Deputy Buttimer's fine contribution on the cystic fibrosis unit in Cork and the difficulties experienced in trying to come to an arrangement with those who were involved in the fund-raising.  I hope there is a speedy resolution.  I took a copy of the Minister's reply and I will have time to peruse it later.<\/p><p>  We are where we are again in the context of the discussion of Estimates for 2014 for the Department and the HSE.  My party is tabling a Private Members' motion in that regard this evening and there was to be a debate in the D&aacute;il tomorrow for six hours as well.  Unfortunately, the latter has been withdrawn, and we will raise that in the appropriate forum, the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>  The Minister outlined in some detail the Estimates for the Department and the HSE.  The key issue is the legislative proposals that will transfer the Vote from the HSE to the Department of Health.  In his reply, the Minister might give an indication of roughly when he expects that to happen.<\/p><p>  An issue that sticks out, not because of the figures but because of the issues that have been raised in recent times with regard to the ambulance service, is that of the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.  The primary function of the council, which was established in 2000, is to develop appropriate standards in pre-hospital emergency care.  It is in this context that the council is pursuing the development of professional and performance standards for ambulance services and ambulance service personnel in addition to the accreditation of institutions providing training for pre-hospital care providers.  There are major concerns among broader society about response times, the stress and pressure under which the front-line ambulance service is working, the delays caused by the lack of resources and personnel, and whether centralisation is working effectively and efficiently and providing the service that people expect.  At times of crisis, particularly in emergencies such as myocardial infarctions, persons not breathing, or massive trauma such as car accidents, there is concern that we do not have an ambulance service that is fit for purpose in dealing with the pressures and demands that are placed on it from time to time.  We recently had cases in which there were up to eight ambulances waiting outside an emergency department because they could not discharge patients.  I note that ambulance service funding has been cut by 3%.  I am not making an issue out of that.  Would the Minister enlighten me as to what exactly they are doing, given that HIQA is also in place to audit the national ambulance service call-out times to see whether they are in compliance with the guidelines of 7 minutes and 59 seconds and 18 minutes and 59 seconds for first response and second response, respectively?  I seek clarity on that issue.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act 2009 and said the cuts to GPs and pharmacists would save &euro;70 million in a full year.  We have had a dispute on this.  I have stated on a number of occasions that I believe that GP services are in crisis.  They are working under extraordinary financial pressure.  One may argue that there is no sympathy for doctors, but I have sympathy for patients who may not be able to access doctors.  That is an area that we must look at before a crisis lands on our lap.  With the Minister's knowledge as a GP and his former advocacy role - I am not being sarcastic and I am sure he is proud of this - there is a need for us to assess the impact of the FEMPI cuts on GP services, coupled with the fact that in May or June of this year the Minister will roll out free GP services for children aged five and under.  I wonder has any audit been done.  Has there been any assessment of the impact this may have on front-line GP services?<\/p><p>  Rightly, strong emphasis is put on primary care.  The backbone of primary care provision in this country is the GP service, both in-hours and out-of-hours.  On a continuous basis, we meet GPs who say they simply cannot sustain the level of cuts and cannot provide the services that they would like and feel obliged to provide because of the cutbacks and other issues being foisted on them.  I do not expect any government to make announcements that would tie its hands in negotiations or discussions with an organisation or grouping, but at this stage we must take a strategic look at the role of GPs, how they are playing it, and whether or not they are being severely affected, not only for their sake but for the patients.<\/p><p>  We now find that the roll-out of free GP care for those aged five and under will be on a voluntary basis.  I am not quite sure how that will work.  We could end up with a situation in which those who opt in would become pediatric-type GP services while others would go for other age cohorts, and that would not be healthy in view of the fact that most associate the scheme with their family doctor.  They go to their family GP as a family.  A little thought should be put into this.  I genuinely have concerns about the impact that this could have.  There is a strong relationship between the family and their GP.  It is not something that people take lightly.  If their GP for whatever reason cannot fulfil his or her commitment to those aged five and under, then the parent must up sticks and head off to another GP.  I wonder whether this has been thought out.  Is it possible that there could be large tracts in which there will be provision of GP services for those aged five and under, and those wanting access to a GP will not go to the GP services that provide for those aged five and under because they are crowded with children and will move elsewhere?  It could create upheaval given the strong bond between GPs and families throughout this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12014012800004#E00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390930500,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I call Deputy McLellan who is substituting for Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12014012800005#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1390930500,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials and again convey apologies on behalf of Deputy O Caol&aacute;in who cannot be here today.  I am substituting for him.<\/p><p>  The post-budget period in the month of January has seen intensive engagements in the media and in this committee on the overall health budget and on the HSE 2014 service plan.  Recently, we had the Minister and HSE officials here for their quarterly meeting with the committee, which immediately followed a dedicated meeting on the service plan.  It must be said that there is an air of unreality about all of this.  Basic figures have changed for unaccountable reasons and other figures have been plucked from the air and no one can explain from where they came.<\/p><p>  The bottom line is that the provision for our health services in budget 2014 was inadequate.  The cuts being imposed across our public health system this year are unsustainable.  The original memorandum to the Cabinet from Mr. O'Brien on the HSE service plan stated that it will not be possible in 2014 to fully meet all of the growing demands placed on the health services.  We know this was changed to read that it will be very challenging in 2014 to meet all the growing demands.  This sanitised version was released by the Minister and published in the service plan 2014.<\/p><p>  We have repeatedly argued that the health funding plans of the Fine Gael-Labour coalition have zero credibility.  A total of &euro;660 million of spending cuts to health were signalled in the budget.  That became &euro;619 million in the service plan.  We are told the earlier version of the service plan stated that the actual budgetary challenges facing the health service in 2014 amount to &euro;1 billion.  Mr. O'Brien confirmed on radio on 22 December that he was given no source for the proposed budget figure of &euro;113 million probity cuts to medical cards, since changed to &euro;23 million in the current service plan, and that it did not come from the Department of Health or the HSE.  We have repeatedly asked where that figure of &euro;113 came from and we still have not got a satisfactory answer.  Wherever it came from, the Minister was able to reduce it to &euro;23 million in the service plan, apparently without the blink of an eye.<\/p><p>  What we do know is that medical card holders and medical card applicants are facing an ever-more restrictive regime.  The standard reply from the Minister that more people than ever have medical cards on income grounds does not address the issues here.  We all know from our constituencies that very young children and adults have had medical card renewals or initial applications refused in circumstances where previously they would have been granted.<\/p><p>  By the end of 2014, almost &euro;4 billion will have been taken out of our public health services since 2008.  The health services have already been cut to the bone, and the knife is still being wielded.

A further 2,600 whole-time equivalents are to go in 2014, in addition to the 12,500 that have gone since 2007.  The entire management of health funding and health services by this Minister and this Government is called into question by their handling of primary care.  The service plan refers to the vision for primary care services whereby the health of the population is managed, as far as possible, within a primary care setting but then it cuts &euro;294 million out of primary care in subhead C.1 in these Revised Estimates.  That is reflected in a 10% cut in primary care services.<\/p><p>  While the provision of GP cards for children aged five and under is welcome, it is in the context of overall primary care cuts.  The Government is to take an additional &euro;43 million out of the pockets of medical card holders in increased prescription charges compared to &euro;50 million saved through generic substitution and reference pricing.  The Minister and the director general must account for the failure of the HSE to move more quickly in setting reference prices for medicines under the long overdue legislation we passed last year.  As recently reported, a range of drugs placed on the interchangeable lists by the Irish Medicines Board have not had reference prices set by the HSE.  The entire process has been far too slow and the HSE and the individual patients are not seeing anything like the savings on medicines we should be seeing.<\/p><p>  I am very concerned about the cuts to long-term residential care in subhead C.2.  The nursing homes support scheme, the so-called fair deal, is being cut again and this has very serious implications for the lives of vulnerable older people and severe knock-on effects for our entire health system.  Already, there is a huge waiting list for places under the so-called fair deal scheme and these cuts spell misery for thousands of older people, many of whom are occupying hospital beds because they can no longer be cared for in their homes and cannot get access to nursing home places.<\/p><p>  The first State-wide audit of dementia care carried out by Dr. Suzanne Timmons, consultant geriatrician at UCC Mercy Hospital, has just been published.

I agree with what the previous speakers said.  This is the third year in a row where we have an unsustainable budget and cuts of &euro;619 million plus 2,500 staff, which will create further difficulties, particularly for patients but also for staff and for the provision of necessary services for patients.<\/p><p>  I want to raise again the question of whether there is any information from the HSE on agency costs.  I have raised this issue at many meetings.  I have got assurances from the HSE and from the Minister that we would get these figures but I have not got them yet.  The committee secretariat has been trying to get the figure  without success.  I ask for an assurance from the Minister that these figures will be made available within the next day or two.  They are very important figures because we know that the cost of agency non-consultant hospital doctors is huge.  I have been told that it can cost anything up to three times the cost of a directly employed non-consultant hospital doctor.  We would also like to know the cost of agency nursing.  The overall figure of approximately &euro;60 million for non-consultant hospital doctors was given at one meeting.  As Senator Burke said, on the basis of the number of staff involved, that appears to be a huge figure.  Hopefully, the Minister might have those figures this afternoon and, if he does not, I ask that they be given to us.<\/p><p>  When will we have sight of the McGrath report?  What steps are being taken to ensure that non-consultant hospital doctors are available to staff hospitals throughout the country.  There is a serious problem in this respect.  <\/p><p>  On the query raised by Deputy Kelleher on the employment and appointment of consultant medical staff, at a recent meeting we were told that there was no real problem here.  I would like some clarification on that.  There now appears to be a real problem if media reports are anything to go by.  At a very recent meeting, we were told that there was no real problem at all.  <\/p><p>  I ask the Minister to reconsider the position regarding medical cards.  The Minister said in his statement: &quot;Suffice it to say that my Department will be working closely with the HSE and with the assistance and support of the Departments of An Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that savings from these measures are maximised.&quot;  This relates to medical probity.  What that means is that very ill people who have held cards for years are being refused cards - their cards are being withdrawn.  I hear of this happening on a daily basis and other colleagues, both on the Government and Opposition benches, have told me they find the same is happening.  <\/p><p>  As I came into this meeting earlier, I got notification that a card that had been withdrawn from a young chap, who is wheelchair-bound, with recurrent epileptic seizures, hyrdocephalus, cerebral palsy, spastic diplegia, who has a shunt <i>in situ<\/i> and suffers from perennial rhinitis.  An appeal was submitted against a refusal to issue him a medical card and the decision to refuse it to that young person with those various medical conditions was upheld.  That is what medical card probity means in practice.  I meet people with such cases on an regular basis, as do other colleagues. I ask the Minister to reconsider this issue and to pull back from the current position.  It is a very serious situation for families and for individuals with serious medical conditions who are losing their medical cards.<\/p><p>  The Minister has targets set for addressing delays in outpatient appointments but there are serious problems regarding the length of time people have to wait for outpatient appointments, particularly for orthopaedic appointments.  This is a problem throughout the country.  It is a problem in my area, both on the Waterford side and on the Limerick-Cork side.  It is a national issue.  Delays in orthopaedic appointments are a particular problem and I ask the Minister to clarify the position on this. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12014012800006#G00200","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1390931100,"counter":310,"content":"<p>Deputy Neville also indicated he wanted to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12014012800006#G00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1390931100,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I raised with HSE at the last meeting the funding of the mental health services.

That is what we are all here to do.<\/p><p>  Deputy Sandra McLellan asked where the figure of &euro;113 million came from.  I do not mean to be rude but I told the Deputy's colleague where it came from two weeks ago at this committee.  It came from a report done from by PricewaterhouseCoopers on behalf of the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, and the HSE project team.  The report referred to a figure between &euro;65 million and &euro;210 million being available.  The sum of &euro;113 million is in the middle of that range.  I am the first to acknowledge that the study carried the caveat that a more detailed examination of the PCRS database was required.  That has since been carried out and that is why I asked for the validation process to be undertaken, involving the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Arising from that, the figure changed to &euro;23 million.  That still means many medical cards will need to be reviewed, but normal probity demands that this happen.  When the Secretary General at the Department of Health and the director general of the HSE are before the PAC, they will get the run-through on why probity has not been done if there are medical cards that people should not have retained.  The focus is an exercise in accuracy.  While cardholders are legally obliged to inform the HSE of a change in circumstances that may affect their eligibility for a medical card, the Comptroller and Auditor General recently highlighted that in 2012, of 1.8 million cards in existence, just 22 were returned voluntarily.

Deputy McLellan talked about an embargo on job cuts.  People are leaving the service.  In some instances they are not being replaced, in others they are.  Last year we employed approximately 700 nurses.  The moratorium is being done in a flexible way.  We must change the skills mix.  I have said it many times.  We have consultants doing work that GPs could do, GPs doing work nurses could do, nurses doing work that health care assistants could do, and all of them doing work that allied health care professionals such as physiotherapists and occupational therapists could do.  Just because a few nurses leave it does not mean they need to be replaced.  It might be more appropriate to replace them with a health care assistant or physiotherapist.  We also want to change the way we do general practice.  Before the colorectal cancer screening service came in, only consultants did endoscopies; now they are done by advanced nurse practitioners, who are perfectly able to do them.  It is about thinking outside the box and doing things differently, because if we continue to do things as we always have, we will end up with the same problem.<\/p><p>  Deputy Seamus Healy raised the issue of agency costs.  This is the third time and I fully acknowledge that we said we will get back to him.  We will do it, but there is a difficulty.  Globally the cost of an agency nurse is slightly less than a full-time employed nurse because of superannuation, sick leave, maternity leave and everything else.  A non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, is more expensive, but not three times or twice as expensive.  They are approximately 20% to 40% more expensive because I have to get the correct grade.  A first, second or third year senior hospital doctor, SHO, or a first, second or third year or a specialist registrar are all paid different salary scales.  We are trying to get that out of the system, which is proving a little difficult.<\/p><p>  We have covered the specific medical card issue Deputy Seamus Healy raised.  More generally, at the end of 2013 there were 2,018,162 medical cards and GP cards.  That is more than ever before.  In 2013 we expected it to go to 2.1 million.  In 2014 we expect it to go to 2,277,845.  We are extending the number of people who can avail of free GP care year on year and we will keep doing that until all our population is covered.  That is a commitment from this Government to achieve that by 2016.  I am not saying it will be easy.  There will be tough negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO.  In fact, it will be consultation, because under competition law the IMO is prohibited from negotiating.  That does not mean we cannot consult them and talk to them about the shape of a new contract that would meet the needs of their patients and support them in the excellent work they do.  I have made the point that it is an income-based scheme, not a disease-based scheme.<\/p><p>  Later tonight I will make a statement on outpatient waiting times.  It will represent real improvement in the figures people have been bandying about over the last number of weeks.  Orthopaedics is a problem area.  We did not reach our target but we will put a plan in place to ensure we do this year.  I promised we would try to ensure nobody waited longer than 12 months for an outpatient's appointment having seen his or her GP.  Only in March were we able to validate the full extent of the numbers, 386,000, more than 100,000 of whom waited longer than a year.  Despite the 8% growth in population and 10% reduction in staffing levels and a 20% reduction in the budget, members will be very happy to see the improvement that has been made.  I do not have the figures here now.  They are being finally validated to ensure we are not misleading anyone.  In certain areas we did not reach the target and I am very happy to highlight them because I am not in the business of spin or perception but reality, because reality is what our citizens have to endure, so spin does nothing for them.<\/p><p>  Deputy Neville mentioned the &euro;35 million.  He is right, many of the posts were not filled in 2012, but virtually all of them were filled in 2013.  Many of the posts from 2013 were put in place and we are continuing to fill them.  Some of them are highly specialised and it is difficult to pull people into the service.  Many people who retired were in the mental health sector because, like the garda&iacute;, they can retire at 55 because of the stressful nature of the job.  Recruitment of a further 477 posts funded from the 2013 allocation has been slow to date but, as indicated in the 2014 plan, the posts and other developments relating to 2013 allocation of &euro;35 million will continue and is targeted to be completed in the next quarter in 2014.  At the end of November 2013 the recruitment process was complete or in the final stages for 395, or 95%, of the 414 posts approved in 2012.<\/p><p>  We hope to catch up this year on the slow start.  We surpassed what we sought to achieve for 2013 of itself by moving through many of the people.  As part of the overall 2014 budget of &euro;765.8 million, an additional &euro;20 million has been ring-fenced this year for 250 to 280 posts in mental health services in line with the programme for Government commitment.  The other &euro;15 million will be made available next year.  It is not as fast as Deputy Neville would like.  He has always been concerned about this area.  It is not as fast as I would like, but the recruitment has been problematic in certain areas.  Many of the posts are not nursing posts but ancillary posts such as psychologists, counsellors, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12014012800008#J01100","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1390932300,"counter":334,"content":"<p>We will return to Vote 38: grants, subheads B1, B2, B3; other services, subheads C, D, E1, E2, E3, E4, F1, F2, F3, F4, G, H, I.
