This included an 8% increase in the value of whitefish quotas leading to a new total of &euro;152 million for the quota.  Ireland&rsquo;s quota for prawns also increased by 15% in 2018, which is the biggest single increase in over a decade and shows the very healthy state of this stock.<\/p>  <p>  The rebuilding of many other stocks was also demonstrated by a 34% increase in our whitefish quotas off the North-West coast and a 64% increase in the Irish Sea.  These are both areas that were severely depleted just five years ago.  This shows that the many years of intensive, industry led conservation measures are paying off.  The work done to rebuild these stocks has led to significant increases for quotas for our fleets.<\/p>  <p>  While we did have cuts in stocks including haddock and whiting in the\u00a0Celtic Sea, these cuts followed the scientific advice to ensure a sustainable fishery.\u00a0\u00a0In terms of the herring stock in the Celtic Sea, the reduction applied was\u00a0in\u00a0accordance\u00a0with\u00a0 the provisions of the industry led management plan for the stock.

Last December&rsquo;s Council was another important step towards the objective of having all stocks fished at maximum sustainable yield levels by 2020.

Our efforts will be focused in these areas foreseeable future, but we will also be working hard to maintain our position and deepen market penetration in traditional markets such as those in the EU, including the UK, and the US.  <\/p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025 I led a very successful Trade Mission to the Gulf Region in February 2017, visiting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  This was followed by an extensive Trade Mission to the US and Mexico in June.  These  markets offer significant potential for Irish exporters.  The US is the largest food and beverage market in the world and has a population of 324 million people.  Furthermore, some 35 million Americans claim Irish ancestry.  Mexico has a population of 127 million, making it the eleventh-largest country in the world in population terms and the fifteenth-largest economy in the world, with projections that it will move into the top five by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  I also led a trade mission, to Japan and South Korea in November 2017, accompanied by 40 representatives of the Irish food sector, as well as by experts from my Department, the Chief Executive of Bord Bia and senior representatives from Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc. <\/p>  <p>  This was a very opportune time to bring a delegation of Ireland&rsquo;s food leaders to this part of the world, given that the EU has concluded a Free Trade Agreement with South Korea as well as agreeing an Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan.  These are markets of high potential for beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat exports, and so it is important that we raise the profile of Irish agri-food enterprises that already have access to these markets, and make progress in negotiating access for others. <\/p>  <p>  I have also returned from Turkey recently, where live exports were the primary focus. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently making arrangements with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland for a trade mission to the US and Canada at the end of the February.

This exercise identified opportunities in both new and more mature markets, and provides valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers.<\/p>  <p>  I have already overseen an intensification of my Department's efforts to develop a globally focussed agri-food sector, and since October 2016 I have provided more than &euro;14 million in additional funding to assist Bord Bia in its marketing and promotion efforts.  In addition, my Department will participate fully in the Government's plan to double Ireland's global footprint by 2025. <\/p>  <p>  Against the background of this work the value of Irish agri food exports has continued to grow and in 2017 exceeded &euro;13 billion.

This strategy is informed by considerable scientific evidence of a link between badgers and cattle in the context of the spread of bovine TB.  In line with this policy, where badgers are identified as a likely source in County Kerry a survey is carried out and badgers are captured and removed under licence issued by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  This is currently on-going in the South Kerry area.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has recently commenced the vaccination of badgers against tuberculosis as an integral part of the bovine TB eradication programme.

This body is one of the six North South Implementation Bodies created under the Agreement.  The Loughs Agency, as part of the FCILC, has been given responsibility for fisheries related matters in respect of both Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough and the legislation envisages that the Agency will enter into a management agreement with the relevant authorities in both jurisdictions with a view to assuming responsibility for aquaculture licensing within the loughs.  Discussions in respect of this management agreement are ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the placement of aquaculture products on the market, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) controls all live bivalve mollusc production areas, including Lough Foyle, to ensure compliance by Ireland with its official control obligations, and compliance by operators with their food safety obligations.<\/p>  <p>  The classification of mollusc production areas is an explicit obligation of the EU food safety regulatory framework. Regulation 854\/2004 requires Competent Authorities to classify and subsequently monitor mollusc production areas, while Regulation EC No 853\/2004 requires Food Business Operators (FBOs) to only harvest molluscs for human consumption from areas which have been classified by the Competent Authority.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of Lough Foyle, the SFPA has classified two production areas for the production of both molluscs and oysters.  In approximate terms, taken together, the two classified areas include all waters to the Donegal Shore of a line from Magilligan Head to Inishowen Head.<\/p>  <p>  The official sampling of molluscs for both microbiological and biotoxin monitoring purposes is performed by the Loughs Agency under a Memorandum of Understanding with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Under EU Food Safety Regulations Food Business Operators may only harvest Live Bivalve Molluscs for human consumption from production areas which have been classified by the Competent Authority, and which have not been closed for health reasons by the Competent Authority.<\/p>  <p>  Operators are required to ensure that any consignments of molluscs harvested are accompanied by a document indicating various pieces of information, referred to as the &lsquo;Gatherers Document&rsquo; or more correctly the Shellfish Registration Document.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to fish health, the Marine Institute is focused on the assessment of biotoxins in shellfish product and harmful algal bloom monitoring in Lough Foyle, as part of the National Biotoxin Monitoring Program.  Only when the Lough is in open status can shellfish product be harvested and placed on the market for human consumption.\u00a0 In the event of an area in the Lough showing a positive result for biotoxin, or harmful algal bloom, the Loughs Agency is responsible for coordinating between Ireland and the United Kingdom over this shared waterbody to ensure that product would not be allowed to be harvested from the Lough when a biotoxin regulatory limit is exceeded.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As will be seen, therefore, the management of aquaculture and associated foreshore licensing functions in Lough Foyle gives rise to legal and jurisdictional complexities.

The NIFF is representative of sea-fishing boats of less than 12m overall length in the fishing fleet.\u00a0 The focus on the NIFF work programme is on fisheries management in the coastal waters within 6 nautical miles.\u00a0 The NIFF is taking the lead in setting priorities for the inshore sector including ongoing work in developing a dedicated strategy.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  To date, the twelve NIFF meetings have led to very constructive two-way conversations on issues of mutual concern, industry priorities, emerging policies &amp;amp; initiatives. \u00a0NIFF members are now included on a number of fisheries consultative structures including the Quota Management Advisory Committee, the Industry Science Fisheries Partnership, the SFPA Consultative Committee, the EMFF Operational Programme Monitoring Committee and BIM\/Bord Bia Market Advisory Group.\u00a0 This gives the inshore sector a role in making recommendations on a range of fisheries policy matters including on allocation of Ireland&rsquo;s quotas, on data collection and scientific research.\u00a0 Perhaps most important of these is that the NIFF now has an input into how funding is utilised including through the Inshore Fisheries Conservation Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Sub-Committee&rsquo;s 2014 report refers to managing the lobster and shrimp fisheries.\u00a0 Changes came into effect in 2014 regarding the management of these fisheries, following on from an extensive consultation process.\u00a0 In more recent times lobster in particular has been a feature of the agenda of the meetings which I have had with the NIFF and I look forward to a discussion with NIFF on the review of the effectiveness of the current conservation measures in 2018.\u00a0 The current V-notching conservation measures have been extended through 2018 to facilitate these discussions.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the mackerel quota, there has been a change to the way this is allocated.\u00a0 For 2017 and future years, the 87% to 13% share out of the quota between the Refrigerated Sea Water (RSW) pelagic fleet and polyvalent segment of the fleet will remain unchanged.\u00a0 Where Ireland&rsquo;s quota exceeds 90,000 tonnes, the quota shall be shared on a 80% to 20% basis between the pelagic and polyvalent fleet.\u00a0 A minimum of 2% of the mackerel quota, or 1,000 tonnes, whichever is the greater will be deducted annually for demersal swaps before any share out between segments is undertaken.<\/p>  <p>  There is an open mackerel fishery for vessels under 18 metres in length.\u00a0 An amount of 2.5% of the overall polyvalent Mackerel Quota has been set aside for this fishery and a monthly catch limit is used.\u00a0 This catch limit is recommended\u00a0each month by the Whitefish Quota Management Advisory Committee which consists of fishing industry representatives. \u00a0For 2017, under 18m Boats had a catch limit of 5 tonnes per month.\u00a0 In the last number of years much of this quota has remained under-utilised.<\/p>  <p>  Quotas for other species which can be targeted by the inshore fishing sector have set-a-side allocations for smaller sea-fishing boats.\u00a0 Key inshore stocks are not limited by quota arrangements, for instance lobster and crab species which are the mainstay for many small boats.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The sub-committee made a recommendation with regard to &ldquo;minor fishing infractions&rdquo;.\u00a0 In November 2014, my Department published a public consultation document in the form of a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA)\u00a0 of a proposal for a Bill to amend the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 to provide for, inter alia, a system of fixed penalty notices\u00a0(&ldquo;on the spot&rdquo; fines) for minor fisheries offences. \u00a0This provided the possibility of creating a subset of minor offences which are legally suitable to be dealt with by way of fixed penalty notices.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In summary, the process suggested in the RIA involved giving a person who was alleged to have committed a minor offence an option to pay a fixed payment which would mean that a prosecution would not be taken in the Courts.\u00a0\u00a0If the payment was not received within 28 days, the prosecution would be initiated in the courts and on conviction it was expected that a higher fine would be applied.<\/p>  <p>  A number of industry submissions received under the RIA on the implementation of fixed penalty notices raised concerns that these would be used in place of verbal or written warnings.\u00a0 Other comments raised concerns regarding potential inequalities in the application of the system between different Sea Fisheries Protection Authority Port Officers and Naval Service personnel.\u00a0 There were also comments regarding the constitutionality of applying sanctions in the absence of a Court decision and others seeking a fully administrative system.\u00a0 In light of the comments submitted in respect of the above proposal on a fixed penalty system,\u00a0it was decided not to proceed with the introduction of such a system.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to fishing infrastructure, it is important to say that my Department owns, maintains and directly manages six Fishery Harbour Centres at Killybegs, Ros an Mh&iacute;l , An Daingean, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth, under Statute.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, I have allocated &euro;27.9m to the Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Capital Programme.  &euro;2m of this is allocated to the Local Authority element of the programme targeting piers, harbours and slipways under their ownership across the 17 Coastal Local Authorities.\u00a0 On 31 January 2018 Local Authorities were invited to submit prioritised lists of projects for consideration.  Ultimately, the infrastructure supported will be of great benefit to many rural coastal and island communities.<\/p>  <p>  The remainder of the 2018 Capital programme, &euro;25.9m will be invested in the ongoing development, maintenance and upgrade of the Fishery Harbour Centres.  This investment will build on the &euro;92m invested in the Fishery Harbour Centres since 2010 and the &euro;25m invested in the Local Authority infrastructure over the same period.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2016 I commissioned an Independent Review of Aquaculture Licensing.  The Report of the Review Group was submitted to me at the end of May 2017.  The Review Group carried out a detailed examination of the existing aquaculture licensing process, undertook comprehensive stakeholder consultation and looked at comparative national and international consent systems to determine best practice for managing a complex licensing process in a transparent, environmentally appropriate and legally robust manner. <\/p>  <p>  The Group&rsquo;s Report is published and available to view on my Department&rsquo;s website.  A total of 30 separate recommendations are contained in the Report.<\/p>  <p>  In that regard I can confirm that my Department is committed to and actively working towards the achievement of 300 licence determinations for 2018 with a further 300 targeted for 2019.  This will meet a core objective of the Aquaculture Licensing Review Group.  The achievement of 600 determinations over the next two years will effectively eliminate the backlog as an issue.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme is the vehicle for financial supports to the seafood sector up to 2021.\u00a0 The Programme delivers a wide range of supports for aquaculture, fisheries and seafood processing through a suite of 15 Individual schemes which are administered by BIM. <\/p>  <p>  In summary, there are a number of recommendations not relevant to the remit of my Department and I have endeavoured to give the Deputy an update on relevant matters, including policy developments, which have occurred since the report was published.  I would like to assure the Deputy that this Government is fully commitment to the seafood sector and the coastal communities who are dependent on fisheries and aquaculture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300059#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bioenergy Strategy","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300059#WRB02600"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[7158\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300059#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many farmers in the west of the country are now experiencing problems with slurry disposal due to bad weather; and his plans to carry out a study into the feasibility of establishing bio-digestive systems to avoid disposal crises due to worsening climate conditions and to ensure safe disposal of slurry.","asker":"1345","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>We are aware of reports of difficulties regarding slurry disposal linked to bad weather.

This work is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region, and\u00a0 our efforts will be focused on developing new opportunities in these markets,\u00a0as well consolidating our position and deepening our penetration of well established markets in the European Union, including the UK, \u00a0and the United States.<\/p>  <p>  In the meat sector, the focus is on obtaining access to new markets or improving the terms of access to others.  In 2015 we gained access to the US market for Irish beef.  In the same year we also got access to the Canadian market for Irish beef and to the Omani market for Irish beef and sheepmeat. <\/p>  <p>  In 2016 we gained access to the Maldives for beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultrymeat.  We also gained access to the Iranian market for sheepmeat and we regained access to the Israeli market for beef. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, the market in Egypt was re-opened to exports of beef from Ireland and we got access to the Chilean market for Irish pork. <\/p>  <p>  On the dairy front, Ireland exported in the region of &euro;4bn in dairy products to nearly\u00a0130 countries in 2016.  Against the backdrop of EU-agreed trade deals such as those completed with Canada and Japan,\u00a0my Department continues to prioritise efforts to gain access to new\u00a03rd country markets and, equally importantly, to deepen existing markets for Irish dairy products.  In many instances such efforts are on foot of trade missions at Ministerial level.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  CSO data for the year to end November 2017 showed that Irish dairy exports were approaching 20% ahead of the same period in 2016, on foot of factors such as\u00a0improving global prices (which was particularly evident in sectors such as butter), but also as a result of increases in volumes exported across a range of product categories.  This demonstrates that our\u00a0efforts are contributing positively to Irish dairy sector exports.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that\u00a0the value of exports to emerging markets in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central\/South America stood at almost &euro;2.2 billion in 2016.  The value of trade to these markets increased by 52% in the period 2012 to 2016.  Exports to these markets now account for 19% of total food and drink exports, compared to 16% in 2012.  This growth in the share of exports occurred during a period when total food and drink exports jumped by more than 23%.<\/p>  <p>  Growth to emerging markets has been led by Asia, with trade growing by more than 150% to &euro;1.2bn.  This in turn has been\u00a0led by China, which recorded a more than three-fold increase (total &euro;880m v &euro;283m in 2012).\u00a0 Exports to other Asian markets grew by 73% in the same period, to &euro;318 million.<\/p>  <p>  Trade to Africa has held steady\u00a0around the &euro;500m mark during this period, notwithstanding the challenges faced by those West African countries whose economies are so reliant on a strong international oil price.  Encouragingly, exports to North African countries grew by just under 50% in 5 years, helping to counterbalance this impact.<\/p>  <p>  Exports to the Middle East grew by 21%, to &euro;370 million. <\/p>  <p>  The role of trade missions also\u00a0cannot be underestimated in gaining further market penetration for Irish Agri food products to new and existing markets. <\/p>  <p>  I led a series of very successful Trade Missions in 2017, during which\u00a0destinations included the Gulf States, the US and Mexico.  I also led an extensive trade mission to Japan and South Korea.

Wexford.<\/p>  <p>  The agri-food sector is of critical importance to the Irish economy.\u00a0 Its regional spread means it underpins the socio-economic development of rural Ireland in particular. Farming\u00a0is an essential part of the social, cultural and economic fabric of the country and it is also part of a wider EU dispensation that values a Common Agriculture Policy built on family farming,\u00a0food security, high standards of food safety and environmental sustainability.\u00a0 These are values that we hold dear, and so it is critically important when we consider the impact of Brexit that\u00a0the positive contribution of\u00a0agriculture to the rural and national economy, and to society in Ireland, and indeed elsewhere in the European Union, is to the forefront in our deliberations. <\/p>  <p>  Since the UK referendum in June 2016,\u00a0the Government has\u00a0introduced a range of measures to help the agri-food sector navigate the short-term impacts of Brexit.\u00a0 In Budget 2017, I introduced measures to help reduce farm gate business costs, including a &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme, new agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the 2018 Budget I also announced a\u00a0&euro;50m Brexit support package, which will be comprised of a number of initiatives.  Firstly,\u00a0in cooperation with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I am establishing a new Brexit Loan Scheme aimed at providing affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future.  The Scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million of working capital finance available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses (up to 499 employees), at least 40% of which will be available to food businesses.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Due to State Aid rules, this new Scheme will not be available to farmers and fishermen, so I am considering the development of a\u00a0separate loan scheme in 2018 similar to the 2017 low-cost scheme, based on\u00a0&euro;25m funding from my Department to the Scheme.  These measures are aimed at enhancing competitiveness within the sector.<\/p>  <p>  I have also introduced supports for Bord Bia for investment in their market insight and market prioritisation initiatives which are aimed at identifying and developing potential diversification opportunities.  I have already increased funding to Bord Bia by &euro;10 million since the Brexit vote, and a further &euro;4.5 million is allocated in Budget 2018. <\/p>  <p>  To enhance product diversification, I have also allocated funding to support the development of the new National Food Innovation Hub, which will be located\u00a0in\u00a0Teagasc Fermoy, Co. Cork. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy\u00a0that Government\u00a0remains very focused on supporting farmers and the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead, whether they are based in Wexford or in any other part of the country.  The Government will be firm in arguing that any agreement reached between the EU and the UK must take account of the very serious challenges presented by Brexit for the sector, particularly\u00a0given the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and the importance of our economic relationship with the UK.  And of course ultimately Ireland's objective \u00a0in the negotiations is to have a trading relationship\u00a0 with the UK which is as close as possible to the current arrangement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300059#WRB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dairy Sector","counter":86,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300059#WRB04100"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[7015\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300059#WRB04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the way in which he plans to mitigate the guaranteed negative impact for milk producers in view of the fact that the floor price for skim milk powder has been removed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":88,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Irish dairy market, following on from broader EU and International trends, is currently in a much improved position compared to the relatively recent past.  Of course we remain extremely vigilant in monitoring the current market and emerging trends, particularly as we approach the peak period for Irish milk production . <\/p>  <p>  Whilst the overall dairy sector is now in a much better place, particularly at the farm gate, the issue of intervention stocks overhanging that particular market remains a cause for concern, arising from the significant recourse to this market measure for skimmed milk powder (SMP) across the EU since September 2015.<\/p>  <p>  There are now approximately 376,000 tonnes of SMP in public intervention stocks, effectively overhanging the EU SMP market.  My Department and I engaged at Council of Ministers meetings and directly with the Commission on recent measures to limit further stock piling of SMP in 2018 without due justification, including the Commission's proposal, to which the Deputy refers, to reduce the fixed price ceiling to zero. <\/p>  <p>  I strongly argued that this measure should be specified as for 2018 only, to avoid setting a precedent for the longer term.  This point was accepted and agreed in the final version of the measure, as adopted by the Council per COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) 2018\/147 of 29th January 2018, which came into effect the following day, 30th January.<\/p>  <p>  I have clearly stated previously, at Council of ministers meetings and elsewhere, that it is imperative for the Commission to remain vigilant in monitoring the market situation, and to have contingencies in place in the event of market volatility re-emerging, particularly in relevant markets, namely raw milk, butter and SMP in particular.<\/p>  <p>  In common with the vast majority of EU Member States where dairy production is of significance, I recognised that the current situation in respect of existing stocks could not be allowed to persist indefinitely and that there is general acceptance that doing nothing is not an option. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that this measure does not represent a change to the fundamental provisions of the intervention mechanism, nor to the necessary supports that intervention provides during periods of market volatility.  Ireland has welcomed and made use of intervention during such periods of instability.  This measure responds and is framed around a very specific set of circumstances, namely; very significant intervention stocks of SMP; a significant divergence between SMP and butter prices in negative and positive directions respectively, and; a generally more favourable market context in the EU dairy sector, including the farm gate in respect of more recent raw milk returns. <\/p>  <p>  I have clearly stated that the system, as it evolves, will need to display flexibility in respect of adapting to market contingencies, including flexibility around proposed SMP buying-in prices at tendering rounds, to react to the broader market situation at any given point in time. <\/p>  <p>  However, the issue of current stocks cannot be disentangled from the issue of managing SMP intervention in 2018 and beyond.  The issues involved, with respect to both market management and sentiment in the sector, are complex and require ongoing careful management.<\/p>  <p>  Given the Commission&rsquo;s effective status as among the world&rsquo;s biggest players on the SMP market, and as such their capacity to affect market sentiment, it would be appropriate that they continue to act prudently and responsibility in the disposal of stocks.  I am satisfied to date that the Commission has managed these stocks in a prudent manner. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has and will continue to engage with the Commission, with other Member States, and with national stakeholders on these important issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300059#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme Funding","counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300059#WRB04400"},{"type":"question","counter":90,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[7150\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300059#WRB04500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of the programme for Government commitment to increase ANC funding by &euro;25 million in 2018; and if increased payments will reflect the constraint of land type.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":91,"content":"<p>I am very aware of the importance of the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme, which issues annual payments in excess of &euro;200 million to\u00a0over 95,000 farmers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The ANC Scheme has always been recognised as a very important support for rural society and farmers across the country who farm constrained lands.\u00a0 In light of the importance of the scheme, the Programme for Government included a commitment to provide an additional &euro;25m for the Scheme in 2018.\u00a0 I am pleased to confirm that this commitment was delivered in Budget 2018 and that, subject to the EU Commission&rsquo;s approval of an amendment to Irelands Rural Development Programme, this new funding will be available for payment under the 2018 ANC Scheme. \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A number of different options were available in deciding how this additional funding was to be divided. \u00a0I was conscious of the need for money to be targeted at those farmers on lands with higher levels of constraint.<\/p>  <p>  With this in mind and having considered the views of stakeholders, I have decided to distribute the additional &euro;25 million as follows:<\/p>  <p> - &euro;13m will be allocated to the 'mountain type land'\u00a0category <\/p>  <p> - &euro;9m will be allocated to the\u00a0'more severely handicapped' category'\u00a0and<\/p>  <p> - &euro;3m\u00a0will be allocated to the 'less severely handicapped' category.<\/p>  <p>  These allocations will have the effect of increasing the current payment per hectare rates across all land categories.\u00a0 Those farming on what is called &ldquo;mountain type land&rdquo; will see their payment increase from &euro;109.71 to &euro;135 on their first 10 hectares, and from &euro;95.99 to &euro;112 on remaining hectares up to a maximum of 34 hectares.\u00a0 Farmers with land categorised as &ldquo;more severely handicapped lowland&rdquo; will see an increase from &euro;95.99 to &euro;104 per hectare up to a maximum of 30 hectares.\u00a0 Finally, those with &ldquo;less severely handicapped lowland&rdquo; will see an increase from &euro;82.27 to &euro;88.25 per hectare up to a maximum of 30 hectares.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these increased payment rates are consistent with the underlying logic of the Scheme, where the highest level of support is targeted at those who are faced with the highest level of constraint on their land.\u00a0 These changes must now be formally agreed with the EU Commission, by way of an amendment to our Rural Development Programme.\u00a0 My officials have initiated this process, with a view to introducing these new rates\u00a0for payment in 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300059#WRB04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300059#WRB04700"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[6668\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300059#WRB04800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of delayed GLAS payments for 2017 to persons in counties Carlow and Kilkenny; the reason for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":94,"content":"<p>The GLAS scheme is the most popular scheme ever run under a Rural Development Programme in Ireland.

As with all measures, certain criteria apply.  Farmers, in a locality within the region, identified by Teagasc as having a significant fodder shortage, having completed a fodder budgeting exercise with their FAS agricultural advisor, will be eligible to receive a financial contribution towards the costs of transport of fodder, sourced through the Co-operative system.  Only the shortfall in fodder will be eligible to receive support under the measure.<\/p>  <p>  Teagasc assessments of whether there are significant forage shortages in specific areas is ongoing.

Farmers will still pay the cost of the fodder in the normal way.

Farmers with Hen Harrier habitat qualified automatically for GLAS under Tier One, with some of the highest per hectare payments as well - &euro;370 per hectare up to the standard ceiling of &euro;5,000 per annum, with automatic qualification for GLAS Plus as well, should they manage sufficient habitat.  GLAS Plus brings potential payment for managing Hen Harrier habitat up to &euro;7,000 a year.  I am delighted to say that there are currently 2,674 farmers in GLAS taking the Hen Harrier action and this represents nearly 70% of all farmers with Hen Harrier land.  By any standards, this is a remarkable achievement and the scale of this level of co-ordinated intervention could have real impact on the survival of the bird. <\/p>  <p>  However, in developing the current RDP, my Department also wanted to build in the possibility for testing different ways of approaching agri-environmental issues on the ground &ndash; and this included how we might try to help both the Hen Harrier and farmers in Hen Harrier areas.  We wanted to experiment with a more agile &lsquo;locally-led&rsquo; model which could be used to test new ways of doing things and, perhaps most importantly, new ways of engaging farmers and involving them much more directly in developing ideas and solutions.  <\/p>  <p>  This is the process out of which the new Hen Harrier Programme has grown.  While funded and supported by the Department, it is not a Department scheme as such &ndash; it is a partnership involving many different players and is active in all six SPAs.  As well as seeking to protect the future of the bird, it explicitly seeks to create a stronger socio-economic outlook for the agricultural communities in those areas and to promote positive relations with those communities, who have managed these sensitive landscapes for generations.  The new Hen Harrier Programme has been designed by a locally-led Project Team working in close collaboration with the farmers on the ground in those areas.  I am delighted to say that interest in the scheme is exceptionally high with over 1,200 applications already received.  Worked examples show that a farmer with 15 hectares could earn up to &euro;3,000-&euro;4,000 a year, while a farmer with 40 hectares could actually get up to &euro;6,000-&euro;7,000 a year.  This could be in addition to what is paid under GLAS, depending on the circumstances and actions taken. <\/p>  <p>  I have allocated &euro;25m to the new Locally-Led programme and taken in combination with payments under GLAS to Hen Harrier farmers, we anticipate that total payments to farmers in these areas will be close to &euro;90m over the course of the current Rural Development Programme.  These payments are fully co-funded by the EU and testify to the ongoing commitment of both the Irish Government and the EU to support farmers in Hen Harrier areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300060#WRCCCCC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy Reform","counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300060#WRCCCCC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[7112\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300060#WRCCCCC02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the outcome of recent discussions at the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers on CAP reform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":131,"content":"<p>At the most recent EU Council of Agriculture Ministers in January, Ministers were given the opportunity to debate the future of the CAP post 2020.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Discussions focussed on\u00a0the key objectives to be set at EU level to ensure that\u00a0the CAP continues to add value after\u00a02020, and\u00a0the level of subsidiarity\u00a0necessary to provide increased flexibility for Member States while maintaining the common character of the CAP, and the role of\u00a0National strategic plans in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  In general Ministers recognised  the CAP's contribution to the production of high quality food, its support for 44 million jobs across the EU, for the maintenance of\u00a0landscapes\u00a0 and environmental improvement, and\u00a0the development of rural\u00a0communities across the EU, already provides significant added value.\u00a0\u00a0Ministers also recognised, however, that the CAP post 2020\u00a0should add further value by contributing towards the EU&rsquo;s environmental challenges and climate change objectives.\u00a0 This can only be achieved by securing an adequate budget for the CAP post 2020 and by placing farmers at the centre of the future CAP policy.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of subsidiarity,\u00a0Ministers generally agreed that the high level objectives for a new CAP should be set at EU level, and that within those parameters Member States could determine the appropriate measures to be introduced which best suit their own national circumstances.\u00a0 While member states were broadly supportive of the Commission's proposals on subsidiarity, there was a\u00a0broad consensus that member state discretion should not be set at a level that undermined the\u00a0common policy. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Discussions on the CAP post 2020 will intensify further in the coming months, with the Bulgarian Presidency scheduling CAP related discussions at every Council of Agriculture Ministers meetings during its Presidency.\u00a0\u00a0The upcoming February Council of Agriculture Ministers will\u00a0include \u00a0an exchange of views on the Commission Communication on the future of CAP, focusing on direct support, environmental aspects and rural development. <\/p>  <p>  I look forward to continuing to engage constructively on CAP post 2020 with Commissioner Hogan, his officials,\u00a0the Bulgarian Presidency and my Ministerial colleagues from other Member States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300060#WRCCCCC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Live Exports","counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300060#WRCCCCC02600"},{"type":"question","counter":133,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[6914\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300060#WRCCCCC02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the way in which live exports performed in each of the years 2015 to 2017; the efforts his Department is making to promote further expansion of the live export trade; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1273","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":134,"content":"<p>I am extremely conscious of the vital role that live exports play in stimulating price competition, providing an alternative market outlet for Irish beef farmers.

Ireland worked very closely with other Member States in both Agriculture and Trade committees of the EU, and at Council of Ministers level, seeking to have this TRQ removed and to have a comprehensive assessment of the cumulative impact of all FTAs on the agriculture sector carried out by the Commission before any substantial offer would be made.

Our views have been expressed clearly and consistently in EU discussions at political and official level, and by the Taoiseach in recent engagements with French President Emmanuel Macron and with Commission President Jean Claude Juncker.  <\/p>  <p>  Most recently, Ireland made the latest in a series of very strong interventions on this matter at the Trade Policy Committee in Brussels on 2 February, and my colleague, Minister of State Andrew Doyle, also made a very strong intervention at the January Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in Brussels, and spoke to Commissioner Hogan on the matter. Ireland also consulted closely with French and other Member State colleagues in the margins of the WTO Ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires in December in an effort to ensure that no further concessions would be made in relation to beef.<\/p>  <p>  I believe there is a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations, and I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector.  I will continue to work with other member states to protect the interests of the Irish beef sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300060#WRCCCCC04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Afforestation Programme","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300060#WRCCCCC05000"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[7145\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300060#WRCCCCC05100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of trees planted by those in the agriculture sector since 2011; the percentage of native species planted; the percentage of commercial non-native species; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":158,"content":"<p>The Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme is the main afforestation scheme available to land owners operated by my Department.\u00a0 The Scheme provides for a number of different grant and premium categories and within those categories, for the planting of a number of different species.\u00a0 The Forestry Programme 2014 to 2020 took into account the aims and objectives of the EU&rsquo;s Biodiversity Strategy.\u00a0 Certain commitments were provided for, which include a target of 30% broadleaf planting on an annual and national basis.\u00a0 This is a specific condition of my Department&rsquo;s State Aid approval for the programme.\u00a0 At the launch of the Afforestation Scheme a minimum of 10% broadleaf component was required.

Up until then, public service occupational pensions, including Defence Forces pensions, were generally adjusted in line with, and from the same operative date as, relevant pay increases applied to other corresponding public servants.  In the intervening years since end-2008, the Deputy will be aware that the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts 2009 &ndash; 2013 reduced public service pay and pension rates.<\/p>  <p>  The pre-existing non-statutory linkage of pension adjustments to movements in the pay of serving public servants &ndash; sometimes referred to as \"pay parity\" &ndash; lapsed in 2010, when the values of pensions in payment were left unchanged notwithstanding pay cuts at the beginning of 2010 that affected all public servants under the FEMPI legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, due to a &lsquo;grace period&rsquo; associated with the 2010 pay cuts, public servants who retired in the period up to end-February 2012 had their pensions based on the higher &lsquo;pre-cut&rsquo; salary levels. \u00a0This has led to the current situation whereby post-February 2012 retirees, on a like-for-like basis, mostly receive lower pensions than their counterparts who retired before them.  In addition, from the beginning of 2011, a progressively structured \"Public Service Pension Reduction\" (PSPR) had reduced the rates of public service pensions above specified thresholds.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in his reply to Questions Nos. 373 and 378 of 20th June 2017 indicated that the pension differential arising between pre and post-2012 retirees and the lapsing of pay parity have created the conditions under which &ndash; as we move beyond \"FEMPI\" legislation and the progressive removal of the PSPR towards more normal pay and pension setting conditions in the public service &ndash; the issue of how to adjust the post-award value of public service pensions through appropriate pay or other linkages has required consideration.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, the Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA) 2018-2020 sets out the policy on pension increases as now adopted by Government for the duration of that agreement, that is, to end-2020.\u00a0 Section 6.2 of the PSSA states that policy on public service pensions in payment will be guided by the following three elements:<\/p>  <p>  First, the need to adopt an equitable approach to the various public service pensioner cohorts differentiated by date of retirement (in particular pre and post end-February 2012) is affirmed.  Second, for those who retired or will retire after end-February 2012, to the extent that they retired on reduced salaries for pension award purposes, they will receive pension increases in line with pay increases received by their peers currently in employment, in accordance with the terms of the collective Agreement.  Third, when alignment is achieved between pre and post end-February 2012 pensioners, as will happen progressively for salary ranges up to &euro;70,000 in 2020 under the proposed collective agreement, pay increases will continue to benefit pensions in payment for the duration of this Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, certain public servants including relevant Defence Forces members received pay increases from 1 January 2016 (where basic salary was less than &euro;31,000) and from 1 April 2017 (a &euro;1,000 pay increase for all public servants with basic salaries below &euro;65,000).\u00a0 In December 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform authorised the application of those 2016-2017 pay increases to certain public service pensions.  Backdated to 1 September 2017, this pension increase is essentially confined to post-February 2012 retirees who retired on basic salaries of not more than &euro;65,000 &ndash; in line with current pension increase policy as adopted by Government.\u00a0 In January, 2018 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform authorised that the basic pay increases provided for in 2018-2020 during the period of the Public Service Stability Agreement also be passed on to the pensions of relevant public servants who retired post-February 2012.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that, in line with the current public service pension increase policy, my Department has commenced the detailed work of implementing these pension increases in the case of relevant military pensioners who retired since March 2012.  I am also advised that this will be a significant undertaking for my Department and its payroll provider, as each pensioner rate will have to be examined at individual level on an ongoing basis as the various pension increases are worked through.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the progressive removal of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) from pensions in payment has been happening in three stages over the period 2016 to 2018.\u00a0 As of 1 January 2018, it means that most public service pensioners, including about 95% of military pensioners, are not affected by PSPR at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300061#WRD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naval Service Data","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300061#WRD02500"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[6930\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300061#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the cost of the Naval Service missions in the Mediterranean Sea each year to date; the number of Defence Forces personnel deployed on the missions per annum; the annual cost of the missions; if the use of Naval Service vessels in Operation Sophia has reduced the availability of the vessels for search and rescue missions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>The additional costs incurred from the deployment of Naval Service vessels to the Mediterranean under Operation Pontus and Operation Sophia comprise the costs of allowances, fuel and other ancillary costs.\u00a0 Details\u00a0of these costs\u00a0and the numbers of Naval Service personnel deployed in the Mediterranean for each of the last three years are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>YEAR<\/th><th>COST<\/th><th>No. of Defence Forces personnel deployed on Naval Service vessels<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>&euro;2.6m<\/td><td>184<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>&euro;2.1m<\/td><td>175<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>&euro;2.19m<\/td><td>188<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Irish Naval Service vessels were first deployed in the Mediterranean in May 2015 on Operation Pontus.\u00a0 Naval vessels deployed again on Operation Pontus in 2016 and 2017.\u00a0 Following Government and D&aacute;il approval, the L.&Eacute;.

This is a position that Michel Barnier has expressed on a number of occasions, including on 5 February.<\/p>  <p>  In the 8 December Joint Report from the EU and UK negotiators on progress in phase one of the Brexit negotiations, the UK undertook that, in the event that it is not possible to resolve the border issue as part of a wider EU-UK future relationship agreement, or through specific solutions proposed by the British Government, it will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Customs Union and Single Market which support North South cooperation, the all-island economy and protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  Ireland and the Commission are agreed on the need for the legally binding Withdrawal Agreement under Article 50 TEU to include satisfactory arrangements achieving this objective.<\/p>  <p>  I and my officials continue to set forward Ireland&rsquo;s position on these issues at EU level through the General Affairs Council (Art. 50) and the relevant preparatory bodies as well as through bilateral contacts with Michel Barnier and the EU Taskforce and EU27 counterparts.  This includes my meeting this morning with Foreign Minister Linas Linkevi&egrave;ius of Lithuania.<\/p>  <p>  While stressing that Ireland is a member of the EU27 and that the issues involved can only be substantively negotiated with the European Commission, Brexit also naturally arises during the frequent bilateral contacts which I have with UK Ministers, including in the last fortnight with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Chancellor Philip Hammond, Minister Alan Duncan and Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington.  I most recently met Mr Lidington on Friday last, 9 February, the day when the most recent EU-UK negotiating round finished.  In addition to making clear the Government&rsquo;s position on island of Ireland issues, I strongly impressed upon him the need for the UK to come forward with more concrete proposals, including on a customs partnership if that is what they choose to seek.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300061#WRD04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Documents","counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300061#WRD04600"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[6902\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300061#WRD04700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when he and his Department officials saw the draft text of the transition section of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that was circulated on 6 February 2018.","asker":"1224","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>The European Commission Taskforce presented the draft legal terms for transitional arrangements to the EU27 Member States on 6 February, in advance of its publication on 7 February.

This is a service which my Department provides so that the media can easily and freely avail of photography where their own staff photographers cannot be fully accommodated.  Events such as the visit of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall in May 2017 and those by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada in July 2017 and UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in November 2017 resulted in positive overseas media coverage of Ireland.<\/p><p>Through the Office of Government Procurement an updated Multi-Supplier Framework Agreement for the provision of Professional Photography and Videography is now in operation.  My Department procures the services of external photographic agencies via this Framework where necessary.<\/p><p>In addition, my Department continues to avail of in-house resources for photography whenever possible.<\/p><p>The cost of photography to my Department for events which took place in 2018, 2017 and 2016 are listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3.

My Department has from time to time commissioned companies with a public relations and communications background to provide other professional services such as project management, logistics and event management, particularly in relation to Irish Aid public outreach activities.  A table containing this information is set out.<\/p><p>DHR Communications has been contracted to manage and administer grants to journalists reporting on international development issues under the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) and to manage and administer annual Africa Day-related events.<\/p><p>The SCMF involves managing three funding rounds each year, including the annual SCMF student competition.  This typically involves the following activities:<\/p><p>- Convening national and regional information workshops;<\/p><p>- Managing and administering the application process;<\/p><p>- Organising the judging process;<\/p><p>- Providing detailed feedback to all applicants;<\/p><p>- Processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records;<\/p><p>- Maintaining and updating the SCMF website.<\/p><p>It should be noted that expenses paid to third parties account for approximately 30% of the total paid to DHR for managing and administering the Simon Cumbers Media Fund.  This includes costs associated with maintaining and updating the SCMF website, facilitating the judging process and raising awareness of the Fund among journalists.<\/p><p>Following a competitive tendering process, DHR was also engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day flagship event as hosted by my Department at the Farmleigh Estate in 2016 and 2017 and also to support other Africa Day regional events held outside Dublin.  This included the administration of a small grants scheme for the regional events which DHR managed on behalf of the Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website.  This public awareness work represented a very minor element of the overall project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.<\/p><p>In relation to the expenditure on Africa Day, expenses paid to third parties accounted for between 70% and 80% of the total costs listed.  This included expenditure on security, sanitation, venue set-up, health and safety issues and small grants to facilitate the participation of community groups.<\/p><p>Table 4 sets out the payments for

In phase one<font color=\"#004080\">,<\/font>we secured concrete commitments on the protection of North South Cooperation, the All-Island economy, the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process.  We have also secured clear and strong commitments on avoiding a hard border and the UK has set out, for the first time, how this will be achieved.<\/p><p>In the event that it is not possible to resolve the border issue as part of a wider EU-UK future relationship agreement, which has always been the Irish Government&rsquo;s preference, or through specific solutions, the UK has committed that &ldquo;in the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy, and the protection of the 1998 agreement.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The North South cooperation we enjoy today brings tangible benefits to the daily lives of people in the border region and contributes to economic opportunity and development.  It is also a very practical outworking of the peace process which allows for the normalisation of relationships between people across the island, to mutual benefit.  The Government is therefore firmly focused on protecting the full range of areas in which North South cooperation exists today.<\/p><p>The Guidelines agreed by the European Council in December underline that negotiations in phase two can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken regarding citizens&rsquo; rights, the financial settlement and the Irish-specific issues during the first phase are respected in full and translated faithfully into legal terms as quickly as possible.  A key focus in the current phase of the negotiations is therefore on completing work on the withdrawal issues and on the drafting of the binding Withdrawal Agreement, where we and our EU partners expect to see the commitments made by the UK in phase one on all exit issues, including those involving Ireland, to be translated faithfully into legal terms as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>In this regard, we are working closely with the Commission Task Force and our EU partners in the coming weeks to advance the legal and technical work needed.  This work is building on work carried out at the request of the EU and UK Coordinators for the High Level Dialogue on Ireland\/Northern Ireland, where officials carried out detailed work over October and November last year to map out areas of cooperation that operate on a North South basis on the island of Ireland and which rely on EU law and policies.<\/p><p>This included looking at the six North South implementation bodies, the areas of cooperation under the North South Ministerial Council, which cover agriculture, environment, health, education, transport and tourism, as well as other areas where there is practical cooperation between North and South, including justice and security, energy, broadcasting and communications, inland fisheries, sport and culture.<\/p><p>The exercise highlighted how the maintenance and future development of meaningful North South cooperation rely on the EU legal and policy frameworks to give direction to th<font color=\"#004080\">is<\/font>cooperation and to facilitate its operation.  The EU frameworks are both overarching and the foundation to North South cooperation in many instances.  Much of the cooperation is interconnected, mutually supporting and complementary; it is not easily quantifiable.<\/p><p>All areas of cooperation, to varying extents, rely on or are supported by EU acquis.  Much of what happens involves the implementation of EU law and policies in a coherent and coordinated way that benefits the island of Ireland as a whole, particularly for reasons of size, economies of scale and geographic location.<\/p><p>The exercise underlined the need to avoid risks presented by any regulatory divergence from the rules of the EU Single Market and Customs Union.  We want to ensure that this cooperation can continue in a meaningful way.<\/p><p>Like the UK, we have consistently said that it is our preference to resolve the Irish-specific issues through the wider future relationship agreement between the EU and the UK.  However, in case this is not possible, we must at the same time ensure legal certainty in the Withdrawal Agreement that reflects the commitments made by the UK in phase one of the negotiations.<\/p><p>We will continue to work closely with the Commission Task Force and our EU partners in the coming weeks to advance the legal and technical work needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300061#WRD05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Cases","counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300061#WRD05900"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[6949\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300061#WRD06000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is growing concern for the health and well-being of a number of political prisoners in Bahrain (details supplied); and if he will raise the issues with his Bahraini counterpart.","asker":"1309","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":226,"content":"<p>I am aware of the situation referred to by the Deputy, and I remain very concerned about the human rights situation in Bahrain.

The tax wedge is defined as the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children (i.e. a worker on 100% of average earnings) and the corresponding total labour costs for the employer including employer social insurance costs. <\/p><p>Ireland historically has one the lowest tax wedge levels both within the EU and the OECD at average wages.  In 2016 (the latest year of data available), Ireland&rsquo;s average tax wedge was 27.1% of labour costs.  This compares very favourably to the OECD-average of 36.0%, and has been the lowest of the EU28 member states since 2000. <\/p><p>However, this comparative difference in tax wedge is eroded as incomes increase. Analysis published in the Income Tax Reform Plan in 2016, available online at<i>,<\/i>shows that in 2015 the Irish tax wedge for a single person was comparatively low at income of up to 125% of average earnings.  It then surpassed the UK and USA at c.125% and 150% respectively and surpassed the comparative French tax burden at c.210% of average earnings, while still remaining below Denmark and Germany.<\/p><p>In Budget 2015, the Department of Finance undertook an Economic Impact Assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Policy available online at<i>.<\/i>As part of this work, ESRI researchers estimated that the corporate tax rate has a negative effect on the location decision of multinational companies.  In other words, the higher the corporation tax rate in a country, the lower the probability of FDI locating there.  Although not the main focus of this research, they also examined the relationship between labour costs and FDI.  The researchers found that the higher the labour costs in a country, the lower the probability of FDI locating there.  This negative relationship between labour costs and FDI is borne out in other international studies such as:<\/p><p>- Johansson et al. (2008) &ldquo;TAX AND ECONOMIC GROWTH&rdquo;, OECD, <i><\/i><\/p><p>- Hajkova et al. (2006) &ldquo;TAXATION, BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND FDI LOCATION IN OECD COUNTRIES&rdquo;, OECD, <i><\/i><\/p><p>All else equal, it implies that countries with higher tax wedges than other countries are more likely to deter FDI.<\/p><p>I would also note that it is important to look at the effects of budgetary measures over time and not ignore their broader impacts.  The contribution of budgetary policy to employment growth over the past number of years is a case in point.  Employment is the best route out of poverty and is crucial to ensuring the sustainability of Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity.  Therefore the importance of the role of budget measures in creating an environment conducive to employment creation should not be understated.  As such, it remains a key Government priority to maintain competitiveness and support employment growth.

This assessment will in many cases include insurers own presumptions based on their private modelling and research. Consequently, neither the Government nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.<\/p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.  This in turn should lead to the increased availability of flood insurance.  To achieve this aim, there is a focus on:<\/p>  <p>  - prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,<\/p>  <p>  - development and implementation of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and<\/p>  <p>  - improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.  <\/p>  <p>  The above approach is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.  In this regard, the Insurance Ireland\/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.

Pursuant to this recommendation, a protocol has been agreed between the Department and Insurance Ireland under which insurance companies have committed to accepting the driving experience returning emigrants gained while abroad, when the driver has had previous driving experience in Ireland.  The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated any differently to any other driver subject to their ability to demonstrate, and the insurance company to verify, continuous driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  What this means is that the returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein or, indeed, whether the country is a member of the EU or not.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, insurance companies have agreed to provide relevant and helpful information on their websites to make it easier for consumers to understand the implications of their move abroad from a motor insurance perspective.

The wording of the agreed protocol is also available on the Insurance Ireland website. <\/p>  <p>  The report also outlines some sample cases which demonstrate how the rolling-out of the protocol has already led to disputed cases being resolved to the benefit of returning emigrants, and provides figures indicating that the number of such cases being processed under the Declined Cases Agreement is decreasing.<\/p>  <p>  If, however, a returning emigrant is unable to secure a motor insurance quotation on the open market, they may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement process, and the relevant contact details are: declined@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.  More generally, Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance, which can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761820.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300062#WRE04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners","counter":274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300062#WRE04600"},{"type":"question","counter":275,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[6874\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300062#WRE04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether an adequate service is being provided at the Revenue Commissioners' office in Athlone (details supplied) in view of the difficulties experienced by persons who have limited or no online experience; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":276,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that it has introduced an appointments service in a number of public offices, including the Athlone office.

Trustees must also\u00a0ensure that proper membership and financial records are kept.  Members of pension schemes should receive annual statements from any pension schemes they have paid into.  They further indicated that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has arrangements in place to assist with scheme member tracing, where pension schemes are having difficulty locating scheme members.\u00a0Where the administrator of a pension scheme or of a life company is unable to trace a member using their own resources they can avail of that Department&rsquo;s host mailing service for assistance in this process.  <\/p>  <p>  There is currently no single platform or infrastructure in place in Ireland allowing deferred scheme members to access information on their pensions savings and to trace their pension entitlements.\u00a0\u00a0The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has had a number of meetings with industry\u00a0where it was\u00a0indicated that in many cases the pension funds can find owners of pension benefits\u00a0using their own searches or by utilising that Department&rsquo;s host mailing system.<\/p>  <p>  Unclaimed benefits within occupational pension schemes can remain in the scheme indefinitely.  Such funds remain there in trust for the member.  Unclaimed personal pension funds and PRSAs established with an insurance undertaking are subject to the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003.

While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million. Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  A commitment is included in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement. That process has now commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.\u00a0 The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that within 3 months of the passing of the Act, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will prepare and\u00a0lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300064#WRG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":391,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300064#WRG02700"},{"type":"question","counter":392,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[6701\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300064#WRG02800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount his Department has spent on temporary accommodation for a school (details supplied) in each of the years 2000 to 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":393,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that details of expenditure on temporary accommodation, at the school referred to, are available on my Department&rsquo;s Financial Management System from 2003.

It is anticipated that decisions based on the review will be announced in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300065#WRH05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Private Partnerships","counter":483,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300065#WRH05300"},{"type":"question","counter":484,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[7044\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300065#WRH05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way in which the tender process for the &euro;200 million PPP investment in infrastructure in the higher education sector will be structured (details supplied); if there will be a separate tender for each of the 11 institutions which are to receive investment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[7205\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300065#WRH05500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a tender (details supplied) will be tendered via the traditional funding route in an effort to support companies on the Border in view of Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":486,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 and 216 together.<\/p>  <p>  The projects forming part of the Higher Education PPP Programme are currently being appraised in accordance with the Public Spending Code.\u00a0 The current focus is on confirming the detailed Schedules of Accommodation for each project.\u00a0 This PPP programme was provided for in the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan for 2016-2021 and is expected to deliver some 8,000 student places across the Institute of Technology sector. <\/p>  <p>  The PPP procurement process, whilst yet to be finalised, is anticipated to comprise two separate tender competitions to deliver the identified facilities across the 11 HEIs.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0As part of the PPP procurement process there will be a series of regional &ldquo;Meet the Buyer&rdquo; events for local SMEs to meet with the PPP companies that have been short-listed to tender for the project.

The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the changes\u00a0I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the current starting salary of a new teacher\u00a0is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.<\/p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010.  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  A commitment is included in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.  That process has now commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.\u00a0 The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that within three months of the passing of the Act, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will prepare and\u00a0lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300066#WRJ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":536,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300066#WRJ03700"},{"type":"question","counter":537,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[7364\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300066#WRJ03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to improve the manner in which the Irish language is being taught at primary school level (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":538,"content":"<p>A new\u00a0primary language curriculum for junior infants to second class has been developed.\u00a0 Implementation of the new curriculum commenced on a phased basis in 2016 starting with the oral strand.\u00a0 This was prioritised to allow teachers to emphasise the importance of speaking Irish as a living language.<\/p><p>There are two curriculums; one for Irish-medium schools where Irish is the language of instruction and one for English-medium schools where Irish is the second language.\u00a0 Proficiency levels attained in Irish will, in reality, be different depending on the language of instruction used.<\/p><p>All primary teachers are currently in receipt of Continuing Professional Development, CPD, for the new primary language curriculum.\u00a0 CPD concentrated on the oral language strand in 2016\/17.In 2017\/18, the CPD is focused on the reading and writing strands.\u00a0 Teachers will be able to teach all three strands from September 2018.<\/p><p>Improving the standard and supports for teachers of Irish is an important priority.<\/p><p>All Initial Teacher Education, ITE, programmes for primary level have been reconfigured and lengthened.\u00a0 The content and duration of Gaeltacht placements has been increased from one three-week period to two separate periods of two weeks.<\/p><p>My Department funds An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, COGG, to develop textbooks and other resource materials for both English-medium and Irish-medium schools.<\/p><p>My Department also funds Foras na Gaeilge to provide interactive teaching and learning resources under their Seide&aacute;n S&iacute; initiative.<\/p><p>Work is currently underway in developing the primary language curriculum for third to sixth class.<\/p><p>All the above efforts are being made to enable teachers to enhance the quality of the learning experience and the proficiency levels gained by our primary pupils in Irish whether they attend an Irish-medium or an English-medium school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300066#WRJ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defibrillators in Schools Provision","counter":539,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300066#WRJ04000"},{"type":"question","counter":540,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[7365\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300066#WRJ04100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to liaise with the Minister for Health and the\u00a0national steering group on out of hospital cardiac arrest in order to make\u00a0defibrillators more easily accessible in schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":541,"content":"<p>The position is that under the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school. <\/p>  <p>  The decision to install a defibrillator is made at local school level and is a matter for the board of management of each individual school.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand that a national steering group on out of hospital cardiac arrest was established in 2017 and is representative of health professionals, patient groups, healthcare providers and other sectors.

The ISI&rsquo;s objective is to restore people who are insolvent to solvency in a fair, transparent and equitable way.<\/p><p>International experience demonstrates that it takes several years for a new insolvency regime to really gain traction. However, to date, the ISI has returned over 6,000 debtors to solvency with over 2,000 of those cases being Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs) which deal with mortgage debt.<\/p><p>In over 90% of these PIA cases, debtors have been able to stay in their homes.\u00a0This is a significant achievement given that many cases involved arrears exceeding 720 days and is an important indicator that the system is achieving positive results for indebted borrowers.<\/p><p>The solutions introduced in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 have also had an indirect impact on the number and quality of over 120,000 informal agreements between debtors and creditors, as reported by the Central Bank of Ireland. Because arrangements agreed under the Act are public and court approved, they set precedents for the terms of agreements that will be acceptable to a court. Debtors now have realistic alternative options available to them through the ISI if negotiations break down. <\/p><p>To date the value of debt involved in applications to the ISI, including bankruptcies, has exceeded &euro;9.6 billion.<\/p><p>Insofar as the overall effectiveness of\u00a0personal insolvency arrangements\u00a0are concerned, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 modernised the regime for personal insolvency and brought Ireland in line with international best practice by providing for a range of debt resolution options within a statutory framework which balances the rights of creditors and debtors. The Personal Insolvency Arrangement, in particular, is an innovative solution that seeks to restructure or settle secured debt. Other important elements of this framework include the minimum statutory protection laid down regarding the debtor's reasonable living expenses and their home.<\/p><p>The Government has introduced a number of amendments and supports, since 2012, to ensure the success of the solutions provided by the Personal Insolvency legislation. These include the section 115A Court review process and the Abhaile Mortage Arrears Resolution Service. <\/p><p>The section 115A Court review process, introduced with effect from November 2015,\u00a0permits a debtor to ask the Court to review and assess the reasonableness of a\u00a0PIA proposal which has been refused by creditors and which includes mortgage arrears on the debtor's home. The\u00a0Court considers the reasonableness of the refusal using a balanced range of criteria and has power, if satisfied, to impose the proposed personal insolvency arrangement on the dissenting creditor(s). This removes the so called &quot;Bank Veto&quot;.<\/p><p>The High Court has published a number of important detailed judgements on the criteria that will be applied by the courts in section 115A review cases, and the types of mortgage arrears resolutions that may be imposed. Those precedents involved the following issues:<\/p><p>- Separated Spouses -a case\u00a0involving a separated spouse who restructured her mortgage.\u00a0The Court rejected a claim by the bank that, before any restructure, the bank needed the cooperation of the other joint borrower.\u00a0 <\/p><p>- Rejection of unsustainable warehousing proposal and approval for\u00a0negative equity write-off -\u00a0acase\u00a0where the mortgage lender wanted to warehouse part of a mortgage.\u00a0The Court ruled that this could not be done unless there is a reasonable prospect of the couple paying back the warehoused amount.\u00a0The PIA wrote off most of the negative equity.<\/p><p>- Fixing interest rate for the long term -a case concerning a mortgage rate fixed for 27 years.\u00a0In assessing if this unfairly prejudiced the financial institution (a fund rather than a bank), the court looked at market investment returns rather than the rates and terms that are available to a bank to raise capital and\u00a0decided that the PIA proposal was fair and reasonable in this context.<\/p><p>A further\u00a0significant High Court judgement, dealing with technical challenges made to the Section 115A process, was also issued at the beginning of February.\u00a0This ruling has been positively received by both the ISI and Personal Insolvency Practitioners. Subject to any possible appeal, it is expected to lead to increased activity in Personal Insolvency Arrangements.<\/p><p>Another important enhancement is\u00a0Abhaile,\u00a0the Government's national\u00a0Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service, which\u00a0ensures that people who are in danger of losing their home have access to free professional advice, including advice from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner. Abhaile was introduced in 2016 to allow further enhanced access to the personal insolvency regime. Abhaile offers detailed financial and legal advice to homeowners in mortgage arrears with the aim of allowing them to find a solution to their arrears and to stay in their homes where possible. Take up of the Abhaile scheme has been high, with over 10,000 vouchers for these consultations issued since the start of the scheme in July 2016. A borrower may also apply for legal aid through Abhaile to seek a court review under section 115A. Abhaile is also raising awareness of the scheme through a targeted Abhaile public information campaign.<\/p><p>Finally, my Department is also finalising a review of the operation of the Personal Insolvency Acts. Submissions made by stakeholders via a public consultation have made a range of recommendations to enhance the process and to support increased engagement with the system. I look forward to bringing proposals to Government in the coming months to address the conclusions of the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300067#WRK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting of Personnel","counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300067#WRK02300"},{"type":"question","counter":577,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[7174\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300067#WRK02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if universities and institutes of technology come under the requirements that require staff to be Garda vetted as per requirements of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012; if such requirements are required in circumstances in which staff are close to retiring; the penalties enacted on those persons who do not register; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":578,"content":"<p>Employment vetting is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016.

In addition, in the context of the coming into force on 25 May 2018 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the DPC has launched a broad based communications campaign to raise awareness of the new law. These communications activities are focused on building awareness of the very significant additional obligations the GDPR will place on organisations, as well as the greatly strengthened rights it extends to individuals to have their personal data protected and safeguarded.<\/p><p>The spend in relation to the Insolvency Service of Ireland relates to the 'Back on Track' campaign. The 'Back on Track' campaign promotes the ISI's range of debt solutions at every opportunity in a range of ways including through the backontrack.ie website, targeted advertising campaigns (including TV, video on demand, outdoor, press, radio, and online), information booklets which are distributed nationwide, and presentations and meetings with relevant groups. Research has found that the campaign has greatly increased awareness of the ISI's services. Those who availed of an ISI solution have also spoken of the immense sense of relief once they took the first step to address their debt problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300067#WRK05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gaming and Amusement Halls","counter":606,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300067#WRK05300"},{"type":"question","counter":607,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[6764\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300067#WRK05400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there are limitations or restrictions as to the location in which a business with a specific purpose can be located within a town centre (details supplied).","asker":"1278","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":608,"content":"<p>I can inform the\u00a0Deputy\u00a0that I have no role in the licensing process for amusement arcades.<\/p><p>All lawful gaming in amusement and gaming arcades in Ireland is, at present, confined to areas in respect of which Part III of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 is in force.

The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.  <\/p>  <p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice was also developed by a steering committee of the Judiciary\u00a0which developed\u00a0the Irish Sentencing Committee website which was\u00a0a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  The website can be accessed by\u00a0members of the Judiciary and the public and is a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families as well as members of the public.<\/p>  <p>  The report of the Working Group on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy, published in July 2014, considered the issue of developing sentencing guidelines.\u00a0 However, the majority of the Review Group took the view that the primary role of developing sentencing guidelines is the responsibility of the judiciary and does not lie in bringing forward detailed statutory based guidelines.  It might also be noted that a Sentencing Council was not advocated by the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Mandatory Sentencing which was published in June 2013.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that, in 2014, the Court of Criminal Appeal issued a number of judgments which addressed the question of sentencing and which acknowledged the many factors that can be considered in individual cases which undermine the usefulness of direct comparisons between one case and another.  Nonetheless, every effort to promote consistency should be made and in this respect it is appropriate for the courts to provide guidance on sentencing matters.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Judicial Council Bill was published in June 2017 and is currently awaiting Committee Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.\u00a0 The Bill provides for the establishment of a Judicial Council, the function of which will be to promote and maintain excellence in the exercise by judges of their judicial functions.\u00a0The Council is specifically tasked with promoting an understanding of sentencing principles and practices among judges and persons other than judges.\u00a0In this context, it will be assisted by a Sentencing Information Committee which will be responsible for the collation of sentencing information and the dissemination of that information.\u00a0 The\u00a0costs for the operation of that Committee have yet to be determined but were provisionally estimated at\u00a0&euro;400,000 for startup (including IT) costs and &euro;200,000 for  annual running costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300068#WRL03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service","counter":653,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300068#WRL04000"},{"type":"question","counter":654,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[7047\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300068#WRL04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the estimated cost of establishing a dedicated a family court system; and the estimated full year running cost thereafter.","asker":"1287","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":655,"content":"<p>My Department is currently working on the General Scheme of a Family Court Bill which will aim to streamline family law court processes, clarify jurisdictional issues and provide for a set of guiding principles to help ensure that the Family Court will operate in a user-friendly and efficient manner.

In this regard, it is important to understand the issues which arise in seeking to simply outlaw membership of a criminal gang in such a manner. Most significant here is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.  Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships, alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.  <\/p>  <p>  However, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, with a view to ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular the activities of those involved in organised crime.  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.  These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.  The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment. <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not. Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were also introduced aiding prosecution of the offences provided for under the Act.  The Act also provides that where a serious offence is committed as part of, or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to utilise all available legislation, including the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 referred to above, in their ongoing efforts to tackle organised crime activity.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300068#WRL05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":671,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300068#WRL05800"},{"type":"question","counter":672,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[7099\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300068#WRL05900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; in the Carlow-Kilkenny Garda division for the years ending 31 December 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":673,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

The expert oversight by the CSO of crime statistics is welcome in order to ensure that we can have confidence in the official crime statistics and can tailor our policies accordingly.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to clarify that the issue about the classification of homicide statistics is not new.  It was identified some time ago by the Garda&iacute; themselves and I am assured that intensive work has been ongoing to resolve the issue by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with oversight from the Policing Authority, the CSO and my own Department. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that this issue was already in the public domain at the time of my appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality.  Since my appointment as Minister I have been briefed regularly on the issues relating to crime statistics.  On 5 February, in the course of a wide ranging meeting with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on policing issues, I was briefed on the issue by Acting Commissioner O Cual&aacute;in and his wider team.  On 7 February I met the Chair and CEO of the Policing Authority with the Acting Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner to discuss the progress made to date in resolving this issue and progress yet to be made.  I strongly underlined the need to have matters addressed on an urgent priority basis, while acknowledging the labour intensive complex work involved in cases stretching back over many years.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na outlined the process of the peer review currently being undertaken and other aspects of the ongoing process on which they will report to the Authority at their next scheduled public meeting on 22 February. <\/p>  <p>  I support the Authority&rsquo;s important work in relation to this matter and I understand that this issue will continue to be examined both in public meetings and in the ongoing work that takes place in between such meetings until the Authority is fully satisfied.  This oversight is appropriate and welcome, as the Policing Authority was established by the Government as an independent body to oversee the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to policing services in Ireland.  Its key objective is to promote trust and confidence in policing and to help shape policing services for Ireland in the future.  The Minister has full confidence in the ability of the Authority to do the work with which they are tasked. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initiated a review of homicide classifications, initially for the period 2013-2015 but later extended the review to cover the period from 2003-2017.  This is obviously a time consuming and complex process but it is important that both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the CSO are confident that their data is robust and accurate.  While the review is underway, the CSO has suspended the publication of quarterly crime statistics, with the most recent published figures being for Q4 2016.  The review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has not been published as it is not yet complete, however the details will be made public on completion. <\/p>  <p>  I am extremely concerned about reports that unlawful deaths were not properly investigated.  Any substantiated allegations of this kind would be very serious and a cause of grave public concern.  The issue that has arisen in respect of homicide classification is complex and it is essential to clearly establish the facts.<\/p>  <p>  While I note that a figure of 41 deaths requiring reclassification has been mentioned in public discourse, this is incorrect.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has advised that their examination of 524 cases for the period 2013-2015 identified 41 cases which required further examination and, out of those 41 cases, 12 deaths were identified which required reclassifications on PULSE.  In addition, a further &lsquo;peer review&rsquo; verification process is underway in relation to these figures, as requested by the Policing Authority. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that, in the review of the 41 cases, it was identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that each death was fully investigated by them and this has been stated both orally and in writing.  I have received assurances from the Garda Commissioner that he is confident that all 41 cases which were identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as requiring further examination have been properly investigated in accordance with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  This article, as the Deputy will be aware, protects the right to life and places an obligation on States to investigate suspicious deaths.<\/p>  <p>  My Department remains in close contact with the CSO, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority to ensure a return to the publication of Crime Statistics by the CSO at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300069#WRM00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Vehicles","counter":683,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300069#WRM00800"},{"type":"question","counter":684,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[7172\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300069#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of SPSV licences that were revoked in each of the years 2015, 2016 and 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":685,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the issuing and revoking of Public Service Vehicle (PSV) licences is an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s functions pursuant to Section 70 of the Taxi Regulations Act 2013 to issue \/ revoke a PSV licence have been delegated by the Commissioner to each Divisional Officer and District Officer.

It provides a means of recognising that every community - both urban and rural - has its own concerns and expectations.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.  It is of course the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties, not solely those assigned full-time as community Garda&iacute;. <\/p>  <p>  I have previously stated that I welcome the strong emphasis that the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed that the strength of the Garda Traffic Corps on the 31 December 2017, stood at 623.  In addition, there is one Chief Superintendent and two Superintendents attached to the DMR Traffic Corps, a Superintendent and Traffic Inspector attached to each of the five Regions, and one Superintendent attached to the Policing Road Traffic Bureau.  It is important to note, that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as through specific enforcement operations.<\/p>  <p>  There is no room for complacency when it comes to road safety and the intensive efforts being made to promote road safety have contributed to last year representing the lowest number of road traffic fatalities on record at 159.  It is imperative that the positive momentum across road traffic enforcement and road safety initiatives is harnessed towards further annual reductions in fatalities.<\/p>  <p>  By working together with the RSA and other agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to confront dangerous road-user behaviour thorough public presence, legislative enforcement, education and partnership.  The Government is committed to further supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard including by reversing the effects of the legacy of the moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 which resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across the whole organisation including the Traffic Corps. <\/p>  <p>  The Government implementation of the plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 is well underway and there is real tangible progress on reaching this goal.  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment.  This year a further 800 Garda trainees will enter the College with 800 also scheduled to attest. This will see Garda numbers reach more than 14,000 by the end of 2018. <\/p>  <p>  This increase in Garda numbers will facilitate the Commissioner in meeting his commitment to strengthen the numbers assigned to roads policing by 10% year on year using the strength of the Traffic Corps of 671 on 31 December 2016 as a baseline.  It is not all about numbers, the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on the role of the Traffic Corps being expanded to include crime prevention and detection on the roads through the establishment of Divisional Roads Policing Units.  The Commissioner has confirmed that a review of roads policing has been completed and that a new role and job description for additional personnel for Road Policing Units has been developed. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that regional competitions which will allow for the allocation of additional resources to the Divisional Roads Policing Units is ongoing and Garda management plan that in the region of a 150 additional Garda&iacute; will be assigned on an incremental basis to Roads Policing duties in 2018 to support better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement and crime prevention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300070#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Reports","counter":735,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300070#WRN00500"},{"type":"question","counter":736,"qnumday":296,"qnumall":"[7446\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300070#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on a newspaper report (details supplied) of 7 February 2018 relating to a Garda report containing information outstanding from a number of parliamentary questions, including the number of drivers detected with between 50 mg and 80 mg of blood alcohol; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":737,"content":"<p>I am aware of the newspaper article referred to by the Deputy, however, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not appropriate for me to comment on a journalist's source material.

It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as at least 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA Ireland client companies.  <\/p><p>Site visits nevertheless do represent an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas and the IDA always does its utmost to ensure that investors consider all potential locations when visiting Ireland. <\/p><p>The following table outlines IDA Ireland site visits by county from 2013 to 2017.<table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>180<\/td><td>205<\/td><td>242<\/td><td>284<\/td><td>327<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath <\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath <\/td><td>9<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>42<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>42<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan <\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth <\/td><td>4<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan <\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal <\/td><td>7<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim <\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo <\/td><td>10<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>18<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork <\/td><td>31<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>48<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>51<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway <\/td><td>15<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>41<\/td><td>42<\/td><td>62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo <\/td><td>3<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>326<\/td><td>359<\/td><td>565<\/td><td>638<\/td><td>682<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300070#WRN02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Ireland Data","counter":762,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300070#WRN02600"},{"type":"question","counter":763,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[7061\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300070#WRN02700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of IDA-supported jobs by county at the end of each year from 2013 to 2017; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":764,"content":"<p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s performance in 2017 resulted in the third consecutive year of strong growth under the Agency's current Strategy.

The Council has set out specific requirements for doctors regarding prescribing of drugs at section 42 of its Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners (2016).  While the Guide is not a legal code, it sets out the principles of professional practice and conduct that all doctors registered with the Medical Council are expected to follow.  The Guide advises that doctors must be aware of the dangers of drug dependency when prescribing benzodiazepines, opiates and other drugs with addictive potential.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2016 the Early Warning Emerging Trends (EWET) subcommittee of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol, with the agreement of my Department, wrote to health care professionals highlighting the need for vigilance when prescribing and dispensing pregabalin and gabapentin, as these drugs present a risk of addiction and a potential for illegal diversion and misuse.  Prescribers were advised to always undertake a risk benefit assessment prior to prescribing either of these medicines for patients under their care.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s multi-disciplinary Medicines Management Programme (MMP) works with the National Medicines Information Centre (NMIC) and the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE), in collaboration with the HSE-Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS), to provide sustained national leadership relating to issues such as the quality of the medicines management process, access to medicines and overall expenditure on medicines.  It aims to promote safe, effective and cost effective prescribing.<\/p>  <p>  The MMP work plan includes monitoring the utilisation of all medicines with a high prescribing frequency and\/or high expenditure based on data from the PCRS.<\/p>  <p>  The MMP has previously identified the high number of prescriptions for certain benzodiazepines and &lsquo;z-drug&rsquo; sedatives and, coupled with the safety concerns associated with these medicines and their addictive potential, now monitors the total number of patients on these drugs and the total number of prescriptions issued on an on-going basis.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of increasing trends around their use the MMP has published a toolkit to support the appropriate prescribing of benzodiazepine and z-drugs in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia.  The guidance document contains information on initiation, review and deprescribing of these drugs and it is anticipated that the adoption of this guidance by prescribers will lead to a reduction in the long-term inappropriate prescribing of these drugs.<\/p>  <p>  The MMP, in collaboration with the PCRS, has written to all GPs outlining their levels of benzodiazepine and other hypnotics prescribing on the GMS scheme in an initiative to encourage better quality prescribing of these drugs.  The reports allow GPs to see exactly how many times they have prescribed these drugs in the preceding months.  This is another useful tool for prescribers to monitor prescribing in their practice compared to national rates and also to track changes in their prescribing over time.  The next HSE-PCRS prescribing report is planned for circulation in the coming weeks and information from the recently published toolkit will be disseminated to GPs alongside those reports.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, in October 2017 the Medical Council of Ireland and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland launched joint guidance on the Safe Prescribing and Dispensing of Controlled Drugs aimed at registered medical practitioner and pharmacists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300071#WRO02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":827,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300071#WRO02900"},{"type":"question","counter":828,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[6700\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300071#WRO03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that as of 1 January 2018 there is now no sexual health service within an hour&rsquo;s commute of Athlone; and his plans to rectify this matter","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":829,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300071#WRO03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Planning","counter":830,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300071#WRO03200"},{"type":"question","counter":831,"qnumday":330,"qnumall":"[6714\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300071#WRO03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the projects to which funding has been allocated under the HSE capital plan for 2018 by CHO area, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":832,"content":"<p>Health capital funding was outlined in the Public Service Estimates for 2018.

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs. The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring\/Summer session 2018. I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that: there is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation; there is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme; resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and the Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>   It is hoped to bring a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.  Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,  no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. <\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. <\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. <\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017. This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster. No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes. In August 2017 the HSE advised GPs of the changes and of treatment alternatives. <\/p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes. The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision. <\/p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,500 applications from GPs, of which some 10% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.<\/p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  Of some 200 appeals to date, the HSE advises that over 50% have been accepted on clinical grounds.<\/p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at .<\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300072#WRP05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Funding","counter":914,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300072#WRP05200"},{"type":"question","counter":915,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[6850\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300072#WRP05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the State subsidy provided to the gay men&rsquo;s health service for 2017 and 2018, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":916,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300072#WRP05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"question","counter":918,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[6851\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300072#WRP05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the additional funding provided by the sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme to the GMHS in 2016 and 2017; his plans to continue this funding in its current form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":919,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. <\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. <\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. <\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  In August 2017 the HSE advised GPs of the changes and of treatment alternatives. <\/p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes.  The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision. <\/p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,500 applications from GPs, of which some 10% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.<\/p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  Of some 200 appeals to date, the HSE advises that over 50% have been accepted on clinical grounds.<\/p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard laboratory approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and has been agreed by experts from the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and other Irish and international experts.  This testing is available in Ireland. <\/p><p>Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics by General Practitioners.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.  <\/p><p>The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre website () gives extensive information on Lyme Disease diagnosis, treatment and how to avoid tick bites.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. <\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. <\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. <\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  In August 2017 the HSE advised GPs of the changes and of treatment alternatives. <\/p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes.  The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision. <\/p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,500 applications from GPs, of which some 10% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.<\/p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  Of some 200 appeals to date, the HSE advises that over 50% have been accepted on clinical grounds.<\/p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at:<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.

Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 90 die from the disease.  All cervical cancers are linked to high risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types.  In 2009 the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls to reduce their risk of cervical cancer and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools. <\/p><p>I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  However, these claims have led to a significant drop in uptake rates of the HPV vaccine from 87% in 2014\/15 to 72% in 2015\/16 and 51% in 2016\/17.  Provisional figures from the HSE indicate that HPV vaccine uptake rates increased in September\/October 2017 to 62% due to a comprehensive communications campaign for parents with support from a large number of key stakeholders.<\/p><p>One of the most important things we can do is to provide accurate and credible information to enable parents to take a fully informed decision concerning HPV vaccination.

The HSE launched their information campaign for HPV vaccination as part of the 2017\/18 Schools Immunisation Programme on 30 August 2017.  The Information campaign supports the HPV vaccination programme and provides information packs for parents which are scientifically accurate and endorsed by Irish and international bodies.

During 2017, 53 herds in these areas were restricted with a total of 302 reactors removed.  32 of the restrictions followed reactor disclosure at a contiguous herd test.   <\/p>  <p>  Since the first breakdown in the area in Autumn 2016, the outbreaks have been investigated and managed by my Department&rsquo;s Veterinary Inspectorate (in cooperation with local herd-owners and veterinary practitioners).  They have conducted epidemiological investigation of all herds with more than 2 reactors, blood sampling of all reactors for quality control purposes, diagnostic blood testing of high risk groups within the herd, identification of contiguous holdings and additional testing as required, as well as subjecting the herd to further diagnostic tests where it is considered that the infection is of a more chronic nature.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s TB Eradication Programme incorporates a wildlife strategy since 2004 which includes the removal of badgers from areas where there has been a TB outbreak with evidence of an epidemiological link to badgers.  Badgers are protected by national legislation and are captured under licence, issued by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  This strategy is informed by considerable scientific evidence of a link between badgers and cattle in the context of the spread of bovine TB.  In line with this policy, where badgers are identified as a likely source in the Iveragh Peninsula a survey is carried out and badgers are captured and removed.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has recently introduced the vaccination of badgers against tuberculosis as an integral part of the bovine TB eradication programme.  This marks a major step forward in the bovine TB eradication programme and follows years of scientific research.  The most recent research findings confirm that vaccination of badgers can play a role in reducing the level of infection in cattle.  It will enable Ireland move forward towards eradication of bovine TB in a controlled holistic way, which will serve to protect the badger population whilst also protecting cattle and the livelihoods of farmers.  The vaccination programme has commenced in the areas which have already been part of the field trials demonstrating the effectiveness of badger vaccination.  It will roll out incrementally to other parts of the country over time, with vaccination gradually replacing the need to remove badgers.  It is not appropriate to initiate a vaccination programme in an area where there is an active outbreak of disease.<\/p>  <p>  I would also point out that there are other factors that contribute to the spread of tuberculosis which may be contributing to the problem in this area.  For example, there are a significant number of animals traded locally within the area and the clustering of outbreaks indicates that the contiguous spread between herds is likely a factor.  Farmers in the area are to be congratulated for their efforts to increase biosecurity which will further reduce the risk of future outbreaks.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, while it is too early to formulate any definitive conclusions, early indications are that the situation in South Kerry is showing signs of improvement.  The rate of reactor disclosure and herd restrictions has abated.  A significant number of herds have recently had one clear test and a smaller number have had their second clear test and are no longer restricted. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300077#WRU01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":1192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300077#WRU01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1193,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[6735\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300077#WRU01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, payment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; the reason for the delay in issuing payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1273","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1194,"content":"<p>The above named\u00a0was approved into GLAS\u00a03 with a contract commencement date of\u00a01 January 2017. <\/p><p>Administrative checks\u00a0must take\u00a0place on all GLAS\u00a0claims.

In the judgment, the Supreme Court found that fishing by Northern Ireland boats within the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State under the Voisinage arrangements is not permitted by law.  The Voisinage arrangements are long-standing reciprocal arrangements which have allowed fishing boats from Northern Ireland access to fish within the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State and vice versa.   <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court finding that the Voisinage arrangements are not invalid but that, as it stands, there is insufficient provision for them in domestic law.  The Supreme Court in fact noted that the arrangements were a sensible recognition at official level of practice and tradition, where fishing boats traditionally fished neighbouring waters. <\/p>  <p>  The application of the judgment is to all fishing by Northern Irish fishing boats in the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone, measured from the baselines, relying on the Voisinage arrangements.  Foreign fishing vessels are not permitted to fish inside the baselines.  Fishing activities that have a legal basis are not affected, such as those reliant on the access arrangements to Ireland's 6 to 12 nautical mile zone set out in Regulation (EU) No. 1380\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council.<\/p>  <p>  The Government approved the publication of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill to address issues raised by the Supreme Court judgment, in so far as it relates to access for Northern Irish vessels.  If enacted and commenced, the Bill will give the Voisinage arrangements a proper legal footing.  The Bill was published in February 2017 and is available on the Oireachtas website.  The Bill has commenced debate in the Seanad. <\/p>  <p>  In July 2017, the UK Government formally announced that it is leaving the 1964 London Fisheries Convention.  The Convention deals primarily with access rights to countries 6 to 12 nautical mile zones and much of these are also included in Common Fisheries Policy.  Article 2 of the Convention precludes countries from fishing in another country&rsquo;s 0 to 6 nautical mile zone.  However, Article 9 of the Convention gave countries the option to come to arrangements with their neighbours to allow access inside the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone if so desired.  This was the basis for the Voisinage arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The UK has intimated it would like to retain the Voisinage arrangements element of the London Fisheries Convention.  Ireland will continue to reflect on all relevant issues in the context of Brexit negotiations and the progress ofthe Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Under EU Regulation, every commercial sea-fishing boat needs to have a licence, held by the owner of the boat, and in accordance with the Common Fisheries Policy, every Member State must manage the size and scale (capacity) of its fishing fleet.  Fishing capacity in Ireland, in theform of gross tonnage and engine power, is a privately owned, tradable asset that, with certain exceptions, may be sold, traded or realised as a financial asset on the tonnage market.  To licence a sea-fishing boat, capacity must be provided by the applicant as part of the licensing process.  Currently the licensing process for a sea-fishing boat does not incur a charge.  I do not consider that the proposal set out meets the terms of EU Regulation and accordingly I do not see scope to explore this option. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300077#WRU03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":1213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300077#WRU03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1214,"qnumday":464,"qnumall":"[6791\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300077#WRU04000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when an outstanding 2017 GLAS payment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1215,"content":"<p>The person named was approved into GLAS 1 with a contract commencement date of 1 January 2016 and has received all payments in respect of scheme year 2016 and the 2017 advance payment.

Upon summary conviction these are &euro;5,000 and\/or up to six months in jail.  For major cases taken on indictment, the maximum penalty was increased from &euro;100,000 to &euro;250,000, with a maximum custodial sentence of five years imprisonment.  These penalties are in keeping with Irish jurisprudence and therefore I do not envisage further changes at this time.<\/p>  <p>  Penalties imposed upon successful conviction vary at the discretion of the court, with the Act containing provisions that an individual convicted of serious animal welfare offences may be banned by the courts from keeping animals, or have the numbers of animals they may keep restricted. <\/p>  <p>  The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 however has importantly changed the basis upon which animal owners must treat their animals and is specifically designed to allow early intervention in a much wider range of cases than the previous legislation allowed for.  Thus minor cases can be tackled before they escalate and the Act is a vehicle to encourage and educate animal keepers.  This new approach means that Authorised officers are addressing problems while they are relatively minor, reducing the risk of escalation.<\/p>  <p>  Enforcement is a complex issue, so a progressive aspect of the Act is that it does not just focus on prosecution, which is only appropriate in cases where there have been serious welfare issues that can be clearly demonstrated to the courts.  The new enforcement approach reflects the need to intervene as early as possible in animal welfare situations.  This approach is aided by The Early Warning\/Intervention System (EWS) initiative introduced by the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council involving, amongst others, my Department, the Irish Farmers' Association and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals which provides a framework within which farm animal welfare problems can be identified before they become critical or overwhelming.<\/p>  <p>  The Act provides for Animal Health &amp;amp; Welfare Notices to be issued by Authorised Officers.  This means that minor situations can be addressed at an early stage and that encouragement, guidance and best practice are introduced rather than just punishment.  It also provides for Fixed Penalty Notices to be issued in minor cases.  These alternatives to prosecution mean greater efficiency in terms of enforcement of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions of the Act are enforced by Authorised officers of my Department, An Garda Siochana, officers of Customs &amp;amp; Excise and authorised officers of ISPCA and DSPCA, along with individual officers of the Turf Club.  This approach provides a large cross section of experienced officials who are aware of welfare issues and can flag them up as and when they arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300077#WRU05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Harbours and Piers Development","counter":1228,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300077#WRU05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1229,"qnumday":469,"qnumall":"[6858\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300077#WRU05500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when applications will be invited from local authorities for the development and maintenance of piers under the fishery harbour development scheme; the amount of funding that has been allocated to the scheme in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1230,"content":"<p>The responsibility for the development, and maintenance of Local Authority owned piers, harbours and slipways rests with each Local Authority in the first instance and their parent Department,\u00a0the Department of Housing, Planning, Community\u00a0and Local Government thereafter. <\/p>  <p>  However, as part of its annual Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme,\u00a0my Department provides limited funding\u00a0to assist coastal\u00a0Local Authorities\u00a0in carrying out small\u00a0scale projects for the development and repair of piers, harbours and slipways in their ownership. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have approved funding of &euro;2m for the Local Authority element of my Departments 2018 Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure\u00a0Development Programme. <\/p>  <p>  On 31 January 2018 Local Authorities were invited to submit prioritised lists of projects for consideration.

Difficulties in harvesting fodder in some of these areas were compounded by the need to house livestock earlier than usual, resulting in additional pressure on fodder supplies over the course of the winter.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To immediately address this issue I prioritised the payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cash flow.  The European Commission agreed to his request, informed in part by the poor weather conditions of last autumn, for an advance payment of the 2017 Basic Payment Measure and Agri-environment measures.  These payments commenced after the earliest date possible which was 15th October 2017, and balancing payments issued in early December 2017.  These payments together with those issued under the Areas of Natural Constraints Measure, injected over &euro;1.3 billion into the Irish rural economy by the end of last year and are providing a very welcome boost for Irish farm families and will help to finance additional fodder purchase where necessary.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At this time I also requested Teagasc, through its farm advisory service, to identify farmers who would be most at risk of running out of fodder and provide them with support to carry out fodder budgeting on their farms and explore all viable options to ensure that they had sufficient feed for the coming winter.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As indicated earlier, the main reason that farmers\u00a0may be\u00a0short of fodder in some cases\u00a0is that poor weather\u00a0last autumn particularly, prevented harvesting of the normal requirement for hay or silage on those farms.  Therefore, in order to provide additional assistance to those livestock farmers severely affected, mainly in parts of the West and North West, I introduced a targeted Fodder Transport Support measure, operated through the Co-operative structure, to partly offset the cost of transporting fodder between those areas where it is available and those where it is scarce.  This measure applies only to fodder purchased in the period from 29 January 2018 until 20 April 2018.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While the areas identified by Teagasc as being the most affected are predominantly located in parts of the West and North-West, the measure is not county specific within the region.  As with all measures, certain criteria apply.  Farmers, in a locality within the region, identified by Teagasc as having a significant fodder shortage, having completed a fodder budgeting exercise with their FAS agricultural advisor, will be eligible to receive a financial contribution towards the costs of transport of fodder, sourced through the Co-operative system.  Only the shortfall in fodder will be eligible to receive support under the measure.  <\/p>  <p>  Teagasc assessments of whether there are significant forage shortages in specific areas is ongoing.  It is important to emphasise that this is a targeted and locally focused measure, centreing on areas of fodder scarcity that normal local trading in fodder cannot service.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This measure will provide a financial contribution of &euro;8 per standard bale of hay or straw for feeding and &euro;12 per standard bale of silage or haylage towards the additional cost of transporting the fodder from the East and South of the country to the affected areas of the West and North West. Farmers will still pay the cost of the fodder in the normal way.  To ensure that normal local trade in fodder is not disrupted, a minimum transport distance of 100 km will apply.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Financial assistance under the Fodder Transport Support Measure is payable in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408\/2013 on de minimis aid in the agricultural production sector.  No applications for support under this measure were received up to last Friday, 9 February.  Processing and\u00a0verification of applications for support will be carried out in a timely fashion.<\/p>  <p>  Full details on the operation of the measure, including application forms and Department contact details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300078#WRV01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Exports","counter":1256,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300078#WRV01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1257,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[7162\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300078#WRV01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if prime beef will be sold by Irish meat plants to China in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1258,"content":"<p>My Department has made significant progress towards securing market access in the last two years.

No decision has been made to widen representation at the Roundtable beyond the original participants.  <\/p>  <p>  While the agenda of the most recent meeting did not include a specific item on live exports, the issue was discussed during the Roundtable.  The Deputy will be aware that in the last year I have undertaken several trade missions to facilitate access to new markets and develop existing markets for Irish exports.  In the last week of January I, along with officials from my Department and Bord Bia, and representatives of Irish live cattle export companies, visited Turkey, which last year was our third largest market for the export of live cattle.  I had a successful meeting with my Turkish counterpart, Minister Fakibaba, and we agreed to set up an official contact group to facilitate detailed discussions on certification issues.\u00a0 Minister Fakibaba also confirmed that, from the end of May, private sector buyers will be permitted to import cattle for fattening.  Currently this trade is through State body ESK only.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department and I will continue to place a great importance on the cattle export trade as a means of providing an alternative market outlet for Irish cattle farmers.

Responding to significant demand, last year I reopened the BDGP programme for new entrants, reflecting the success of this programme, which targets both the environmental footprint and the profitability of the suckler herd through improving the genetic merit in participating herds. <\/p>  <p>  Whilst the Irish beef sector has been challenged by Brexit uncertainty, meeting this challenge\u00a0is assisted\u00a0by  having\u00a0in place a long term strategy for agri food sector in Food Wise 2025, which includes actions to enhance the competitiveness of the beef sector at both farmer and processor level. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300079#WRW02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sheepmeat Sector","counter":1327,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300079#WRW02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1328,"qnumday":503,"qnumall":"[7450\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300079#WRW02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he is satisfied regarding the future prospects for exports of lamb to the European Union or outside; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1329,"content":"<p>Last year, 2017, was a positive year for the Irish sheepmeat industry and total Irish sheepmeat production rose by 10 percent in 2017 to 67,000 tonnes according to the Performance and Prospects 2017\/2018 report by Bord Bia. Alongside this increase in production, exports have risen by 14 percent in volume terms to 57,000 tonnes and by 12 percent in value terms to &euro;275 million. In 2017 Ireland exported sheepmeat to 39 countries.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Within the EU, France and the UK remain the top markets for Irish sheepmeat.

The UK market grew at 11 percent, yielding &euro;51 million. Across the EU, Sweden recorded growth of 14 percent for 2017, making it Ireland&rsquo;s third largest export market for sheepmeat. The German market is in fourth position, with a 9 per cent growth rate and exports of &euro;26m. <\/p>  <p>  Bord Bia have identified Germany as an EU country with strong growth potential; Germany has a large meat-eating population base, and low consumption of sheepmeat. Industry trends indicate that lamb is growing in popularity amongst gourmet restaurants and premium retailers, and the Bord Bia strategy will target this section of the market. Among other EU markets targeted for development in the Bord Bia report are the Nordic countries, where Irish sheepmeat already accounts for over one in every five tonnes of sheep meat imported; and Belgium and Luxembourg, where Irish premium exports are growing in a competitive market. <\/p>  <p>  Outside of the EU, Bord Bia&rsquo;s recent market prioritisation exercise has identified Iran and the United Arab Emirates as markets with high potential for growth.

Tillage is a key source of seed production, grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector and as a consequence is a significant stakeholder in our agri-food industry from a supply\/food safety and sustainability viewpoint. <\/p>  <p>  Cereal production has experienced a few difficult years both in terms of grain price\u00a0and weather conditions.\u00a0Because Ireland accounts for only around 1% of EU production, grain prices here are very much affected by European and world market price shifts and tend to experience volatility. The current situation globally for the cereal sector is that it has experienced another consecutive year of high grain supplies which have again\u00a0outstripped demand. These years of oversupply continue to exert a downward pressure on the market and this of course has had a negative effect on price to the grower here. Partly as a consequence, the annual cereal area has reduced in recent years. For example, in 2017 the national cereals area reduced by about 10,000 ha to 270,000. <\/p>  <p>  However, I want to highlight the actions my Department is undertaking to assist this vital sector. In 2017 I introduced the &euro;150m Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and extended it through provision of national funding\u00a0to cover the tillage and horticulture sectors. There was a very positive reaction by farmers, including tillage farmers, to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance. \u00a0The &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Loan Scheme&rdquo; has provided a template for access to finance schemes, including the recently announced &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; for SMEs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am also examining a potential Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and for longer-term capital financing for food businesses; for which\u00a0my Department\u00a0has secured &euro;25 million of funding in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  As a further support to tillage farmers I introduced the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme under TAMS II which opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017. The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There has been a significant level of interest in investments by the tillage sector, with a total number of 775 applications  received\u00a0so far\u00a0and 637 approvals. Over &euro;1.38m has now issued in respect of 120 payment claims. Payments will continue on an ongoing basis.\u00a0This is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).<\/p>  <p>  Last year in response to the exceptionally challenging harvest conditions of September 2016 I introduced a Weather Related Crop Loss Support measure to assist farmers who experienced significant yield losses in spring cereal crops. This measure provides for a financial contribution of up to &euro;200 per hectare up to a maximum of 35 hectares per eligible applicant towards the cost of uninsured spring cereals crop losses in excess of 30% by yield.\u00a0 Particularly hard hit growers who experienced cereal crop losses in excess of 50%  benefit from an additional &euro;100 per hectare, on the same area. A total of 167 applications for support were received in the Department by the closing date of August 26 and are currently being processed. To date payments totalling &euro;314,032 have issued to 68 applicants.<\/p>  <p>  While the challenges facing the sector at this point in time are real, in Ireland we can grow  cereals with the highest yields in the world and this is an advantage we must\u00a0press home\u00a0and also look to exploit other areas under our own control. For example, my own Department provides a high quality \u00a0official crop seed certification scheme to the industry in addition to an extensive national crop variety evaluation programme.  I would also encourage tillage growers to fully implement the advice and research provided by Teagasc in relation to efficient and sustainable production of crops. My Department remains committed to assisting all involved in the sector to optimise efficiency and sustainability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300079#WRW02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dairy Sector","counter":1333,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300079#WRW02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1334,"qnumday":505,"qnumall":"[7452\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300079#WRW03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the future prospects for the dairy sector with particular reference to export markets; the extent to which the sector continues to achieve high quality and competitiveness on international markets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1335,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that Ireland&rsquo;s plans for growth in the dairy sector are formally set out in Food Wise 2025, Ireland&rsquo;s blueprint for the overall agrifood sector, where an all of sector agreed approach is set out including actions, benchmarks and targets for the dairy and other sectors.

The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters. The CFP utilises the best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas. Key features of this policy include setting Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas to deliver maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2015, where possible, and in all cases by 2020 as well as a discards ban (Landing Obligation) to be phased in over the period 2015 to 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Setting fishing levels on the basis of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) is an essential aspect of the policy. Fishing opportunities are agreed on an annual basis at the EU Fisheries Council of Ministers on the basis of a proposal produced by the European Commission that is informed by the best available scientific advice. The Common Fisheries Policy specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY. \u00a0To achieve this, the FMSY exploitation rate shall be achieved for all stocks by 2020 at the latest.\u00a0This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a marked improvement in the state of many stocks in the waters around Ireland. For example, there has been a 34% increase in our whitefish quotas off the North-West coast and a 64% increase in the Irish Sea. These are both areas that were severely depleted just five years ago. This shows that the many years of intensive, industry led conservation measures are paying off. The work done to rebuild these stocks has led to significant increases for quotas for our fleets.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of the landing obligation is to eliminate the wasteful and unsustainable practice of discarding. The first part of the landing obligation, the ban on discarding pelagic stocks such as herring and mackerel, came into effect on the 1st of January 2015.\u00a0 The landing obligation was extended to certain demersal stocks (whitefish and prawns) from the 1st of January 2016 and will be fully phased in by the 1st January 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Scientific information on the state of the fisheries exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute and is published in the Stock Book each year. The most recent Stock Book, 2017, contains 74 stocks that are subject to the scientific advice of the Marine Institute. Of those 74 stocks, 29 were assessed as being sustainably fished in 2017. This number has grown every year since 2013. This in turn leads to the number of stocks being overfished declining from 22 in 2014 to 17 in 2017.  The biomass of stocks, the quantity of mature fish in the sea, has also increased. In 2017 there were 27 stocks in a positive state above biomass trigger points. This is an increase over the preceding year of 22.<\/p>  <p>  The EU Commission has also noted that the state of fish stocks continues to improve which indicates that we are seeing the benefits of prudent and responsible fisheries management practices. <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that we will continue to make significant progress that will ensure the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processors while supporting the communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300079#WRW04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Safety Standards","counter":1348,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300079#WRW04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1349,"qnumday":510,"qnumall":"[7458\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300079#WRW04500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which Irish and EU food traceability standards continue to apply with particular reference to imports from third countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1350,"content":"<p>Primary responsibility under EU law for food safety, hygiene and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators. <\/p>  <p>  Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied.

The contracts are published on the Authority&rsquo;s website and their performance is subject to regular checks and audits.<\/p>  <p>  The collective work of the FSAI and the official agencies is set down within a comprehensive Multi Annual National Control Plan for Ireland 2012-2017, which is submitted to the European Commission and against which the FSAI and the official agencies are audited by the Commission on its implementation. <\/p>  <p>  The system of official controls covers all foods produced or marketed in the State, including imports.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating in EU Member States and third countries. Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department in accordance with the relevant EU regulations.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formerly the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance. Inspection reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website<\/p>  <p>  Imports of food of animal origin are the subject of specific authorisations before they can be placed on the market in Ireland or the EU. Imports of foods non- animal origin are subject to compliance with all relevant EU rules. These are subject to market checks during the course of routine inspections and\/or are tested as part of the annual extensive microbiological and chemical monitoring programmes.\u00a0 The FSAI also receives information on foods which may pose a danger to health from the European Commission through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300079#WRW04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1351,"content":"<p>Question No. 511 answered with Question No. 482.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alternative Farm Enterprises","counter":1352,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300079#WRW04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1353,"qnumday":512,"qnumall":"[7460\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300079#WRW04900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent of deer farming; the domestic and-or export markets for venison; the extent to which the industry can grow; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1354,"content":"<p>Deer farming in Ireland is an alternative farming enterprise which is extremely reliant on the supply and demand dynamics that affect all agricultural production systems within Ireland.\u00a0 In 1996\u00a0there were approximately 500 deer farms in Ireland with 20,000 deer,\u00a0but numbers have declined significantly since that time.\u00a0 There are now only a small number of farmers in Ireland supplying deer for meat production to cater to the niche market available. <\/p>  <p>  Its viability is dependant on producers and companies\u00a0ensuring that there are\u00a0 customers available for their product, an objective which Bord Bia assists in by identifying potential market outlets.

This management is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the State Agency with statutory responsibility for inland fisheries.  The management\u00a0policy is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 salmon rivers, river sections, estuaries, etc., has its own genetically unique stock of salmon, which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river.<\/p>  <p>  IFI is supported in its management role by Ireland&rsquo;s Standing Scientific Committee. IFI also draws on international advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).<\/p>  <p>  The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive with which Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies.  In order to align fully with the Directive and the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) principles and in view of a sharp decline in salmon stocks, the Irish Government closed mixed stock fisheries in 2007 including coastal and offshore fishing for salmon.  Harvest fisheries are now only allowed on individual river stocks which are shown to have a surplus and in estuaries where the stocks from individual rivers entering the estuary are each meeting their individual conservation limits.<\/p>  <p>  A Salmon Hardship Scheme was introduced in 2007 under which fishermen active in the commercial salmon fishery could opt to permanently\u00a0cease fishing.  In excess of &euro;25 million was allocated to the scheme to facilitate payments to fishermen, with a further &euro;5 million provided for community development projects.\u00a0 It is considered that river stocks would be in a far more perilous state if the closure of mixed stock fisheries had not been implemented.<\/p>  <p>  The number of public commercial licences available for sustainable harvesting of fisheries in 2018 is 105 while it is anticipated that some 18,000 recreational licences will issue.\u00a0 Recreational angling now comprises close to 70% of total catches.  Catch and release continues to be a feature of recreational angling with approximately 10,000 salmon released by anglers annually.<\/p>  <p>  During migration from rivers to marine feeding grounds, salmon from both rivers in Ireland and rivers in other countries travel through Ireland&rsquo;s coastal waters.  These \"mixed stocks\" pose particular difficulties for management as they contain individual fish often from a wide range of rivers some of which are below sustainable reproductive capacity.  Any deviation from current policy would be contrary to the international independent scientific advice as the &ldquo;home river&rdquo; of off-shore salmon cannot be identified and it is not possible to disaggregate the individuals or stock groups at sea.<\/p>  <p>  The conservation imperative demands that current salmon stocks are not further eroded by mismanagement or inappropriate exploitation, whether via angling, commercial fisheries in rivers inland or through the operation of indiscriminate mixed stock fisheries at sea or in estuaries.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to international agreements entered into at EU level and at NASCO and the prohibition of mixed stock fisheries is a key element of international best practice in salmon conservation and management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300080#WRX01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300080#WRX01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1387,"qnumday":523,"qnumall":"[6743\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300080#WRX01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the amount spent by his Department on photography, by photographer and-or agency, public relations or communications advice external to the media officers of his Department, by agency; the use of public relations or communications advice by an agency fully funded by his Department by agency and month, in tabular form since 1 January 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1388,"content":"<p>My Department's remit includes complex policy areas, oversight of State regulation and service provision across key strategic services such as energy and public broadcasting, and regulation of sectors such as mining and hydrocarbon exploration.

Addressing urban congestion on both the strategic road network and locally in certain locations is an important theme in the Strategy. The measures proposed are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, Dublin City Council and the NTA jointly published the Dublin City Centre Transport Study which sets out the various measures proposed for Dublin's city centre to ensure the efficient functioning of transport within the city centre. Those two bodies, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and TII, are progressively implementing the measures set out in that document to enable the continued development and growth of the city. Over the last six months, changes have been made throughout the city centre to accommodate the introduction of new Luas services. The most significant changes were the introduction of the additional bus lanes along the North and South Quays last August.  In addition, a host of other junction and traffic signal changes has been implemented.  In the case of College Green - and in advance of a determination of a proposal for a civic plaza at College Green developed by City Council - the NTA, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and Dublin City Council, have proceeded to reduce bus vehicle volumes passing through the area, which would allow the junctions and signals to function more effectively. These parties continue to keep the situation under review.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport I have secured increased funding for both public transport services and infrastructure in Budget 2018 which will allow us to address congestion and emerging capacity constraints on our public transport system across our cities including Dublin. This includes an 8% increase in funding for PSO services across the bus and rail networks in 2018 to support the delivery of these socially necessary but financially unviable public transport services. <\/p>  <p>  Following the mid-term review of the Capital Plan, Budget 2018 provides for an increase in the multi-annual capital investment for Ireland's public transport with a four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion over the period 2018-2021.

It sets out the ambition that all new cars and vans sold in Ireland from 2030 will be zero emission (or zero emission-capable).  A range of policy measures aimed at supporting the transition to low emission vehicles are set out in the National Policy Framework (<i>)<\/i>.  Furthermore, the National Mitigation Plan published in July 2017 reiterates the ambition and also includes supporting actions towards this objective <i>(<\/i><i>).<\/i><\/p><p>While remaining technology neutral in the context of promoting greater uptake of zero emission capable vehicles, the full electrification of the car fleet represents a feasible option in Ireland, where supporting grid infrastructure is developed.  Advances in battery technology, increasing competition in the market and falling vehicle costs would suggest that electrification will be the predominant low emission choice for private car, taxis and commercial vans in the short to medium term.  In this regard, under a Programme for a Partnership Government commitment &ndash; that Ireland will become a leader in the take-up of electric vehicles (EVs) - a dedicated Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce was established to consider the range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate this aim.<\/p><p>The work of the Taskforce has been divided into three work streams focusing on: Market Growth Stimuli and Visibility; Infrastructure, Energy Regulation and Pricing; and Planning Legislation, Building Regulations and Public Leadership.

In 2017, additional funding of &euro;1.5m was allocated to Tusla to support the development of services.  I was pleased to secure a further increase of &euro;1.7m for 2018, bringing the total level of funding for DSGBV services to &euro;23.8m.  This includes funding for some 60 services throughout the country, including emergency refuge and support services.<\/p><p>The development of services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence nationally is guided by the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention), as well as the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (2016-2021).  Additional funding in 2018 will support the development of enhanced DSGBV services.<\/p><p>Tusla does not have access to live data on refuge use.  Information provided by funded domestic violence services indicates that refuges consistently operate at full or near full-capacity.  Any vacancies are generally attributed to the turnover between the discharge and admission of clients.<\/p><p>Services for victims of domestic abuse in the North East region, namely counties Louth, Meath, Cavan, and Monaghan, received approximately &euro;1.4m in funding from Tusla in 2017.  Services to victims of domestic violence in counties Cavan and Monaghan are provided by Tearmann Domestic Violence Services, which received funding of approximately &euro;192,000 from Tusla in 2017 for the provision of support and advocacy services to victims.  Individuals based in West Cavan can also avail of the services of the Domestic Violence Advocacy Service for Sligo, Leitrim and West Cavan, which also provides support and advocacy services.  This service received approximately &euro;317,000 in funding in 2017.<\/p><p>Tusla has no immediate plans to provide a refuge in the Cavan\/Monaghan area.  There are three refuges situated in Drogheda, Co. Louth; Dundalk, Co. Louth; and Navan, Co. Meath, which provide emergency domestic violence accommodation to women based in the North East region.  This includes 21 family units of emergency refuge accommodation.<\/p><p>As part of its commissioning approach to developing services, Tusla carried out a number of needs analyses projects in 2017 to identify gaps in service provision and to prioritise service developments.  All future service developments, whether based in the North East region or elsewhere, will be informed by Tusla&rsquo;s commissioning approach.  In 2017, Tearmann Domestic Violence Services completed a Strategic Plan as a means of improving and developing services in counties Cavan and Monaghan.  Tusla will meet Tearmann Domestic Violence Services and other partners shortly with a view to supporting these developments.<\/p><p>The following table provides information from Tusla on the geographical spread of 147 emergency refuge family units.<table><tr><th><\/th><th>County <\/th><th>Number of Emergency Refuge Family Units <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1 <\/td><td>Clare <\/td><td>6 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2 <\/td><td>Cork <\/td><td>6 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3 <\/td><td>Donegal <\/td><td>4 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4 <\/td><td>Dublin <\/td><td>37 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5 <\/td><td>Galway <\/td><td>6 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6 <\/td><td>Kerry <\/td><td>6 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7 <\/td><td>Kilkenny <\/td><td>7 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8 <\/td><td>Kildare <\/td><td>4 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9 <\/td><td>Limerick <\/td><td>14 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10 <\/td><td>Louth <\/td><td>13 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11 <\/td><td>Mayo <\/td><td>5 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12 <\/td><td>Meath <\/td><td>5 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13 <\/td><td>Tipperary <\/td><td>4 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14 <\/td><td>Waterford <\/td><td>16 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15 <\/td><td>Westmeath <\/td><td>4 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16 <\/td><td>Wexford <\/td><td>4 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17 <\/td><td>Wicklow <\/td><td>6 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Total <\/td><td>147 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>At all times, Tusla&rsquo;s key priority is to ensure that the needs of victims and survivors of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence are met in the best way possible, with due attention to the quality, accessibility, and outcome of services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300083#WRAA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Detention Centres Expenditure","counter":1602,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300083#WRAA03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1603,"qnumday":598,"qnumall":"[7048\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300083#WRAA04000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the full year running cost of Oberstown detention centre.","asker":"1287","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1604,"content":"<p>My Department provided funding totalling\u00a0 &euro;23.139 million to support the operation of\u00a0Oberstown Children Detention Campus in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300083#WRAA04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":1605,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300083#WRAA04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1606,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[6711\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300083#WRAA04300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if correspondence from persons (details supplied) in County Cork regarding an ECCE place for their child will be examined; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1607,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the correspondence referred to by the Deputy was originally received in my Department on the 11th of January this year and a reply has issued.<\/p>  <p>  The age limits for the Early Childhood Care and Education scheme (ECCE) were set in consultation with the Early Years Education Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills to limit the age range of children beginning primary school and to ensure that children transition into primary school with their peers.

That protection will remain if the legislative proposal is adopted.<\/p>  <p>  As the law currently stands, even if a card holder volunteers their PSC, a private sector organisation would be committing an offence by accepting it as they are not a &ldquo;specified body&rdquo;.  Customer feedback is that they should be allowed to volunteer the card to non-Specified Bodies if it suits them to do so, for the purposes of ID verification such as when signing up to a utility company contract or opening an account with a financial institution.  Customers often report that private companies insist on a State-issued photographic ID such as a Passport or Driver&rsquo;s License which they might not have and which are costly.  In contrast, the PSC is free of charge.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore the legislative proposal is that non-specified bodies that accept a PSC that is offered to them voluntarily by the holder should not be prosecuted or at risk of prosecution.

In other words, the volunteering of the card is the critical issue.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, and for the sake of absolute clarity - this proposal in no way allows a private sector body to access the customer data on the card chip or on any government database - simply to view\/accept the card as a form of identity and to stop it being an offence for them to accept it.<\/p>  <p>  This measure will be beneficial to holders of the PSC, most especially those who do not hold a driving licence or a passport.

The MIS is defined by the VPSJ as &ldquo;the gross income a household needs in order to reach their minimum essential standard of living&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The VPSJ&rsquo;s Minimum Essential Standard of Living 2017 (MESL) is derived from a negotiated consensus, based on focus groups with representative households, and discussions with policy-makers and experts.  According to the VPSJ, it is a standard of living which meets an individual's \/ household's physical, psychological and social needs, calculated by identifying the goods and services required by different household types in order to meet these minimum needs.  The costs incorporate factors such as food, clothing, personal care, health, household goods, household services, communications, social inclusion, education, fuel, transport, personal costs, insurance, savings and contingencies.<\/p><p>The model developed by the VPSJ produces a minimum income standard which is dependent on whether the household is, among other factors: (i) in a rural or urban location; (ii) composed of a single working age person, a couple, a single- or two-parent family, a single pensioner or a pensioner couple; and (iii) living in private rented accommodation, social housing or is an owner-occupier.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the MESL for welfare households assumes that households are eligible for a medical card, and as such, health and insurance costs are reduced accordingly, although the cost of over-the-counter medicines and prescription charges remain.  While the model assumes that pensioners have the Free Travel pass and the Household Benefits package, it does not assume this for working age people.  It should be noted that certain working age recipients of welfare payments do qualify for Free Travel &ndash; all recipients of Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, for example.<\/p><p>The costing outlined below is based on the following assumptions: (i) The minimum income standards used for the costings are those for urban locations; (ii) Housing costs are not taken into account as these are provided for separately in the model and vary significantly depending on a household&rsquo;s circumstances.  It should be noted that weekly welfare payments do not vary depending on housing types or costs.  A range of schemes, such as Rent Supplement, the Housing Assistance Payment, Rental Accommodation Scheme and the differential rent scheme are available to assist with certain types of housing costs.<\/p><p>The Minimum Income figures used in this costing are from the Minimum Essential Standard of Living 2017<i><\/i>(the latest publication available) and its Appendices.  The costs are based on 2018 estimated recipient numbers.<\/p><p>Children<\/p><p>The cost of a child in 2017 varies depending on the child&rsquo;s age, according to VPSJ research (Appendix 3A).  The VPSJ research places the weekly cost of an infant at &euro;81.09, a pre-school child at &euro;49.19, a child in primary school at &euro;81.77 and a child in secondary school at &euro;129.27.  These costs comprise of food, clothing, household goods, health, social inclusion, transport, education, etc.  The costs do not include childcare.<\/p><p>For the purposes of this costing exercise, a weighted average increase was calculated (based on the CSO&rsquo;s 2017 estimated population distribution by age, which is the most recent available).  Taking into account the value of the qualified child increase (&euro;31.80 per week from March 2018), child benefit (&euro;140 per month) and Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance where appropriate (&euro;125 or &euro;250 per annum, depending on the age of the child), an average increase of &euro;21.22 (rounded up to &euro;21.30 per week) is required to the qualified child increase to bring the payment in line with the VSPJ&rsquo;s direct cost of a child.<\/p><p>The cost of increasing the qualified child increase by &euro;21.30 per week is &euro;393.57 million in a full year.  This includes the cost of increasing the Back to Work Family Dividend which is linked to the rate of the qualified child increase (&euro;15.18 million).<\/p><p>Working Age<\/p><p>The VPSJ research finds that the minimum income standard (MIS) for a single working age adult with no children is &euro;214.69 per week (Appendix 4A).  For the costing, all weekly working age personal rates were increased to &euro;214.70 per week.  The monetary increase varies depending on the current weekly personal rate. It should be noted that the value of increases such as the Living Alone Allowance and supplementary payments, where relevant, such as the Household Benefits Package, Fuel Allowance, and Free Travel, have not been taken into account in this costing.<\/p><p>The MIS for a working age couple with no children is &euro;327.96 (Appendix 4A), which is an increase of &euro;113.27 from the single person&rsquo;s rate.  From March 2018, the general increase for a working age qualified adult is &euro;131.40 per week.  Accordingly, the qualified adult rate was not changed in this costing.<\/p><p>The cost of increasing all working age personal payments to &euro;214.70 per week is &euro;590.74 million in a full year.  It should be noted that this cost also includes increasing the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance age-related reduced rates to &euro;214.70 per week, at a total cost of &euro;113.37 million in a full year.<\/p><p>Pensioners<\/p><p>The MIS for a single pensioner is &euro;216.38 and for a pensioner couple is &euro;261.73 (Appendix 6A).  Accordingly, there are no welfare increases required to reach the MIS for pensioners as current welfare payments are in excess of the MIS for this group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300084#WRBB06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code","counter":1690,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300084#WRBB06200"},{"type":"question","counter":1691,"qnumday":627,"qnumall":"[6922\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300084#WRBB06300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"to set out in tabular form the estimated annual cost of index-linking each payment (details supplied) to inflation over the next five years.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1692,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[6923\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300084#WRBB06400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"to set out the estimated annual cost of index-linking all weekly social welfare payments to inflation over the next five years.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1693,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[6924\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300084#WRBB06500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"to set out the estimated annual cost of index-linking all social welfare payments to inflation over the next five years.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1694,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 627 to 629, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices used in the following table is sourced from the Department of Finance&rsquo;s 2018 Budget Day book.

CIB has been allocated &euro;57.410 million to fund its activities and that of its service delivery partners for 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  In November 2014, the Board of the Citizens Information Board decided to restructure the local CIS and MABS networks.  In October 2016, the Board decided that the new structure should be regionally based.  In February 2017, the Board adopted a recommendation that the current structure of ninety three individual local companies would be changed to a sixteen regional company model, comprising eight CIS and eight MABS companies. <\/p>  <p>  The changes are being made at local company board level only.  The valuable work carried out by employees and volunteers working in CIS services and employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore.

The move to such a system has been signalled, therefore, for a significant period of time.<\/p>  <p>  As was understood at that time, and as underlined in the sentence the Deputy refers to from the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, some people are paid a higher rate under the Yearly Average system, and some will be paid a higher rate under the Total Contributions Approach.  If everyone was paid the same amount under the new system as they were under the old one, there would be little point in such a reform, and if everyone was paid either the same or more, it would add to the sustainability challenges already faced by the State pension system.  However, past and future trends show that these challenges are going to place ever-increasing burdens in the coming years on workers who fund State pensions through the PRSI system.  The proposed new TCA system strikes a balance between recognising periods outside the paid workforce while emphasising the need to maximise the paid element in the contribution conditions for pensions.<\/p>  <p>  In 1997, expenditure on state pensions was IR&pound;1.35 billion.  However, by 2017 the cost of state pensions had increased to &euro;7.27 billion.  After adjusting for inflation, the cost had nearly trebled in real terms over a period of just 20 years, despite reforms made in that time.  As the Actuarial Review the Deputy refers to pointed out, despite increases in the State pension age legislated for in 2021 and 2028, the ratio of workers to pensioners is projected to decline from 4.9 in 2015, to 2.9 in 2035, and to 2.0 by 2055.  <\/p>  <p>  While 2055 may seem far away to some, most of today&rsquo;s workers will be in receipt of the State pension at that point, and I would hope that some current pensioners may still be in payment, and so we all have a stake in ensuring the system is sustainable to that date and beyond.<\/p>  <p>  The TCA model proposed for post-2020 pensioners has yet to be decided upon, as the Government proposal will not be finalised until after a public consultation later this year.  There are a number of factors, not just the number of years required for a full pension, which influence outcomes, and I will consider very carefully the priorities identified by stakeholders in that consultation process.  Again, although the model and associated legislation hasn&rsquo;t been finalised, it is my intention that it will be possible for Home-Caring credits to be allocated in the same year as paid contributions, where appropriate.  <\/p>  <p>  The TCA model being made available for post-2012 pensioners (up to 2019) is based on 40 years, but has very significant Home-caring provisions, much more beneficial than those in the 2010 proposals, that make it more advantageous for most of those disadvantaged by the Yearly Average approach.  Take, for example, a pensioner with 18 years PRSI contributions, and who also spent 18 years in the home raising their children before 1994.  Under the Yearly Average system, that person might have received a 75% pension before 2012, or a 65% pension if they retired post-2012.  Under the 30-year model proposed under the National Pensions Framework and announced in 2010, they would qualify for a 60% pension.  However, under the TCA model being made available to post-2012 pensioners, despite it being based on a 40-year model, they could qualify for a 90% pension, as a result of the recognition given to her home-caring periods.<\/p>  <p>  There are others who would not benefit, and who would attract a higher payment under the current approach.  For example, under the Yearly Average approach, someone who has already built up substantial state and private pensions in another country before moving to Ireland in their mid-50s, can built up a maximum rate pension in Ireland also, with just 10 years of contributions.  This is clearly inequitable compared to the previous example, and while such people will continue to have access to the means-tested State pension (non-contributory) if they need it, which can be paid at up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate, their SPC entitlement will be lower under TCA than it would be at present.  <\/p>  <p>  It is through making savings from elimination of such anomalies that it is possible to improve benefits for those who, to date, have had insufficient recognition of their contributions in and out of the home.<\/p>  <p>  I want to clarify, in response to one of the Deputies specific questions that there has not been any change to the State pension (contributory) in terms of means testing.  As before, where someone has a SPC entitlement, they will be entitled to at least that amount, regardless of their means.  They will also continue to have access to the alternative of the State pension (non-contributory), which is means tested, if that SPC entitlement is lower, and they will be paid whichever is the higher amount.  This is not a change. <\/p>  <p>  The importance of this safety net is crucial, and the level it is set at clearly informs policy regarding other schemes such as contributory pensions.  However I have seen it misleadingly claimed in recent months that some pensioners are expected to live on &euro;155 weekly, or less, even where they have no other means aside from the State pension.  Such claims cause anxiety for many approaching pension age, and it is important for those with very few contributions, and with minimum additional means, to be assured that they will have an adequate pension in old age.  Data from CSO and Eurostat show that the state pension system has been very successful in this regard, and demonstrate that a person of pension age in Ireland is considerably less likely to be in poverty than those of working age, who currently fund the system through their PRSI contributions and their taxes.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300085#WRCC05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Allowance Payments","counter":1751,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300085#WRCC06000"},{"type":"question","counter":1752,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[7277\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300085#WRCC06100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a fuel allowance payment will be reinstated for a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1753,"content":"<p>Fuel allowance is a means tested payment, payable to people who either live alone or only with certain other qualified people. <\/p><p>This gentleman was awarded Disability Allowance from 02 September 2015.

Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.  Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.<\/p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department.

For certain projects, including Transport Infrastructure Ireland projects, housing capital projects, local enterprise initiatives and landfill remediation work, central funding can be availed of to fund the costs of additional staff.<\/p>  <p>  The funding system for local authorities is a complex one, as authorities derive their income from a variety of sources including commercial rates, charges for goods and services, Local Property Tax (LPT) as well as funding from Government Departments and other bodies.  The purpose for which discretionary income is used is a matter for the elected members of the local authority. Elected members have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which includes adopting the annual budget.  Accordingly, it is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. <\/p>  <p>  Local retention of LPT began in 2015 and is now established as an important source of funding for the local government sector, thereby reducing reliance on central funding. In accordance with decisions taken by Government regarding the distribution of LPT, every local authority has a minimum level of funding available to it, known as the baseline.  There are variances across the country in terms of LPT levels but it is important that all local authorities receive at least this baseline level of funding to ensure they can deliver services.  For 2017 onwards, an upward adjustment was made to the LPT baseline of each local authority, to include an additional amount equivalent to the Pension Related Deduction (PRD) income retained by local authorities in 2014. The inclusion of PRD in increased LPT funding baselines helps protect local authority income in the future.  It means that, from 2017 onwards, local authorities do not retain PRD locally, thus reversing the previous approach.  This was designed to negate the effects of declining PRD income being retained by local authorities from 2016 onwards as a consequence of the implementation of National pay agreements.<\/p>  <p>  Commercial rates account for over a third of local authority income.  The Government has decided to proceed with legislation to improve the administration of commercial rates, which will enable local authorities to achieve higher rates of collection and lower levels of arrears and debt, leading to increases in locally generated revenue.<\/p>  <p>  My Department works with all local authorities to ensure the local government sector can meet existing and emerging challenges.  Matters relating to LPT allocation methods and baselines for future years will be reviewed as necessary and appropriate. All such funding issues have to be considered within the parameters of the national fiscal and budgetary situation and the competing priorities presenting themselves at wider Governmental level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300086#WRDD02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seaweed Harvesting Licences","counter":1780,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300086#WRDD02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1781,"qnumday":660,"qnumall":"[6708\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300086#WRDD02800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1971 of 11 September 2017, the status of plans to sell the harvesting rights of kelp disk seaweed to a company (details supplied); if this deal has already gone through; and the way in which it will affect the County Clare coastline.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1782,"content":"<p>The role of my Department in regard to seaweed harvesting is to regulate the activity in accordance with the Foreshore Act 1933.

The Place Finder Service has been successfully utilised by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) across the Dublin local authorities since February 2015, with more than 2,000 households currently being supported by the Homeless HAP scheme. A similar service began operating in Cork City in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In order to further assist homeless households in exiting emergency accommodation the Homeless HAP Place Finder Service is now available in each of the 31 local authorities.  All local authorities are now being provided with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation via the HAP scheme. <\/p>  <p>  From available data, at the end of Q4 2017, approximately 22% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefitting from the additional flexibility that was provided to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limits. When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region is removed, 16.7% of households nationally were benefitting from the additional flexibility. In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being applied was 15.7% above rent limits provided. In the case of Cork City Council, at the end of Q4, 2017, 34.3% of households had benefitted from additional discretion with the average rate being 14% above the rent limits provided.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and I are constantly monitoring HAP data, as well as other key information relating to the private rental market. Indications are that the current HAP rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs. Increasing the HAP rent limits in particular local authority areas could have further inflationary effects on the private rented sector, which could have a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.<\/p>  <p>  In cases where a tenant, currently on a local authority waiting list, wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area, I have directed local authorities to provide that HAP tenants continue to be dealt with by their originating local authority. However, the rent limits will be those that apply in the local authority where the property is situated. The originating local authority will engage with the relevant new local authority to facilitate eligible requests for inter-authority movement. Where homeless households have sourced or been assisted by the Place Finder Service in sourcing accommodation outside the Dublin area, the relevant rate of support is based on the rent limits that apply in the local authority where the property is situated. The DRHE have been advised to consult with the new local authority in relation to the appropriate level of support that should be provided. However, the Place Finder Service can still pay a deposit and rent in advance on behalf of the tenant.<\/p>  <p>  In order to maintain the equitable treatment of all housing applicants, inter-authority movement for HAP applicants is based on the current social housing eligibility income bands, i.e. movement will only be facilitated across local authorities with income bands that are equal or higher; or where shared areas of choice are already operated.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is currently operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.

The RLS was established on a pilot basis in Waterford and Carlow local authorities in October 2016 and expanded nationwide from 23 February 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant dwellings who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their dwellings up to the required standard for rental property. Subject to the suitability of the dwelling for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an approved housing body (AHB). <\/p>  <p>  Provisional 2017 outputs, across the range of delivery methods available to local authorities and approved housing bodies, were published on 15 January 2018 and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<\/p>  <p>  www.housing.gov.ie\/housing\/rebuilding-ireland\/social-housing-delivery-2017-ministers-statement.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently validating data from local authorities in order to report detailed progress by local authority on the RLS in the final quarter of 2017. This will be published shortly. However, I can confirm that at the end of 2017, a total of 820 applications had been received under the scheme. Local authorities were engaging with the property owners in relation to 573 properties, 31 agreements for lease had been signed and 9 homes had been delivered and tenanted. A detailed breakdown of the RLS scheme data up to end Q3 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <\/p>  <p>  www.housing.gov.ie\/housing\/social-housing\/social-and-affordble\/overall-social-housing-provision.<\/p>  <p>  While my Department is currently finalising detailed output data across each of the social housing delivery programmes in 2017, it is already clear that the RLS has not yet delivered the level of new social housing homes envisaged. I have reviewed the operation of the scheme, as part of the review of Rebuilding Ireland, and I have concluded that the scheme has significant potential but there are areas where it can be improved to make it more attractive and effective. At the Housing Summit held on 22 January 2018, local authority Chief Executives were advised that, from 1 February 2018, a number of key changes are being made to the scheme. These include:<\/p>  <p>  -  a reduction in the minimum lease term required from 10 to 5 years;<\/p>  <p>  -  increasing the proportion of market rent available to property owners where they take on more responsibilities under the tenancy, meaning that up to 92% of market rent will be available; and<\/p>  <p>  -  provision of additional funding for property owners, over and above the current &euro;40,000 limit, where the dwelling is a bedsit type dwelling being brought into compliance with the Standards for Rented Houses Regulations and made available for social housing. <\/p>  <p>  In total, my Department spent &euro;196,385 on the Repair and Leasing Scheme in 2017. I am making &euro;32 million available for the scheme in 2018 and I expect local authorities and approved housing bodies to continue to implement the scheme locally and to achieve the target of 800 new properties this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300087#WREE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water and Sewerage Schemes","counter":1833,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300087#WREE01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1834,"qnumday":680,"qnumall":"[7306\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300087#WREE01700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if relief measures will be put in place for members of group water schemes in view of the discontinuation of the domestic water charging regime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1835,"content":"<p>In late 2017, my Department conducted a review of group water scheme subsidies. The review involved discussions with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the representative body of the group water sector.  Discussions concluded in December, when I approved revised subsidy levels.  The new subsidy arrangements, endorsed by a special delegate conference of the Federation on 13 December 2017, came into effect on 1 January 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The changes implement the recommendation contained in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services (JOCFFDWS), endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in April 2017, that there be equity of treatment and equivalent financial support between households using public water services and those availing of private water services. The subsidy scheme is demand-led and available to all eligible group water schemes irrespective of county location.  <\/p>  <p>  The revised subsidy levels are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  1) For the annual subsidy towards the operation and maintenance costs of group water schemes providing a supply of water for domestic purposes (known as &lsquo;Subsidy A&rsquo;): <\/p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house in private group water schemes has increased from &euro;140 per household to &euro;231. An increased maximum subsidy of &euro;281 per household is available for small schemes of less than 100 houses that are willing, in the interests of providing in the long-term a more sustainable water supply to their members, to progress towards rationalisation or amalgamation with other schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house for public group water schemes has increased from &euro;70 per household to &euro;115.  These are schemes that supply their members with water that is provided by Irish Water.<\/p>  <p>  The portion of costs than can be recouped by group water schemes has also increased.  Typically up to 60% of costs have been covered by the subsidy payments.  This has increased to 85%.  There are also changes and simplifications to how these costs are assessed.<\/p>  <p>  2) For the additional subsidy that is paid towards the costs of group water schemes that have long-term Operation and Maintenance Contracts (for example, as part of a Design Build Operate project) for the delivery of water (known as &lsquo;Subsidy B)&rsquo;: <\/p>  <p>  There has been an increase in the level of volumetric costs incurred by group water schemes operating under these contracts that is recoupable, from 60% to 85%.  This will allow for a greater portion of costs to be included within the subsidy payment.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, my Department is currently finalising proposals to increase the level of grant support for users of private wells, details of which I will be announcing shortly. <\/p>  <p>  Separate to the initial review of group water scheme subsidy levels and also in fulfilment of the JOCFFDWS recommendations, I will shortly be establishing a working group to conduct a wider review of investment needs in rural water services. The review will focus on issues such as governance, supervision and monitoring of the sector, and capital investment requirements.  It is anticipated that this group would engage with relevant stakeholders and will aim to complete its work by mid-2018.<\/p>  <p>  Cognisance will be taken in this regard of any required measures to support the implementation of the finalised River Basin Management Plan 2018-2021, which I plan to finalise and publish early this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300087#WREE01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Charges","counter":1836,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300087#WREE01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1837,"qnumday":681,"qnumall":"[7307\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018021300087#WREE02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if an initial free water allowance for agricultural holdings that are subject to the water charging regime will be introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1838,"content":"<p>Farming households using a public water supply, like other domestic users, do not pay domestic water charges, save for excessive use as provided for in the Water Services Act 2017.
