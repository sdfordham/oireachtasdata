According to the Court of Appeal ruling, the Minister is &quot;obliged to consider&quot; these rights before making a decision on the application for permission to stay here.  Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan said that the Minister, &quot;was obliged to consider the Article 8 rights contended for on behalf of the applicants&quot;.

The T&aacute;naiste understands proceedings have issued in approximately 70 similar cases.  Part of the issue with regard to this complex matter relates to whether existing legislation is sufficiently clear on whether an application under section 4 of the Immigration Act 2004 needs to be made by a person seeking to vary an existing permission, which is current, or whether such an application can be made by a person who is out of permission.<\/p> <p>The Court of Appeal judgment raises the issue of whether Article 8 rights under the European Convention on Human Rights should be considered as part of the application process.  The State's clear position, which is in keeping with the jurisprudence of the Irish courts and the European Court of Human Rights, is that consideration of Article 8 rights is only required when a person applies to enter the State or when he or she is being considered for removal from the State as part of the deportation process.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Such a consideration would take place under a different statute, section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and as part of a fundamentally different process.

This case concerns two families because there was a related appeal judgment that was given on the same day in the Luximon case.  In the case I spoke about, the Balchand case which is under appeal, the couple involved had a son who was born in Ireland in 2009 and who had lived his entire life in the State.  He had never even visited Mauritius - the original home country of his parents - and so on.  The Minister of State has clarified for me that there are 70 similar cases in which proceedings have now issued.  That is a large number of families who are now, as the Minister of State has said, in a position similar to that of Irish people who are undocumented in America.  At a time when we are protesting - rightly in my view - about the unfair treatment by President Trump towards undocumented individuals and towards Irish citizens in the US who are currently in such a difficult and uncertain position, it would behove Ireland to look at its own policy and to look at the wider implications.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath has said that the T&aacute;naiste is giving further consideration to the wider impacts of the case.  I know that the rule from 2011 capped at seven years the total time student permission may be granted, but that is quite a lengthy period and it is very likely that people - as did the couple in the Balchand case - will set down roots, become fully integrated and have a family here.  As pre-2011 entrants to the State, it would be a fair approach to state these are people in respect of whom the application to remain could have been granted.  Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan was very clear that in considering the application as to whether to renew permission to stay, the T&aacute;naiste was bound to consider the constitutional principles and the principles as set out in the European Convention on Human Rights.  The judge clearly set it out that it was at that stage of the process when the T&aacute;naiste would be bound, and indeed later in the process.  I will say no more, given that the matter is under appeal, but I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to bring back to the T&aacute;naiste my concern that in appealing this case, the State and the Government are perhaps overlooking the wider implications and the detrimental and negative impact this sort of uncertainty will have for so many families, potentially 70 families, whose status is now uncertain as a result of the State's appeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#C00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I totally accept the importance of raising this particular case in light of the broader debate.

The T&aacute;naiste also recognises there is a need to address the issues highlighted by the court judgment in a structured way that maintains the integrity of the immigration system, while addressing the needs on a case-by-case basis.

I will offer one of many examples from people in my constituency who have come to me.  In November 2016 I heard from a woman who applied for an emergency medical card.  We went to the primary care unit in Carlow.  The forms were completed and presented along with a letter from the doctor outlining the diagnosis and the medical history as well as bank statements.<\/p> <p>The person started treatment within days of submitting the application.  Following the initial application, the medical card section was contacted and asked about the status of this application.  We were told that further information was requested.  The process is like going for a mortgage.  First, those responsible wanted proof of the mortgage and a statement from the bank with details of monthly payments made.  This was requested despite bank statements showing the money going out of the account.  The officials still needed confirmation that the person was paying the mortgage.  A letter from the mortgage protection provider with details of cover and how much was paid monthly was sought.  A copy of the car log book and proof of address of place of work was sought to work out travel expenses.  A copy of the house insurance policy, including the details of fire and contents cover was sought.  Confirmation of payment for insurance cover was sought.  A copy of the insurance policy showing cover for fire and contents was sought.  Completed medical forms from other members of the family detailing medical information to be completed by the GP were sought.  A further letter from the oncologist indicating that he supports the application for an urgent medical card was sought.<\/p> <p>This person is still undergoing treatment.  Under normal circumstances, sourcing and submitting all this information would take time, never mind during treatment while caring for three children as well as producing all this information.<\/p> <p>That information was submitted in November.  This week, we were told that if all the information was not submitted by 28 February, the application would be closed.  That is a disgrace.<\/p> <p>This is the process for what we call an emergency medical card.  This is what a person undergoing cancer treatment has to submit.  The person in question is in the middle of radiation treatment.  She is going up every day to get treatment and she stays over.  The cost for car parking is &euro;8 for the day.  That is another issue.  This is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>I have applied for cards for several people seeking palliative care medical cards.  That is a separate issue.  People can get them quickly and I am aware of that because I have got them.  Those involved are very good with palliative care.  However, the system is falling down in the case of emergency medical cards and this needs to be changed.<\/p> <p>I will outline another bugbear of mine.  People who have medical cards still have to pay.  Every time a person goes to the doctor for blood tests, that person has to pay &euro;20.  That is unacceptable.  Let us suppose a person has a medical card and is undergoing treatment.  That person has to pay &euro;20 for blood tests.<\/p> <p>There is a broader issue at play.  I call on the Minister of State to bring this back to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and to ask for emergency medical cards to be issued on the same basis as palliative care medical cards - they are the same.  As I said, the woman in question is getting treatment but she has been waiting for four months for her medical card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#D00600","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Murnane O'Connor for her contribution and for raising this important issue.<\/p> <p>While we have made significant progress in the treatment of cancer in Ireland, a cancer diagnosis obviously has a major impact on the patient both physically and psychologically.  A cancer diagnosis can also have social as well as financial impacts.  The diagnosis often has a significant effect on a patient's family and friends.<\/p> <p>I have met many cancer patients and their families during my time in the Department of Health.  This has given me a profound appreciation of how difficult and varied the effects of a cancer diagnosis can be.<\/p> <p>Eligibility for a medical card is determined by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and the partner or dependants.

The Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility, the Keane report, was accepted by the Government and forms the basis for the current operation of the medical card system.  The report explicitly considered the potential for the award of medical cards on the basis of a person's medical condition and recommended that a person's means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card; the panel concluded that it would not be feasible, desirable nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order as a means of determining medical card eligibility and that a financial assessment remains the most equitable method of allocating scarce resources in the health sector.<\/p><p>Following the expert group report, a clinical advisory group was established by the director general of the HSE to assist in the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.  Now, as a result of this group's deliberations, the HSE, when assessing a person for a medical card, has procedures in place which as well as looking at income have regard to their overall financial position, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p><p>The HSE also has a system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care they cannot afford.  Emergency medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details.  Where a patient is terminally ill in palliative care, the nature of the terminal illness is not a deciding factor in the issue of an emergency medical card in these circumstances and no means test applies.  Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure the person gets the card as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>To sum up, the HSE is ensuring a more integrated and sensitive approach towards the processing of medical card applications, including those from persons with a diagnosis of cancer involving greater exchange of information between the central assessment office and the local health offices in relation to people&rsquo;s circumstances and need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#D00700","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that considerable work has been done in the area of medical cards but there are still concerns.

Therefore, what he said in that respect is misinformation.  It is tough enough for people who are suffering with cancer or who have other illnesses and who are trying to manage their illnesses without having to fight with the HSE to get their entitlements.  People's applications for medical card, whose incomes are only &euro;2 or &euro;3 over the threshold for qualification for a medical card, are being refused on a regular basis.  Some leniency needs to be shown but that is not happening.  I firmly believe that there are people who are genuinely entitled to a medical card but their applications are being refused because their income is slightly over the threshold.  However, the issue of emergency medical cards needs to be addressed.  I compliment the medical card section of the HSE on the granting for medical cards for those in  palliative care.

These parents are getting older, however.  I know of several families where the parents are in their late 70s and early 80s and who drive their children to the facilities provided by Cope in Cork city.  They are coming under more pressure as they cannot drive in the same way as they could before and, sometimes, they cannot do it every day.  They are finding there is no support mechanism for them if they stop taking their son or daughter to these facilities.  Another issue is if their child is over 18 years of age, no allowance is made for them either.<\/p><p>This is an issue that is beginning to come up more and more.  I have come across cases nearly every second week in my constituency clinics.  It is a matter which needs to be examined.  Can a system be put in place to support those parents who have been so good, in the sense they saved the State significant amounts of money through the years?

I welcome the opportunity to outline the current position on the issue of transport for people with disabilities attending HSE-funded day services.  Over the past 12 months, I have visited and met over 4,000 people with physical and intellectual disabilities in many services across the country.  Recently, I visited the Cope Foundation in Cork and met the parents and families of its clients.<\/p> <p>The provision of transport to adults with a disability attending HSE-funded day services is not a core health service.  I am fully aware, however, of how important transport is for people with disabilities who attend day services.  As a general rule, public transport should be used in all circumstances where it is an option.  This is in keeping with the principle of mainstreaming with a clear focus on ensuring persons with a disability have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible.<\/p> <p>It must be noted that, in general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the free travel pass, meaning there should be no additional cost burden at an individual level.  New developments being put in place to meet the service needs of school leavers with disabilities who require continuing HSE-funded supports each year will be located as close as possible to where people reside, to reduce the travel time for each person and enable them to be more connected with their local community.  Funding is not provided to service providers for the transportation of young people to and from day services.<\/p> <p>However, when all other options are exhausted and people cannot avail of a day service because they do not have transport to attend, the service provider is advised to use some of the service money to cover the transport costs.  This may result in the provision of a reduced quantum of service to the service user.  However, it is also my experience that the HSE will do its best to provide transport in certain cases without reducing services.<\/p> <p>While day service users in receipt of disability allowance are automatically entitled to the free travel pass, I am also conscious of the fact that the travel pass is not worth much if there are no buses on which to use it.  This may be the case in rural areas.

The HSE also intends to liaise with the National Transport Authority and disability service providers to explore ways in which the authority&rsquo;s services could assist people with disabilities.  I understand that the National Transport Authority has a total of 17 transport co-ordinating units called Local Link, which provide safe, secure and reliable public transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland through a combination of scheduled public transport services and door-to-door services. The HSE plans to explore the opportunities these units may provide to people with disabilities to access day services and allow them to fully participate in the social, educational and economic life of their own local communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#F00200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Then one has a huge cost in that as well.  I am concerned that numbers are growing.  We need to plan very quickly for it and to do so within the next 12 months.

We have been very fortunate in Cork with all the services we have but there are major challenges and we need to look at them.<\/p> <p>Finally, the interesting thing with vehicle registration tax is that, while it is available for someone getting a vehicle who has registered a vehicle in his or her own name, there is no allowance of any description for parents who are providing transport for their child.

I welcome his comments on the setting up of this group and I accept his point that we need to move on this particular issue on transfer for people with disabilities and that we need to deal with it over the next 12 months.  I also want to say something on the strong economic argument which is used regularly with service providers.  I came across one service provider recently which gets a grant of &euro;90 million a year and yet it was looking at cutting back transport services to very complex young adults with physical and intellectual disabilities.  That is not acceptable to me and we told it to go back to the drawing board and to not cut transport services.  We told it that if it wants to do other reorganisation to its finances it can go ahead but to not do that.  That goes on.<\/p> <p>The Senator made a very strong and important point and my plan is to try to get services in the local community as near to families as possible.  The Senator's argument, which I will relay to my officials and the people in the HSE, is that if we do not provide transport for these young adults with these intellectual and physical disabilities and if they go into residential care, they will actually cost the taxpayer more money.  That is a very valid economic argument.  In addition, the human rights argument - which I have always pushed very strongly - is that the best idea is to try and get services running from their home to the service provider.  Children and young adults in rural areas have to be looked at as well.  At present, I am looking at and working closely with this group and I am going to deal with this issue.  I will deal with the issue of the high cost of transport as well.  The Senator mentioned a figure there related to the issue of mobility and families who bring disabled children or teenagers around the place.  I am considering legislation for transport mobility and there are in the region of 4,700 such people in the wider community.  These are all issues that we have to deal with.  As the fellow says, if we get two or three years to deal with these things, I will be delighted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#G00300","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#G00400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487082600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.05 p.m. and resumed at 3.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1487082600,"counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#N00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The Order of Business is No. 1, Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 [Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il] Report and Final Stages to be taken at 4.45 p.m. and to conclude no later than 9 p.m., if not previously concluded, by the putting of one question, which shall in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#N00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>It would be remiss of me not to mention the Maurice McCabe controversy.

We hear of difficulties in the inner city with drug and crime gangs in the Crumlin area.  The children attending this school come specifically from the area of Drimnagh and Crumlin.  What is most shocking is that when the boys and girls attending the Assumption junior school proceed to secondary school, the boys go on to Drimnagh Castle secondary school which has been given DEIS status and the girls go on to the Assumption secondary school in Walkinstown, which has not been given DEIS status.  This is an anomaly, which discriminates between boys and girls.  The boys in Drimnagh Castle are getting a better education than the girls attending the Assumption secondary school.

The Harold's Cross Greyhound Stadium is an historic venue in Dublin and opened in 1928.  It is a very important part of the local history and community in Harold's Cross and in the wider Crumlin and Drimnagh area.  In addition to the contribution it makes to the local community, it also makes money.  It makes financial sense to maintain the track.  It is not operating at a loss.  The decision to close the track, and its potential sale, has infuriated both me and the Dublin Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association, which has been protesting against the sale since the news first broke.  I would ask the House to support the Dublin Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association and call for the decision to sell the track at Harold's Cross to be reversed.  It is a short-term decision that will damage the local community and greyhound racing in the long term.

Their quest for truth, transparency, openness and honesty on how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na serves this State is deeply appreciated by all right-minded citizens.  This has been a long and painful journey spanning over three Governments, led by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, starting out when Maurice McCabe raised concerns about corrupt practices in the hierarchy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2008, and then continuing publicly when he and Garda John Wilson brought their concerns into the public domain.

In first year, boys are 32% fitter than girls, but this increases to 41% in fourth year and so the trend continues.<\/p> <p>The researchers found that a significant proportion of girls drop out of sport for social and academic reasons as they make the transition through education.

All of us in the House support Sergeant Maurice McCabe and his family.  He has been treated scandalously by the State and its agencies.  The conduct of the Government in recent days has drawn the public's attention to the dysfunctional arrangements made in the administration of the State.  It has expedited or shortened the lifetime of the Government because it is very difficult to see how the public can continue to have trust in a Government that has behaved in the way it has in the past few days.  We have had several contradictory statements from Ministers and I understand the opportunity has not yet been taken in the Houses to correct the record.  The people need to have confidence in the Ministers who are administering the State.  Because of the way they have behaved recently that certainly is not the case.  It would be useful if the three Ministers in question which include the Taoiseach wee to set the record straight on what they knew and when.  Is it the case, in fact, that some people knew an awful lot about this matter and then decided to forget it?  In the meantime, Sergeant McCabe and his family should be at the forefront of our concerns.  As I said, the Labour Party fully supports the idea of a full public inquiry or tribunal in order that these matters could be aired in public.  Given the experience of Sergeant McCabe and the O'Higgins' examination of the issues involved, it is fair to say Sergeant McCabe would not have any confidence in an examination of matters of this importance that would take place behind closed doors.  As parliamentarians, we should acknowledge and reflect on the seriousness of a State agency having an open file on allegations of child abuse against an individual, as well as a file on his family, and this information being propagated with impunity by others.  I would not be surprised if we were not just dealing with matters before a tribunal of inquiry but also, potentially, looking at a criminal investigation at some point down the line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#P00600","speaker":"1398","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I wish to raise an issue I have raised previously in the House - the chronic and severe shortage of substitute teachers in the State's schools, which issue has been to the forefront in the media in recent days.  The situation has become so bad that it is anticipated that some schools may actually have to close because they have no other choice as they have no substitute teachers to stand in.  The Irish National Teachers Organisation estimates that, on average, 800 to 1,000 substitute school teachers are needed on a day-to-day basis, but currently there are only 30 stand-by teachers available for 3,300 schools.  That is a chronic figure and illustrates how bad the system is.  It is at breaking point and principals may have no choice but to close schools.  Recruitment fairs are very much in vogue in third level colleges.  Very attractive packages are offered to young teachers coming out of college.  In places such as Abu Dhabi and in the Middle East generally tax free packages are offered, plus perks, to individuals willing to go there on 12-month or two-year contracts.  That is what the State is competing with.  People are voting with their feet and taking up these contracts.  When a school cannot find a substitute teacher, a number of things happen.

That matter is seriously concerning, but let us deal with it on another day.<\/p> <p>I second the amendment to the Order of Business from Senator Conway-Walsh.  St. Valentine's night of 36 years ago is burned into our collective memories.  A total of 48 young people on the north side of Dublin never came home.  They lost their lives in the Stardust fire.  These young people lost their lives and hundreds of their friends and lovers were injured horrifically.  Words cannot fully describe the extraordinary pain visited on the affected families, including mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters, for the past 36 years as a result of that dreadful night in 1981.  The journey these families have had to go through began then and continues to this day.  It has included the flawed Keane report of 1982, which added much pain to the families, and the Coffey review of 2009, which contained an unpublished recommendation for a new inquiry.<\/p> <p>The Government now has the power to take action and help discover the truth.  Moreover, it has the power to create a commission of investigation.  The State claims it needs new evidence.  The families have handed over that new evidence.  The State can now go ahead and attempt to uncover the truth of this murky night in our collective history.<\/p> <p>The families of those who died long before their time, those who were injured physically and psychologically and their parents and sisters continue to vigorously pursue the truth for their loved ones.  We should all be ashamed of the inaction of this Government and previous Governments, as well as the thwarting and procrastination in respect of this horrific tragedy visited on young people from working-class communities in this city.  They are seeking justice and we need to assist them in every way possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#R01400","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I agree with some of the sentiments expressed.

If that is the standard in how an extremely serious report is prepared, then very difficult questions must be answered regarding what is a very dangerous way of completing something which could lead to a full investigation of a person and which could involve criminal prosecution.  There are many questions to be answered in this matter.  There are also many questions to be answered as to why it has taken so long for this issue to be dealt with within Tusla and why something of this nature has been left to fester.  That is exactly what has happened.  It has been left to fester within both the Garda and Tusla.  The sooner the public tribunal is set up and the issues are fully aired, the better.  If information comes through that people were involved deliberately in trying to muddy a person's name and destroy that person's family, those who were party to that type of business must be prosecuted and the appropriate penalty imposed on them for ruining someone's life.

While it is fantastic that these homes will be created, many of the people who will buy and rent homes in Cherrywood will want to use the Luas.  We need a wider debate, not just about the Luas service to Cherrywood but also about mass transit generally in Dublin.  Its transport infrastructure is creaking and needs to be tackled soon.

On the way to Dublin this morning I was listening to the radio station Shannonside Northern Sound.  Last Sunday there was a Gaelic minor football match in Cavan.  A lady, the parent of two of the players involved, gave her account of racist abuse suffered at the match which effectively ended in mayhem.  I understand the GAA will deal with the matter.  It was harrowing to hear, however, that in this day and age there are still racism and sectarianism in sport.  The GAA has done a lot of work in this regard, with the FAI, under the Show Racism the Red Card programme.  This is, however, a complex problem and there are spectators and players who think they can get away with it.  This is a wake-up call.  I was taken aback by the account of the lady in question who, while passionate about the GAA, would not like her children to play again.  While the GAA will deal with the matter correctly, there is no place for sectarianism and racism in sport, especially among young people.  I blame the parents who believe they have a right to use racist and sectarian chants.  We must ensure we put a stop to it.  During the years, as a former Glasgow Celtic supporter, I remember attending Old Firm matches between Celtic and Rangers in Glasgow which is infamous for sectarianism.  The two clubs involved, with the Scottish FA, the Northern Ireland FA and the English FA, have done much to work together to deal with the problem.  While the incident to which I am referring happened at a Gaelic football ground, we need to do much more to ensure there will be no place for sectarianism and racism in sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#T00200","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I formally second Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's proposed amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p> <p>Tusla has been spoken about.

The picket line is at Kerry Foods in Charleville.  The picket line resembled something from Wapping in the 1980s.  We had multiple cameras installed by the company.  We had a whole host of heavies and security guards present.  Last week, Kerry Foods bused in strike breakers from Britain for the day to replace workers on a legal trade dispute.

It behoves everybody, particularly those in the Houses of the Oireachtas to let that work take its course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#V00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#V00400","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>We have ideas and suggestions.

Prices in the rental sector in Galway have almost doubled since 2012.  I was very proud to stand yesterday with the Galway Housing Action Group, which is drawing attention to the issues surrounding homelessness in Galway city.  It is quite ironic, then, that I have been sent documentation concerning irregularities in the allocation of housing under the affordable social housing scheme that has been operated by Galway City Council.  According to the documents I have been sent, former senior management officials were allocated housing under the scheme who did not fit its criteria.  That a retired head of a particular department whose income would be publicly known to be in excess of the limits allowable under the affordable social housing scheme was given a house is a very serious matter.  Furthermore, I am told he already had a primary residence prior to purchasing the house.  I am informed that other senior officials were awarded houses in excess of their needs as well - for example, three-bedroomed houses for single occupancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#V00900","speaker":"1377","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I think a Commencement matter concerning this issue has been tabled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#W00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":98,"content":"<p>It is believed that these senior officials cherry-picked the higher-spec houses and inevitably breached the waiting list for these sought-after dwellings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#W00300","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Does the Senator want two bites at the cherry?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#W00400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>This is a very serious issue of allegations of officials-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#W00500","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I am just pointing out that a Commencement matter concerning the issue has been tabled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#W00600","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>My understanding was that it had been-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#W00700","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>The Senator's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#W00800","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":104,"content":"<p>-----turned down as a Commencement matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#W00900","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":105,"content":"<p>It has not been selected for tomorrow but it may be selected another day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#W01000","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>It is an issue that needs to be brought to the floor of the House.

The Leader will know that I attended the Government's all-Ireland civic dialogue on Brexit yesterday.  The purpose of yesterday's meeting was to focus on the implications of Brexit for the human rights aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.  These are very critical and harmonious rights and entitlements right across the entire island.  I took great heart from the civic dialogue and the broad range and comprehensive number of groups and organisations present, some with great experience and the wherewithal regarding the issue of human rights and equality to come together to concentrate and focus minds on these important issues.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, on this occasion and the Government.  I thought it was particularly important that yesterday's meeting focused on the Good Friday Agreement and aspects thereof because, as we move ahead in a post-Brexit scenario, what is becoming increasingly clear is that the decision by voters in England and Wales to remove my part - the northern part - of Ireland from the EU against our will is going to have direct implications for the Good Friday Agreement.  Not only are the Governments of the North and South co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, but what is probably more important and more open to challenge is the fact that the people of this State overwhelmingly endorsed with their vote the Good Friday Agreement.  Unlike other learned colleagues in the House, there are those of us who can see clearly that there is a direct subversion of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement as a result of this vote.  We have a British Government and a British Parliament that, as late as last week, when debating the Bill to trigger Article 50, flat-out rejected any amendment that took into consideration the unique situation put forward as a result of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>The European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs is telling us very clearly that Brexit will alter the Good Friday Agreement.

I appeal to all Members to be cognisant of these facts.  People are presumed innocent until proven otherwise and, therefore, everything that we say or do is important.<\/p> <p>All of us in this House share the view that Sergeant McCabe, his wife, Lorraine, and family deserve justice.  There are many strands to this unedifying story.  There are questions to be answered.  It is incumbent on us to ensure that they are answered and that the truth is revealed.  This afternoon, the Taoiseach announced in the Lower House that the Government will establish a public tribunal of inquiry, under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, into the alleged smear campaign against Sergeant McCabe.  It is important that truth and justice are arrived at and that the eminent judge charged with the task is allowed to do his or her work.  If there is a deliberate smear campaign against Sergeant McCabe, then those who carried it out should not be immune from prosecution and should be held to account for their actions.<\/p> <p>In terms of the questions posed on terms of reference, the information that I have indicates that we should have some material to debate within the next 48 hours.

The Minister for Education and Skills has published his plan to tackle educational disadvantage, but I share the Senator's concern about how some schools are allocated or, more specifically, not given DEIS status.  As in the Senator's constituency, there are some schools in mine that do not have DEIS status when they should have.  The Senator could raise the matter in the Commencement debate, but it is important that we invite the Minister to come to the House to discuss the issue.  It is also important to acknowledge that his announcement yesterday included 108 actions to help every child in school to achieve his or her potential.  That translates into 110 schools receiving additional supports, from which 28,000 pupils will benefit.  This is about improving literacy, numeracy, school completion rates and ensuring more children aged 11 and 12 years will go on to attend post-primary education where they will be able to attain their potential.  I am a former teacher and taught the leaving certificate applied programme in educationally disadvantaged areas.  It is important that we allow every child to reach his or her potential.  The Minister is identifying a new model of education to deliver on the objective of ensuring more children will stay in school.  We will see a different model whereby they will have the ability to be educated.  However, I agree with the Senator that there is a need for that model and status to be explained properly because there are some schools that we believe should have DEIS status.<\/p><p>I am happy to accept the amendment proposed by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell to allow No. 13 to be taken.<\/p><p>Senator Catherine Noone referred to the Irish Life health fitness challenge.  It is important that we invite the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, to come to the House because the nation must tackle the issue of obesity.  We are heading into the final weeks of \"Operation Transformation\", which programme, in tandem with the Healthy Ireland project, promulgates the need for fitness, healthy eating and physical activity.  The Minister was due to hold an event today, but it was cancelled.  Collectively and in a cross-party manner, we should get ourselves moving to tackle the problem of obesity.<\/p><p>Senator Robbie Gallagher also raised an education issue.  We should acknowledge that the Government has recruited more teachers.  There are an additional 2,400 teachers, as well as an additional 900 special needs assistants, SNAs, employed.  Part of the reason schools cannot find teachers is that they are already employed.  It is good that we have more teachers employed and that there is increased activity.  However, I accept the Senator's point that it is a nightmare for school principals.

While I understand the Senator's concerns and I am not having an argument with him, an amount of work has been done on the Bill.

The process will not deprive him of the opportunity to speak and move his amendment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We may differ on the actual amendments or the process involved but the House is anxious to get the Bill passed, as is the Minister.  That said, I appreciate where Senator McDowell is coming from on the matter.<br\/><br\/>Senator Devine raised the issue of the Stardust tragedy.  She is right that today, on Valentine's Day, it is important we remember the young lives that were lost.  There has been significant commentary by Government in terms of what is happening, and we should allow that work to continue and reach a conclusion.  It is also important that we recognise the young lives that were cut so tragically short on that dreadful Valentine's night.  I share Senator Devine's concerns and agree that we need to see justice prevail.<br\/><br\/>Senators Humphreys and Ardagh raised the issue of Harold's Cross greyhound track.  It is important to put on the record that Bord na gCon has statutory responsibility for the development of the greyhound industry.  It has been charged with that task.  A report was commissioned to look at the future of greyhound racing.  That independent report made several recommendations regarding Bord na gCon's financial performance and future prospects.  Bord na gCon has considered that report and has decided to put the stadium at Harold's Cross on the market, which will allow for a consolidation, a reduction in the debt levels of the organisation and an increase in the board's capacity to provide support and assistance to the greyhound industry.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, will have the final consent with regard to the sale of Harold's Cross.  Any specific proposals for such a sale will be considered in line with the Indecon recommendations and the need to reduce Bord na gCon's debt burden.  All of us agree that we should have a vibrant greyhound industry and we should all work to see that happen.  If the Senators wish to table a Commencement matter, that might be a way of having the issue addressed in the short term, but I am happy to try to get the Minister to come to the House in the coming weeks to discuss the matter.<br\/><br\/>Senator Horkan raised the issue of Cherrywood.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, will be in the House tomorrow and the Senator will have the opportunity to debate that matter with him then.<br\/><br\/>Senator Feighan raised the issue of racism in the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA.  As a member of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael, I can say that the organisation has done huge work in combating racism and promoting integration in our society and our new communities.  The GAA deserves to be commended on that but any slippage in that regard must be shown the red card and must not be tolerated.<br\/><br\/>Senators Gavan and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in raised the issue of Tesco and the industrial action taking place today in some of its stores.  I also stand with the workers of Tesco who, in some cases, have been treated very poorly.  There was a debate on the issue on the radio today which outlined some of the remarks made about this dispute.  We also had a contribution on the issue last week by Senator Gavan.  There is a Labour Court recommendation that some members of the Mandate trade union have refused to accept.  We must acknowledge the importance of the retail sector.  I would encourage all sides to engage with the industrial relations mechanisms of the State to arrive at a resolution.  It is important we do not do anything to undermine the rights of workers and I would be happy to invite the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, to the House to discuss the matter as well as the wider issues of work and employment.  In that context, it is important we put a value on work.  This Government and its predecessor have been instrumental in getting people back to work.<br\/><br\/>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of the electoral boundaries and I know that Graiguecullen is very close to her heart.  I am happy to invite the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, come to the House to discuss that matter.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of the <i>daft.ie<\/i>report and I am happy to invite the aforementioned Minister to the House to discuss it.  However, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach said, it might be better to raise this as a Commencement matter for this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#Y00500","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I put it down for today-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021400002#Z00200","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1487082600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Okay.
