We are joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to this committee.  He is accompanied by Ms Mahin Fitzpatrick.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of last week's meeting on 26 January, 2017.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  I wish to raise one item arising out of the aforementioned minutes.  We had quite a long discussion last week with the Secretary General of the Department of Defence, Mr. Maurice Quinn, about the sale of the Government jet.  I propose that the committee writes to Mr. Quinn to clarify a few issues because a couple of people have contacted me since our meeting and raised a number of matters.  First, I understood clearly from Mr. Quinn that there were access issues in terms of other people inspecting the Government jet and the spare parts in the hangar in Georgia.  I want him to explain how he arrived at that conclusion because I have been informed that there were no access issues and all one would have had to do was ask.  Access was put up as a reason for not getting an outside opinion.  Second, in his statement Mr. Quinn said that a lot of the spare parts did not have certification and I want some documentary evidence on that.  I also want know what document he issued to the Air Corps seeking certification and any correspondence received back confirming that there was none.  Finally, I just want to raise a point relating to our remit.  We accept that a decision had to be made to either sell the Government jet as it was, in parts on the floor and get the best available price - which is what actually happened - or fix it and put it back in the air.<\/p><p>There is a third option that was not considered, which I ask to be considered.  If someone took a vehicle into a garage and parts of it were on the floor, it may have been economical to put it back in working order and then sell it.  I am told that if they just repaired it and put it back in working order it could have been sold without any ongoing commitment at substantially more than was actually achieved.  There is no evidence that that option was explored.  No evidence was given to us that it was explored.  I would like to know the Secretary General's views on whether that option was considered and to see the documentary evidence that it was considered.  There appears to have been a Government decision to sell it.  Normally, somebody with a knowledge of selling things would have been involved in that process.  Did they seek to appoint any third party - some kind of broker - with knowledge of the industry to sell it or was it just done by civil servants?  I will ask the Secretary General to clarify those matters.  I am not disputing anything he said but I want those matters clarified because people who were watching proceedings contacted me afterwards with those questions so I would like them clarified. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017020200002#A00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486026000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I want further clarification.

He caught us on the hop.  We will all get a copy of that.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to correspondence, No. 266C, i to iv, and No. 267, i to ii.  This is correspondence from last week where we are awaiting another explanatory note.  It all relates to payment of public moneys by Dublin City Council to Ballymun regeneration programme.  We agreed to forward this correspondence to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and when the Secretary General is before the committee on 2 March, we will discuss this matter further.  We have put him on notice of that.  There is a new item of correspondence here today.  Do any members have anything further to add or can we just keep it on the file until 2 March?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We have sent it on.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 275C, i to iii, a letter from an anonymous source which attached a newspaper article regarding lease agreements entered into by the OPW.  We note that.  It is just a newspaper article.  <\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 277C, an e-mail received from two individuals who are involved in the ongoing case with the University of Limerick.  The secretariat has written to the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser for advice on this matter.  I propose that at our next meeting, the committee gets a brief from the parliamentary legal adviser on this particular issue.  We are also scheduling the third level institutions to appear before the committee in April.  I suggest we inform the University of Limerick that this topic will be discussed at that meeting.  We will come to that meeting in our work programme in a few minutes.  We note that.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 297C, i and ii, from NAMA regarding the sale of a property in Dublin 8 and an issue raised by Sager Management Limited.  The correspondence explains that the situation has been dealt with, that the individual has been contacted and is engaging in the process.  I propose we note this correspondence from NAMA.  Is that greed?  Agreed.  For the record, it is interesting to note that although NAMA was the secured lender on the property, the property remained under the control of the debtor and it seems NAMA is at arm's length from the actual sales process.  NAMA has been in direct contact with the individual.  <\/p> <p>  No. 4 is statement and accounts received since the last meeting.  They will come up on the screen now.  They are in front of us.  No. 4.1 is Leopardstown Park Hospital board, clear audit opinion; Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, clear audit opinion; Health Service Executive, patient private property accounts, clear audit opinion but attention is drawn to the issue of internal control.  That is specifically on our work programme.  On 9 March, we will deal with the HSE specifically on the patient private property accounts and the fair deal scheme.  We will deal with other HSE issues separately.  Those two items are specifically on our agenda.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 4.4 is special account for the purposes of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006, clear audit opinion.  The next item is the Repayment Scheme (Donations) Fund.  There were nil proceeds to that account in 2015.  It was very easy to get a clear audit report when there were no transactions.  That was an account whereby the Repayment Scheme (Donations) Fund was set up to receive voluntary donations from beneficiaries of the scheme to be used to fund improvements in health services for dependent old persons and persons with disabilities.  People will recall that some people were in institutions without the proper legal sanction and they sought refunds of charges and everything like that and &euro;1.67 million was paid out in 2015.  Many families felt they got very good service and they made a donation back of the amount received.  Other families chose, in recognition of the happy service they received, not to make a claim in the first place.  <\/p> <p>  Can the Comptroller and Auditor General tell us if there is much left to be paid in that fund?  Is it nearly over?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017020200002#B01900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486026000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I expect it is.

Just on that and even without going into private session, the conclusions of the secretariat's work will be circulated to all members next week.  In December while we were working on it in addition to the normal secretariat that is available to us we had the support of another staff member as well as help from a second person.  They have been moved to the secretariat of the Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  The clerk is finalising it on his own and we are still doing our routine business as well.  It is fully understandable why it has taken the extra week or so.

There was borrowing of &euro;10.5 million in this regard so it would be useful for us to examine what level of oversight the Department put into practice.

Payment of salaries, wages and allowances totalled &euro;235 million, which represents almost 71% of the total expenditure in 2015.  The Prison Service spent just over &euro;47 million on buildings and &euro;26.5 million on prison services, including expenditure on food and cleaning materials etc.  The main capital development project being undertaken by the Irish Prison Service in 2015 was construction of a new prison in Cork at a total estimated cost of approximately &euro;45 million.  This new medium security prison for adult males has an operational capacity for 275 prisoners and is the committal prison for counties Cork, Kerry and Waterford.  The relocation of prisoners from the old Cork prison commenced in early 2016.  The Accounting Officer will be able to brief the committee on the proposed future use of the old Cork prison.<\/p> <p> A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;6.3 million was voted for the Prison Service in 2015.  At the end of the year, the unused surplus for surrender was &euro;1.26 million.  The account received a clear audit opinion.  However, in my certificate, I draw attention to the Accounting Officer's statement on internal financial control, in which he discloses the level of non-compliance by the Prison Service with national procurement rules in respect of goods and services procured in 2015.<\/p> <p>  The report for consideration by the committee this morning relates to an examination by my office of the annualised hours system which operates in the Prison Service.  This system replaced overtime in the Prison Service from late 2005.  Historically, overtime levels were very high in the Prison Service.  Overtime costs peaked at &euro;59 million per year in 2002 and 2003.  Under the new annualised hours system, prison officers contract to work a fixed number of additional hours annually to a maximum of 360 hours per year over standard rostered hours.  When the Prison Service was planning to introduce the system, it was projected that it would result in significant financial savings.  I wanted to examine what had been achieved in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Following the introduction of the annualised hours system, the average number of hours worked by prison officers over and above their basic work week was halved.<\/p><p>The new cap on the number of additional hours that a prison officer may work ended the practice of some individuals working extremely high numbers of hours.  There is now a more even distribution of earnings from additional hours.<\/p><p> Prison officers are paid for contracted additional hours at a rate of 1.8 times the basic hourly rate.  A related pensionable allowance of 8% of basic pay is paid to each prison officer regardless of the number of additional hours he or she contracts to work.  This includes approximately 7% of officers who do not contract to work any additional hours.  My examination found that the average overall earnings of prison officers have not changed significantly in cash terms since the introduction of the new system.  Prison officers are paid for all of their contracted additional hours but may not be called on to work the full number of hours.  Additional hours not worked are called write-off hours.  While the average level of write-off hours across the Prison Service in 2014 was 15%, there was significant variation across the 14 prison institutions.  Open centres had the highest number of such write-off hours.<\/p><p> The Irish Prison Service has a low ratio of prisoners to prison officers relative to prison services in other states.  This suggests that some efficiency gains may be possible.  The joint task reviews that were carried out under the 2010-14 and 2013-16 public service agreements resulted in changes to staffing configurations.  No in-depth review of the tasks carried out in prisons and the resources required for those tasks has been carried out since 2001.  In particular, there was no formal process for the identification of potential efficiencies which may have arisen from prison infrastructure expenditure, which came to a total of &euro;223 million between 2001 and 2014.<\/p><p> The Prison Service anticipated that the introduction of the annualised hours system would result in a reduction of approximately one third in the amount of sick leave taken by prison officers relative to 2001 levels.  Sick leave levels increased significantly between 2001 and 2005.  The incidence of sick leave fell significantly after the introduction of the annualised system, but the reduction achieved to date has not been to the level anticipated by the Prison Service.<\/p><p> The Prison Service estimated that the annualised hours system would produce savings of &euro;31 million a year.  This was not achieved.  The examination estimated that the average annual net salary saving as a result of the introduction of the annualised hours system is approximately &euro;5.5 million a year.  Furthermore, the savings achieved to the end of 2014 were offset by substantial lump sum payments, totalling &euro;41 million, to serving prison officers when the new system was introduced.  As a result, the estimated net Exchequer saving over the period 2006 to 2014 was approximately &euro;8 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017020200002#E01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486026000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

To put it simply, the decision to introduce annualised hours was made against a background of very substantial overtime working in the Prison Service, which cost a considerable amount of money and led to inefficient and ineffective ways of operating the service.  At one point, the level of overtime in the Prison Service was very close to that in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is a much bigger force.

I am not in any way questioning the validity of the points made by the Comptroller and Auditor General when I say I know from my discussions and my reviews with prison management personnel over recent years that they believe the system of annualised hours has brought about a sea change in how prisons can be managed and has contributed greatly to securing efficiencies against a background of making much-needed reforms in the prison system.  A review that is taking place at present is assessing whether further improvements can be made in the system.  We can talk about this during the course of the morning.<\/p> <p>  I accept that the savings involved have not been as great as those which were initially hoped for.  This is largely due to a decision by an independent body to provide compensation on a scale greater than that which the Prison Service had argued was warranted for the changes which had been made.  By its nature, this was outside the control of the Prison Service.  Nonetheless, I think the Comptroller and Auditor General's report recognises that real and significant savings have been achieved.  A former Minister of State in the Department said at the time that \"despite reservations ... about the deal that emerged [it was] accepted that the overall package represented a workable way forward for the future\".  It is certainly the view of Prison Service management that this has proven to be the case in the intervening period.<\/p> <p>  Of course the annualised hours system is not perfect.  No system could be perfect in the particular circumstances of closed and open prisons.  Twelve years on, if I were faced with a choice between a demonstrably unpredictable and inefficient overtime system and a system of annualised hours that delivers efficiencies, predictability and significant savings, I would recommend to the Minister and the Government that a similar decision to that taken in 2005 be taken again now.<\/p> <p>  As I have said, Mr. Donnellan will highlight a few of the headline significant changes that have been made in the prison system.  In that respect, a crucial change which has occurred over the past decade has been the elimination of unplanned temporary release, or the \"revolving door\" as it was known.  That practice, which was a major feature of the overcrowded system over many years, had an enormously corrosive impact on the entire criminal justice system.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude by mentioning three items of significant infrastructural development that are in planning.  The E block in Portlaoise Prison is in urgent need of replacement due to its dilapidated state.  It is expected that construction works on the refurbishment of the two remaining wings in Limerick Prison, along with a stand-alone female facility, will begin towards the end of this year, depending on a tendering competition.  Most significantly, a new blueprint for the staged development of the Mountjoy complex, which is designed to extend its viability as a prison complex for decades to come, is in contemplation and, subject to Government approval, is likely be part of a public consultative process later this year.  I would like to hand over to Mr. Donnellan now to say a few opening words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017020200002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Waters"},{"type":"speech","time":1486026000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>We do not have an opening statement from Mr. Donnellan.

As the Secretary General has mentioned, the committee will be aware of significant changes and reforms that have occurred in the Prison Service in recent years.  The prison system has experienced severe strain and has had to deal with the continuing challenge of overcrowding.  Thankfully, overcrowding has been eliminated due to a number of factors, including enhanced pre-release planning, structured temporary release, community return and community release.  The number of people in custody has fallen by 20% from its peak in 2011.  More important, the number of people on temporary release has decreased by 70% from its peak.  There is no doubt that this is making society much safer.  The implementation of the fines legislation is starting to have an effect on committals.  We have not yet seen the full benefit of that.  Last year, we saw a decrease of 15% in the number of people being committed to prison for non-payment of fines.  This is very welcome.<\/p> <p>  We are continuing to develop a comprehensive capital programme.  Having developed new modernised accommodation in Castlerea Prison, Portlaoise Prison, Wheatfield Prison and the Midlands Prison, our priority now is to develop existing accommodation with a special focus on rehabilitation and the elimination of slopping out.  Five years ago, there were 1,000 people, or 25% of the prison population, slopping out.  Fewer than 50 prisoners, or 1% of the prison population, are slopping out today.  We hope to eliminate that with the development of facilities in Limerick and Portlaoise in the coming years.  The opening of the new Cork Prison in 2016 was a major initiative as the previous prison in Cork was the worst prison in our prison estate.  The introduction of an incentivised prisoner regime system has helped with behaviour and has helped to drive down violence in the prison system.<\/p><p>The committee will be aware that for various reasons, some prisoners have to be accommodated separately from other prisoners.  We call this a restricted regime and we have been working very hard in the past number of years to reduce the number of people who are on 22-hour or 23-hour lock-up, as it is called, or solitary confinement down to a manageable number.  Significant progress has been made on that.<\/p><p> We have also been working with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in ensuring we can measure recidivism and measure the effectiveness of prison.  Our first reports were published in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and during that period we have seen a drop in recidivism, that is, of people re-offending within a three year period, from 55% to 45%.  I hope in the next five to ten years I will see that percentage dropping down to 35%, which is the norm of the Nordic countries.  I am confident that the successful implementation of our strategy has really helped the prison system.<\/p><p> I look forward to developing our new strategy, which we are now implementing, which is built around supporting prisoners, supporting our staff, supporting victims and developing organisational capacity.  This has to be against the backdrop of additional hours, AH, which has allowed stability and predictability in the system and the diversion of much-needed funds to a more rehabilitative focus.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017020200002#F01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Donnellan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486026000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>We will start with Deputy Marc MacSharry, who has 20 minutes.

The bill for overtime had risen from &euro;54 million, up to &euro;55 million, culminating at &euro;59 million in the space of a couple of years, which gave rise to very serious difficulties in the entire justice sector in meeting a bill of that level every year.  The money allocated for other services and in other subheads had to be diverted to pay the overtime bill.  During that period, as I said in my opening remarks, the overtime for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was about &euro;65 million.  There were about 3,000 officers in the Prison Service, whereas the number of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was much larger.  Clearly the issue of overtime had to be resolved as it was not sustainable.<\/p> <p>  A review of the figures from 1997 up to the early 2000s was conducted to see if there could be a better way of organising the service.  They looked at four different options, namely, hiring more staff, time off in lieu, trying to curtail the overtime system and the annualised hours system.  They came down in favour of the annualised hours, and this was approved by a Minister and everybody else in the system.  They went into each prison and looked at the number of hours required to run the prison, came up with a global figure - and my colleagues can elaborate on that - of rostered hours and overtime hours that it would take to run the Prison Service right across all the individual institutions.  I believe 16 institutions may have been in operation at that time.  That global figure ultimately fed its way into the &euro;31 million saving which was identified at that time and was based on an expenditure of &euro;59 million in overtime.  In subsequent years that overtime bill fell back to &euro;46 million.<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. Donnellan to give Deputy MacSharry a flavour of how the numbers that arose came about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017020200002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Waters"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486026000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>As the Secretary General has said, there was an envisaged saving of &euro;31 million and that was against an overtime budget at its height of &euro;59 million.  However, when the deal came up for signature in 2005, the overtime figures for the year 2003-04 had dropped from &euro;59 million to &euro;46 million.  This reduction was because the then Government closed two prisons, the Curragh and Spike Island in Cork, which freed up 150 officers to be redeployed back into the system, which offset that overtime difference.  The real figure for benchmarking in our view should have been &euro;46 million, which would have given a gross saving of &euro;19 million per year.  The deal was put to a vote of the prison officers and then went to the Civil Service Arbitration Board.  The Civil Service Arbitration Board awarded the prison officers an 8% operational allowance and a lump sum of just under &euro;14,000 per officer.  That further eroded those saving.  The next savings, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has said are just over &euro;5 million a year in real savings or just over &euro;8 million, if one takes in the pension costs.

We can benchmark ourselves against those prisons, ask those prisons a question and get 29 answers back on a topic.  We have a lot of contact there.  More important, we are part of what is called a benchmarking group, which is made up of Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.  Our statisticians meet every year, and we benchmark ourselves against each other and against the same criteria.  For instance, the Council of Europe figures benchmark people for a whole range of staff who are not in the prison.  In Norway and Sweden, they have what is called the import model.  Many of their services are imported from the community, including health services, education services and work training services.

Communities were not safer when we had 30% more prisoners being managed by approximately the same number of prison officers.  The prison officer is the key change agent within a prison.  It is not the psychologist or psychiatrist; it is the class officer who intervenes with prisoners every day on the landing.  That is what can bring about massive change.

That change led to a reduction in sick leave for 2013 and 2014.  In 2015, we saw a return to the sick leave level we currently have.  Benchmarking us against the group of other European countries in terms of total sick leave lost within the system, Ireland stands at 5.2% of all losses, Sweden is at 6.1%, the Netherlands has a figure of 6.5%, Norway is at 7.9%, and Finland's figure is 5.5%.  In other words, we are not doing too badly.  On average, there are 15 days of sick leave per officer per year.  If one strips out injury on duty and maternity-related sick leave, that comes down to 11 days per officer per year, which is not bad given the type of work prison officers have to do.  There is no comparison between their work and the work being done by a civil servant in an office.  We have a range of measures to tackle sick leave.  The levels are unacceptable and we are always trying to drive them down.  When the AH system was introduced, we saw a significant reduction in sick leave, and the 2015 figures should be viewed in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017020200002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Donnellan"},{"type":"speech","time":1486026000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>On claims, what are non-compensation-related legal costs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017020200002#J00700","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1486026000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>It is quite complicated but, essentially, they relate to claims taken by prisoners against us.  There are three types of such claims.  The first is where a prisoner challenges the validity of the order holding him or her in prison.  Second, prisoners can take a challenge against us for a decision we make about them on behalf of the Minister.  In the case of a decision on entitlement to one third remission, for example, a prisoner can take a challenge to the High Court, as some have done, which is very expensive.  The third claim prisoners can take is where they consider their regime to be incompatible with their human rights.  For instance, gangland prisoners who are kept separate from other people and prisoners who are allowed only screen visits might  challenge that in the High Court.  In such cases, we would have to appoint matching counsel and defend the case.  Those are the costs associated with non-compensation.  Much of the total is made up by legal costs, but a small part is for compensation awards to prisoners.  These are sometimes given for very pragmatic reasons where, say, we get advice that it is not worth defending a challenge at a cost of &euro;100,000 and it would be better to pay &euro;10,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017020200002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Donnellan"},{"type":"speech","time":1486026000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Donnellan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017020200002#J00900","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1486026000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending the meeting.

It is absolutely vital that the Department provide resources for prison staff in order to keep them going because we are all human beings.
