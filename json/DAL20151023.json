Essentially, the Bill is an amendment to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 to make provision for a partial - I stress the word \"partial\" - exemption of property tax payable by a relevant owner whose property is located in a managed estate on which the owner of said property is liable to the payment of management fees and to provide for related matters.<\/p>  <p>  Many people are living in managed estates paying management fees who must also pay local property tax.  We understand the reason the local property tax exists.  The essence of the local property tax is to provide funds to local authorities to carry out work they should do.  However, in many estates nowadays there is a management fee to be paid.  These could be housing estates, apartment complexes or a joint housing and commercial development, although the Bill has nothing to do with the commercial aspect of the estates.  Some of these estates are quite big, with up to 900 dwellings as well as shops, a local pub, a pharmacy and child care facilities.  The latter elements pay commercial rates rather than the local property tax.  We will talk about that issue another day.  The Bill relates specifically to people living in these estates who are subject to management fees.<\/p>  <p>  Management fees became very popular a few years ago when local authorities began to include a condition in planning permission granted by them whereby there would be a management company to manage the public areas in an estate.  It was probably a short-cut way for local authorities to avoid taking on the future liability of dealing with the open areas in some estates, as well as roads, footpaths, lighting and community facilities.  In the past, this would have specifically included water and sewerage facilities also, for which local authorities previously had responsibility.  Local authorities still deal with those matters, but now they act merely as agents for Irish Water.  We will not get into a debate on Irish Water today because that is a separate issue.<\/p>  <p>  People are paying management fees to companies to manage their estates and carry out work that in the normal course of events would be managed by local authorities if the estate was fully taken in charge.  Such people are paying on the double for access to roads, footpaths, lighting and other public services in the immediate area, which could include pedestrian crossings and the maintenance of roundabouts.  I do not suggest for a moment that people should not have to pay their management fees or the local property tax.  The purpose of the Bill is to grant a partial exemption to those who are currently paying on the double.  People understand the management of their estate and the fees they pay, whether they live in houses or apartments.  We believe there should be a recognition that people are paying on the double, and to that end we propose a partial reduction in the local property tax equal to one third of the management fee, one third of the local property tax, or &euro;100, whichever is the lower amount.  Under the proposed legislation, nobody would ever gain more than &euro;300.  People who are in properties valued at &euro;1 million with big management fees attached &ndash; some developments charge up to &euro;2,000 &ndash; and whose local property tax is very high would not get an extra benefit because it is restricted to a maximum benefit of &euro;300.  That is the essence of the Fianna F&aacute;il approach to all taxation and expenditure.  The benefit should be geared towards people on lower and middle incomes and should not be skewed in favour of those at higher income levels, as has been the norm in all budgets in recent years from the Fine Gael Minister of State across the floor.  In capping the benefit at &euro;300 &ndash; most people would not be in that bracket &ndash; we specify that people would have to prove they had paid their management fee by producing receipts.  Many management companies have difficulties collecting their income.  A receipt of payment could accompany the payment of the local property tax and ensure a reduction of one third of the management fee.  If the management fee was &euro;450 then the reduction would amount to &euro;150, and if the management fee was lower then the reduction would be less.  If the value of a house in a development was under &euro;100,000, for which the local property tax would be &euro;90, it would get a reduction of only &euro;30, which is one third.  People in a house valued up to &euro;150,000, the local property tax on which would be &euro;225, would get only one third of that, approximately &euro;75.  For those in a house or apartment valued at up to &euro;200,000, for which the local property tax would be &euro;315, would get a reduction of only &euro;105.<\/p>  <p>  Based on data available from the Central Statistics Office and local authorities - I accept it is not an exact science - the best information we have been able to establish is that such a measure would be of benefit to approximately 200,000 dwellings in the private sector.  It would not even be confined to the private sector, because local authorities have houses in some estates which they were given under the Part V arrangements for developments.  That is another issue that is covered in the Bill.  We estimate that the average saving per person would be approximately &euro;86, based on people whose property tax is in the region of &euro;300 to &euro;400 and who have a lower management fee.  Some people would save a little less if their property tax was lower, and others would save substantially more, but nobody would have a saving greater than &euro;300.  We estimate that the measure would cost approximately &euro;17 million in a full year.<\/p>  <p>  We published this legislation during the course of the year.  I thank in particular my Dublin colleague Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien for his work on the Bill.  He met many people in his constituency in the greater Dublin area who raised the matter with him.  They see the injustice of having to pay twice in the form of management fees and the local property tax.  He instigated the Bill and he wants to speak on the issue in the Seanad, but because it is a money Bill it must first be introduced in the D&aacute;il.  I introduce the Bill essentially on his behalf.  I acknowledge his good work.<\/p>  <p>  However, the issue does not just affect the Dublin area; it affects every provincial town.  Off the top of my head I can think of one large estate in Portlaoise, Kilminchy, which has between 600 and 700 houses and apartments.  There is also a commercial area, which has nothing to do with the issue in hand.  Management fees are payable there.  I can think of housing estates in Mountmellick and Portarlington where management fees are payable also, and where people are liable for the local property tax.  The issue is not just a Dublin issue; it mainly affects cities but it does stretch into every provincial town, especially in areas where local authorities insisted as a condition of planning permission that a management fee would be charged by a management company.<\/p>  <p>  The issues outlined must be taken into account, particularly the plight of apartment dwellers in some areas.  We estimate that the average saving per person would be &euro;86, which is a modest amount.<\/p><p>We are only on Second Stage, and I do not know the timing of the legislation or when it will pass through the Oireachtas.  If it is through the Oireachtas before the general election, we would be happy to implement it.  At this point it is not, and I have no indication that it will be on the Statute Book in 2016.  If we had had clearance from the Government, we would have had it in our budget proposals.  In the absence of a commitment from the Government to support this, it would have been wrong to include it in a budget submission because the legislation would not be in place.  It will be in our manifesto for the next general election and will be implemented as soon as possible, if Fianna F&aacute;il is leading a government after the election.<\/p> <p> Other issues also come into this debate.  A partial or complete exemption should be introduced for those affected by pyrite.  A restricted number of unfinished housing estates are exempt from the local property tax.  When the household charge came in first, I recall that between 40,000 and 50,000 houses were exempt from it in the first year.  When the local property tax was introduced, it was cut by 90% to approximately 5,000 houses.  It is a very restricted list at this stage, which does not reflect the reality on the ground.  There are many estates in which works are not yet completed.  The definition of an unfinished estate that would allow it to qualify for an exemption from the local property tax is exceptionally restrictive.  If the footpaths to the front doors of the properties on an estate are not finished, the whole estate is deemed unfinished.  However, estates that have problems with water and sewerage schemes or other public services might not be considered unfinished and, accordingly, get no exemption.  We need to re-examine the definition of an unfinished estate.  We also need to examine the issue of estates that have not been taken in charge.<\/p> <p> Apartment dwellers have been hit very hard by the Government with the local property tax based on the value of their apartments, as well as management fees.  They have also been hit by water bills.  It is unfair that the Government introduced a system whereby people would be charged for water when it knew that several hundred thousand dwellings, namely apartments, could never have a water meter installed.  It is not possible to install a water meter in some apartment blocks and one cannot put a water meter inside everybody's apartment door.  The logistics of this were never adequately considered by the Government.  Everyone living in an apartment pays the local property tax and pays management fees to the management company but also has to pay the maximum amount in respect of water services.  If they had a meter, they might have a much reduced water bill because water usage by an apartment might not be as much as that of a house.  There is no question, for example, of an apartment owner having a hose to wash the car, water plants and look after a garden.  Many apartment dwellers might not use their full allocation.  However, Irish Water has no mechanism to ensure apartment dwellers can get a reduced bill because it cannot install water meters in apartment blocks.<\/p> <p> What does the Government have against those who live in apartment blocks?  I do not know why it has singled out that particular group specifically.  It has singled them out for the local property tax, which is fine, but the Government knows that anyone who lives in an apartment block that was built over the past ten or 15 years pays a management fee, and this was not taken into account.  It puts the water bill on top of that and ensures they have to pay the top rate with no possible reduction if they have a lower water usage.  This leads us on to the broader issue of what exactly the Government has against people in apartment blocks.<\/p> <p> The purpose of this legislation is to help people in apartment blocks and estates where there is a management company.  Many of the estates can comprise detached, semi-detached or terraced houses.  Some of these houses are even owned by local authorities, which got them under Part V arrangements for social and affordable housing.  The council is paying the property tax because it is the owner, but also the management fee to the management company.  Due to the lack of consistency in thinking this through, one can have the ridiculous situation of a local authority paying the management fee to a management company to manage the roads in an area that the local authority should have taken in charge.  The more one thinks about it, the more one can see the merit in allowing some partial reduction in the local property tax.  No one is suggesting a full reduction.  However, a maximum reduction of one third should be allowed if it is higher than the equivalent proportion of the management fee, and subject to a maximum cap of &euro;300.  I hope the Government will accept this legislation and allow us to tease out the difficulties on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102300004#B00100","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445591700,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Sean Fleming for initiating this Bill and providing an opportunity to debate the local property tax.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of the local property tax is to broaden the domestic tax base and to replace some of the revenue from transaction-based taxes with an annual recurring property tax.  We know only too well how, in the past, transaction-based taxes proved to be an unstable source of Government revenue.  By contrast, international experience has shown that property taxes are a secure and stable source of funding.  It is also important to have a tax system that does not heap the entire cost of running the State on people going to work in the morning.  Stability in our public finances is precisely what Ireland needs, now and into the future.  Frankly, proposals from some on the Opposition benches to abolish the local property tax are reckless and irresponsible.  I accept that Fianna F&aacute;il originally opposed the tax, but its budget submissions for 2015 and 2016 included it.  Moreover, the local property tax enables us to achieve our goals in a manner that does not have a direct impact on employment.  The Government is steadfast in its determination to do everything in its power to protect and support the creation of jobs and ensure that the entire cost of our tax base is not heaped on those at work.  As a measure that is a tax on assets, not employment, the local property tax will not adversely affect job creation.<\/p>  <p>  The local property tax is fair and equitable, as the owners of the most valuable properties pay the most.  Properties valued over &euro;1 million are subject to a higher rate of 0.25% on the excess over &euro;1 million.  The local property tax legislation provides appropriately for ability to pay and conforms to international norms.  It is now well established as a significant element of our taxation system.  While I do not include Deputy Sean Fleming in this, some on the Opposition benches propose its reckless abolition.  Despite this, the local property tax has a high level of compliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102300005#C00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1445591700,"counter":9,"content":"<p>There is no choice in the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102300005#C00300","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1445591700,"counter":10,"content":"<p>It is important that its position be maintained, as research and experience internationally consistently show that taxes on immovable property are among the taxes that are least detrimental to growth.<\/p>  <p>  In the course of introducing this Bill on First Stage, Deputy Sean Fleming indicated that approximately 177,000 homeowners were affected by management fees.  Now, he claims there are 200,000 home owners who are paying management fees.  On the cost of his proposal, he stated that the maximum cost of the proposal would be in the region of &euro;17 million.  From our conversations with the Revenue Commissioners, we are not sure where the figure of 200,000 homeowners is derived from, as it does not appear in the 2011 census.  The Revenue Commissioners have indicated that without some figure on the number of properties that are subject to management fees and their average charges, it is not possible to cast the Bill&rsquo;s provisions, as there is no basis in the returns made to the Revenue Commissioners on which to make an estimate.<\/p>  <p>  It is likely that a considerable proportion of those paying management fees are landlords themselves, who are already able to deduct the cost of management fees from their tax liabilities.  The Bill does not exclude landlords from the partial exemption proposed, so it would result in a double benefit for these landlords.  Will the Deputy clarify whether that is his intention?<\/p>  <p>  If we accept that the local property tax is necessary to fund local services and we do not want to see significant hikes in the tax, who will pick up the slack for the &euro;17 million cost?  Who will have to pay more, and what services in what communities does the Deputy wish to cut?<\/p>  <p>  Due to its importance, the Minister for Finance asked Dr. Don Thornhill to conduct a review of the operation of the local property tax, with particular emphasis on any impacts on local property tax liabilities due to property price developments over recent years.<\/p><p>Dr. Thornhill is a distinguished former public servant who chaired the interdepartmental group on the design of a local property tax in 2012.  In his report on his review of the local property tax, which was published on budget day, Dr. Thornhill makes a number of recommendations.  His central recommendation is for a revised system whereby a minimum level of local property tax revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield.  This in turn would allow for the estimation of local property tax rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.  This new system is recommended by Dr. Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.<\/p> <p> As announced in Budget 2016, the Minister for Finance will be making a proposal to Government to postpone the revaluation date for the local property tax from 2016 to 2019.  This postponement means that home owners will not be faced with significant increases in their local property tax in 2017 as a result of increased property values.  This gives sufficient time for the other recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report to be considered fully by the next Government.<\/p> <p> I note the Deputy's comments about pyrite exemption.  The Minister made very clear in his budget speech that he accepts the recommendations concerning pyrite exemption, which I think was recommendation 11 in the Thornhill report.  Among these recommendations is that local authorities be more engaged in supporting the Revenue Commissioners and also that they provide the general public and individual households with programmatic and other useful information on how they spend the public funds available to them and the proportionate contribution made by the local property tax.  This is a very important recommendation.  If people will be asked to pay money directly to councils, they need to see where it is spent and what it is spent on and there needs to be transparency.<\/p> <p> The local property tax was designed on the principles of equity, transparency and simplicity.  Under the local property tax, a liability applies to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept to a minimum for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  The more people one wishes to give exemptions or partial exemptions to, the more one increases the burden on other people paying the local property tax.  I am sure Deputy Fleming does not want to do that to the many people in his constituency who do not live in areas with management companies.<\/p> <p> There is no specific relief from the local property tax for the payment of management fees and there are no plans to introduce such a relief.  Issues such as ability to pay are addressed through a system of deferrals, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions.  Those who are liable for management fees to property management companies may be exempt or eligible for relief from the local property tax for another reason or may be entitled to avail of a deferral arrangement under the provisions contained in the legislation.<\/p> <p> Generally, properties in managed estates, to which such fees apply, would have been purchased by their owners in the knowledge that they would be taking these commitments- as Deputy Fleming says it is often included as a condition of planning - and that it was the intention that many such estates would not be taken in charge by local authorities nor in some cases, would it be appropriate for local authorities to do so.  Management fees in these estates may in some instances include services such as refuse collection, maintenance of common areas and a sinking fund for certain repairs to the buildings.  This is an important point that the Deputy did not make.  These are costs which homeowners in many other developments would have to fund themselves for their own properties.  When one pays the management fee, one might get bin collection and maintenance of common areas included in that and a sinking fund if repairs are needed within the building.  These are costs that those who do not pay management fees or who live in housing estates that do not pay management fees must meet from their own means.  When the Deputy talks about double costs and double charges, it does not stand up to scrutiny when one considers that the management fee often includes the payment of services that other people living in other housing estates in other areas must meet from their own pockets.  People in management fee estates pay for it through the management fee.<\/p> <p> The introduction of the local property tax provides an opportunity for political reform at local government level.  The local properly tax will provide a stable funding base for local authorities and it can be altered in the future.  This is a good reform in local democracy whereby for the first time funds will be ring-fenced for local authorities.  This gives our counsellors an opportunity to decide the tax base that is needed for their community and the projects on which they want to spend that money.  We have not had that since the misguided removal of domestic rates by the Deputy's party when it tried to buy a general election in 1977.  I hope we will not see that again.  Revenue from the local property tax will accrue to local authorities and will support the provision of local services.<\/p> <p> Local authorities provide a broad range of services in the public realm, the proper functioning of which are important for the well-being of every community and household.  These include fire and emergency services, road maintenance and cleaning, street lighting and spatial and development planning.  The net issue is that the local property tax applies to everybody no matter where one lives.  It funds services in all our towns and villages and it is not envisaged that there would be a special category or a special exemption for properties with management companies.<\/p> <p> In certain circumstances, private estates will be taken in charge by local authorities in accordance with the Planning and Development Acts.  This is, of course, a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the relevant local authorities.  However, it is germane to this debate and I will say a few words about it.  I am informed by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that the requirements relating to the taking in charge of residential developments are provided for in the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2015 and the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011.  Normal housing estates fall under the provisions of the Planning and Development Acts while multi-unit developments, which are generally apartment blocks and gated developments of not less than five units, fall under the Multi-Unit Development Act.<\/p> <p> The taking in charge of residential estates by local authorities is provided for under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Section 180(1) provides that in respect of estates which have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the planning permission, the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the developer or by the majority of the owners of the houses involved, initiate the procedures for taking the estate in charge.  With regard to estates which have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the planning permission and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within seven years of the expiration of the permission authorising the development, section 180(2) provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the owners of the houses concerned, initiate taking in charge procedures.<\/p> <p> The taking in charge of an estate is achieved firstly by a declaration under section 11 of the Roads Act 1993 that the road or roads in question are public roads for whose maintenance the local authority will then be responsible.  This is a reserved function and is a matter for the elected members of a local authority.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government issued updated policy guidance to planning authorities in 2008 on the taking in charge of residential developments and management arrangements.  This required each planning authority to develop or update, as appropriate, its policy on taking in charge by the end of June 2008 based on the following principles.  They include certain core facilities or infrastructure to be taken in charge on request and the procedures for taking in charge to begin promptly on foot of a request by the majority of the residents in the development or by the developer, as appropriate.<\/p> <p> In accordance with the Multi-Unit Developments Act, and this is also generally specified in the conditions attaching to the planning permission, developers are required to transfer ownership of the common areas of a development to an owners' management company which then assumes responsibility for the ongoing maintenance, management and refurbishment of the overall development.  Property owners in a development are members of, and are represented on, the management company and are obliged to pay the annual maintenance and service charges applied by the management company.<\/p> <p> Given the scale of the infrastructure maintenance and the range of other services provided by a multi-unit development management company, the annual service charges or management fees applied can be quite expensive.  Without these service charges, the development would fall into disrepair.  They are, therefore, applied for both the short and long-term benefit of the property owners in a development.  They relate solely to the ongoing maintenance, management and refurbishment of a development - not the community, town or village, which is what the local property tax refers - and are confined to costs incurred by the management company within the boundaries of a development.<\/p> <p> For people in unfinished estates, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, provides that a residential property will be exempt from the local property tax where it is situated in an unfinished housing estate that is specified in a list prescribed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for the purposes of the Act.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has prescribed and published this list, which is set out in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013 and was compiled by local authorities utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the national housing survey 2012.<\/p> <p> For individuals on low incomes, the local property tax legislation provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to local property tax in certain cases.  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The income thresholds for a full deferral are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, regardless of whether they are married persons, civil partners or cohabitants.<\/p> <p> An increased income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  A deferral option in qualifying cases in this regard will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress.<\/p> <p> Some property owners may find themselves unable to pay the local property tax but do not qualify for a deferral under the income conditions.  For this reason, the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 provides that a person who has entered into an insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may apply for deferral of the local property tax that is due during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect.<\/p><p>The 2013 Act also provides that a person who suffers an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which he or she is unable to pay their local property tax without causing financial hardship, may apply for a full or partial deferral.  The vulnerable are protected by these legislative arrangements.<\/p> <p> I was somewhat taken aback by Deputy Fleming's question as to what we have against people in apartments, particularly in view of how the absolute economic chaos he, his Government and the policies they pursued and cheered on put those people living in those apartments in a situation where they found themselves in negative equity and losing their jobs.  We are supporting them by getting them back to work and trying to restore the housing market to some level of stability after the chaos.  I was also impressed by how the Deputy managed to mention the issue of water charges without blushing when we know his party leader sat around a Cabinet table and agreed with his colleagues to introduce a flat water charge of &euro;500 per house.  I presume - we will have to probe this further - that it would have applied to everybody living in an apartment as well.  I do not know whether it is parliamentary to say he has some neck, but this new-found love for people in apartments and his new opposition to water charges are quite stark.  I look forward to debating these issues.<\/p> <p> The local property tax has been introduced, is achieving a high compliance rate by taxpayers and is providing a stable base of funding for our local authorities.  If we introduce more exemptions, somebody else must pay and that pushes the burden onto other people.  The Minister, therefore, is not in a position to accept this Bill, but I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102300005#C00400","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445592900,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I am one of those recklessly irresponsible people the Minister of State described who were opposed to imposing a tax on one's private home.

Anybody who thinks water will be cheap in this country a few years hence is living in cloud-cuckoo-land.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Fleming asked what the Government might have against people living in apartments.  I must agree that people who live in apartments, especially in large apartment blocks, have a huge extra expense.  Before I speak about apartments, the Minister of State said in response to the Deputy's arguments that there is a level playing field with regard to housing estates.  I cannot accept that.  Housing estates that were built years ago in Wexford do not have management companies, so there are no management charges.  The local authority takes care of matters.  However, more recently built estates have management companies and a management fee must be paid.  Both pay the same local property tax.  Many of these houses have been bought and are now privately owned.  I do not know how the Minister of State can argue that the two are on a level playing field, because the field is not level.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to apartments, management companies will become extremely problematic in the city.  Sadly, I was a director of about seven of them and I could not wait to get out of them.  They are very difficult and problematic to run and are very expensive.  People in Dublin are paying up to &euro;2,000 per year in management fees for apartments, and it is not because they are being robbed by the management companies.  There are good and bad management companies, just as there is good and bad in everything in business.  However, if an apartment block has five lifts, for example, the cost of maintaining the lifts is astronomical.  The five lifts might serve 30 apartments, which is not as unusual as one might think.  If the block of 30 apartments has only one lift, it is obviously much cheaper.  Many people went into this somewhat on the blind side.  They signed up for leases which provided for a management fee, but many of them are shocked at how high the fees are.  The average for Dublin city, especially in the city centre area, is probably &euro;1,600 to &euro;1,700 per year.  If people are paying this for management services, it is draconian to ask them to pay the property tax as well.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State made the point that if Deputy Fleming's Bill were passed, and I support it, an extra amount of millions of euro would be missing and he asked where we would get it.  If any action such as this were taken, money would have to be raised elsewhere.  However, surely fairness is a major aspect.  The concept that we create as level a playing field as possible to treat everybody fairly must be a strong factor and mitigate against the extra cost.  We know that everything costs money, but a government must have the primary objective of applying fairness in any way it can.<\/p>  <p>  The management companies carry out cleaning that is not done by the local authorities.  For example, the management company in Quartier Bloom, the Italian quarter which we still control, cleans the area.  The local authority does not get involved in the cleaning of the outside areas.  We must do it.  However, other people have the benefit of the local authority cleaning the area around their apartments and they might not have a management fee.  There are people paying money to management companies for things that the local authorities do in other areas.  Due to how the apartments are structured, the management fees will not go away.  The apartments are expensive to look after and that will not change.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation will probably be required in the management company area.  There are many problems in that area which I do not have time to discuss in detail today, but it will become a bigger issue over time.  The idea that people should pay &euro;1,600 to &euro;1,700 per year as well as a property tax should be re-examined.  It definitely deserves further thought because it is just too big an ask for too many people.<\/p>  <p>  A point was made about people in apartments having to pay the flat water charge.  It is significant that charging for water was not envisaged when planning for apartments was given over the past 20 years.  It is a surprise to the people that they now must pay directly for water.  Obviously, I do not agree with it.  Deputy Fleming mentioned that the chances of putting meters in these buildings are quite slim.  It can be done, but at huge cost.  If water becomes so expensive and if a private company ever gets control of it, it probably will set about doing that but I presume, although I have not seen any planning conditions recently, that one will have to put meters in the basements and instead of running one pipe to feed 15 apartments there will have to be 15 pipes and a meter on each of them in the basement.  Putting them outside the door of each apartment is not really an option because it will create a problem with regard to giving people access to check them and so forth.  It would have to be done through the basements.  Most of these apartment blocks will not be rectified or retro-fitted with meters so imposing a flat charge on them is draconian.<\/p><p>It is another issue the Government should examine.<br\/><br\/>Fairness and the need to create a level playing field dictates that the Government is a little hasty in not supporting this Bill.  It deserved some consideration.  Even if it were allowed to move to the next Stage we could have a serious debate on it because there are pros and cons around the entire area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102300007#E00400","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445593500,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The Bill, in so far as it goes, provides some relief, and we support it on those grounds, but why is it restricted to equal of one third of the local property tax, LPT, or &euro;300, whichever is the lower figure?  It seems limited but, however, it does provide some relief and on those grounds, we will support the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The key issue is the abolition of local property tax, which we included in our recent budget submission, in the same way that Sinn F&eacute;in councillors, whenever we were in a position to do so, supported the reduction of property tax on local authorities as an interim measure pending, hopefully, the eventual abolition of that tax.<\/p>  <p>  Management fees were but one of the many extra charges imposed by developers during the Celtic tiger years.  I am talking about managed developments, but it was also charged on ordinary housing estates for a number of years.  When people bought their houses they were tied in to contracts under which they had to pay management fees.  In some circumstances they are justified where there is a reliable security system and maintenance but as referred to by a previous speaker, it is a very difficult situation in many estates where extortionate charges are being imposed.<\/p>  <p>  In many cases the developer and the management company is one and the same and is simply being used as a cash cow for the developer, while carrying out little or no maintenance or improvements in the estate.  Approximately 200,000 homes are involved.  In one example, an apartment owner who came to public notice was given a &euro;2,000 management bill for, among other things, landscaping, tree-cutting and tree removal, even though the apartment block was on a street of terraced houses with neither trees, gardens nor green areas.  That type of practice is taking place as well.  When the person refused to pay the amount, he was issued with threats that his apartment would be removed from the block's insurance policy, and that the management company would begin legal proceedings to recover costs and an application made for the repossession of his property.  That is probably an extreme example but it is clear there is a good deal of abuse with regard to management fees, and that issue should be addressed, apart from the proposal in this Bill, which I support.  There are examples in Laois of people being charged up to &euro;1,000, with little or no service being provided.  There are some good examples, however, where the management company is like a co-operative in that there is buy-in from all the local residents, all of whom are active members of the management company.<\/p>  <p>  Management companies were mentioned by a previous speaker in regard to Kilminchy, which is 90% taken over by the local authority.  It is not run by a management company.  There is a small estate adjacent to Kilminchy that is under the control of a management company but there are others also.  Rankins Wood and Maryborough Crescent, in Portlaoise, are among many where management companies are involved.  The crucial difference is that the residents are responsible for the lights, footpaths and green areas.  If someone is living in an ordinary housing estate or on a street, the local authority is responsible as far as the step of their door but the residents in these developments are responsible for the landscaping, boundary treatment and maintenance, footpaths, roads, lights, water services in and out and everything else within the development, and there is a large cost involved.<\/p>  <p>  A person living in a development very close to where I live was a little behind in paying their management fees.  They happened to be a commuter who was paying a serious amount of money and another range of taxes to the Departments of the two Ministers opposite me, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Harris.  That person came out of her house one morning to find her car had been clamped by the management company.  That is not the first case of that happening to someone.  It took that women a couple of days to get her car released.  She could not travel to work.  She was caught in an awful situation.  It is clear that abuses are taking place in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding local property tax in general, it is clear that it unpopular to impose a further tax burden on already hard-pressed citizens such as the woman I mentioned.  When it was introduced by the former Minister, Phil Hogan, he claimed it was necessary to help maintain public parks, libraries, lighting and footpaths through contributing via the local authorities' Local Government Fund.  In fact, what we saw last year was the Local Government Fund being raided to subvent Irish Water.  It is ironic that the amount taken out was almost the same as that raised through the property tax.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, the Government has realised that property tax is unpopular and made a gesture towards that in the budget, but we are getting near the time for an election.  However, the decision to freeze any increase to reflect rising property values until 2019 is only a temporary stay of execution as home owners will be faced then, or if a future Government changes the legislation or makes a move in the next budget, with a much larger jump in LPT in 2019.  In any event, the Government measure has been overtaken by the fact that many local authorities had already decided to avail of the option not to increase the tax or to cut it by up to 15%.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, that is a double edged sword as local authorities have their funding reduced equal to the amount of the local property tax.  Local authorities are faced with a situation where locally provided services are badly hit by the reductions in their funding from central government.  In the case of Dublin, the yield from property tax in 2016 for Dublin City Council would have been hit by &euro;77.5 million but the reduction of 15% would reduce that &euro;77.5 million by more than &euro;11 million.<\/p>  <p>  Some Government supporters have argued that reducing the rate on such councils is deliberately hitting their own services. However, Fine Gael councillors, along with Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in, all proposed motions calling for a 15% reduction so not only do all the parties agree that local property tax is too high, all of them, and many councils, implicitly support the Sinn F&eacute;in view that local authorities and local services should be supported out of general taxation and other charges.  We presented options such as packaging levies, waste levies and a second home tax, which is an option; that is one the Government did away with.  Instead of going for the option of taxing speculation, it taxed the family home.<\/p>  <p>  The funding to local authorities has been drastically reduced in real terms over the past five or six years.  As I pointed out last year, the proceeds from LPT were, in effect, handed over to Irish Water, and we know the way that is being wasted and literally being poured down the drain.  Not only are households expected to pay for water through water charges, therefore, they are also hit by having the funding that was supposed to go to local services diverted down the drain to Irish Water.<\/p>  <p>  Our party made a submission to the review of the local property tax before the budget.  We put on record our opposition to LPT and recommended that the tax should be abolished.  If elected to government after the next election, that is what we are committed to doing.  In our submission, Deputy Pearse Doherty correctly pointed out that the review is intended simply to provide political cover to the Minister for Finance rather than as a genuine investigation into LPT.<\/p><p>He correctly stated that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was planning to announce a freeze on the link with property prices, which of course he did in the budget.  The review and the voting record of Fine Gael councillors in Dublin and on other local authorities prove that Fine Gael has realised that the local property tax, LPT, is extremely unpopular, not least among its own supporters.  <\/p> <p> Our position is that the LPT is a failed tax.  It has failed in its stated objectives and is simply another unfair tax implemented with the excuse of an economic crisis.  Nor does it provide any new services.  With 110,000 households in mortgage distress, it is unacceptable.<\/p> <p> We talk about negative equity.  Looking at the county I live in, along with south Kildare - the Monasterevin area, Portlaoise, Mountmellick, Portarlington and towns like that - I can see that the people who have really been hit with negative equity are those in apartments.  Apartment prices have literally fallen through the floor.  While houses in some areas have held up reasonably well, perhaps taking a 30% or 40% hit, there are apartments that are not worth 20% of what it cost to build them.  Take Parkside in Portlaoise as an example.  The Minister of State should just look at what the apartments there were bought for and the prices they have been selling at over the last year or so.  In some cases they are selling for a quarter or one sixth of what they cost in the first place.<\/p> <p> We support the Bill.  We would like to see the total abolition of the local property tax.  In respect of previous comments on management companies, legislation will be required there because we are going to have problems with management companies down the line.  They were not properly thought through in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102300008#F00200","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445594100,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank all the Members who have contributed to this debate.  As I stated earlier, the Government cannot support the Bill, and I have outlined why we are not in a position to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the local property tax in 2013 was the largest extension of self-assessment in the history of the State, with more than 1.3 million taxpayers obliged to file LPT returns and pay the tax in respect of around 1.9 million properties.  The first valuation date was 1 May 2013 and the valuations declared for that date determined tax liabilities for half of 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.  The next valuation date would be due on 1 November of next year, which would determine tax liabilities from 2017 to 2019.  However, as the Minister, Deputy Noonan, said in his budget statement, he will now make a proposal to the Government to postpone the revaluation date until 2019.  This postponement means that homeowners will not be faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values.  It will allow the next Government, whatever its composition, to give serious consideration to the excellent work done by Dr. Thornhill in the report that the Minister asked him to carry out.  A number of recommendations are contained within that report.<\/p>  <p>  The local property tax is producing a stable revenue yield for local authorities and, although the tax rates are modest by international comparison, the charge is progressive.  I am quite surprised that Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support a Bill that would mean that landlords, who could own multiple properties and could actually claim back tax relief on the cost of management fees, could get an exemption or partial exemption from property tax and then pass it on to other people, maybe more hard-pressed families.  It seems like quite a peculiar position.<\/p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, the introduction of a property tax is part of a broader approach to taxation of property which aims to replace some of the revenue raised from transaction-based taxes.  We do not believe that all of the tax base can be levelled on work.  We know that is a disincentive.  I know from the pre-budget submission that Sinn F&eacute;in is in favour of having a marginal tax rate in this jurisdiction that is almost 20 percentage points higher than up the road in Belfast.

It is their decision to lower the local property tax in an area or to put it up.  They can ring-fence it and decide what to use the money for - playgrounds, more roads or maintenance.

We cannot just allow money to disappear and say that services will continue.  It is going to have to be passed on to somebody else.  <\/p><p>Deputy Wallace made the point that people in housing estates with management companies are paying the same amounts and those in management companies are not getting anything extra for their management fee.  That is just not true.  I live in an apartment.  I rent it so I do not pay the management fee.  That fee includes waste collection, washing the windows, and the maintenance of the area outside my apartment in terms of carpet cleaning and all that sort of stuff.  My parents live in a housing estate in Greystones.  They do not get the windows washed or the bins collected.  They have to pay for those out of their own pocket.

The Bill proposes that where a person is liable to pay an annual management fee to a management company in respect of a property, he or she should have a partial exemption in respect of his or her local property tax in the relevant year on confirmation that the management fee has been paid.  This would be a modest amount, equal to one third of the management fee, one third of the local property tax, or &euro;300, whichever is the lowest.  It is a very modest recognition of the double charge that people are paying.  I acknowledge support from Independent Deputies and from Sinn F&eacute;in in this regard.  Some people think we should go much further in respect of the local property tax.  That is a valid opinion and a point for another day.  I believe that while the tax is there, we want some amendment to it.  This is a reasonable and modest proposal.  It was not intended to be very broad-ranging.  It was meant to be limited and confined.<\/p>  <p>  I must respond to some of the issues the Minister of State raised in his script, which was obviously considered in detail.

The ESB used to supply electricity but it has been forced, through competition, to divest over 50% of its assets to allow competition into the market.

It will never get off the ground because of the way the Government has gone about its business.  It will never be a valid commercial organisation.  EUROSTAT knows this and the Irish Water plan for the next seven years makes no mention of going back to EUROSTAT because it knows it will be laughed out of court.  The Department of Finance officials, based on the memos we have read, always knew there would be a problem with EUROSTAT.  The Government has tried several things to tweak it, including by means of the provision of the water conservation grant, but people saw through that.  It tried to exempt people from water rates to reduce their cost base to get it through EUROSTAT but every little trick it has pulled has failed.

Before I outline the findings of the committee and the recommendations included in the report, I thank, on behalf of other members of the committee, the various witnesses who came before us and gave of their time to discuss this issue.  Their engagement helped the committee and gave us very valuable information and insight.<\/p><p>The background of the report is worth an explanation and will contextualise today's debate.  In January 2014 the European Commission published a communication which focused on addressing the consequences of the disenfranchisement of Union citizens who exercise their right to free movement across the Union.  This was published in the context of EU citizens exercising their right to free movement between one country and another within the EU, which is a core freedom for citizens.<\/p><p>It is an interesting perspective because whereas we tend to think of our rights as Irish citizens, in this case, the European Commission, as the guardian of the treaties, has addressed a distinctly national competency in the context of the wider concept of EU citizenship.  The Commission has expressed concern that member states are failing to give voting rights in government elections to their citizens who live in other member states.  It is worried that this failure might impinge on citizens' freedom of movement.  It has cited Ireland and four other member states for failing to provide rights to their citizens who live abroad.<\/p> <p> Although the European Commission policy document exists simply to provide guidance to member states and does not have any legal effect, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs could not ignore its findings and decided it would be worthwhile for it to consider the issue.  That was the impetus for the work of the committee, which explored the issue by holding meetings with EU officials to explore the Commission's rationale for its view.  We also heard from representatives of other EU member states, including academics and ambassadors, to find out what approaches they are taking.  The committee's work was timely because the Constitutional Convention was also considering this issue at the time.  It had reported to the Government in November 2013.  Deputies might recall that the convention recommended at that time that voting rights for Irish citizens abroad should be extended to Presidential elections.<\/p> <p> I will set out what has happened since that time.  In March of this year, the Government launched a new diaspora policy document, in which the issue of voting rights in Irish elections was addressed.  The document acknowledges that the introduction of such rights is challenging because a range of issues would need to be addressed and managed in the context of any extension of the franchise.  In particular, it mentions that the number of Irish citizens living outside this State is huge.  I do not think this should be a reason for not granting the right to vote to our citizens who live abroad.  If anything, it should have the opposite effect.  Following on from the publication of Ireland's diaspora policy document, and in line with the response of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, to the joint committee's report, the Minister has undertaken to analyse the various issues associated with the possibility of extending voting rights to Irish citizens who live abroad.  I think we are all very glad that this welcome development is taking place.<\/p> <p> This debate is long overdue.  In an increasingly globalised world, where more and more countries are granting voting rights to their citizens abroad, Ireland is out of step with many of its European partners.  In that context, it would be remiss of us not to debate this issue, particularly in view of the recent wave of Irish emigration.  We have seen various waves of emigration over the decades, but I think we all recognise and appreciate that several hundred thousand people have left this country in the past ten years.  There must be a way to balance the rights of Irish citizens who live abroad with the rights of Irish citizens at home.<\/p> <p> Many people will wonder how engaged with Irish affairs are Irish citizens who live abroad and will question whether those who live elsewhere are really interested in the issues affecting this country on a daily basis.  If we ever wanted to see how engaged our diaspora can be, the referendum on marriage equality last May provided a fine example.  Thousands of Irish emigrants returned home to vote.  They came from as far afield as Africa to cast their votes in the referendum.  More than 70,000 people retweeted #hometovote on Twitter over a 24-hour period.  It is clear that many Irish people living abroad want to have an ongoing link in Irish elections.  That they are living abroad now does not mean they will never return to our shores.  The example of the marriage equality referendum shows that people living abroad still want to participate in the democratic process.<\/p> <p> This is not just a question of rights; it is also about the emotive nature of the issue.  While we were producing our report, we spoke to various groups representing Irish people who live abroad, including Irish in Britain and Votes for Irish Citizens Abroad.  They explained why it matters to them to be involved.  As an ex-emigrant who lived abroad for 17 years, I appreciate how important it is to the members of the diaspora that they do not feel neglected by their home country.  It is clear from talking to many members of diaspora groups that they feel somewhat rebuffed by the failure to extend the right to vote to them, especially given that other EU member states have given their emigrants the right to vote in national elections.  Deputies will be aware that UK citizens living in Ireland have the right to vote not only in Irish general elections, but also in UK general elections if they have not been living abroad for more than 15 years.  Many people are aware of the rights that exist in other member states and want them to be extended to Irish citizens.<\/p> <p> I will turn now to the report of the joint committee, which received a number of submissions during its hearings.  We heard that Ireland is among a minority of member states that have not extended voting rights to citizens living abroad.  Although electoral systems remain a national competence, there is a consensus in the academic literature that a case might very well be taken against the Irish Government at the European Court of Justice to challenge the restriction on voting rights and thereby force the State to act.  This is something that could be coming down the line in the near future.  That is another reason we need to address this matter.  It is being addressed in other large and small European countries, many of which have been able to design systems that allow their residents who live abroad to vote.  Countries like Italy and France have given emigrants the right to vote in specific reserved constituencies like the North America constituency or the northern Europe constituency.  Citizens of countries like France and Spain who live in various parts of the world have the right to vote for specific candidates to represent them in their national assemblies and parliaments.<\/p> <p> We heard from ambassadors about the various voting systems that other countries have come up with.  Emigrants might have to go to their countries' embassies or, in the case of countries such as Estonia, are able to vote online.  These secure systems are used by countries to give their diasporas the right to vote and to ensure people can mark their ballot papers validly.  One of the recommendations we have made is that the various systems that are already in place in other countries should be compared to see what can be learned from them.  There is no doubt that we have a very large diaspora.  If we are to give voting rights to Irish citizens living abroad, we need to examine carefully issues like the definition of \"citizenship\", the time limits that might apply to the right to vote and the creation of reserved constituencies, as I outlined earlier.  We believe voting systems can be designed without having a disproportionate effect on the outcome of national polls.<\/p> <p> Wide support has been expressed for the Constitutional Convention's report on voting rights in Presidential elections for Irish citizens who live abroad.  We believe a debate on the extension of voting rights to parliamentary elections is the next step that should be taken.  In reaching a consensus on this issue, we also considered the issue of the large diaspora, the concept of citizenship and the possible disenfranchisement of Irish citizens.  We made it clear that there is a need to accept it is not possible to separate the issue of voting rights for Irish citizens living in the EU from the issue of voting rights for Irish citizens living elsewhere.  The committee made a few significant recommendations.  First, it recommended that the Government should accept the principle that voting rights should be extended to Irish citizens living abroad.  Second, it proposed that a system that would be workable in an Irish context should be designed.  Third, it recommended that an electoral commission should be established to implement the first two recommendations.<\/p> <p> We sent our report to the Departments of the Taoiseach and the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I note from the reply received from the Minister, Deputy Kelly, that work on the establishment of an electoral commission has begun, with the Department recently concluding a process of public consultation.  It is hoped that hearings on the draft consultation paper on the establishment of an electoral commission in Ireland will get under way shortly.  I understand that this body will publish a report on this issue and I look forward to reading it.  We must remember that Ireland is not unique in considering these issues.  Many member states have already addressed these matters, so it can be done.  I know that the large size of our diaspora is a concern for many people, but I remind them that other countries with high rates of emigration, such as Italy and Mexico, have dealt with this issue in their own way and given their expats the right to vote.  The UK allows its citizens who are living abroad to vote for the first 15 years after they leave that country.<\/p><p>Italy reserves seats in its parliament for those abroad.  There are numerous solutions and I have no doubt we can arrive at one that would work in an Irish context.  All we have to do is sit down and work one out.<\/p> <p> It is worthwhile to reflect on the fact that we have one of the youngest populations in the European Union.  Our young people travel and live abroad and many return having spent several years gaining experience.  We all expect and want those people to feel as if they belong to this country and that they have a link with it.  We cannot afford to neglect them or ignore the fact that their rights are being diminished because we cannot put a system in place or we have not tried to put a system in place to include their votes in our franchise.<\/p> <p> We can do this.  Other countries have led the way.  If we do not do something, the danger is that we will be brought to court.  It is time to act.  I encourage the Government to do so, to take on board the recommendations of the committee and to extend the right to vote to Irish citizens living abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102300010#H01900","speaker":"1076","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445595900,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I am glad to take this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly.  I thank Deputy Hannigan and the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs for their report, Voting Rights of Irish Citizens Abroad.  It is good to have an opportunity to discuss the issues raised in the report and update Deputies on related developments since the report was published in November 2014.  I commend the committee on its work and on the way in which it has given the opportunity for all stakeholders to engage and express, on the record, their views and opinions in respect of this matter.<\/p>  <p>  The background to the committee report is its decision to consider a European Commission recommendation published in January 2014.  The Commission recommendation addressed voting rights of EU citizens in member states.  The Commission made a number of recommendations based on its view that a link could be made between voting rights and the right to free movement within the European Union.  It may be useful if I briefly outlined the background to the Commission recommendation and the view taken on it in Ireland.  Earlier research undertaken by the Commission had drawn attention to the fact that some EU citizens lose the right to vote in their national elections when they leave home and take up residence in another member state.  This could be true in the case of Ireland, for example, as our voter registration laws require voters to be ordinarily resident in their constituencies.  EU citizens in these circumstances can find themselves in a situation where they do not have a vote for the national parliament either in their home member state or in their member state of residence.  The Commission came to the view that national policies which disenfranchise citizens in this way may also be regarded as limiting the right of EU citizens to move and reside freely within the EU.<\/p>  <p>  When consulted, we indicated to the Commission that we did not share the view that the electoral system in Ireland could be regarded as a serious impediment to free movement within the EU.  I note that the joint committee came to the same conclusion in its report.  In any event, electoral systems in the member states are a core national competence.  Irish electoral law makes provision for citizens of other member states resident in Ireland to vote in D&aacute;il elections where there are matching arrangements that allow our citizens to vote in their parliamentary elections.  This is the position, for example, in the case of Irish citizens resident in the United Kingdom and British citizens resident in this State.  In any event, the Commission pressed ahead with the publication of its recommendation.  The Commission recommended that EU citizens who show a continuing interest in the affairs of their home member State should be facilitated in voting at their national elections.  This continuing interest would be demonstrated by individuals re-applying at agreed intervals to remain on the national register in their home member state.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs undertook to consider the Commission recommendation in greater detail.  The report we are debating today sets out the committee's conclusions.  The joint committee recommended that the Government should accept the principle that voting rights should be extended to Irish citizens abroad, that it should proceed to design a system that would be workable in an Irish context and that an electoral commission be established to implement these recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of voting by Irish citizens living abroad has been considered by various Oireachtas committees.  They came to the view that the existing electoral arrangements in Ireland should be maintained.  Notwithstanding this position, the Government established the Constitutional Convention to consider, among other issues, giving citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections at Irish embassies, or otherwise.  The wider agenda of extending voting rights to Irish citizens resident outside the State in other elections or in referendums was not part of the programme for Government.  The Constitutional Convention undertook the work involved and reported to the Houses of the Oireachtas in November 2013 in its fifth report.  The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs acknowledged in the report that issues of concern to the committee had also been considered by the Convention.<\/p>  <p>  The findings reached by the Convention are well known at this stage.  The members of the Convention came out clearly in favour of citizens resident outside the State, including those in Northern Ireland, having the right to vote in presidential elections.  However, they were more divided when considering the category of citizens to whom the franchise should be extended.  While 36% said that the right should be given to all citizens living outside the island of Ireland, 53% said that this right should only be given to those citizens who had lived in Ireland at some stage.  A further 11% were undecided on this question.  They were also divided on the question of whether there should be a time limit on how long citizens could be resident outside the island of Ireland and continue to qualify for a vote.<\/p>  <p>  In launching the Global Irish: Ireland's Diaspora Policy document last March, the Government outlined its position on the recommendations contained in the fifth report of the Convention.  The Government acknowledged that an extension of voting rights to Irish citizens outside the State would be welcomed by many members of the diaspora.  The Government accepted that doing so would allow them to deepen their engagement with Ireland and play a more active role in Irish society.  On the other hand, the Government indicated that it would be challenging to introduce and manage.  The Government decided that before any decision could be made on the holding of a referendum, a range of policy, legal and practical issues would need to be considered and deeply analysed in the first instance.  The potential costs arising would also need to be fully analysed and considered.  With this in mind, the Government asked the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, in co-operation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs, to analyse these issues and report back to Government.  This work has commenced.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs report also identified the need for careful examination of the issues involved in extending the franchise to Irish citizens resident outside the State.  The committee reported that these issues included the definition of citizenship and a reflection on whether a time limit should apply to entitlement to vote.  It is worth reflecting briefly on these points and on some of the other considerations that arise as well.<\/p>  <p>  There is general acceptance that the diaspora would welcome an extension of the franchise to them in presidential elections.  Yet we do not know how many Irish citizens make up that diaspora.  A conservative estimate from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade suggests that approximately 1.65 million Irish citizens are resident abroad.  When the Northern Ireland population of 1.8 million is added to this, we have a total of 3.5 million citizens resident outside the State.  These figures exclude those who might have an entitlement to Irish citizenship but who have not taken up that entitlement to date.  Indeed, some have estimated the Irish diaspora could be in the region of 70 million.  While many of these people may not qualify for Irish citizenship, some would.  At issue is how many.  Should we extend the vote to all with an entitlement to Irish citizenship or should it be confined to those born on the island of Ireland?  These are the types of questions that arise and need to be examined.  We need to be cognisant of the potentially large numbers involved.  Furthermore, we need to consider the impact, the cost and the type of arrangements that would need to be put in place to accommodate any extension of the franchise.<\/p>  <p>  Other countries have a time dimension to their citizens' entitlement to vote when resident abroad.  In Australian federal elections, for example, citizens who are absent for up to six years can be registered as overseas voters.  After that, the enrolment can be renewed annually on application to the Australian Electoral Commission.  For general elections in New Zealand, citizens who have lived in New Zealand for more than one year continuously and who have visited New Zealand in the past three years can be registered as overseas voters.  Closer to home, UK and Northern Irish citizens can register as overseas voters for Westminster and European elections.  To do so, they have to be registered as residents in the UK within the last 15 years.  We need to consider whether to have a time dimension in any arrangements to be introduced in Ireland.  If we decide to include such a dimension, then we must consider whether it should be for five, ten or 20 years.<\/p><p> An important dimension to our considerations is the position of Irish citizens resident in Northern Ireland.  Ireland and Northern Ireland have a unique constitutional relationship since the Good Friday Agreement and any consideration of the franchise issue would need to be considered fully in that context.  This would include considering the political sensitivities there may be about legislating for the electorate in the North to vote in an election in this jurisdiction and the need to ensure any proposal is fully consistent with the State's recognition of the current constitutional status of Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p> There are also many practical and operational challenges to consider.  Arrangements for the registration of new voters and for voting by those voters would need to be thought through.  Logistical and cost implications of various options would need to be assessed.  The integrity of any new arrangements introduced must be foremost in our considerations.  As I stated, the Government has committed to undertaking the analysis required and that work is under way.  When it is completed, decisions will be made as to whether proposals for change will be put to the electorate in a referendum.<\/p> <p> The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs also recommended that an electoral commission be established to implement its recommendations.  The programme for Government contained a commitment to set up an electoral commission.  A recommendation made by the Convention on the Constitution to establish an electoral commission was also accepted by Government in April 2014.  I will outline for Deputies the steps that have been taken on the establishment of an electoral commission since the publication of the joint committee report.<\/p> <p> On 27 January last, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, published his consultation paper on the establishment of an electoral commission in Ireland.  The consultation paper examines the present system of electoral administration and its costs.  It sets out principles of good governance to inform the setting up of an electoral commission.  It analyses recommendations made by other bodies, including political parties, Oireachtas committees and academics.  It also considers experience internationally with similar structures.<\/p> <p> When he published his paper, the Minister asked the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht to undertake a public consultation process based on 11 key questions set out in the consultation paper.  These cover the commission's structures and functions, reporting arrangements, its relationship with other bodies currently involved in electoral administration, as well as practical matters, including staffing and funding arrangements.<\/p> <p> The committee engaged in a wide-ranging consultation with interested parties between March and July.  I understand that it is due to report back to the Minister shortly with recommendations.  This will inform further the consideration of the issues arising in the preparation of the electoral commission Bill.  It should be understood, however, that there is a significant amount of work to be undertaken in moving this forward.  The Minister made it clear when publishing his consultation paper that establishment of an electoral commission will take a number of years to complete.  The development of legislation is a necessary first step but we need to do it right.<\/p> <p> I commend Deputy Hannigan and the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs on their report and their engagement and work in this matter.  They have highlighted a number of factors that need to be borne in mind as we undertake the analysis on extending the franchise to citizens resident outside the State.  As I have stated, that analysis is under way and will be completed in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102300012#K00200","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445596500,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response and thank Deputy Hannigan for the way in which he set out the committee's position.  I was the Fianna F&aacute;il representative on the committee.  Like others, we participated in a full and frank way in an effort to improve the position as it relates to the capacity of Irish citizens abroad to continue to participate in our electoral democracy.<\/p>  <p>  The right to vote is something that was hard won, and that should underpin all our views on this matter.  When citizens, in many cases through no fault of their own, find themselves outside the State to work, live and have gainful employment, they should not ultimately be disenfranchised of the right to continue to participate in the development of this democracy.  Many of their forefathers were part of the founding of the State, and it would be right that we in elected office try to ensure for the future that this issue is addressed.<\/p>  <p>  My party fully supports the recommendations of the committee.  We are very much of a mind that there is a necessity to establish the electoral commission that would ensure the implementation of the recommendations set out, namely, that the Government accepts the principle of extending voting rights to Irish citizens abroad and that it should proceed to design a system that would be workable in an Irish context.  I do not want to minimise the complications associated with that given our unique electoral system.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Irish citizens who reside in the European Union, my party believes we must find some way to ensure the rights derived from their citizenship, not only of Ireland but of the European Union, are respected.  Fianna F&aacute;il agrees with the European Commission recommendations that in instances in which member states' policies limit the rights of nationals to vote in national elections based exclusively on a residence condition, member states should enable their nationals who make use of their right to free movement and residence within the European Union to demonstrate a continuing interest in the political life in the member state of which they are nationals, including through an application to remain registered on the electoral roll, and by doing so to retain their right to vote.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission proposal to make it easier for Irish citizens within the Union to retain their voting rights in Irish elections is a welcome development.  However, the implementation of this proposal must be examined carefully before any rash decisions are taken merely to meet the concerns expressed by the Commission.  That is why an electoral commission of our own would be best placed to tease that out.  I was taken to some extent by the surveys to which the Minister of State referred.  We should have moved beyond that position and should leave it to an electoral commission to implement the recommendations as set out.<\/p>  <p>  It must be acknowledged that Ireland is unusual in the increasingly globalised world in not allowing the majority of its overseas citizens any say in the political process.  Members of the armed forces and the diplomatic service are able to vote in D&aacute;il elections, while only NUI and Trinity College graduates can vote in a certain section within Seanad elections.  Beyond these exceptions, only those who are ordinarily resident in Ireland may vote.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, approximately 115 countries and territories, including almost all developed nations, have systems in place to allow their citizens abroad to vote.  This number is growing.  Even countries with high numbers of citizens abroad, such as Italy, as the Chairman of the committee stated, the Dominican Republic and Mexico, have recently allowed their expatriates to vote.  Citizens of the United States, for example, can vote no matter how long they stay away, while citizens of Britain are disqualified after 15 years.  Some countries, such as France, reserve seats in their parliaments for citizens who live abroad, while others vote in the constituencies in which they used to live.  If we look at those countries and examine the systems they have invoked, we can learn from them.  If Ireland is to embrace its citizens abroad, we must look at the logistics of how our voting system can be made to work to embrace the opinions of these citizens.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the idea of having a permanent, independent electoral commission which would be in charge of running all elections and referendums.  We welcome the committee's recommendation to establish an electoral commission and to design a system that would be workable in the Irish context.<\/p>  <p>  We believe it is vital for democracy that Irish citizens who are entitled to vote in our elections can vote.  If people engage in the most important act of our democratic tradition, that of voting, this will enhance our democracy by consolidating the legitimacy of our parliamentary democracy.<\/p>  <p>  It is no secret that I and, I imagine, many others in this House would also like to see a strengthening of our parliamentary democracy.  While we are not unique, we are certainly among a small minority within the European Union where our Parliament is extremely weak and the Executive in effect holds all the aces.  In the long term, we need to address this imbalance.  It would improve and enhance the work of this House.  It would make the House more reflective of society at large and would, perhaps, help to regain and rebuild the trust between Parliament generally and the citizens.  Perhaps that work can be done by the Constitutional Convention at a later stage but it is certainly something that needs to be addressed in tandem with extending voting rights to citizens outside the State.<\/p><p>Qualitative studies seem to suggest there has been a loss of connection between parliamentarians and citizens.  This is evident from the level of disenchantment over what might be referred to as the structures of Parliament.  The Minister of State's Department might consider giving more powers to Members of Parliament in a broader way rather than having the Executive effectively retaining all the control, with much of the work in the Houses merely consisting of rubber-stamping.<\/p> <p> We believe the recommendation by the committee to accept in principle that voting rights should be extended to Irish citizens abroad could be facilitated through our embassy network within the European Union in the first instance.  It would ensure Irish citizens living and working outside Ireland, but within the European Union, would register with their local embassy.  This would be an important part of ensuring embassies are in a position to remain in contact with and track the activities of our citizens abroad.  The register should be required to be updated annually.  Citizens seeking to vote from abroad should be obliged to select the constituency to which they have the closest connection.  I have no doubt that establishing the criteria to ensure this process would be fair and balanced, and would not result in gerrymandering of any kind, would be contentious.   This is important to prevent fraud and would act as a control measure.  None the less, Fianna F&aacute;il accepts that all relevant applications could be submitted electronically.  Since we live in an environment in which electronic communication is far more prevalent, particularly among those who travel, an electronic submission would provide an appropriate means of access.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il is broadly supportive of the recommendations outlined by the European Commission and those of the committee and it hopes the Government will use this opportunity to implement reform of our electoral system that will broaden participation, establish an independent electoral commission and, for the first time, grant substantial voting rights to all our citizens within the European Union.  We hope it will consider extending these rights to citizens farther afield.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102300013#L00200","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445597100,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this report, which was brought forward by the Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  Everybody agrees the issue is, and should be, under review and that some efforts need to be made by a commission to examine the feasibility and logistics of including the wider electorate.  There are, of course, implications.  The committee discussed this at length.  Different countries, including those throughout the European Union, have different requirements and varying means of dealing with the issue.<\/p>  <p>  It was suggested during the debate by the committee that there would be no appreciable effect on the outcome of elections if the vote were extended to all Irish people overseas in a general election.  Of course, that is not necessarily the case because there would be an impact on an election outcome.  Depending on which end of the spectrum one is standing, this could be good or bad; we do not know how it would work.  I disagreed with the suggestion put forward by an expert that the impact would be negligible.  It could be quite considerable, particularly in a closely fought general election in which 1%, or a fraction of a percentage, of a vote count would make a difference.  That said, the principle still needs to be examined with a view to extending the franchise to people outside the country, be it over a specified period or longer period, with the objective of having registration on an annual basis.  That seems to be a possibility.<\/p>  <p>  Presidential elections need to be examined in the first instance as they are the most appropriate in this regard.  The Minister of State mentioned potential obstacles.  They are not beyond resolution.  They were examined by the committee.  It was felt in the final analysis that there were sufficient grounds, bearing in mind all the practicalities and possibilities, to try to come up with a proposal that would be logical, effective, acceptable and in consort with the Constitution.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission was very anxious to move forward with this legislation on the grounds of restriction of freedom of movement.  I am afraid that some developments in Europe in the meantime seem to indicate to me that freedom of movement is not always allowed throughout the Union.  I am a strong supporter of the European concept and project and will remain so but I believe some of the sights we have seen across Europe since the publication of this report are not reassuring.  I refer, of course, to the treatment of refugees and to those who are known as economic migrants.  There seems to be a bias against the latter, as if economic migration were a serious transgression of some description.  We should be very familiar with the concept in this country.  Our people needed to emigrate for economic reasons and they were glad of the opportunity.  At a recent meeting in Luxembourg, I expressed the opinion that economic migration was not a cardinal sin or international transgression of any description but a matter of necessity for many people.  It was a necessity for us.  I stated I did not see the logic of isolating economic immigrants and of the restriction of their movement and of the right to move throughout the European Union, even though they are not European citizens.  The images of razor wire preventing people from crossing from one state into another do not necessarily reside particularly easily with any of us, nor should they.  Although I am a strong supporter of all the European concepts and the European project in general, I am certainly not a supporter of what leads to that kind of imagery.  When the European Union is issuing instructions and expressing opinions, collectively or individually across Europe, it should take account of the need to apply the principles that it espouses to itself also.  Former Commissioner Peter Sutherland has expressed strong views on this subject, as have many Members of this House.  It would be wrong to allow this occasion to pass without commenting on it.<\/p>  <p>  On the recommendation of the Commission, we are going in the right direction.  I do not know how the international element of the register would be checked.  I expressed this view during the discussions of the committee.  For as long as I have been around, we have not been able to check the register properly in this country.  This has been the case for at least 40 years.  I do not know how it will happen eventually if there is to be an international aspect to the register.  It is essential that we find a means of ensuring the electoral register is updated regularly and systematically and that, in the event of an extension of voting rights to citizens in Northern Ireland, across Europe or elsewhere abroad, for whatever purpose, be it short or long term, the manner of its compilation will be a major consideration.  The logistics will have to be dealt with if the proposal is to be successful.<\/p>  <p>  The electoral commission has already been referred to.  I am sorry Deputy Timmy Dooley has left the House.  He stated that we need electoral reform and that the Parliament needs greater powers.  Over the years, it has come to my attention that when parties that have been in government, particularly those in government for a long time, find themselves in opposition, for whatever reason, they always believe it would be a great idea to give more power to the Parliament and less to the Executive.  I do not know why this is the case.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny, and I have seen times come and go in which parties' enthusiasm for this concept seemed to wane somewhat when they found themselves back in government, for one reason or another.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il has stated that if it is returned to Government after the next general election it will extend further powers to the Parliament.  I take that with the proverbial grain of salt for the simple reason that it did little in that regard when in government for a lengthy period prior to the election of this Government.  It could be said that Members of this House had less power than ever before during the period when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government and that what little power was available to them was diminished on a regular basis.  I do not propose to, nor should I in this particular context, go into the detail of all the reasons I hold that view.  However, should the opportunity to do so present in the future, I will take it.<\/p> <p> Lest people listening in to this debate would think that the current Administration restricts the rights of the Opposition and prohibits this Parliament from doing its work, I must point out that it does not.  The level of participation by this Parliament in terms of debates, committee meetings - including pre-legislative scrutiny of Bills - and debates on finance and social welfare Bills has been far greater than that of any other Parliament in the history of this State.  This type of participation was not a feature of previous Administrations.  <\/p> <p> In regard to people complaining about their inability to get replies in this House, I have raised a number of questions in this House over the past few years.  Under the previous Administration, it was very unusual if I did not get, on a daily basis, 14 or 15 refusals of replies to what were legitimate parliamentary questions, the answers to which I knew were readily available in the respective Departments.  I refute the allegation that the current Administration has restricted the democratic process of this Parliament; it has not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102300014#M00200","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1445597700,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I welcome this report and appreciate the work involved in producing it, particularly the work of my colleagues Deputy Crowe and Senator Reilly, who are members of the committee, and Ms Lynn Boylan, MEP, who gave evidence to the committee.<\/p>  <p>  On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I welcome the recommendation of this report that voting rights be extended to Irish citizens living abroad and that a voting system that would work in an Irish context be designed.  I would be concerned if people outside were of the view that this issue was being considered in the context of its impact from a party political point of view.  That is not the case.  This is not about political parties or political party interests.  <\/p>  <p>   While the report was drafted by the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs following a communication and recommendation from the European Commission which criticised Ireland&rsquo;s disenfranchisement of citizens living in other EU countries, it is impossible to ignore the wider context and to take voting rights of Irish citizens living in another EU state in isolation.  This report, although welcome, is nothing new.  We have heard all it has to say before on several occasions.  What was missing previously and, I fear, will be missing now is action from the Government.  The Government needs to take this issue seriously.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in believes in the core republican principle of equal citizenship and, therefore, the right of Irish citizens living in the North and abroad to vote.  We have campaigned on this issue for many years.  We unequivocally support the right of all Irish citizens of voting age to vote for the Irish President, regardless of where they are living.  Furthermore, we believe that Irish citizens living outside this State should have the right to appropriate representation in the D&aacute;il by way of reserved constituency, with voting rights subject to presentation of a valid passport and regular registration requirements.  We also argue that they should be entitled to representation in a reformed Seanad.  It was mentioned previously that this would be difficult to administer.  However, it is currently being done in many other countries.<\/p>  <p>  In this debate, too many people are ignoring that not only can Irish citizens abroad not vote but citizens on this island living in the Six Counties cannot do so.  The Good Friday Agreement states that this Government recognises the right of all people born in the North to identify as Irish citizens, if they so wish.  We should not be treating those people as second-class Irish citizens.  They are not second-class citizens: they are Irish citizens who should have full voting rights.  Equality should never be compromised.  We should be building an inclusive Ireland rather an exclusive one.  We should be reaching out to everyone on this island, including Unionists, and asking them to join our political process.  We are a family on this island.<\/p>  <p>  The failure to extend voting rights to citizens in the North arises, I would argue, out of the deeply partitionist mindset of successive Governments.  We need to open up our minds and move on from this.  In September 2013, 78% of members of the Constitutional Convention voted in favour of giving citizens resident abroad a vote in presidential elections and 73% voted in favour of giving such a vote to Irish citizens resident in the North.<\/p>  <p>  In March of this year my colleagues Deputies Gerry Adams and Se&aacute;n Crowe brought forward a Bill which would have granted presidential voting rights to citizens in the North and abroad. While the Bill was accepted, it was said that it would have to be put to a referendum, but there has been no move to establish that referendum - more Government inaction.  There is a huge demand among Irish citizens to amend Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann to give Irish citizens in the North and abroad the right the vote.  The Government needs to face up to this democratic demand, which was overwhelmingly supported by the Constitutional Convention.  We need to end this practice of depriving Irish people of the right to influence their destiny and our destiny.  Do we fear Irish citizens who live abroad or in the North?<\/p>  <p>  I note that the report mentions that eventually a case may be taken to the European Court of Justice challenging the restriction on voting rights, following which this Government would be forced to act.<\/p><p>We should not wait to be told by the European Court of Justice that we are infringing on the rights of citizens; we should act.<\/p> <p> A total of 115 countries have systems in place to allow their emigrants to vote, so we are not reinventing the wheel.  I do not accept that we should shy away from it because of the complexities surrounding the issue.  It has been done before in countries all over the world.  We should ensure we catch up with best international practice.<\/p> <p> In Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s policy paper on the global Irish, we detailed our support for the introduction of appropriate diasporic parliamentary representation in the D&aacute;il by way of reserved constituency, with a valid passport and regular registration requirement, as well as representation for citizens in the North.  Both Northern and diasporic citizens should also be represented in a reformed Seanad.  Citizens who are resident outside the State should also have a vote in presidential elections.  We suggested that postal voting for those living outside Ireland, which could be done through the relevant embassies and consulates and made subject to appropriate safeguards against electoral fraud, would be the best system for voting.

I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  It is clear that voting rights are dear to the hearts of many Irish citizens resident outside the State.  We all acknowledge that, as does the Government.  In terms of some of the main considerations that arise for analysis, it is important that we weigh up the implications of the numbers that might be involved in extending the franchise in presidential elections to Irish citizens resident outside the State.  We must also consider whether a time limit should apply to the entitlement of those citizens to vote and, if so, for how many years.  The joint committee also mentioned in its report the need to consider such matters.<\/p>  <p>  Various Deputies referred to the fact that the registration of voters resident outside the State raises questions about how that might be done efficiently, but we must also ensure the integrity of the voter registration system, which is fundamental to any democratic voting system.  Consideration, too, would need to be given to the way in which voters might be allowed to vote.  Different methods are used around the world, including voting at diplomatic missions, postal voting and e-voting.  All of the options must be closely examined, as there are complex and interrelated issues of both principle and practicality.  In its consideration of the Fifth Report of the Constitutional Convention, the Government decided that the full range of issues involved would need to be analysed and costed before any decision could be made on the holding of a referendum.  That work has commenced.<\/p>  <p>  I also outlined in my contribution the developments this year on the establishment of an electoral commission.  The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the consultation paper published earlier this year is expected shortly.  That will provide an invaluable input into the preparation of the electoral commission Bill.  I stress again, however, that the establishment of an electoral commission will take a number of years to complete.<\/p>  <p>  Various points were raised in the debate.  Deputy Colreavy accused the Government of inaction.  I do not agree with him because, as I outlined, the issue must be carefully examined and the work is under way.  A deep analysis is being carried out and every aspect of the matter must be considered.<\/p>  <p>  To date, the European Court of Justice has not interfered with any national competence in relation to electoral systems.  It is important to state that currently the EU has no legal competence in regard to national election systems.  It is not an EU law but a recommendation based on the perception that electoral laws impact on free movement within the Union.

I will come back to the substance of his contribution.  I also thank other Members of the House - Deputy Timmy Dooley from Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Michael Colreavy from Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy Bernard Durkan from Fine Gael.  I further acknowledge the contribution of the other members of the joint committee to the preparation of the report.  It is a cross-party report.  We managed to come to an agreement among ourselves.  I am a member of a Government party, but today my role is as a member of the committee, which I am representing, so I do not feel bound to adopt the Government line.  That will become a little more obvious as my conclusion progresses.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the initiative in the House that allows time in the Chamber to debate the important work that is done by various committees of the House.  It is important because it means that committee reports do not just gather dust on shelves but get an airing on the floor of the Chamber, which is an improvement.  To return to one of the points Deputy Dooley made, it does show that there have been improvements in the way we operate as a House.  We would not be here on a Friday at all if it were not for the changes introduced by the Government in order to make the D&aacute;il a bit more democratic and accountable, and to allow Members from Government parties and Opposition parties to discuss and debate Bills and committee reports.  The debate has shown that the issue of voting rights is of concern to all parties in this House.<\/p>  <p>  From our discussions we are aware of the concerns and interest of many members of the diaspora.  While I was following the debate on the floor, I was also looking at the Twitter feed.  I note that many people are commenting on the debate who are watching from all over the world.  A level of disappointment was expressed at the lack of Members in the House.  I know that we are represented by all of the main parties here today, but it is a bit disappointing that we did not have a greater level of engagement on this issue.  Many important points were raised.  Deputy Dooley, on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, outlined the importance of finding some way to give our citizens living abroad the right to vote.<\/p><p>He referred to how UK and US citizens have the right to vote and how, as far as Fianna F&aacute;il is concerned, it is time we extended voting rights to our citizens abroad.  I very much welcome this.<\/p> <p> Deputy Michael Colreavy made the important point that equality should never be compromised, a point with which we all agree.  Several Members said we need to be cognisant of the impact of this proposal.  I am not sure that we have to be.  As far as I am concerned, citizens have the right to vote.  For what and for whom they vote is up to them.  That is the democratic system in which we live.  So what if they vote for a different party?  It is their right to do so.  They are either full citizens of our State or they are not.  They cannot be half-citizens.  It is simple as that.  We should not fear our citizens living abroad but encourage them to vote and explain the issues to them.  We should not patronise them to the extent that we think they would not understand what is going on in our country.  We should have confidence in their ability to make the right decision to vote accordingly.<\/p> <p> I have known the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, for many years and I respect the job he is doing.  I know he will have been briefed on this issue by his civil servants.  However, that was not a can-do speech from him.  It was a speech that gave many reasons as to why this will take time.  The language used referred to how we need to be cognisant of the large numbers involved, the cost, the impact and the integrity of the systems involved.  It stated there are complex issues that need to be closely examined and the establishment of the commission would require several years to be completed.  I am disappointed by this.  We can move more quickly.  Other countries have moved quickly on this.  I fear we will be hammered into this through a court action.  We should lead and show our citizens abroad that they are part of the Irish nation, that we respect their views and that we want them involved in our society.  As Deputy Michael Colreavy said, we should not be waiting; we should be acting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102300016#O01600","speaker":"1076","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445598900,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1445598900,"counter":73,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 12.25 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 3 November 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
