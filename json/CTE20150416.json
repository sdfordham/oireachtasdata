It concerns a cross-Border broadband project which aimed to provide high-speed connectivity on a line between Belfast and Dublin.  The project promoter was Bytel Networks Limited.  The Bytel project was grant-aided by the EU-funded INTERREG III programme under a measure designed to improve inter-regional economic infrastructure.  The Special EU Programme Body, SEUPB, was accountable to the Government, the European Commission and the Northern Ireland Executive for the management and delivery of the INTERREG III programme, which ran from 2000 to 2006.  SEUPB appointed the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, DETI, in Northern Ireland and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as joint implementing agents for the measure.  <br\/><br\/>In October 2004, the two Departments offered grant funding of &euro;4.3 million to Bytel, based on estimated total project costs of &euro;12.4 million.  At just under 35% of the project cost, the grant offered was almost the maximum payable, and the grant was paid in full between November 2004 and November 2005.  Subsequently, it was found that almost none of the project spend was eligible for EU grant assistance, and that the actual project costs were significantly lower than the projected &euro;12.4 million.  There were major failings at each stage in the handling of the project.  The project proposal only narrowly passed the assessment for entry to the EU programme.  There were weaknesses in the project appraisal, including weaknesses in the definition of what was to be delivered by Bytel.  There was little evidence to support the projected project costs.  The strength of a proposed partnership between Bytel and a company called Aurora Telecom was also not probed adequately.  When Aurora withdrew from the project and was replaced by another service provider, the nature of the project changed significantly and the project costs fell.  This should have led the Departments to reappraise the project and recalculate the grant payable, but this did not happen.  <br\/><br\/>The two Departments were responsible for checking and approving Bytel&rsquo;s claims for grant payments.  The first such payment included &euro;1.3 million for the purchase of equipment that was to have been paid for from Bytel&rsquo;s resources.  That equipment, bought from a sister company in the Bytel group, was not ultimately used in the project.  There is a doubt as to the market value of the equipment.  The final claim for &euro;2.07 million contained no backup or verification evidence but, despite this, was paid in full.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources considered that it had no direct role in this area and it relied on DETI and on other advisers for assurance that expenditure claimed by the project promoter was valid.  In circumstances in which it was relying on others for assurance about the validity of payments, the approach taken by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources showed, in my view, a lack of awareness of the risks.  There was no evidence to show that it had put appropriate controls or checks in place.<br\/><br\/>The Departments missed an early opportunity to identify problems with the project.  Whistleblowing allegations were made to DETI by a director of the Bytel company in June 2006.  An internal investigation was conducted by DETI and concluded that no further action was necessary.  However, its investigation was later found not to have been sufficiently rigorous or independent and its findings were not supported by adequate evidence.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources was made aware of the allegations by DETI but decided not to attend a meeting with the person who had made them.  Further allegations about the project were made to the NIAO in June 2008 and were referred to DETI, which commissioned a review of the project.  By September 2009 it found that there had been irregularities.  DETI only informed the SEUPB that there was a possible irregularity in May 2010, and informed the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in December 2010.  Details of the irregularity were only forwarded to both in February 2011.  A further review of the project was then commissioned by SEUPB, which found that 97% of the &euro;4.3 million paid to Bytel was based on ineligible expenditure and should not have been paid.<br\/><br\/>My primary interest, and that of my counterpart in Northern Ireland, was to identify any lessons to be learned from the management of this project which could improve the administration of EU-funded projects in a cross-Border context and more generally.  The very complex arrangements put in place for the administration and funding of the INTERREG III programme contributed to the delay within the bodies concerned in recognising that a financial loss had occurred, in reporting the loss and in accepting the appropriate degree of responsibility for its occurrence.  We have tried to summarise the complexity of arrangements in Figure 2.2 of the special report.  As members will see, there is nothing simple about the relationships.  The illustration shows the funding flows and the number of agents involved in the project.  Almost inevitably, the complexity of the arrangements and the number of actors involved led to a lack of clarity about roles in the oversight of the grant.  The outcome in this case points to a need for more straightforward accountability arrangements for future cross-Border projects, with a reduced number of layers and clearer definitions of each agency&rsquo;s responsibilities.<br\/><br\/>A key feature of the management of grant administration for the project was the poor sharing of information between the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and DETI.  Formally, as joint implementing agents, both Departments had equal responsibility for the measure.  Each had the same agreement with SEUPB but, significantly, they had no formal agreement between themselves.  The communication arrangements between the Departments were informal or <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  In my view, they were inappropriate for important inter-regional infrastructure funding worth almost &euro;8 million.  They were also ineffective.  This project highlights the need for formal arrangements to be put in place to ensure that key decisions are agreed and recorded, and that important issues arising in the course of a project are communicated in a timely way to the relevant bodies.  <br\/><br\/>The Departments did not put in place adequate processes to manage basic project risks arising from the Bytel project, including the risk of failure to deliver the project as planned, and risks arising from changes to the scope of the project.  In addition, they did not operate effective controls over validation and authorisation of payment claims, particularly in circumstances in which grant claims were submitted close to payment deadlines.  <br\/><br\/>In general, the arrangements and criteria for funding projects and recoupment of associated EU grant funding are complex.  Funding and recoupment can be spread over a number of years.  Due to the number of projects and programmes, the multi-annual nature of the funding and the summary nature of the financial reporting by Departments and agencies, it is generally not easy to see in any set of financial statements what has happened when a claim for funding is withdrawn or is disallowed by the EU.  For example, the loss to Irish taxpayers of &euro;1.76 million in potential EU funding as a result of the late recognition of problems with the Bytel project was not clearly accounted for by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources or by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Neither of those Departments reported that the grant of &euro;2.3 million paid to Bytel from Irish Exchequer sources was to no good effect.  In my view, it would provide greater transparency if relevant Government Departments and agencies published a note to their accounts setting out, by programme, the value of EU funding requested in a year, the amounts received from the EU, the value of claims withdrawn or disallowed and the balance outstanding at year end.  My office will discuss the development of an appropriate format with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#C01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429174800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy, and invite Mr. Griffin to give his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#D00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429174800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>The recently published Comptroller and Auditor General and NIAO reports clearly set out the issues that have arisen in implementing the Cross-Border Extreme Broadband Project between Dublin and Belfast, with nodes in Dundalk, Drogheda and Armagh.  The project was to be funded under the INTERREG III-A telecoms measure, but due to irregularities, which are set out in the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the NIAO, INTERREG funding for the project was ultimately withdrawn.  At this stage, funding of over &euro;2 million has been lost to the Exchequer.  Recoupment of all funding for the project, including funding contributed by the Northern Ireland authorities, is the subject of court proceedings.<\/p> <p>  It is clear from the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the NIAO that there were deficiencies in the oversight of the Bytel project.  While DETI in Northern Ireland was in the lead role for implementing the project, processes in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources should have been better at critical junctures as the project evolved.  This includes Bytel's signing of the agreement with Eircom UK to replace Aurora, extending the broadband project to the north west.<\/p><p>This changed the structure and costs of the project and a revised letter of offer should have issued to Bytel.  This could have ensured that some of the expenditure on the north west extension of the project was eligible for INTERREG funding.  Instead, following the ASM review, all of the expenditure on the north west extension was deemed ineligible.<\/p><p> Since critical deficiencies in the project were brought to the attention of the Department in 2011, we have been fully engaged in dealing with them.  This includes participation on the project board established by the SEUPB to review the project, co-operating with ASM in the conduct of the forensic audit of the project, initiating with DETI a technical review of the project by PRISA consultants and fully engaging with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in its preparation of the report on the Bytel project.  <\/p><p> It is worth noting that the technical review undertaken by PRISA in 2013 concluded that the network delivered through Bytel-eircom met all the objectives laid out in the grant application and the letter of offer and that the project was very beneficial for the entire region.  The reach of the delivered network went beyond the original objectives as the north west was included in the network with additional nodes at Omagh and Derry.  The fibre also extends to Bridgend and Letterkenny providing network resilience through the networks in the Republic.<\/p><p> It is regrettable that a project of this regional significance had to be withdrawn from the INTERREG programme and that better value for money was not delivered.  There are issues for all of the parties involved, including the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, regarding oversight of the project.  I assure the committee, however, that the Department now has in place more stringent oversight and monitoring processes for INTERREG projects and indeed projects across all expenditure programmes.  I look forward to assisting the committee with its consideration of the issues related to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the Bytel project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429174800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>May we publish Mr. Griffin's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#E00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429174800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1429174800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Colgan to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#E00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429174800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>During the EU Structural Funds period 2000 to 2006, the SEUPB acted as managing authority and paying authority for the INTERREG IIIA programme and the PEACE II programme.  A total of 420 projects were funded under the INTERREG programme and 7,500 under the PEACE programme.  The joint value of both programmes was in excess of &euro;1 billion.  The Bytel project was a cross-Border broadband development initiative funded under the INTERREG programme.<\/p> <p>  The arrangements for the implementation of programmes during the EU funding period 2000 to 2006 relied on the use of implementing agents.  There were 56 implementing agents for the PEACE programme and 25 for the INTERREG programme.  Implementing agents acted under a service level agreement, SLA, with the SEUPB.  Under the terms of this agreement, the implementing agents were responsible for the management of a part of the programme and for the provision of funding to eligible projects.  Responsibility for the Bytel project came under the control of two government departments - one in Belfast, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and one in Dublin, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Responsibility for the assessment, approval, monitoring and funding of this project came under their responsibility.  The implementing agents were also required to inform the SEUPB of any changes in the nature of the project and to report any irregularities.<\/p> <p>  In May 2010, as the formal process of programme closure was drawing to a conclusion, the SEUPB was made aware by DETI of a potential irregularity with the Bytel project.  No details of this irregularity were provided at the time.  The SEUPB signalled this potential irregularity to the European Commission as part of the closure process, indicating that further details would be provided when they became available to the SEUPB.<\/p> <p>  In February 2011, the SEUPB was made aware of the extent of the irregularity involved with the Bytel project.  On foot of the information that became evident at that time, the SEUPB initiated a full review of the project.  This review was concluded in March 2012.  It was evident from the conclusions of the review that the Bytel project was not eligible for funding under the INTERREG programme.  The SEUPB informed the relevant accounting officers in the government departments concerned that it intended to withdraw the project from the programme and from the final claim for drawdown of funding from the European Commission.  The European Commission was informed accordingly.<\/p> <p>  The withdrawal of the project from the programme resulted in a loss to the Irish Exchequer and the Northern Ireland Executive of &euro;4.3 million.  The SEUPB has co-operated fully with the Comptroller and Auditor General in Ireland and the Northern Ireland Audit Office in the review of this project.  The reports represent a fair summary of the facts associated with this project.  The SEUPB is happy to answer any queries the committee may have and to provide any additional explanations of clarifications that may be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Colgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1429174800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>May we publish Mr. Colgan's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#E00600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429174800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Colgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1429174800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Griffin, Mr. Colgan and their officials.  I thank the Northern Ireland Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee in Northern Ireland for hosting us in Stormont a number of weeks ago to discuss the project.  It is shocking reading all of this material in that it sets almost the gold standard for management incompetence and project and oversight failure.  From the beginning, there was a litany of flags being raised and problems arising but none the less cheques were written and money was paid out.  It is so broad across every aspect of the project, it leads one to question what was going on and whether there were ulterior motivations.  If one looks at it from the beginning, a company with no track record in delivering this kind of project with a balance sheet of almost nil fails to win a project and yet a month later, is re-evaluated and wins a project.  It engages with Aurora Telecom on the basis of the letter of offer, it fails and Aurora Telecom pulls out.  It goes in with another company and the entire nature of the project changes but nobody on the department side changes any of the consequences.  We see a bill issued for &euro;1.3 million for equipment worth &euro;30,000 which was bought from a sister company of the company concerned.  This was never used in the project and yet we see further cheques being written.<\/p> <p>  A whistleblower comes forward in 2006 and the department in Northern Ireland says there is nothing to be seen here.  Another whistleblower comes forward in 2008 and eventually, we start to see some movement.  However, while that is going on, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is not told about that second issue.  However, it failed to attend a meeting in 2006 with the whistleblower, at the invitation of DETI, to talk to them about their concerns.  Mr. Colgan's organisation, the SEUPB, is not told until 2010 that there are problems and must then be the body to instigate a forensic assessment of the project to discover the real detail of what was going on instead of the departments involved.

These included, for example, the use of a sister company for the processing of some of the claims, particularly with regard to the Nortel racks.  In respect of the final claim submitted on the project, it was a claim of &euro;2 million based on a single-page document comprising the provision of infrastructure that we believe was not provided in the manner set out in the payment claim.

First, the company that pulled out should have reported back to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to let it know it had pulled out and that something therefore needed to be done.  This point specifically relates to this Department here in the South, that is, to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.

As I mentioned in my opening statement, there were several critical junctures in the evolution of the project where the Department should have been more assertive.  A view was taken at the time - I believe rightly so and this was confirmed by my counterpart in Northern Ireland at the Committee of Public Accounts hearings on 17 March - that he was the lead for the day-to-day management of the project, the management of payment claims and so on.  Notwithstanding that, on looking at the papers there probably were three times where we could have been more involved.  The first was in respect of the actual scoping of the original project.  The Deputy will recall from reading the ASM and Prisa reports that one difficulty they had in determining exactly what was delivered and exactly what was eligible for payment was the inadequacy of the technical documentation provided regarding the definition of the project back in 2004.  As a Department that had an overall responsibility for management rather than the day-to-day operational issues, we should have been more involved at that stage in scoping out or making sure that the project was adequately scoped out.  This would have involved greater technical input from our Department at that point but this did not happen.<\/p> <p>  Second, when Aurora decided not to participate in the project, it changed things fundamentally in terms of the project structure.  One had a project that was to involve the provision of dark fibre on the Aurora network between Dublin, Drogheda, Dundalk, Armagh and Belfast.  The nature of the project then changed with the withdrawal of Aurora.  Let me deal with the role of Aurora.  It is clear from the documentation I have seen that there was a commitment at a relatively senior level within Aurora to be involved in the project.  We have letters that are signed by a senior project manager in Aurora that set out clearly the company's intention to participate in the extreme broadband project.  A review was conducted late in 2004 by the Aurora parent, that is, Bord G&aacute;is, of the operations of the company in general.  As I understand it, what arose from that review was a decision not to progress with the Aurora project.  I suppose two issues then arise.  The first is whether the Department should have been more involved in determining the exact nature of the partnership agreement between Aurora and Bytel and the second is whether, when Aurora decided to withdraw, the Department should have been involved in trying to convince it that this was a project with which it was worth continuing.  In answering that question, I should note that Aurora was a subsidiary of a commercial semi-State company that operated under the aegis of the Department.  As a Department, we do not involve ourselves in the day-to-day operations or the day-to-day projects of subsidiaries of our commercial semi-States.  That is a practice and if one accepts that by and large, although we obviously have in place certain oversight arrangements, the commercial semi-States that operate under the Department have an independent mandate to discharge their commercial duties, at that relatively micro level pertaining to a single project under a subsidiary of one of the Department's commercial semi-States, I would have thought it unlikely and probably inappropriate for the Department to get involved in a direct way.<\/p> <p>  What this does not remove from the circumstances that pertained at the time is that by virtue of Aurora opting out of the Bytel project, the entire project changed.  The letter of offer was predicated on certain things.  It was predicated on a substantial contribution in kind from Aurora in the provision of its dark fibre in its network as a sort of underpinning of the Bytel project.  This should have triggered alarms in both DETI and in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to the effect that the nature of the project had changed, that by definition this altered the letter of offer and, therefore, a new letter of offer was required.  Had an intervention taken place at that stage, it is quite possible that a new letter of offer would have stated explicitly, for example, the involvement of Eircom in the project.  This would have rendered that expenditure eligible for INTERREG funding and would have rendered eligible for INTERREG funding the additional work that formed the new Bytel-Eircom relationship, which was the extension of the line to Omagh, Derry, Bridgend and Letterkenny.  This certainly was an oversight on the part of my Department and on the part of DETI at that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1429174800,"counter":62,"content":"<p>To clarify, is there paperwork or documentation in the Secretary General's Department from that time noting that Aurora had pulled out of the project?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#F00600","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429174800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>There was, but its significance does not appear to have been understood.

In fairness to the individual involved in the project at the time, the e-mail certainly indicated his intent to attend the meeting, but we did not attend the meeting.  Had we attended the meeting we might have got a better sense as to the seriousness of the whistleblower allegations, although the conclusion drawn subsequently by DETI was that this was an internal dispute among the directors of Bytel.  ASM concluded in its own forensic audit in 2009 that we took our eye off the ball.  If the seriousness of the allegations made by the whistleblower in 2006 had been fully appreciated, again, there may have been an opportunity to step in at that stage.  The project was concluded, but it would have allowed us to determine at an earlier stage that the funding was ineligible, and we had still a number of years left on the INTERRIG III programme to allow for the possible reallocation of funds to other projects that would have been eligible.

I think we relied to a very significant extent on the de facto arrangements that were in place for the management of INTERREG projects.  The committee would have heard some of this at the Northern Ireland PAC hearings in March.  For INTERREG III projects, a service level agreement was put in place in terms of the telecoms measure between the SEUPB, DETI and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in the Republic.  That agreement set out what appeared to be joint responsibilities in relation to who did what.  It is worth looking at the service level agreement.  This is important in terms of the question the Deputy has posed.  The service level agreement would have been provided to ourselves and DETI and would have been signed off by both Departments.  The implementing agents would have been required to provide matching funding for the SEUPB.  We did that.  In that regard, we certainly discharged our role.  Did we facilitate applications for funding?  We did.  That was also undertaken by DETI.  Did we undertake project assessments?  We were involved in the project assessment in 2004 with the DETI and Western Connect, the consultant appointed to the telecommunications measure, which looked at the Bytel project and ultimately put it forward for assessment.  Did we issue offers of grants to projects?  We did that by way of the letter of offer.  There were a range of other things.<\/p> <p>  Custom and practice seems to have built up whereby a lead implementing agent was assigned for particular projects.  All but one of the telecoms measures would have been led by DETI.  We led on one of them.  The day-to-day operational issues such as looking at payment authorisations, forwarding payment authorisations to the SEUPB, monitoring the project and post-project evaluations would have been undertaken by DETI and, in relation to the earlier part of the project, by Western Connect, the consultant established to assist in that process.  It is instructive to look at the first two payment claims, for which approval was made by Western Connect and countersigned by DETI.  When Western Connect's contract ended, the payment claims were authorised by DETI and countersigned by ourselves.  It is worth noting, again, looking at the documentation that backed those up, that all the documentation was held in-house by either Western Connect or by DETI and did not go past our own Department.  That is a practice that was built up.  There was no formal partnership between the two Departments.  If I was to add a fourth issue on which we should have done better, it would have been to formalise what was the de facto working arrangement between the two Departments.  <\/p> <p>  I do not get any sense that the fact that this was EU funding was in any way a consideration in terms of how the project was managed, other than the fact that funding was available.  Certainly, there was pressure in 2004 to identify appropriate projects that could be included for INTERREG III funding under the telecoms measure.  Again, that is cited in the ASM report, and the pressure is particularly evident in the Northern Ireland authorities.  We have one e-mail on file in the Department, to which the Comptroller and Auditor General referred in his report, which appeared to give the impression that the N+2 consideration - that funding is allocated at a particular point which one has two years to spend - may have been a consideration for us, but I do not see anything in the content or tone of that e-mail which would lead me to that conclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1429174800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>May I ask Mr. Colgan if the SEUPB has suffered any financial loss as a result of what has happened?

In that sense we had to be satisfied that there were robust systems of control within the implementing agents, and we took assurances from the internal audit that that was the case.  We had to put a service level agreement in place which laid out exactly what their roles were.  We delegated authority in relation to their fulfilling that role and dealing with those things in a way that was set out.  We provided training, guidance and procedures manuals to ensure that everybody was perfectly clear as to what their roles were.  There were robust systems in place.<\/p><p>The weaknesses happened at individual manager level or some point within the system where there was not an awareness of the importance of certain developments that should have been raised to another level.  There are a number of instances.  I will reiterate what Mr. Griffin said.  There was a point in 2006 when the whistleblower allegation was raised.  We were made aware of the allegation.  We asked for a meeting with the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to discuss that allegation.  That meeting took place on 19 July 2006 with one of my staff.  We went through the allegations with DETI and we received absolute assurances from that department that there was no significance to it nor any issues that needed to be taken further.<\/p><p> The Article 10 report was commissioned and undertaken by consultants.  It raised a number of concerns in respect of the Aurora and Nortel racks as well as some of the other issues.  We addressed these issues directly with DETI.  Again, we would have received assurances from the department.  That is the way the system worked back then.  We were basing it on a system of assurances and the view that people's internal systems of control were robust enough to give us comfort to the effect that they were doing what they were supposed to be doing.  In fact, it turned out that was not happening.<\/p><p> There were some other critical points, particularly in 2008 when the second whistleblower allegation emerged.  We were not informed about that.  We were not informed about the subsequent review commissioned by ASM Accountants in 2009.  That ended in a draft report that was never finished.  We were not made aware of that.<\/p><p> In 2010 as we came to the process of concluding or closing off the programmes, we received a two-line correspondence indicating a potential irregularity with Bytel.  We were surprised about it, but we had to include the matter in our final declaration to the Commission.  We pointed out that there was a potential irregularity with the particular project and that we would come back to the Commission with further detail when we knew more.  For the rest of 2010 we were in contact with DETI.  Eventually, I wrote to the department in December 2010 urging those responsible to provide us with the detail we needed.  I did not receive it until well into 2011.  In fact, I went to a North-South Ministerial Council sectoral meeting involving the two relevant Ministers.  I had to tell them that this irregularity was still outstanding against the final drawdown of funding for INTERREG III, without having detail of it.  Eventually, at a meeting on 8 February 2011, I and a member of my staff were made aware of the seriousness of the issues.  We were made aware for the first time about the 2008 whistleblower allegation and of the ASM review in 2009, which had never been completed.  We were also made aware of some internal audit reviews that had been carried out as well.  We were made aware for the first time that there was litigation under way and that DETI had initiated legal proceedings on the matter.<\/p><p> Two days later I wrote to the Accounting Officers in various Departments stating that we were taking certain steps to take the matter in hand.  That led to the setting up of a project board to investigate the whole case and the commissioning of a detailed forensic audit, which ended up reporting in March 2012 in some detail around everything which has now come up to the surface.<\/p><p> I wrote again in March 2012 indicating that I would have to withdraw this project from the programme.  The question from the committee was whether we have lost any money.  The Special EU Programmes Body does not have any money.  We manage money on behalf of the member states.  Basically, our role is to draw down money from the European Commission against expenditure that has been incurred.  We receive the cashflow for that expenditure from various Departments and we use it to pay projects.  Subsequently, we draw down the money from the European Commission against verified and certified claims for expenditure.  In this case when it came to the final claim for a drawdown of expenditure from the European Commission, we had to deduct an amount in respect of the Bytel project.  That is where the loss occurred.  From that point it ceased being an EU project.  It stopped having anything to do with us.  From that point it was outside the EU programmes as such.  It became a loss to the Northern Ireland departments and the Irish Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#G01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Colgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429174800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I am keen to ask a final question although I realise I am approaching the limit of my time.

While the witnesses felt that this was an exceptional situation, how can they come to that conclusion, considering that the only reason we have been able to have the results we have seen unfold here today was because of a whistleblower?  Moreover, it was not just because of a single whistleblower but because of two whistleblowers.  In the case of the first, no attention was paid to the details of what was presented and in the second case, eventually it came to the conclusion.  The SEUPB's own damning report from 2012, when it set up an independent audit of the entire project, came to the conclusion that 97% of the funds that were paid out were ineligible for European Union funding.  The report found that the entire project was poorly managed and appraised.  The SEUPB's own independent investigation in March 2012 is a damning indictment of the entire project.  However, the only reason it could have come to that conclusion was because of a whistleblower.  As there were no whistleblowers in the other projects, how can one now present this committee with an assessment that this is exceptional?  I understand there were 420 other projects under INTERREG III and 7,500 projects under the PEACE programme, all of which were drawing on European money, all of which was linked to various Departments.  Obviously, a substantial number of projects were in place.  Will the witnesses answer that question first?

The Deputy is right that the letter of offer that was issued listed in the annexe an extensive list of items that the project promoters would fund themselves. That list included the &euro;1.3 million Nortel equipment.  When the payment claim was made we were not aware at the time that Aurora would not be part of the project ultimately.  The payment claim was made in November 2004 and Aurora withdrew from the project in December 2004.  At that time, on the face of it, the Nortel racks would have been required to light the Aurora dark fibre.  That does not obviate the fact that the Nortel racks were meant to be a contribution-in-kind by Bytel to the project.  The conclusion drawn in the Northern Ireland Audit Office, NIAO, report was that in the face of the possibility of EU funding being lost due to an impending N+2 deadline, it was agreed that the Nortel racks could be grant aided within the first claim.  I presume the assumption was made that there would be an opportunity later in the process to claw back any moneys from the subsequent and final claims that would be made so that the overall figure of &euro;4.3 million that was to be grant-aided from INTERREG would not be exceeded.<\/p> <p>  The other issue which arises with regard to the Nortel racks is that of their valuation.  The ASM review and the whistleblower allegations that fed into that concluded that the Nortel racks were only worth a fraction of the value of the &euro;1.3 million claim.  I believe a figure of &euro;30,000 was put on them.  In mitigation, I would draw attention to the economic appraisal of the Bytel project that was conducted in 2004, prior to the project being approved.  In that appraisal, Deloitte valued the Nortel racks and deemed that the figure of &euro;1.3 million was more or less in line with the market price for these racks.  The ASM report concluded that on balance, based on the information provided to ASM, it was appropriate in November 2004 \"to rely on the Deloitte economic appraisal\".    When one looks at what ASM subsequently concluded following its evaluation of the four payment claims that were submitted to the Department of Trade, Enterprise and Innovation, the &euro;1.3 million racks were discounted in terms of their entitlement to be eligible for INTERREG funding and that was on the basis of the fact that they were to be a contribution-in-kind by Bytel to the project.  <\/p> <p>  There is a range of issues surrounding the Nortel racks and I understand that they are one of the issues which are the subject of the statement of claim for the writ in Northern Ireland.

There are certain delegated sanctions that allow the commercial semi-State bodies to progress with capital works programmes without being obliged to revert to the Department and those thresholds are set and agreed.  Where there are significant transactions that are to be completed, there is a requirement for the commercial semi-State body to get the approval of the shareholding Department, as well as of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In recent years, we have had NewERA as the shareholder executive that provides significant support to Departments that have commercial semi-State bodies and which does a great deal of financial analysis of those bodies.

However, there are lessons to be learned here.  The Deputy pursued the point about authorisations for sign-off.  In a system in which assurances are given by others, who take responsibility for stating that a payment is authorised or required because the conditions have been satisfied, it would be fairly routine within many organisations for a paying officer to be at executive officer level or at higher executive officer level.  The amounts they can sign off or countersign would be specified.  That is what we would expect to see when we go in to an organisation and is what we routinely see and test for.  If we find any situation in which we think the authorisation level is above somebody's grade, or where there is more complexity to be tested by somebody who is signing off on payment, then we would certainly draw attention to that, and to the requirement to have a second set of eyes looking at a payment.<\/p> <p>  It is important that the administration of payments be separated from the decision to allocate funding in the first place.  I do not believe it was an executive officer who made the choice to fund Bytel.  That decision was made at a higher level in the two Departments.

Payments are made to the promoters on a contract milestone basis.

In the various statements he has made today he spoke about now and then tried to reflect as best he could and defend the Department in the best way he could in terms of what happened.  As Mr. Colgan stated, the facts are being presented here and being put on the table.  From our point of view, we might say it is a once off issue.  I would like various Secretaries General to reflect on the fact that we deal with things that happened many years ago and sometimes we deal with current issues.  The Department where Mr. Griffin worked previously had responsibility for the marine and Deputy Deasy and I visited one of the sites concerned with a report we will prepare shortly.<\/p> <p>  It appears to me that some Departments have a history of extremely poor management, inefficiencies and poor reporting, and this happened with regard to fisheries.  It appears Departments are extremely slow to learn anything from their mistakes.  I know when one reflects on the past ten years one sees things have changed, but it is hard for someone in business or paying taxes looking in at this meeting to grapple with the &euro;2.3 million being discussed.  As I stated earlier, they will wonder whether anyone was fired, sacked or moved.  The shocking part of this is that it seems the dogs may bark here on a Thursday morning but the caravan trundles on.  In this regard, does Mr. Griffin think it worthwhile to mention to his colleagues after the Cabinet meeting next week that they should invite Mr. McCarthy along to give them a perception of what is expected, not just with regard to correcting the past but with regard to what is expected now and in future because things are changing so rapidly as money is so scarce?  It is hard to earn the money to pay the taxes we give to the State and the public expects a greater concentration of effort, efficiency and value for money to be achieved by every Department.<\/p> <p>  It would help if all of the players at Secretary General level got together to discuss this and try to prevent some of the stuff from happening and make a big effort to put the Committee of Public Accounts out of business.  This is my message to them and it should happen.  I do not say it lightly.  I go through this every Thursday morning with every member and some of what we uncover is shocking.  Sometimes it is unfair to the individual opposite, such as is the case of Mr. Griffin because he was not there at the time.  He is answering for the past.  A greater effort should be made to get ahead of where we are and give support to those working in Departments and give confidence to the tax paying public that at least something absolutely positive and clear is being done about these issues.  I know not everything can be prevented, but at least it would give the public the comfort of knowing that we are all working on the same side trying to get something done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#U02300","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429174800,"counter":662,"content":"<p>I fully accept this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#U02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1429174800,"counter":663,"content":"<p>I do not know whether Mr. McCarthy would like to go to the meetings of the Secretaries General.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#U02500","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429174800,"counter":664,"content":"<p>Perhaps we will find a vehicle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#U02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1429174800,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I would have a fear if I were asked into that room that I might not get back out of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015041600002#U02700","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1429174800,"counter":666,"content":"<p>In a funny way I will tag onto what the Chairman has mentioned and what Mr. Griffin spoke about with regard to the national broadband plan.

Leaving the historical issues behind, something which I believe will define his time as Secretary General will be how successful he is in rolling out the national broadband plan.  I wish to ask about the way it was announced and is being operated in the Department.<\/p><p>Rural areas with smaller population densities, or with fewer than 900 people, are not seen as economically viable.  We have what is called State intervention on one hand, and I hope the commercial operators will actually provide the crossover so we will cover 96% or 97% of the entire country by 2020.<\/p><p> The mapping process was published last November, pinpointing the geographical areas requiring State intervention.  The public consultation process on the accuracy of the maps closed for submissions in February of this year.  In my constituency, it is estimated that approximately 29% of the entire land area will not be covered by the commercial operators.  The area has 17,000 or 18,000 households.  In the past four or five years, in particular, and for longer in certain locations, including coastal villages such as Bunmahon and in Kill, broadband is the major issue for people with businesses.  People who want to start businesses cannot get a proper broadband service.<\/p><p> I understand that the Department was meeting telecommunications companies in February and March of this year.  I want to find out how much on schedule the Department is with regard to rolling out the project.  How is it going?  I understand Vodafone made its announcements yesterday or the day before.

I refer to a formal project plan setting out critical paths, milestones, deliverables, resources, funding, risks and issues, steering groups with the appropriate governance, financial, administrative and technical expertise, checkpoint meetings, risk and issue management and change request systems.  To pick up on the point raised by Deputy O'Donovan, there is a reference to regular reporting to senior management.  I am briefed on this very regularly.  I have two meetings scheduled, for tomorrow and Monday, to go through some of the funding and cost-benefit analysis issues.  The Minister is briefed on a very regular basis and is very much in command of where the project is at and where we need to go.

I have a number of key priorities that the Department will be dealing with over the next couple of years.  I would set that up as among the top one or two.  All the resources that are required in the Department to deliver that and any external resources we require to back us up are being put in place.  I am very comfortable about the governance arrangements in place for the management of the project.

I have circulated a document and will talk briefly.  A British exit of the EU would be very serious.  I will focus on two issues.  If a British exit threatens the openness of the Border and the functioning of the North-South institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, it will affect North-South trade, the funding of cross-Border projects and peace and stability in the North.  Peace and stability in the North are based on the Good Friday Agreement, one pillar of which is North-South relations.  It is dangerous to erode any of the pillars of the Good Friday Agreement because it would encourage those with an interest in pulling back on it, either loyalists or dissident republicans, to do so.  BrExit would remove the purpose of the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB and the North-South bodies established under it, and could undermine the goal and functioning of other North-South bodies.<\/p> <p>  Peace and stability are also based on the opening up of the Border.  The Border is no longer so important in daily life on either side of it and this is part of the root of the relative Nationalist satisfaction in the North.  This would change with BrExit due to the implementation of customs etc.  BrExit would encourage sovereigntism in the UK and among Unionists.  The withdrawal of funding for cross-Border projects would undermine very positive small projects that contribute to peace and reconciliation.  There is a need to compensate for potential losses both by negotiating stronger North-South links to the EU for funding purposes, representation and cross-learning, for example, from the Nordic Council.  There is a need to proactively put this on the agenda partly because BrExit would be very dangerous and partly because it is only positive to create a momentum of better North-South relations, to reinvigorate the Good Friday process and strengthen peace and stability in the event of the many possible future shocks, BrExit or others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015041600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Jennifer Todd"},{"type":"speech","time":1429189200,"counter":712,"content":"<p>Thank you.  Many of us are concerned about the issue.  I was previously chairman of them Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and saw the great work done by the cross-Border institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement, such as InterTradeIreland, Waterways Ireland and Foras na Gaeilge.  Professor Todd's written submission referred to the deepening levels of engagement between the two parts of the island in other areas, and many of us are members of the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association that was established a few years ago and whereby Members of the Stormont Assembly meet in plenary session with Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  In the forthcoming plenary session, we will discuss the issue Professor Todd raised of improved health links.  There are doctors in the North who specialise in deep brain injury and we will discuss how we can ensure people in the South can benefit from this.  Here in the South, we are very good at treating congenital heart disease and we are trying to find ways people in the North can get improved access to southern services.  Anything that impacts on this relationship is of deep concern to us, as is the Border issue.<\/p> <p>  The Border issue has been pointed out to us in the past in some of the discussions we have had with other witnesses.  From what we are being told, the reasons the UK wants to withdraw converge around two areas, first, the loss of sovereignty to Europe, which a cohort of people feel is a very important issue that merits a BrExit.  Second, there is a cohort of people who are less concerned about sovereignty but more concerned about the impact of immigration into the UK.  There are two very distinct groups of people on both sides.  If Ireland were to remain in the EU and the UK were to leave, a person from Madrid or Paris who wanted to go to the UK could come to Dublin using his or her passport, without a visa, and then travel by bus or train across the Border into the UK without showing his or her passport.  If a motivation for the UK to withdraw from the EU is monitoring, limiting and controlling immigration, how would we play our part in it?  What would Ireland be asked to do to ensure free access of other EU citizens to the North of Ireland was controlled?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015041600002#B00300","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1429189200,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I often look at Northern Ireland with heart palpitations and, simplistically, see it as a terrible, divided, sectarian statelet.  It is probably the most sectarian society in Europe.  I do not know whether recruitment to the police force and civil service is still done on the basis of religion in the balancing act between Roman Catholic and Protestant.  I thank Professor Todd for her paper, which has added an additional dimension to how I view Northern Ireland.  She has drawn out some amazing potential contradictions.  For example, her report stated that a recent survey showed that more Nationalist voters are prepared to stay in Northern Ireland than move to a united Ireland, yet the participants in the referendum would be the Democratic Unionist Party, not Sinn F&eacute;in.  Has Professor Todd read into the mindset of politicians in Northern Ireland regarding their views?  One presupposes the DUP members are prepared to sell their souls, or political muscle, to the British Labour Party or the Conservative Party.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants a united Ireland but will not participate in the decision-making process in England because its members do not take their seats.<\/p> <p>  Although we have debated the issue of the British exit for some time, there are still many questions.

She points out a number of things that we have expressed concerns about previously.  First, and most important, if it proceeded as indicated and if Britain were to leave the Union, we would have a diminution of North-South contacts and, at very best, obstacles would appear in the contacts that have already been set up, such as Waterways Ireland, the language body and the various crossover points and areas of co-operation that have become commonplace, with discussions on a regular basis both at parliamentary and institutional level.  That is something we do not want in either in a North-South context or in an Ireland-Britain context.  While it has been said to us in the past that Ireland and Britain can arrange to have an ongoing satisfactory relationship because we had that before and we had an Anglo-Irish trade agreement and so on back in the old days, we tend to forget that we are no longer in the old days.  Time has moved on and there are new challenges.  In the modern era there are different challenges altogether, which require a degree of co-operation to which we have now become accustomed.  After the difficult years of the crisis in Northern Ireland, politics has again emerged and is seen to take centre stage.  Many of us remember the criticism that politics had failed in Northern Ireland.  Of course, it had, and it was replaced by something else.  People now see new obstacles presenting themselves through the fora that have already been put in place, the points of contact that have become commonplace and on which both sides now rely to a great extent.<\/p> <p>  As a result of those new obstacles, how does Professor Todd feel we can counteract those negative aspects in the worst-case scenario?  I do not accept that we should pretend it is not going to happen.  It is like Murphy's law: if these things can happen, they do happen.  Alongside the things I have often said before and which we have discussed here before, there is a tendency across Europe at present, which is very unnerving, to feel that Europe has failed and that the European concept is not what it was thought to be.  It was much better than any concept that went before it and it has shown over the last 50 years that it was better, is better and will continue to be better if it is nurtured and allowed to continue.<\/p> <p>  What institutions can replace the potential exit of Britain?  How do we get over the obstacles that will appear - the border obstacles, for example, the logistics of the new entity and the entities involved in relations between Ireland and Britain, between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and between Ireland and Britain together and the rest of the European Union?  Do not let us forget that European history will tell us there is a tendency to go back to where we were.  That has always been a fault in Europe.  Whenever Europe went back to where it was, it was a catastrophe.  There is a danger that kind of thing could happen again.  Unfortunately, I see that kind of outcome if the present tangent towards the undermining of Europe from within continues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015041600002#C00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1429189200,"counter":716,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Todd for the paper she presented.  A report was published recently which discussed the knock-on economic effect on Ireland of a British exit from the EU.  We are now talking about a lot of ifs, as the UK may decide to do certain things rather than actually leaving, and may go down a road of reduced involvement.  Is there not then a reason for us now to start looking at the alternatives as regards, for instance, access to the European market, which has 500 million people.?  This is why I do not understand the recent economic report, which indicated we would lose out more than the UK would.  If one takes the UK out of it, it goes down to 440 million or 430 million.  Do we now need to start looking for alternatives and figuring out how we can benefit, presuming that England does water down its involvement in Europe?  The economic report clearly indicates that Ireland has a great deal to lose as a result of the UK exit.

As the Chair and other members have said, we have met with a number of people around this issue.  Views have varied, not so much on the question of whether BrExit would be a good thing for Ireland and Northern Irish relations, but more in terms of what could, should, might or might not be done, whether there is any point doing anything and whether this might be a storm in a teacup and will not happen at all.  My impression, from the professor's paper, is that she is unequivocal that this is not the approach that should be taken and that we should presume we must protect our position, depending on a potential British exit, or as Senator Burke has said, something that does not quite amount to an exit, but is the next best thing to it.  I could be wrong, but of all the contributors I have heard, Professor Todd is the most unequivocal in saying that we need to act.  As she put it, top-level British-Irish planning for different eventualities has proven imaginative and productive in the past.  Perhaps more went on behind the scenes than we knew back in the day.  Could Professor Todd develop her thoughts more around the type of top-level planning in which we should be engaging?<\/p> <p>  My second point relates to the Nordic model.  Professor Todd makes the point that the Irish Government could negotiate a special position for North-South endeavours with the British Government within the EU, even in the event of a BrExit.  She mentions the Nordic model as an example of how that might be done.  That involves a scenario where members of the EU are involved in an agreement with non-members, which has been negotiated to remove obstacles to freedom of movement across Nordic states.  We would have to make the agreement with the EU generally to reach a separate arrangement for ourselves and the UK, which would depend on overall EU agreement.  Since the Nordic agreement was negotiated, the union has been significantly enlarged and now comprises 28 countries.  Is a special deal for us a realistic possibility?  Does Professor Todd think the UK would be interested in facilitating us in getting a special deal, or is this more of an issue for us than for them?  I ask that because, as the Chair has mentioned, the issue of immigration is a particular concern in the UK.  How would such a model work out in such a way as to ease the concerns of those in the UK who regard that as the most important issue on the agenda?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015041600002#C00400","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1429189200,"counter":718,"content":"<p>A vote has been called in the D&aacute;il.

I am not sure if I can answer all of them in the way members expect.  In terms of immigrants, incomers and freedom of movement across the border, it is the case that immigration is a major concern in the UK.  That is something I have thought about but on which I do not have clear answers, except that the Nordic Council set up in 2014 a freedom of movement body which is certainly one that we should look at fairly closely in the event of BrExit.  The Nordic Council is one year or two years ahead in terms of thinking about how to organise movement between, for example, Finland and Iceland or Norway and Sweden.<\/p> <p>  As Senator Hayden said, there are big differences between the Nordic Council and any British-Irish situation, not least because of the imbalance of size and power between Britain and Ireland as opposed to the Nordic countries, but on the other hand the cross-learning is something we can very productively do.  I will go through the questions and then perhaps come back to some of the issues.<\/p> <p>  On Northern Ireland politicians and what they are thinking about all of this, my sense is that they are not thinking about it.  I was at a conference in the North not that long ago where the general perspective was that nobody in the North is talking about the issue.<\/p><p>They are not preparing.  Maybe they are and they are not telling anyone, but my sense is that there has been less discussion in the North than in the South about it even though it will have a major impact on the North.<\/p><p> While Northern Ireland is stable, it is unstably stable.

As a way of dealing with that fragility, addressing North-South relations constructively and strengthening them within the sovereignty restraints of the Good Friday Agreement can only be positive.<\/p><p> I will revert to a number of the other questions in a moment, but I was asked whether there was any point in doing something or whether I would argue more for proactivity than other witnesses.  In terms of North-South relations, it is always important to be proactive.  I am not an economist, so I am much less certain about proactivity in terms of the cost to the State of BrExit and the ensuing economic policies.  In the context of North-South relations, however, it is clear that the cost to this State of instability in the North would be very high, and proportionately higher than it would be to Britain.  The North is one of this State's vital interests.  Therefore, we must be proactive in our North-South relations.<\/p><p> As to what could replace North-South or British-Irish institutions in the event of BrExit, how to compensate for North-South contacts and how to counteract this within the UK, what I have tried to outline in my paper is that Northern Ireland has been constitutionally anomalous within the UK since at least 1985 and the Anglo-Irish Agreement, although one could argue that it has been so for even longer.  It is understood as such within the UK.  Therefore, British Governments are likely to be more open to negotiating flexible relationships between North and South than they might be between Finchley and Dublin.  This is something that successive Irish Governments negotiated throughout the 1990s.  It could be pushed further, as both the Conservatives and Labour would be open to it in principle.  As to what those relationships should be, Mr. Garret FitzGerald commented at one point in the 1980s to the effect that the South could represent Northern farmers at the EU.  That remains more a thinking statement than a policy suggestion.  However, there are common interests in the farming community and an openness, albeit at the edges, within Britain to negotiating.  For the British state, peace and stability in the North are worth considerable amounts of expenditure and creativity.  It is worth considering what creative negotiations can take place on North-South issues, including those relating to the EU, between Britain and Ireland.  This should be done at the highest possible level because that is what is required, but other discussions can take place in organisations such as the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, the North-South Ministerial Council and so on.  We must start airing the possibility of more innovative relationships in the event of BrExit, but also more generally.<\/p><p> As to what the replacement institutions following BrExit could be, walking backwards in Europe would be a catastrophe, but it would also be a catastrophe if we walked backwards in respect of conflicts.  Since 1945, most settlements across the world have failed.  Most conflicts do not even end in settlement, but in victory or defeat.  We must be particularly careful, as walking backwards on one matter can lead to a more generalised walking backwards.<\/p><p> I was asked whether the State could benefit from BrExit.  From the 1950s and 1960s onwards, the State has skilfully balanced relationships with Britain, Europe and the US.  If BrExit happens, that is presumably what the State will continue doing.  As to how we might benefit from BrExit in terms of our access to the European market, Northern Ireland's access to that market is something about which we cannot do much with Britain, but about which we can do a great deal with the North.  We should be thinking along those lines.  This does not answer the large questions about the cost to this State of BrExit, but one of the points I was trying to make was that the cost to us and the British of going backwards on the Northern Ireland settlements would be high.  As this must be avoided, it is a negotiating point.<\/p><p> As to whether there is any point in us doing anything, the answer is \"Yes\" in respect of North-South relations and enlivening the Good Friday, peace or settlement process.  The metaphor used in the 1990s was of having to keep the momentum going, as otherwise one would fall off the bicycle.  In some respects, the momentum has slowed a great deal in recent years.  It must resume.  It will only slow further if BrExit happens.<\/p><p> We should consider the Nordic model carefully and ask experts to discuss how it might be used.  It cannot simply be plonked down and applied uncritically, but it can be discussed.<\/p><p> How to negotiate in respect of immigrants remains a difficult issue, and one for which I do not have a simple answer.  Freedom of movement is important.  If immigrants are being stopped at the Border, so is everyone else.  Border constituencies have benefited from the Good Friday Agreement and the easing of Border controls and customs checking.  I have undertaken a great deal of research into everyday life in Border areas.  In 2004, people in the Louth area, for example, were still quite distrustful of themselves or of North-South relations.<\/p><p>By 2014, a sense of openness had developed.  Everybody to whom we spoke was very positive about that sense of openness.  For the first time in their lives the Border did not matter and they were able to speak to people to whom they had never before spoken as they were seen as political opponents.  People were very positive about this.  Places like Castle Saunderson, the Ulster Canal, the Cavan County Museum and small community groups in the North benefitted from Special European Union Programmes Body, SEUPB, funding.  Small community groups, small museums and so on have a cumulative affect on relationships across the Border and on sectarian relationships.  These are areas in which there could be a fall-off in terms of EU funding if Britain exits the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015041600002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Jennifer Todd","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429189200,"counter":726,"content":"<p>Professor Todd stated that not only communities in the South but communities in the North will lose out if Britain exits the EU and that this is not a matter on which politicians in the North have engaged to date.

The intellectual disability supplement to the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, follows a representative sample of 753 people with an intellectual disability aged 40 years and older.  It compares their ageing to that of the general population with data yielded by TILDA.  This is the first time in history that we have had a population of people with intellectual disability reach old age.  The average lifespan of people with Down's syndrome has increased from nine years in the 1930s to 60 years and older today and while this advance is to be celebrated, there are some serious health concerns that we need to better understand.  A recent study here found that mortality among people with an intellectual disability is almost four times higher than that among the general population, with the average age of death at 55 years which is 19 years earlier than the 74 years average age of death for the general population.  There are some serious gaps in our knowledge about what is driving this higher mortality rate and about the health and well-being of this population.<\/p> <p>  Other countries have not been successful in including people with intellectual disability in their longitudinal studies on ageing but Ireland has.  It is the first country in the world to include people with intellectual disability in tandem with a generic study on ageing.<\/p> <p>  I would like to draw members' attention to a number of areas, on which greater detail can be found in the submission and in the relevant reports from IDS-TILDA.  I will first draw members' attention to the area of dementia.  Recent findings from the IDS-TILDA found that over a three year period from 2010 to 2014, the prevalence of dementia has doubled in people with Down's syndrome from 15.8% to almost 30%.  We know the average age of onset of dementia among this population is about 51 years, so we are looking at a much younger and at much higher prevalence of dementia than that reported among the general population, which is estimated to be between 4% and 8% in people aged 65 years and over.  Many of the comorbidities which develop or co-exist with dementia in this population are also quite different.  For example, almost 80% of people with Down's syndrome who develop Alzheimer's dementia will also develop new-onset epilepsy or seizure activity.  This is unique to this population.  We see about 10% new-onset seizure activity developing in dementia in the general population.  <\/p> <p>  Assessment and diagnosis of dementia in people with Down's syndrome or with intellectual disability at large is complex and there are various reasons for this.  There is no quick five minute screening for dementia in this population.  I very much welcome the national strategy on dementia which has specifically identified people with Down's syndrome as a priority area for improvements in services.  It is 20 years, however, since there were international guidelines on care issues and recommendations on the care and assessment of dementia in persons with an intellectual disability.  Unfortunately, in Ireland and in other countries, many people with intellectual disability fail to get a diagnosis.  When there is a diagnosis, often the intellectual disability services feel they do not have the know-how, the resources or the expertise to continue to provide care.  When people seek assistance from generic services, such as health services, generic memory clinics and even palliative care providers, these services also feel they do not have the expertise or resources to support this population.  Older people with intellectual disability and dementia are falling between two care systems, often with no one accepting responsibility. <\/p> <p>  That this population is developing dementia should not be a surprise.  The data are very clear.  The data from IDS-TILDA confirm that dementia is experienced earlier and more frequently in people with intellectual disability.  There are some models of best practice developed in Ireland, particularly those of the Daughters of Charity and St. Michael's House.  We need to look at these models and roll out similar models on a regional basis, ensuring there is equity of access to diagnoses and care.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the area of bone health and osteopenia or osteoporosis, often known as brittle bones.  In wave two of IDS-TILDA we found that rates of diagnosed osteoporosis were 16.4%, slightly higher than that reported by TILDA for the general population, at 14.3%.  However, what was very concerning was that when measured objectively, we found very high levels of osteopenia, 37% compared to 14% among the general population, and of osteoporosis, 35% compared to 28% among the general population.  This meant that seven out of ten people in Ireland with an intellectual disability and who were over the age of 40 had poor bone health and most were undiagnosed.  With the added risk loading for poor bone health among this population, it is also concerning that screening levels were low at about 25%.  Given the evidence now emerging from IDS-TILDA, specific strategies around regular screening, objective assessment, targeted prevention and intervention programmes and education are imperative.  <\/p> <p>  It is important to understand that seven out of ten people who participated in our study reported that they could not read instructions, such as those on medicines or in health promotion material.  A similar number of participants could not read accessible information or easy read information and over 50% could not sign their own name or recognise basic numbers.  This means that many people with intellectual disability will not understand information given by a doctor, a nurse or other health care professionals.  It is not good enough to display easy read material in a waiting room.  We recommend, as demonstrated by the data, that health care professionals need additional education around the development of communication with people with intellectual disability.  Many health care professionals fail to communicate in a manner that enables a genuine understanding of the care being offered and we need to address this urgently.<\/p> <p>  I will now highlight the issues for family carers.  The family networks of older people with intellectual disability look very different to that of the general population.  People with intellectual disability are generally single, unmarried and do not have partners, children or grandchildren to assist with their care as they age.  Almost 68% of adults with intellectual disability continue to be cared for at home, many by family carers who are themselves ageing and dealing with their own health care needs.  IDS-TILDA has also found that many are being cared for by sibling carers.  We talk about the sandwich generation among the general population but the sibling carers of people with an intellectual disability are part of what we might call a triple-decker sandwich generation who care not only for their own families and their ageing parents but also for the family member with an intellectual disability.<\/p><p>Two thirds of family members gave approximately 60 hours of care per week and 48% spoke of feeling completely overwhelmed.<\/p><p> The IDS-TILDA evidence strongly suggests that a critical component in reducing reliance on congregated settings will be the quality and resourcing of supports for family carers.  We already know that one of the major policy initiatives is to move people with intellectual disability from congregated settings into more community-based alternatives.  Given the data, one of the first things we must ensure is that those who are already living in the community are supported to continue to do so.  During the period 2010-2014, approximately 120 people reported having moved residence.  However, it is concerning that only 30 of those moved from congregated settings to community-based settings.  The majority of those moves were lateral moves to the same type of setting.<\/p><p> IDS-TILDA demonstrates that there is a need to understand the progress, the facilitators, the barriers and the outcomes of community-orientated services for people with intellectual disability.  The first wave of data from IDS-TILDA provides data and baseline information on people&rsquo;s quality of life, relationships, and health prior to the move.  There must be a commitment to monitoring and tracking what happens after the move.  Forthcoming waves of IDS-TILDA offer that opportunity.<\/p><p> As Ireland launches its health reform agenda, key policy documents, including Healthy Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Improved Health and Well-Being 2013-2025 and the Move from Congregated Settings, have set forth priorities and challenges for the ageing of people with an intellectual disability.  Just as The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, TILDA, is gathering and presenting general population data to inform these efforts, IDS-TILDA is ensuring that there is the same high quality data on people with intellectual disability.  The data are raising the visibility of the needs and experiences of persons with intellectual disability as they age and encourages the cross-walking of that information between specialist intellectual disability services and generic public health environments.  It ensures there is evidence to underpin policy so that we can ensure not only that we have added years to life for people with intellectual disability as they grow old but also, critically, that we have added life to years. <\/p><p> It is my hope that this committee will accept the challenge of ensuring that the data being gathered by IDS-TILDA are utilised effectively in the formulation of policies around disability, health and ageing.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to make this presentation and I am very happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015041600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Mary McCarron","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429173000,"counter":742,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McCarron.

Our most frequently reported medicines were anti-psychotics, which were reported by 43% of the population, followed by anti-epileptics and laxatives.  This reflects, to some extent, the different pattern of morbidity in people with intellectual disability, with a higher prevalence of mental health and neurological conditions.

I apologise on behalf of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in who would have taken the lead this morning but he is in the Chamber because of the clash with Question Time.  The presentations were very interesting.  The witnesses have outlined a number of issues but they have also made many clear recommendations.  There are a few things I noticed while reading the presentation last night, namely, that there are serious gaps in our knowledge as to how people with intellectual disability age, that no one accepts responsibility and that people with intellectual disability fall between care systems.  It is something we need to look at and deal with because we have an ageing population, with and without intellectual disabilities.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask a question about elderly parents looking after an ageing son or daughter, where they may have health issues themselves.  When a son or daughter is diagnosed with dementia at 50 or 55 and are being cared for by an elderly parent, what happens?  I read in one of the submission's that traditional intellectual disability service providers often feel they lack expertise in needed care and when they seek assistance from general health care memory clinics, hospitals and palliative care providers, they find little help and they fall between care systems.  If an elderly parent needs to make alternative arrangements, how easily can that happen and what are the pathways?  Are they clear?<\/p> <p>  I dealt with a case in Cork, which I will raise because I think it is relevant, of an elderly man looking after a son with an intellectual disability.  The man was in his 80s and he passed away.  It transpired that he had never claimed for carer's allowance or anything like that, so when another sibling took on the role of carer and applied for the allowance, they were refused because officials could not understand why someone would need a carer now when they had never had one, even though the man had looked after his son for over 40 years without a carer's allowance.  I felt I needed to raise that.<\/p> <p>  Reading through some of the reports, I see that just 7% of adults in the Republic of Ireland with an intellectual disability are in paid employment.  Is there scope for developing light work with some of the multinational companies as in the US?  Could the Government propose co-operation with some supermarkets, for example, for this type of work?  Three out of four adults with an intellectual disability have never written, texted, emailed or used social media to contact family or friends.  In addition, less than 60% of adults with an intellectual disability use the telephone to contact family and friends.  This group was also less likely to own a mobile phone than other adults in the Republic.  The sense of isolation worsens conditions for people with learning disabilities.  Have studies been done which provide evidence that increased social contact improves older people's well-being?<\/p><p>Can this type of evidence be used to encourage the Government to invest in new programmes?  Is there scope perhaps for third level students or volunteers to visit people who are isolated on a regular basis to ensure human contact?<\/p><p> With regard to the under-diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis, Professor McCarron said strategies are needed for objective assessment and targeted interventions for people with intellectual disabilities.  What body is best placed and equipped to drive this?<\/p><p> She also said, \"The IDS-TILDA evidence strongly suggests that a critical component in reducing reliance on congregated settings will be the quality and resourcing of supports for family care givers.

It is a credit to all involved that, unlike much research, it will provide useful data.  Are the issues related to the increased prevalence of dementia in this population real or are they related to changes in diagnostic criteria or people taking the problem more seriously?  Were assumptions made about folks who had intellectual disabilities in the past and was insufficient effort put into assessing whether a dementia complication arose as well?<\/p> <p>  I am reminded of a bigger issue, which the research will address.  People engaged in public policy formation will have to think about this, even though they are not good at it.  I refer to long-term planning and thinking past the next election specifically.  We will have a significantly changed demographic over the next 20 to 30 years.  As a result of improvements in health policy, people will live much longer.  A higher incidence and prevalence of certain diseases will emerge because people will live long enough to get them.  The good news part of that equation is that people who live longer will live better.  We have arbitrarily decided that many people can or, in many cases, must become former workers and dependants on the State or pension policies of one kind or another.  These people may in extreme cases wish to continue working and, in other cases, could continue working, although they would gratefully accept the offer of retirement based on the criteria originally formulated in 1880s Germany, which was that people should retire at the age of 65.  At that time the average age of death was 41 and the average life expectancy of a 65 year old was another two years whereas now it is approximately 18 years.<\/p> <p>  The reality that is going to have to dawn on people who examine public policy writ large is that we will have inevitably an increasing population of citizens who are wholly or partially dependent on the effort and care of others, which is good news.  They will need the help of others because of their own infirmity, illnesses or various challenges and disabilities but the number of people on whom they depend is getting smaller proportionately.  We will need to critically examine social policy in the area of the able elderly and whether it is sustainable to force people into retirement who wish to continue working and not be additional dependants.  The harder question that will arise is a necessary corollary of that, which is whether optional retirement should be provided for people who have reached an arbitrarily defined age set 130 years ago when we need the resource of people continuing working to deal with those who have no discretion about the level of dependence they have.  Professor McCarron should keep up the good work and I hope it inspires a few more thoughtful debates.  I also hope the message gets through to full-time politicians that they need to start to think about big picture issues in public policy planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015041600002#E00200","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1429173000,"counter":748,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McCarron for her presentation and for all the work that everyone has done in this area.  It is important that all the issues are examined, especially in respect of people with intellectual disabilities.  How many people with intellectual disabilities are affected?  How many are looked after at home with the support of the health services and how many are in full-time structured care?  What are the challenges for the future?  Hopefully, life expectancy will continue to increase because of improved health services but there is increased demand for services as we try to support ageing parents, for example.  Over the next ten years, how many people will require structured care?  This is a major issue in the context of elderly care.  The number of people aged 65 will increase by approximately 20,000 per annum in coming years.  A new Government will be elected in 2016 and by the time it leaves office five years later, another 100,000 people will be aged over 65.  How many people with ID are being looked after at home at the moment?  Given the age profile of their carers, there will be further demands on structured care for them.<\/p> <p>  I have worked with a number of families to file complaints with the Ombudsman for Children.  On the one hand, significant support and care is provided by the health service.  For example, in Cork, the Cope Foundation has been extremely helpful to parents of children with both physical and intellectual disabilities.  On the other hand, the local authority is saying they are just numbers.  In one case I am dealing with, the person is aged 20.  In July 2008, the local authority wrote to the family and said the local authority house they were living in needed to be adapted.  In November 2008, the family submitted the plans outlining the changes that were needed but six and a half years later, nothing has been done.  I am dealing with another case where the child who is now an adult has to be physically lifted out of bed every morning, washed and looked after.  The disability is so severe that the person has to be tube fed.  On the one hand, State services are extremely helpful while, on the other, some State services are not doing anything to help.  Is the co-ordination of services being examined?  There seems to be a lack of co-ordination in services for people with intellectual disabilities who live at home.  I may be dealing with 50 cases in this regard.   Has Professor McCarron come across this issue?<\/p><p>How does Professor McCarron believe this matter can be dealt with as we move forward?

All of these are critical and important questions.  I will address the first question in respect of elderly parents looking after ageing family members with dementia.  This is a common problem and it is likely to be an increasingly common problem.  If we are serious about continuing to support people with intellectual disability to live at home and in the community, we need to develop robust services, including respite to support family members.<\/p> <p>  The Daughters of Charity model is currently supporting a family member who is living at home with her elderly father, who is in his 90s.  She has advanced dementia but she is able to come to the specialist service which has been developed for regular respite.  This has enabled the family to continue to care for her at home because of this outreach support.  It is not always about bringing people into services.  Services also need to move out.  We need appropriate services to support people.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about diagnostics.  I will combine my comments with Professor Crown's question on diagnosis.  It is a number of years since we began to understand the risk of dementia in people with intellectual disability.  Now, assessment tools and diagnostics have substantially and critically improved.  Unfortunately, many generic professionals undertook little diagnostics training as part of their undergraduate qualifications, whether medical or nursing degrees or training in other areas.  Many people working in the generic area in the specialist memory clinics simply do not have the toolkit or the expertise to diagnose.  Good expertise has built up in some specialist intellectual disability services now but these are only in pockets.  There is considerable inequity throughout the country and whether people can get a diagnosis depends on where they are living.  Elderly people have travelled from Cork to Dublin to see me and establish whether I could assess the family member.  That should not be happening today.  We should be building up services of excellence in the various regions.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the issue of employment.  This has come up in several formats.  The big issue for people with intellectual disability is that only 7% of this population are in paid employment.  Many of these people have never been employed.  Many among this population have few assets to support them in their old age.  This is a critical issue.<\/p> <p>  We absolutely need to consider robust supports and serious efforts.  This must include the mainstreaming of this population into real jobs and paid employment.  We need to consider what type of education and additional support will be required to equip them for employment, including third level education.  There are some examples of these initiatives under way.  This is a serious concern.  Naturally, education is central to preparing people with intellectual disability for the workplace.<\/p> <p>  The question of which body is best placed to support osteoporosis assessment was raised.  We need cross-working between intellectual disability specialist services and generic health care professionals.  Many people with intellectual disability find it challenging to walk into a busy clinic and understand the procedures, for example, for something like a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, DEXA, scan.  These diagnostic tests can be very cumbersome and frightening for those among this population.  If we are serious about having screening and testing, we need to look at how we can organise these generic health care clinics.  Perhaps we could have a slot at a given time of the day when it is not so busy in order that people with intellectual disability can be afforded the time they require to get used to unfamiliar environments.  They can be daunting for this population.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on the issue of people not having used social media and limited use of mobile telephones, etc.  There is ample evidence of this and we are seeing in our study the critical nature of social media and technology for improving social connectedness and quality of life.  The data are clear.  Loneliness is a big issue.  Moving people with intellectual disability into the community without the skills, expertise and supports to retain contact is a matter of concern.  We need to build up robust structures in the community and in the education and training sectors to support the use of this technology, on which the rest of us in society are so highly dependent.  We know it substantially improves our connectedness and quality of life.  This is a critical issue.<\/p> <p>  I have commented on the changing demographic in Ireland.  People with intellectual disability are living longer.  There is an issue here.  There are people in congregated settings currently.  We are now trying to move them out into the community and into more independent living accommodation.  The majority of these are in the older age cohort.  They tend to have more health problems.  Given the slow pace of moving people with less severe intellectual disability, those who are younger and those with fewer health problems in the community, we have some work to do to help transition the many others who continue to live in these settings into the community.  Not only that, but much remains to be done to sustain them within the community, because being in the community does not equate in any way to living in the community.  They are two very different things.  Changing geographical location does not necessarily equate with a change in quality of life.  We need robust structures in place to address and support that aspect.<\/p> <p>  There was a question from Senator Burke on the numbers living at home.  We know that approximately 67% of the total intellectual disability population registered on the international intellectual disability database continue to live at home.  We know that approximately 15% live in congregated settings, 17% live in residential settings and approximately 15% live in community group homes.  The majority of people with intellectual disability continue to live at home.  As we said earlier, we are tracking those who are living at home.  Many are being cared for by sibling carers.  We need to consider whether we are serious about not reintroducing congregated settings.  Another model of congregated setting comes under the disguise of the nursing home model.  We need to be very careful and understand the types of robust structures that we are going to have to put in place to support family members.  To answer Senator Burke's question, approximately 67% of the total intellectual disability population continue to live at home.  We know from the last report of the database that there are over 2,000 people looking to move out of home.  Families are actively looking for alternative accommodation for them.  That is an important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015041600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Mary McCarron"},{"type":"speech","time":1429173000,"counter":752,"content":"<p>What numbers are we talking about?

Professor McCarron has reiterated the importance of having this study and of having the data.  We can see the richness of our understanding.  I hope we will evolve as we appreciate and understand more about what the data is telling us.  It speaks to what many of us felt in our guts but we did not have the evidence to actually demonstrate it.  As the deputation was presenting this morning, the question of whether we look beyond intellectual disability struck me.<\/p><p>Sometimes I feel that if the diagnosis is intellectual disability, the box is ticked as far as the health plan is concerned and we do not look beyond that.  Certainly, that is the evidence.  Another thought struck me when I was listening.  We tend to feel that it is great that people are living longer, rather than actually stating what should be our expectation.  We are almost applauding ourselves when we look at the figures, but it probably speaks volumes about what we did in the past.<\/p><p> Eilish Burke gave a very good illustration of how to make health promotion more accessible and how we might do things differently and recalibrate.  Mary McCarron spoke about creating a space or to make room, parallel with the settings we have, in clinics and in other places to ensure that we make it accessible.  The issue of literacy and how we view literacy is extremely important.  Pat Clarke from Down Syndrome Ireland is in the Visitors Gallery.  During the children's referendum that group produced a leaflet to explain the children's referendum to its members.  In fact, I found it useful for a much wider audience than just the group's members.  Have the witnesses found evidence of engagement with advocacy or membership organisations in designing or providing those community settings or on how we are going to do this?  We are getting some of the figures, but how do we create these models?  How do we really understand what is best?  Perhaps we should talk to parents, support groups and advocacy organisations.<\/p><p> I have a question about the figures on dementia.  How is that in the context of the general population?  As Senator Crown asked, is it our growing understanding or is it about how we diagnose generally?  I am trying to understand the increase in dementia.  Is it that we are now looking beyond the intellectual disability?<\/p><p> In the research that has been done have the witnesses found any issues regarding disclosure of abuse emerging later in life?  It is certainly something we have seen with the older population when we look at nursing home care.  The evidence we have been given is that when people are in a safe setting they tend to disclose if there has been domestic violence or childhood abuse, due to being in that safer environment.  Nursing homes have pluses and minuses but sometimes when one is changing that context a person can feel the ability to speak out.  Is that something that has emerged?<\/p><p> I agree about the quality and resourcing of supports to families.  I am concerned about the CARDI report and the living arrangements for older people with intellectual disabilities.  It shows a total redesign is needed of how we provide community supports.  We allow people to live where is best for them, but the reality is that most people are living in residential centres so we cannot ignore that fact either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015041600002#F00600","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429173000,"counter":756,"content":"<p>Have any studies been carried out on the level of mental ill-health among the group, in other words on the areas of psychoses and depression?

Obviously there a level of stigma surrounding mental ill-health and mental disability, but society often does not distinguish between intellectual disability and mental illness.  It is something I find hard to break through.  People with an intellectual disability do not in any circumstances have an illness; they have a condition from birth like most of us have, be it physical or mental.

Regarding what we should do to make health promotion more accessible and to deal with the literacy issue for people with intellectual disability, we should not spend the next ten or 15 years trying to teach this population how to read and write.  That is the first thing to say.  If we do that, we would waste many valuable years.  I am not saying that is not important.  We should be considering adult literacy classes and so forth for this population, but we must also look at technology and other areas which will be more accessible.  There are big efforts now in Ireland, particularly with a doctorate around technology and intellectual disability, in trying to make technology accessible for this population.<\/p> <p>  As part of IDS-TILDA we worked a great deal with people with intellectual disability.  When we started this study it was said that these people would not be able to participate and that they would not be able to engage in this protocol, yet we have had a 98% retention rate from wave 1 to wave 2.  We involved people with intellectual disability in the design of the study.  They helped us to develop the accessible materials.  Not only that, if members of the committee have a chance to look at the IDS-TILDA website, people with intellectual disability have acted out the key findings of the study.  This is an effort to make things accessible to people.  It has been a big focus.  While a very strong conceptual framework underpinned this study, there was also a very strong values framework.  That values framework was about making this study accessible to people with intellectual disability to enable them to take part.  We have shown that this can be done.  It has happened and we certainly can roll out the learning from IDS-TILDA to other walks of life.  It is something that can happen.<\/p> <p>  The next question was about dementia and whether there was a difference with the general population.  Yes, there is.  People with Down's syndrome have a far increased risk of dementia.  Overall, if one looks at all of the international studies, we are looking at a prevalence rate of 15% to 40% of people with Down's syndrome over the age of 40 years having Alzheimer's disease.  The prevalence in the generic population is 4% to 8% in people aged 65 years and over.  One of the over-riding reasons that people with Down's Syndrome are at increased risk is that in 95% of people with Down's syndrome the Down's syndrome is caused by having a triple copy of chromosome 21.  We now know that key sites located in chromosome 21 are implicated in the cause of dementia, particularly the location of the amyloid precursor protein gene which is located on chromosome 21.  This puts people with Down's syndrome at increased risk.  They have an increased loading.  Of course, there are also other factors.<\/p> <p>  Now that we know this population is at increased risk, we must begin to look at prevention.  We must begin to examine what is happening around brain health for the general population.<\/p><p>Very little has happened in this field.  A PhD student from Trinity College, Eimear McGlinchey, is part of the team.  We have started the first brain training programme with financial support from Down Syndrome Ireland and in conjunction with University College Cambridge.  It is looking at brain health in people with Down's syndrome.  We know that things like physical activity, exercise and social connectedness are implicated in brain health.  As we know that a genetic risk loading is associated with this population, we need to look at what we can do to prevent these problems from developing.<\/p><p> Senator van Turnhout also asked about issues relating to disclosure of abuse.  This has not necessarily come through in the data we have collected to date.  As we prepare for the third wave, we may want to look at some different areas that may help if they were uncovered.  Certainly, issues of abuse have not emerged to date among people with intellectual disability who have self-reported.<\/p><p> Deputy Neville asked about mental ill-health, which is a major concern.  Over 45% of the population enrolled in this study had mental health problems.  Dr. Niamh Mulryan, who is present at this meeting, is studying the prevalence of mental health problems among this population in great detail.  We know this is a serious issue.  We can see that from the types of medications these people are taking.  Ms O'Dwyer has spoken about the high use of psychotropic medications.  Mental health problems represent a serious issue for this population.  We also have other issues which we need to unpack as well.  Sometimes there are problems with diagnostics, challenging behaviours and other environmental issues that can be misinterpreted.  We spoke about the very high prevalence of things like osteoporosis.  We know that people who have these conditions are at greater risk of fractures.  It is very common for people in this population to have vertebral compressions.  Very often, they are not able to complain of things like pain.  Perhaps some of the mental health problems we are looking at can be attributed to things like an inability to report problems or undiagnosed pain.  Mental health is a serious issue.  Diagnostics can be complicated.  It is certainly something we are looking at.  Approximately 47% of this population presented in the first wave with a mental health problem.<\/p><p> Senator Burke asked whether there is a single co-ordinator in terms of an overall package.  We need much more joining up of the various systems in areas like housing, health and disability services.  It is often the case that these groups never come together in the same room to discuss how to solve some of these problems.  We have systems which are probably fragmented.  We need a much more co-ordinated approach to how we tackle and address some of these issues.  Certainly the housing issue is a big problem.  We are looking to move people from congregated settings out into community-based accommodation.  Many services are struggling to get on the housing list.  Perhaps people with intellectual disability will be at the bottom of the pile when it comes to things like the housing list.  We need to look at that.  Various working groups are actively trying to address those problems.  The value for money working group is certainly looking at that at present.<\/p><p> The Acting Chairman asked me to suggest how people could be supported when it comes to employment.  We certainly need to prepare people for employment.  Education is one way of doing that.  It is really critical.  It was evident from this study that many people in this population do not even have primary education.  Very few of these people had an opportunity to go to third level education.  I am working in a third level institution, Trinity College, that has a certificate in contemporary living.  It is open to very few people, however.  We need to broaden out the educational opportunities for this population at primary, secondary and third levels.  There have been some very successful efforts to support people in small pockets.  These have involved bridge workers and support workers, etc.  It can happen.  Other countries have demonstrated that people with intellectual disability can be supported to have real jobs as long as the right supports are put in place.  People want real jobs.  It is really important that we commit to supporting that to happen.  That is critical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015041600002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Mary McCarron","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429173000,"counter":761,"content":"<p>The thrust of my question related to encouraging employers to give serious consideration to taking on people with disabilities.

I have a short presentation which I will run through quickly.  The Bill comprises about 25 heads.  There are five major themes within the Bill and some further miscellaneous provisions.  Those themes are as follows: driving under the influence of drugs; issues linked to distracted driving due to electronic communications; mutual recognition of driver disqualifications with the UK; provision for a regulatory regime for written-off vehicles; and an obligation for employers to carry out tests on their drivers for intoxicants.  We are also proposing, as the Minister has communicated to the Chairman, to include a provision for a special speed limit of 20 km\/h in certain residential areas.  While that final measure is not included in the heads as they have been communicated to the committee, the Minister has indicated his intention to propose an amendment in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I will focus first on driving under the influence of drugs.  The Bill provides for a very significant advance in the measures pertaining to drug driving.  Essentially, the policy objective is to bring the provisions pertaining to driving under the influence of drugs other than alcohol more closely into line with those pertaining to driving under the influence of alcohol.  At present, there is an offence in the Road Traffic Act 2010 of being intoxicated and unable to maintain proper control of a vehicle.  What we are proposing to do here is introduce new offences.  One will be an offence of driving with illicit drugs in one's bloodstream.  We are also proposing to add a new offence of driving while impaired by prescribable drugs.  There are two tests for prescribable drugs and one test only for illicit drugs.<\/p> <p>  We are making provision that the Medical Bureau of Road Safety will be statutorily empowered to test, approve and supply devices to the Garda for roadside testing for drugs other than alcohol.  This is essentially providing for new technological developments that allow roadside testing for drugs to take place.  The Garda will be empowered to require the provision of an oral fluid specimen at the roadside.  We will also make provision for mandatory intoxicant testing.  That is an expansion of the mandatory alcohol testing rules that exist right now.  Essentially, it is random testing for drugs as well as for alcohol.<\/p> <p>  There will be an obligation for drivers to provide a blood specimen at a Garda station following arrest after detection of drugs and, where applicable, impairment.  The penalties imposed will be similar to those that apply in cases of drink driving.<\/p><p>Higher penalties will be provided for in instances where a person is driving under the influence of both alcohol and drugs.<\/p><p> I will now deal with the distracted driving provisions.  Essentially, this relates to instances where drivers are driving while using mobile technology.  There is already an offence in legislation since 2006 relating to holding a phone while driving.  Since 2014, an additional provision has been introduced to regulations which relates to texting and issuing a short message service, SMS, on a cradle-borne device.  That is provided for in secondary legislation.  What we are doing now is an integrated provision, setting out all the prohibitions in primary legislation relating to the use of electronic devices while driving.  It will incorporate both existing provisions with respect to holding a phone and also the use of hands in interacting with a mobile device that is cradle-borne.<\/p><p> The next section of the Bill I will mention relates to mutual recognition of driving disqualifications between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  This was already provided for in legislation through a European Union convention on driving disqualifications.  However, the convention was ratified by only seven member states and only implemented by Ireland and the UK.  Under the Lisbon treaty, the UK had an option to withdraw from this convention and a number of other measures under the justice and home affairs provisions.  It has exercised its right to withdraw from the convention, with effect from 1 December last year.  In effect, the legal arrangements we have had in place with the UK regarding mutual recognition of driver disqualifications have not been operating since that date.  We have negotiated a new bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom and we hope to sign it shortly.  The UK will not be in a position to sign until after the elections there on 7 May.  We are providing for legislative implementation of the agreement so we can ratify it after we have passed the legislation.<\/p><p> I will turn to new measures relating to written-off vehicles.  Currently, there are no statutory regulatory measures relating to vehicles that have been written off.  There are approximately 45,000 vehicles written off in Ireland each year, with approximately 40% finding their way back into service.  There are administrative arrangements in place with a link between the insurance companies and the national vehicle and driver file to record vehicles that have been written off beyond repair.  There are measures to prevent them being brought back into use.  We are proposing to provide a statutory basis for that administrative arrangement on the one hand and the development of a more comprehensive regulatory regime regarding written-off vehicles that would govern the possibility of these vehicles being reintroduced to use.  It would also govern the possible reuse of parts of vehicles involved in road collisions.  Essentially, the regulatory regime would be developed to regulate, with secondary legislation made by the Minister.<\/p><p> There are some further measures provided for in the Bill.  We are providing for a responsibility on employers of drivers of buses, minibuses and heavy goods vehicles to test their drivers for intoxicants.  This mirrors a provision already in place relating to safety-critical workers on railways and Bus &Eacute;ireann has asked us to provide statutory underpinning for this so it can introduce the measure for its workers.  We are introducing an offence relating to participation in unauthorised races of animal-drawn vehicles.  There is already an offence relating to the organisation of such events but there is no offence relating to participation.  The Garda has reported that there is difficulty in taking a prosecution where it is not possible to identify the organiser of such an event.  We are also making some minor provisions for penalty points relating to the use of trailers.  We are expanding the penalty points provision in order to cover the issues I have referred to with regard to distracted driving and the use of electronic devices while driving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015041600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Towey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429191000,"counter":777,"content":"<p>There is much food for thought in those comments.

The Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020 includes actions to address this forensically, legally and medically.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is the national, independent and statutory forensic body with responsibility for testing for intoxicants in Ireland and with a designated role in implementing these actions.  The bureau's Report on Roadside Drug Testing and Equipment and Related Matters, published in 2012 and available in advance to members, is a study on all aspects of roadside drug testing, including reference to and analysis of any equipment currently in use or anticipated to be used to carry out such tests.  I would be happy to refer to any issues within that to assist the committee.  The report considers the current definition of a \"drug\" - we may have to return to that issue - and current drug analysis procedure under the Road Traffic Acts.  As part of the<\/p> <p>evidence base for driving under the influence of drugs, the prevalence of drug taking in the general population, in the driver population, in suspected drugs-driving population and the toxicology<\/p> <p>data for drivers in fatal crashes are presented and reviewed, including the bureau study, Driving Under the Influence of Drugs in Ireland: Results of a Nationwide Survey 2000-2001.  That was also sent to the committee in advance of today's meeting.  A number of international data and reports are also considered to inform the relevant bodies as to drugs that could and should be targeted for testing into the future.  The studies indicate that cannabis and benzodiazepines are currently the most prevalent drugs in driving under the influence of drugs cases, followed by the opiates, methadone and cocaine.<\/p> <p>  The effects of individual drugs on driving and the relationship between impairment and measurement of those drugs in the human body are examined in the report.  The methods of detection of drugs-driving by means of roadside impairment testing - implemented by garda&iacute; since last November -and with particular emphasis on roadside chemical drug testing in oral fluid are reviewed to include medical, practical and scientific considerations.  The consequential confirmatory laboratory testing for drug detection in body fluids, including oral fluid in the future, is explored.  I thank my colleagues, including Ms Pauline Leavey, the recently retired chief analyst, Dr. Richard Maguire and Ms Helen Kearns, our current chief analyst, for their assistance and expertise in this report.<\/p> <p>  We considered some previous international studies, and I will mention one in order to assist the committee.<\/p><p>It is very important to have evidence to say why we are doing this.  I am aware that there are important issues about road safety but also about civil liberties.  It is a question of striking the right balance.  We studied in particular the DRUID report 2011, which is one of many international reports.  The current status of roadside drug testing in the international literature by way of extended studies is presented and how they support the introduction of roadside chemical drug testing, RCDT, devices but these reports and our report also acknowledge certain limitations.  The introduction of roadside drug testing devices is a far more complex and complicated initiative than was the case for roadside breath alcohol testing.<\/p><p> A number of currently available roadside drug testing devices were considered and reviewed by us to inform the report on how they operate, their storage and operation conditions, the scientific criteria on which they are based and also the countries which are currently using the devices or proposed to use them at some stage in the future, after 2012.<\/p><p> We also studied the practices for driving under the influence of drugs, DUID, roadside testing in 13 other countries by way of survey to colleagues because it is important that in Ireland we are aware of what other countries do and we learn from them and they learn from us.  We noted that eight of these countries or jurisdictions already have in place provision for the use of such devices.  The remaining five countries had decided not to use the devices and to rely only on impairment testing.<\/p><p> The report also sets out the considerations and options for the introduction of RCDT devices in Ireland, under four main headings, legal, operational, scientific and medical.  A number of options were outlined with the considered recommendation being the combination of roadside traffic impairment testing and roadside chemical drug testing.  An implementation plan for the introduction of the recommended option was set out, including the working timeframe for implementation of the roadside chemical drug testing following the introduction and implementation of the 2014 legislation for roadside intoxicant impairment testing.  That has been in since last November and is another context. <\/p><p> Scientific evaluation of RCDT devices requires specification, selection and evaluation of a suitable testing RCDT system.  The 2015 Bill provides the statutory basis for the Medical Bureau of Road Safety&rsquo;s, MBRS, function for approval, supply and testing of such systems for the taking of oral fluid and blood samples for roadside and confirmatory testing of drugs which impair driving.  Based on current national and international prevalence data the drugs to be targeted initially in RCDT are cannabis, cocaine, opiates and benzodiazepines.<\/p><p> The general scheme of the Bill before the Oireachtas also empowers the Garda to carry out RCDT and to establish checkpoints for RCDT with similar powers to existing mandatory roadside alcohol testing.  It is suggested and recommended that there be a combined twin track approach of zero tolerance for drugs not licensed for human medicinal use and the confirmed presence with impairment for prescribable or over the counter drugs.  Other jurisdictions have approached this issue with variations on this theme.  Recent legislative changes, just over a month ago, in England and Wales informed us of one approach.  The statutory definition in the 2015 Bill of the types and classifications of impairing drugs will require further consultation and consideration.  We must link that with the health aspects of the issue.<\/p><p> It is very important that as well as considering road safety we reassure people about their civil liberties and health in driving and do not cause undue alarm to people on prescription medicines.  A parallel health educational initiative is needed to support and encourage drivers with medical conditions to take their prescribed medications in accordance with health care advices and medical fitness to drive guidelines.<\/p><p> On the technical side, there was a competitive EU tendering process initiated in 2014 under which we set out suitable specifications including 98 separate specifications for an RCDT system.  These, and the overarching legislative, financial and operational parameters, will be summarised and addressed in whatever detail the committee would like.  We wish to help it in every way possible to understand those technical aspects.  A number of RCDT systems are undergoing full scientific evaluation by the MBRS.  Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, LC-MS, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, GC-MS, are sophisticated laboratory techniques.  We utilised these in the evaluation of using genuine oral fluid spiked with target analytes to confirm the spiked level before challenging the sensitivity and selectivity for the drugs under test for the different systems.  Sensitivity and selectivity are very important scientific concepts to consider.  Are we picking up the drugs that are there and are we sure we are not picking up something that is not there?  That is a question of accuracy and fairness.  It is very important that the public and drivers have confidence in an independent forensically assessed system.  The results of the scientific evaluation and of a recent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na field trial of devices at the MBRS will be reviewed with the epidemiological and demographic background and legislative requirements.<\/p><p> When the garda&iacute; came to us last month just before and just after sunset in good Irish fashion, and to our delight, it poured rain.  The conditions were awful, which was terrific for assessing how it works.  The garda&iacute;, the devices and our volunteers were completely rain-soaked and we said it was a wonderful condition under which to test the devices. <\/p><p> The introduction of RCDT needs a carefully integrated and co-ordinated approach harmonising scientific, medical, legislative, and law enforcement requirements to enable enhanced awareness, detection and deterrence of DUID.  The general scheme of the Road Traffic Bill 2015 currently being scrutinised by this committee is an essential part of that procedure and reflects the need to consider the requirements of the administration of justice within the integrated framework.  The MBRS is very pleased to assist the committee in that consultative and deliberative process and to answer questions on any issues arising.<\/p><p> I have six core points, the fourth, fifth and sixth summarise what I have said.  The first three are: recognition that driving under the influence of drugs is a significant problem; promotion of road safety to reduce deaths and injuries due to road traffic collisions and to ensure that the people taking drugs do not themselves become the victims of a fatality or serious injury, or put others in that position; and promoting and supporting the health and well-being of the driving population linked with medical fitness to drive.  The fourth, fifth and sixth points are: provide an evidential basis for RCDT system; set scientific requirements ensuring accuracy and fairness of the RCDT system; and ensure a harmonised and integrated approach.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015041600002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Denis Cusack","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429191000,"counter":780,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Cusack.

Where a Garda is of the opinion that the driver is impaired, the Garda can carry out an arrest and have the appropriate tests undertaken at a Garda station, which means giving a specimen of blood by the person who has been arrested.<\/p> <p>  These new measures will provide for increased powers in terms of what a Garda can do at the roadside.  In particular, a garda will be able to carry out roadside testing for the presence of drugs, as well as the existing breath-testing arrangements for the presence of alcohol.  The roadside testing arrangements will capture a number of the possible types of drug that can be used.  Professor Cusack will expand on this.  Where the presence of a drug is detected, the garda will arrest the person and a specimen of blood will be taken at the Garda station.<\/p> <p>  There is also provision for mandatory intoxicant testing.  Therefore, in parallel or in a similar vein to the existing arrangements for mandatory alcohol testing, there would also be provision for random testing of drugs.

At the moment, an intoxicant is defined in the 2010 Act as alcohol and drugs, and any combination of drugs or of drugs and alcohol.  Therefore, it is not an entirely new concept.  To put it into context, in 1998 when the bureau was still only dealing with blood and urine, there was no evidential breath-testing, so every sample was blood or urine.  Out of about 15,000 samples only eight were tested for drugs.  Last year, it was in the region of 1,200 of the blood and urine samples that came in, which is approximately one quarter of all the samples.  Therefore, we are already testing quite extensively for it.  This recognises, first, that it is an increasing problem and, second, that technology is now available which can assist in the recognition.  I do want to stress, however, that at the moment we are only looking at the four classes - they are, cannabis, benzodiazepines, opiates and cocaine.<\/p> <p>  There will always be other drugs that we cannot currently, and maybe for some time into the future, assess at the roadside.  That is why I would also like to put in context the fact that roadside impairment testing, for which thousands of garda&iacute; have been trained and which was implemented last November, is still an important part of it.  <\/p> <p>  The Chairman's question is one of great concern.  If I were to speak as a forensic doctor or as an ordinary doctor, there would be different aspects.  The last thing anybody wants to do is cause distress or worry to anybody who is on prescribed medication, or who goes to their supermarket or chemist and gets over-the-counter products for a headache, some of which contain codeine, paracetamol or caffeine.  If somebody takes an awful lot of codeine it could show up as an opiate.  <\/p> <p>  This is not about illegal or prescribable drugs, however, it is about impairment and safe driving.  Therefore, whether or not somebody is taking a prescribable or prescribed drug and is impaired, they are no less of a danger to themselves and others.  It is important to recognise that there are certain types of drug which have no legitimate medical use.  <\/p> <p>  I had a look at my old-fashioned licence document and it does say that it is a driving licence or cead&uacute;nas tiom&aacute;na.  It is a licence, not a right, so everyone who drives has to take care they are not tired, distracted, on medications or changed medications.  If somebody is taking it in accordance with a prescription, including their pharmacist's or doctor's advice, I want to stress that we see this linking in with medical fitness to drive, not the misuse of drugs.  Therefore, sl&aacute;inte agus tiom&aacute;int is important for drivers.  In general, they will not have anything to be worried about.  However, if somebody changes their medication and feels groggy, they should not be driving.  Where somebody is taking something that has no legitimate medicinal use, such as cocaine or heroin, by driving they are putting themselves and others at risk because of the known impairment effects.<\/p><p>That is why there is an attempt to differentiate between these things.  Again, I need to be very careful, but this is not about misuse of drugs.  It is another issue as to whether people should be using cocaine or cannabis socially or whatever.  This is entirely about whether it is safe for a person to drive in respect of him or herself and in respect of others. <\/p><p> We need a very important campaign.  This cannot be brought in without ensuring that there is a balance.  People need to be told not to worry about their blood pressure tablets or to continue taking their diabetic treatment or epilepsy tablets.  Whether in a GP surgery, a pharmacy or elsewhere, information on fitness to drive that people can rely on needs to be provided in simple, plain and understandable language.  I have seen the equivalents in other countries because I am on the medical advisory panel for the Department for Transport in London.  That is terribly important.  I hope it answers the legitimate concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015041600002#J01700","nonspeaker":"Professor Denis Cusack","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429191000,"counter":799,"content":"<p>Certainty and clarity is what is required for the motorist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015041600002#K00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429191000,"counter":800,"content":"<p>Certainty and clarity and reassurance for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015041600002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Denis Cusack"},{"type":"speech","time":1429191000,"counter":801,"content":"<p>I thank the officials from the Department and the representatives from the medical bureau for coming here.  It is disappointing in many ways, because we are all worried about road safety, that there is an issue regarding mutual recognition of disqualifications North and South.  A problem exists, although we are reaching some sort of agreement with the UK.  When we spoke to the Minister in the past about penalty points and trying to tie them up between North and South, he said there were legislative reasons we could not do it.  He indicated that it would prove very difficult.  There is a whole raft of issues on which consistency between North and South would be very important, including speed limits, signage, penalty points and all such areas.<\/p> <p>  There is an issue with regard to employers being responsible for their employees.  I often wonder if that is normal European practice.  If a person has a haulage company with a load of people driving trucks and so forth, how can we hold the employer responsible if something goes wrong?  The employer cannot test everyone.  People come and go.  There would be very serious implications for an employer if this requirement was introduced.  Perhaps that proposal could be explained a bit more.<\/p> <p>  The combination of drink and drugs is an issue.  A person could be caught with drink and a person could be caught with drugs.  Should there be a special offence where there is a combination of the two, be they prescribed drugs or illegal drugs?  A new offence was mentioned.  Should it be a special offence when it comes to something like that?  The combination of both is very serious and there should be a higher penalty for it.<\/p> <p>  I am glad to see that we have come round to the idea of having some sort of vehicle register.  In the past, we had company cars.  My area was plagued with them for years.  The issue has died off with more modern cars.  However, it is important that cars that are sold on or thought to have been scrapped do not come back onto the roads.  A register that would deal with this issue would be very important.  Mr. Towey said that he reckoned that approximately 40% of cars come back onto the roads.  I did not think the figure was as high as that, but it is a substantial amount and it could be very dangerous if vehicles are coming back onto the roads.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted that the Minister is bringing in the new speed limit of 20 km\/h.  I brought that Bill through the D&aacute;il.  There was cross-party agreement to examine this issue.  It is very important, especially in housing estates.  We seem to have an increase in the number of children who have been killed on the roads recently.  We had a very good record over the past few years in terms of reducing the number of people who were killed on the roads.  For some reason, the figure increased a bit last year. <\/p> <p>  I want to ask a few things about medical issues and drugs in general.  I have been on the drugs task force for many years.  I am repeatedly told that to measure properly the amount of heroin, cocaine or grass or cannabis in a person's system, testing needs to be done within 24 hours.  Is it the case that to get a proper measurement it would be necessary to get to an individual within 24 hours?  Is there a longer period for different drugs?  I am curious about that.  How are prescription drugs distinguished?  How does that work out?  Many car crashes appear to have occurred out of the blue.  It has been my opinion for a long time that these crashes could be drug-related, or people may have committed suicide.  Do we carry out tests in all incidents?  Is there proper testing in what appear to be random car accidents?<\/p> <p>  Blood specimens and urine were mentioned.  What about hair samples and saliva?  There is no mention of that.  We are still talking in terms of blood specimens and urine.  Should we be taking these things into account?  I would appreciate a response on some of those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015041600002#K00400","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429191000,"counter":802,"content":"<p>I am happy to respond.  In respect of employer responsibility and testing drivers for intoxicants, as I have said, we want to introduce a provision that mirrors the provision that already applies under Part 9 of the Railway Safety Act to safety-critical workers on the railways, under which Irish Rail has introduced a system of random testing.  Irish Rail reports that the system is very successful in creating the kind of culture that it wants to create with regard to safe driving.  The essential element of the regime would be an obligation on employers to put in place random testing.  A certain proportion of workers would be subjected to testing.  It would not be a particularly significant testing obligation but the requirement would exist.  There would also be an obligation on employees to provide the necessary specimens.  The purpose of the provision would be to introduce preventative measures and to have a deterrent effect.  It has worked successfully elsewhere.  We understand from the State bus companies, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus, that they feel that there would be positive benefits if it were introduced in their companies, but that they have said that a legislative underpinning is necessary in order to bring it forward.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ellis mentioned the issue of drink and drugs in combination.  That does happen and it is very evident from the specimen sampling which has been undertaken by the Medical Bureau for Road Safety.  We are proposing, therefore, that the legislation provide for increased penalties when a person is driving under the influence of both alcohol and drugs.  We envisage that the penalty would be increased by potentially 50% in those cases.  That would establish a minimum penalty, with the possibility of a higher penalty being imposed at the discretion of the judge.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of written-off cars coming back on the roads, Deputy Ellis reflected the figure I used of 40% of vehicles finding their way back on to the roads.  It may be important for me to clarify what I meant when I used the term \"written off\".  I am talking about a situation in which the insurance company has made a decision that the cost of repair of the vehicle exceeds the insured value of the vehicle.  In many cases - about 40% of cases - the vehicle is typically beyond repair.  However, in 60% of cases, the vehicle is repairable but it is the view of the insurance company that it is better from its point of view to pay the insured value of the vehicle rather than the cost of repair.  It is not necessarily the case that all of those vehicles that come back on the road are unsuitable to be driven, but there is a possibility that some of them may be unsuitable.<\/p><p> Deputy Ellis welcomed the speed limit issue and no particular question arose from it.  As to the issues he raised concerning drugs and the 24-hour period, Professor Cusack might be best placed to expand on the matter.  He may also wish to expand on another of the Deputy's questions, that being, saliva samples.  The preliminary roadside testing for drugs will be based on saliva samples.  Where such a test indicates the presence of drugs, the person will be taken to a Garda station where a blood sample will be taken.  The blood sample will be the definitive sample for the purpose of any prosecution that might be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015041600002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Towey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429191000,"counter":804,"content":"<p>Is there a provision for taking hair samples?

On the issue of the 24-hour period, alcohol is a particular drug, a pleasant one, that many people take voluntarily and sensibly but which some others do not.  In this context, though, we are dealing with seven other classes of drug: cannabis; benzodiazepine; Valium or tranquiliser-like drugs; cocaine; amphetamines and methamphetamines like ecstasy and speed; methadone; and other opiates.  In addition to these are other drugs that are not always tested for under road safety measures.  This is a complex area.  Those drugs fall into different classes of being sedative-like drugs, hallucinogen-like drugs and stimulant-like drugs.  They are different family types.  Some will only stay in their active components in the body for short periods.  Sometimes, this presents a difficulty.  I know from my forensic doctor colleagues that, although police in England will test someone on the roadside who is clearly impaired, by the time he or she is brought to a police station the doctor conducting the examination must honestly find that the person is not impaired.  Other drugs can last much longer, so each must be taken on its own merits.<\/p> <p>  I will link this matter to that of hair.  A hair sample is a useful forensic tool, but it covers a much longer sphere.  For those who still have head hair, certain drugs will get deposited as our hair grows.  This tool is used more to see whether someone has used a drug of abuse over the longer term, that is, weeks or months.  It is not particularly useful in the immediate phase.  The Bill's measures are concerned with whether a driver has an impairing active drug in his or her system while driving, not with whether he or she took drugs last week, two weeks ago or three months ago.  That is another issue.<\/p> <p>  I do not know whether the Deputy was referring to car crashes when discussing the tragedy of suicide.  Under the Road Traffic Act, we in the bureau only deal with living samples, but the coroners send samples from all road traffic crashes to determine what was in people's systems.  One of the studies involved Kildare.  This is a relevant issue.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about blood, urine and saliva.  He is right, in that much of this work to date has been concerned with blood and urine.  We define \"oral fluid\" as including saliva.  Dr. Maguire will pick me up if I mislead members in any way.  What goes through our blood goes into our saliva.  Different drugs bind in saliva in different ways, which is what makes this process so complex.  Had the Deputy asked me ten years ago after the ROSITA and DRUID studies, I would have said that we were not yet at a stage where we could reliably look to the tests in question.  The situation has since progressed significantly and we are now examining oral fluids at the roadside.  As part of our recommendation, we have suggested that, as technology develops, saliva might be suitable for confirmatory or evidential testing.  The roadside test is only meant to determine whether it looks like there is a drug.  That will not be enough for a prosecution, as it must be confirmed that a drug is in the blood.  Currently, the emphasis is on blood and urine, but oral fluids could be included in future.  We hope to develop this aspect.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about prescribable drugs but he also referred to alcohol and other drugs.  Of the 1,000 drivers we studied who were under the then alcohol limit, one third tested positive for drugs.  Of those who were over the alcohol limit, 15% also tested positive for other drugs.  The Deputy is right about there being a problem.  Ireland has a nuanced balance.  In terms of blood measures for alcohol, we are one of the few countries with levels at 20 mg, 50 mg, 80 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg.  As members are aware, there are tiered and increasing penalties between the 50 mg and 150 mg levels.  I understand that the Minister will make a recommendation in this regard to the Oireachtas.  For example, if someone has alcohol at a particular level plus a drug, one way to approach the issue would be to bring the person up to the next penalty tier.  If we recognise that a driver with an alcohol level of 81 mg is more dangerous than a driver who has a level of 50 mg or that someone with a level of more than 150 mg is more dangerous than someone with a level of 81 mg, a person with a blood alcohol level of 81 mg plus ecstasy is clearly more dangerous than someone with a level of just 81 mg.  Therefore, should this be reflected in the penalty?  This question is being considered actively.<\/p> <p>  I am unsure as to whether I have answered the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015041600002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Denis Cusack"},{"type":"speech","time":1429191000,"counter":809,"content":"<p>Professor Cusack has.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015041600002#L00700","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1429191000,"counter":810,"content":"<p>Deputies Harrington and Fitzmaurice and Senator Brennan are next.

Under this legislation, however, even texting on a device in a handheld cradle will be covered.  Increasingly, mobile telephones in cradles are being used as satellite navigation devices.  Insurance companies use applications to gauge driving behaviour, particularly of younger drivers, with a view to providing discounts, for example, Aviva.  The departmental officials referred to SMS messaging, but there is more to the issue.  Will we reach the point of having to proscribe many different mobile telephone processes or applications?  When one starts listing things, one leaves out others.  What are the officials' opinions in this regard?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the employer&rsquo;s test for intoxicants, the departmental officials might outline what is involved.  They mentioned railways.  Have they sought or will they seek legal advice on issues arising with testing schemes introduced by employers?  Would an employer be liable for any accident that occurred after a driver had been tested?  Would employers become criminally or civilly liable due to equipment failure or some other failure?<\/p><p>I presume local authorities will be empowered to make by-laws or do whatever they need to do to introduce the special speed limits of 20 km\/h in some areas that will be permitted under this legislation.<\/p><p> I would like to put a few questions to the representatives of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  They spoke about the balancing of rights.  Obviously, nobody wants to be stopped or delayed too often by being asked for samples, etc.  A suite of different drugs require different testing and sampling regimes.  They have different effects and different timescales apply to them.  In alcohol situations, the medical bureau can be very definitive about the blood alcohol level.  I believe that is never questioned.  Prosecutions fail for different reasons.  There are many variables in the drug-testing regime.  Impaired driving can lead to testing.  I am not sure how we can provide for solid legislation that will allow for a reasonable number of prosecutions in this area.  Have we tested all of that out?<\/p><p> Reference has been made to prescribed drugs.  I agree that when drugs are listed in the legislation, there are always drugs that are left out.  It is then a matter for the Garda to say it is a case of impaired driving and it goes back into the system.  Loophole after loophole arises, in my opinion, when we try to provide for something like that in legislation.  We have a difficulty when we are providing for legislation in the full knowledge that it will be very difficult for it to succeed, or for the Director or Public Prosecutions to take a prosecution on the basis of it, because there are so many variables in the testing.  Maybe the witnesses can address those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015041600002#L00900","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429191000,"counter":813,"content":"<p>We will bank the Deputy's questions, if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015041600002#M00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1429191000,"counter":814,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I will begin by putting some questions to Mr. Fintan Towey.  Over the last few years, every lorry driver has had to take the certificate of professional competence.  It makes a lorry driver a competent driver.  As part of that process, lorry drivers are given explanations about drinking and driving, etc.  Mr. Towey spoke about Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Is he suggesting that small operators who employ two or three people should be responsible for getting breathalyser tests done on each of their drivers, who might leave somewhere like Ballyhaunis or Cork with the fridge on to bring a load of meat out of this country?  Where do employers stand in all of this from an employment rights perspective?<\/p> <p>  How legal is what the Department is proposing to do?  A person who has taken a certificate of professional competence is supposed, as a competent driver, to check his or her vehicle every morning.  I suggest that knowing the legal alcohol limits and the law with regard to drug abuse is supposed to be part of being a competent driver.  Those who are shoving this over to employers have given us American statistics, but I remind them that drivers in America could spend a fortnight on a road train.  That is not the case in Ireland.  Irish drivers go out of the country.  Did the departmental officials look at the legality of what they are trying to impose on the heavy goods vehicle sector, which is under ferocious pressure at the moment?  No one condones drink driving, but to be quite frank, I think what the Department is trying to do will never work from a legal perspective.  I would like to hear Mr. Towey's comments on that.<\/p> <p>  Reference has been made to what England has done with regard to licences.  Why does Ireland use EU licences if countries do not have joined-up thinking with one another?  The new licences at the moment are EU licences.  Why have we not stayed with our own Irish licences if England basically does not even recognise what is going on at the moment?  It needs to be made clear that the points system does not work between the two countries.<\/p> <p>  As someone who has a daughter with diabetes, I would like to tell Professor Cusack I am aware that people in England who have diabetes are coming under fair pressure to keep their licences.  Having promoted people to do things in this country, are we going to bring in a scenario where this will happen because of certain illnesses?  I would not like to see that happen.  I think those fears need to be allayed very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015041600002#M00300","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1429191000,"counter":815,"content":"<p>I welcome both presentations.  I would like to direct my first question to Mr. Towey.  Will the bilateral agreement that has been negotiated with the UK, which will be signed by us shortly and will be signed by the UK after next month's general election in that country, apply to and include Northern Ireland?  Perhaps Mr. Towey answered this question in his presentation.  I am not quite sure.  Perhaps he can confirm the answer.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ellis spoke about vehicles that have been written off.  I was alarmed to learn that 45,000 vehicles are being written off each year.  My interpretation of \"written off\" obviously differs from what Mr. Towey is talking about.  I think that if a car is written off, it is a danger on the public road.  If 40% of cars that are written off are coming back onto our roads, that means we are talking about approximately 18,000 cars.  Surely this is creating a dangerous situation for us.  If a car has been written off, it should be broken down for its scrap value and any suitable parts should be reused.  I think the current approach is putting dangerous vehicles on our roads.  Are these written-off vehicles still liable for or subjected to national car testing?  Is there any way we could reduce the number of written-off vehicles that are being reused and coming back onto our roadways?  Is there any way to ensure a car is demolished or broken up for its scrap value, perhaps three months after being written off?<\/p> <p>  I would like to give my personal view about the 20 km\/h speed limit.  I appreciate the work that Deputy Ellis is doing on this issue in the Lower House.  As far as I am concerned, speed limit signs are worth absolutely nothing.  They are a waste of money and a waste of time.  I accept that vehicles are parked here and there to catch people who exceed the speed limit.  I was caught doing 63 km\/h in a 60 km\/h zone, after coming off a motorway where I could do 120 km\/h.  No discretion was shown, but that is not my issue.  I am saying that these signs are absolutely useless.  The only way to slow down traffic in built-up areas like housing estates is to construct speed bumps.  In fact, some local authorities have made it obligatory for them to be constructed in housing schemes at the construction stage.  Not many housing schemes are being built at present.  Some local authorities - I will not mention their names - have constructed speed bumps at the construction stage.  It is the only way.  I have seen them and studied them near schools on main roads in many counties in this country.  I have taken photographs of locations where flashing lights and various \"slow down\" type signs, showing schoolchildren walking hand in hand, are used.  I have gone into local schools.  The only way to slow drivers down, even after all those signs were installed, was to construct a speed bump in the middle of the school road and one at each end of the school road.<\/p><p>I firmly believe that is the only way to address the problem in existing and new estates.  There are no long stretches of straight roadway through many of our estates.  The perpetrators of excessive speeding in housing estates are not, by and large, people driving through them for the first time, rather they are residents of those estates, some of who themselves have children.  We must protect the children.  The only way of doing so is to encourage drivers to slow down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015041600002#M00400","speaker":"1138","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429191000,"counter":817,"content":"<p>I hope I capture all of the questions.  In regard to the issue of distracted driving as a result of the use of mobile communications and the difficulties that arise in that respect, it is important to point out that in terms of road safety this has been identified as a significant issue.  As such, it is incumbent upon us to introduce whatever measures we can to bring about changes in driver behaviour, in particular in regard to the use of mobile devices.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, there were approximately 30,000 instances of offences in relation to the holding of a mobile telephone by drivers, in respect of which penalties were imposed.  I understand there are a small number of prosecutions pending in relation to drivers texting while driving.  It is true that it is difficult to detect and prosecute that offence.  The month after the introduction of the regulations in regard to texting while driving the number of offences relating to the holding of a mobile phone while driving was approximately 5,000.  This decreased to 2,000 in the following month.  As such, the regulations had a significant deterrent effect. <\/p> <p>  It is true that technology continues to evolve.  Following the introduction of the regulations there was an increase in FMS messaging, which is traditional texting.  There are many new communication possibilities through various applications, such as WhatsApp, Viber, Facebook and so on.  Our objective is to try to prevent drivers interacting, using their hands, with mobile devices while driving and to encourage the use of cradle born devices such as a SatNav.  Use of a SatNav involves entering data regarding the trip into the device prior to driving, after which SatNav voice commands takeover, with a driver having to glance only occasionally at the screen.  There is no interaction by hand once the SatNav has been set up.  That is the track we are going, although I do not think anybody would suggest that that is perfect.  The issue of people using mobile devices while driving has been identified as a safety issue and is one that we need to try to tackle.<\/p> <p>  The issue of employers testing for intoxicants was raised by two Deputies.

There are people who are driving while impaired due to the presence of drugs in their systems.  Based on tests done on samples, we know certain types of drugs are prevalent, such as cannabis.

I do not know if it will be of help to the committee, but there is a provision in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, section 13(1)(b), which puts responsibilities on the employee not to be intoxicated and put others at risk.  I believe this is a theme.  It is about shared responsibility and it is not all on the employer nor all on the employee.  I do not know if this is a help and it might cross-reference with different legislation.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Harrington's question, my response was to Deputy Ellis, who was asking how drugs are tested for and how they go into the body, the Deputies are quite right that it is more complex, but that is simply in terms of how we test what we are looking for.  There are many variables and it is more complicated than alcohol, but perhaps I can reassure the committee by simplifying the variables.  In terms of road safety and impaired driving, it comes down to whether the drug disappears from the system in 24 hours or three hours and whether we can test it by one method or another.  They are the complexities we have to deal with.  When it comes to the safety of driving the simple variables are whether there is an active substance in the bloodstream at the time of driving which is known to impair driving and make it more dangerous, and how we find that substance.  One can take all the variables and reduce them to just that moment in time.<\/p> <p>  One might also consider all the things for which we cannot test.  This is why I go back to the opening statement.  It is important to know what is happening elsewhere.  From all of the literature, we know that the classes of drugs picked up in the majority of impaired drivers are drugs such as cannabis, benzodiazepine or valium-type drugs, cocaine, opiates, methadone, amphetamine and methamphetamine.  Members are right that it is not 100%, but if we were to not to do anything until we can find everything, then we would be putting lives at risk.  This is a very comprehensive start.  I will give the committee an example.  When we checked the blood and urine samples of drivers arrested by garda&iacute; on suspicion of driving while intoxicated, but who were found to be under the limit for alcohol, approximately 75% of samples turn out to be positive for drugs.  That is a very good start.  It is not perfect; it is more complicated.<\/p> <p>  There is a discrepancy between the number certified as definitely having drugs in the bloodstream versus the number of prosecutions.  I brought this up with previous Ministers Michael McDowell and the late S&eacute;amus Brennan, which illustrates how long ago it was.  Part of the reason was the difficulty in bringing evidence that would satisfy.  One of the important things in our democracy is that nobody should be found guilty of an offence unless there is evidence beyond reasonable doubt.  Taking away a person's driving licence is a very big step.  We are trying to balance that with road safety.  Since November 2014 there is impairment testing which is fairer to the driver and assists the Garda in bringing forward better and fairer evidence.  The roadside chemical testing is adding to that.  We hope that this course is progress.  I remind members that it took decades to get the roadside mandatory alcohol testing.  It is a significant step, but it will take time.  We take our job seriously to make sure that what is out there is fair, accurate and practical for garda&iacute;.  For example, can they use these devices in the pouring rain?  Even though the garda&iacute; and the devices came in dripping wet, we found they could be used.  I wish to reassure the committee that, despite all the complexities, we are trying to make sure this is a simple and fair system.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy Fitzmaurice for discussing drivers with diabetes.  In another life my specialty training here and abroad was diabetes.  What the Deputy has said is exactly what we want to ensure - that people are reassured.  This system is making sure that drivers remain healthy and fit to drive and it supports drivers.  I am a member of the fitness to drive group which also has patient representation and specialists in diabetes.  I do not know if members have had the opportunity to read the guidelines as it is probably not light reading, but up to a few years ago we relied on skimpy 1980s guidelines from the old Department of the Environment.  We had to refer people to the UK guidelines for doctors.  The thing about medical fitness to drive is not to stop people driving but to facilitate people with medical conditions to be in the best health possible and to make sure they are not precluded from driving because of a medical condition, whether it is epilepsy, heart disease or diabetes.  Chapter four of the UK document sets out guidelines on diabetes mellitus and contains a number of appendices to help doctors and their patients ensure that the patients, as drivers, remain fit and healthy and do not run foul.  It is very positive and we need to get the message out that somebody taking insulin or an oral hypoglycemic is not going to run foul of roadside drug testing.  It is a very important message and I thank the Deputy for bringing it up.  Road traffic legislation deals with the penal and criminal, but instead of linking it to misuse of drugs and criminality, as a doctor I am trying to link it to where it belongs - road safety and medical fitness to drive.  Rather than trying to have prosecution, why not try to get people to realise that all we are trying to do is make sure that drivers are driving safely for themselves, their families and other road users.  I hope this reassures members about medical fitness to drive.  The Deputy himself is probably an expert on diabetes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015041600002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Denis Cusack"},{"type":"speech","time":1429191000,"counter":858,"content":"<p>It is just to get the message out there.
