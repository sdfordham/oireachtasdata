This is in sharp contrast to the rest of the EU where there has been steady growth in the number of employees working part-time and the number of fulltime workers has continued to fall.<\/p><p>  Much of our jobs growth is in sectors which we have targeted in the Action Plan for Jobs, such as Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing, Accommodation and Food Services, and Industry.  The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs, which was published at the end of February, contains 385 discrete actions across a wide range of sectors to support competitiveness and job creation.<\/p><p>  The efforts of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are geared to creating full-time employment rather than part-time employment and this is reflected in their employment trends. Jobs Plus, the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s employer incentive scheme, has helped recruit 2,115 long-term unemployed jobseekers from the Live Register to fill full-time positions since its introduction last July, and is deliberately designed to encourage employers to provide full time jobs.<\/p><p>  The change reflected in the reduction of part-time employment relative to the increase in permanent and\/or full-time contracts in Ireland contrasts with the position at EU aggregate level.  While full time employment is the focus of our policy efforts, I recognise that in Ireland as indeed throughout Europe, temporary and part-time jobs are a contribution to job creation since in the medium to long run they may act as a stepping stone to permanent and\/or full-time contracts.<\/p><p>  I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns about the way in which zero hour contracts can operate.  I have, on previous occasions, pointed out that the manner in which these contracts are regulated in Ireland differs from the position in the United Kingdom, where they have generated greater controversy.

This performance in employment growth is better than anywhere in the OECD.<\/p><p>  In addition, my Department has reformed the system for delivery of support to micro and small enterprises by creating the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) within the Local Authority structure. This reform will help to make the operating environment for businesses more coherent, responsive and conducive to entrepreneurship at local level.  All 31 LEOs opened for business on 15th  April.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises. My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of my own Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices. The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops. The aim is that this framework will serve as a model for other regions of the country.<\/p><p>  Under the 2014-2020 Regional Aid Guidelines, which will enter into force on 1 July 2014, areas accounting for 51.28% of Ireland&rsquo;s population will now be eligible for assistance.

NERA officials have also met with a representative of the employer and provided information on the employer&rsquo;s obligations and the rights of the employees. <\/p><p>  Irish employment rights legislation provides a comprehensive range of protections for employees. In this particular case, there may be several possible avenues of redress for the employees to consider, including, for example, making a complaint to a Rights Commissioner under the Payment of Wages Act for unpaid wages and bringing a claim to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) where the employer fails to comply with redundancy payment\/minimum notice obligations. <\/p><p>  The administration of the Redundancy Payments legislation is within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, who has advised that it is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all eligible employees. Where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department of Social Protection that he\/she is unable to pay statutory redundancy to his\/her eligible employees that Department will make lump sum payments directly to those employees. Such payments are made from the Social Insurance Fund and result in a debt being raised against the employer which the Department of Social Protection will seek to recover.<\/p><p>  Where an employer is legally insolvent (liquidation, receivership, bankruptcy etc.) and, as a result, defaults on payment of wages and other entitlements, an employee may also be entitled to seek redress from the State under the Insolvency Payments Scheme.

Drawing on data from 176 countries, the UN Population Fund reported significant achievements. <\/p><p>  Today, fewer women are dying in pregnancy and childbirth. Worldwide, maternal mortality, while still at an unacceptably high level, fell by nearly half between 1990 and 2010.  More women now have access to education, work and political participation. More children, girls in particular, are going to school; primary school enrolment rates are now approaching 90%.   Nearly 1 billion people have moved out of extreme poverty.<\/p><p>  However, progress remains uneven and fragmented. In the poorest communities, women&rsquo;s status, maternal mortality, and rates of child marriage, have seen too little progress over the past two decades. Every day, some 800 women will die giving birth.  Worldwide, one in three women report having experienced physical and\/or sexual abuse. In developing countries, one in three girls are married before the age of 18, with serious consequences for their opportunities for a better life. <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s development policy contains an explicit commitment to the Cairo Programme of Action, through efforts that reduce maternal and infant mortality and promote universal access to reproductive healthcare, including ante-natal care and family planning services.

It provides a clear commitment to maximising progress under the MDGs and a roadmap for the negotiation of a new global development framework post-2015.  Since last year, Ireland has been actively engaged in the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals at the United Nations which is the main intergovernmental forum tasked with developing recommendations on the Post 2015 framework.

While the precise type of vehicle is not disclosed, it is assumed that it is a van as defined in the benefit  in-kind legislation. Generally speaking, the use of a van by an employee or director to travel between places of work is considered to be business rather than private use of the vehicle. \u00a0This is on the basis that the expense associated with such travel is incurred necessarily in the performance of the duties of the employment.<\/p><p>Whether a journey is undertaken in the performance of the duties of an employment depends on the particular facts of the case. So, while as a general rule travel between the registered office of a company and a client's premises would be a business journey, this need not always be the case.\u00a0 For example, if the registered office of the company was also the home of the employee, the travel will generally have a private purpose, i.e. that of travelling to and from home.\u00a0\u00a0 The fact that the vehicle is used to carry tools does not change the purpose of the journey or make it business use. <\/p><p>For the sake of completeness I should add that no taxable benefit will arise in respect of the private use of company van where all of the following conditions are met:<\/p><p>-the van is supplied by the employer to the employee for the purposes of the employee's work<\/p><p>-the employee is required by the employer to bring the van home after work<\/p><p>-apart from travelling from work to home and back to work, other private use of the van by the employee is forbidden by the employer, and there is <b>in fact<\/b>no other private use<\/p><p>-in the course of his or her work, the employee spends at least 80% of his or her time away from the premises of the employer to which he or she is attached.<\/p><p>This exemption applies to company vans only.

In May 2013, the NCSE published its Policy Advice on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools.<\/p><p>Both reports concluded that the SNA scheme has been highly successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools, and with assisting to facilitate their integration and inclusion. However, the reports also concluded that the intended purpose of the scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and that the scope and purpose of the scheme should be clarified for schools.<\/p><p>My Department accordingly prepared a new Circular for schools, which was designed to clarify the scope and purpose of the SNA scheme, in accordance with the recommendations of the reports and policy advice noted above. The circular therefore should not be interpreted as a means to reduce the numbers of SNAs in schools.<\/p><p>At present all SNA allocations are reviewed annually. The circular restates this practice. It should also not be assumed that any such review will automatically lead to a reduction in SNA support for individual pupils, or for schools who have pupils who have continuing care needs.<\/p><p>The Circular acknowledges that many pupils will have care needs which may remain constant. However, the Circular makes clear that whereas supports may be reduced to ensure that pupils who have diminishing care needs can be afforded an opportunity to develop independent living skills, that SNA supports will continue to be provided for those pupils who have ongoing care needs.<\/p><p>The Circular provides details of the primary care needs for which SNA support will usually be provided and details the types of secondary care associated tasks which SNAs may often perform.

However, I understand that the CSO does not compile statistics on jobs created and lost on a county basis.  <\/p><p>As far as agencies of my Department are concerned, the number of jobs created by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices (formerly CEBs), in the past five years are set out in the following Tables, 1, 2 and 3.  (Prior to 2010, the CEBs could only report on the number of jobs existing in CEB-supported companies.  In 2010, the CEBs&rsquo; data recording system was changed, thereby enabling them to produce figures for jobs existing, job gains and job losses for the years from 2010 onwards.)<\/p><p>As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I introduced a collaborative, cross- government approach to advancing job creation in the State.  The Action Plan for Jobs is an annual plan designed to drive action across all Government Departments and Agencies in a collective effort to put in place the conditions needed to support and grow employment in the State.<\/p><p>This Government has set an ambitious target of adding 100,000 net new jobs by 2016 on a path to having 2.1 million people employed in the economy by 2020.  <\/p><p>In the year to Q1 2014, there was an annual increase in employment of 2.3% or 42,700 jobs in the economy, bringing total employment to 1,888,200.<\/p><p>I was pleased to note that the long-term unemployment rate decreased from 8.4% to 7.3% over the year to Q1 2014.  Long-term unemployment accounted for 60.5% of total unemployment in Q1 2014, compared with 61.8% last year, and 63.5% in the first quarter of 2012.  In the same period, youth unemployment decreased from 26.7% to 25.3%.  These figures are very encouraging and show that the Government's Action Plan for Jobs process is working and getting people back to work.<\/p><p>The Government also specifically continues to address the alleviation of youth unemployment through the combined strategies of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.  The objective of Pathways to Work &ndash; which has a particular focus on supporting those who are unemployed - is to ensure that as many jobs as possible are filled by people from the Live Register. <\/p><p>There are a number of actions in both the Action Plan and Pathways to Work which are targeted at, or amenable to, younger people. These include the JobBridge internship programme, the JobPlus initiative, the Youth Guarantee, the Momentum and Springboard training courses, and the ICT Action Plan.  These initiatives are collectively delivered by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills. The Government is also increasing the number of training places available for young people this year. For example, the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs includes a commitment to ring-fence 2,000 places for people under 25 years of age under the new iteration of the Momentum programme this year. <\/p><p>Within my own Department, there is a strong emphasis on supporting entrepreneurship this year, and the range of supports available to entrepreneurs - including young entrepreneurs - is being increased.  A key initiative in 2014, under the Action Plan for Jobs, is the establishment of a new &euro;2m Fund to find Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur.<\/p><p>We will continue to build on this progress through the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work to ensure that more employment opportunities are available to all those who are seeking work, particularly young people.<\/p><p><b>Table 1:<\/b><table><tr><th>Enterprise Ireland<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Jobs Created<\/td><td>9,500<\/td><td>16,206<\/td><td>13,717<\/td><td>12,256<\/td><td>12,536<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Source: Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey<\/p><p><b>Table 2:<\/b><table><tr><th>IDA Ireland<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Jobs Created<\/td><td>5,375<\/td><td>10,430<\/td><td>12,314<\/td><td>12,773<\/td><td>10,611<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Source: Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey<\/p><p><b>Table 3:<\/b><table><tr><th>LEOs<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Jobs Created<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>4,510<\/td><td>5,331<\/td><td>4,858<\/td><td>5,278<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500049#WRB04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Schemes","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500050#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[23966\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500050#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which science and innovation supports have been made available to small and medium enterprises in each of the past five years to date; the number of jobs created under this heading; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s mission is to work with entrepreneurs, Irish businesses, and the research and investment communities to develop Ireland&rsquo;s international trade, innovation, and competitiveness with the ultimate objective of employment and export growth.

Foreign-owned firms contribute substantially to Ireland&rsquo;s exports, jobs, expenditure in the Irish economy and to Exchequer funds.  FDI plays a key role in stimulating the development of &lsquo;new&rsquo; sectors in Ireland, in enhancing our research, development and innovation performance and in accelerating the achievement of critical mass within sectors.   Every 10 jobs in an IDA Ireland client company supports 7 jobs in the wider economy. <\/p><p>  I am glad to say that the numbers employed in companies supported by IDA Ireland has steadily increased in the five year period 2009 to 2013 inclusive.  Total employment in IDA Ireland client companies (including companies that were formerly clients of Shannon Development) has risen from 144,843 in 2009 to 166,184 in 2013.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs is a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the unemployment problem and its specific ambition is to have 100,000 more people in work by 2016.  The Government has set out an objective to create a positive environment to support business start-ups and growth, drive exports and facilitate job creation and retention by the enterprise sector.<\/p><p>  Under the 2014 Action Plan, IDA Ireland is tasked with the creation of 13,000 new gross jobs (yielding approximately 6,000 net new jobs) during the year.   Significantly, under the Plan additional resources are committed to IDA Ireland aimed at achieving an increased market presence and consequential delivery of additional 10,000 new jobs (6,000 direct and 4,000 indirect) over and above the year&rsquo;s target of 13,000, intensifying employment growth over a five year period. <\/p><p>  In addition the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of my own Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices.  The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops. The aim is that this framework will serve as a model for other regions of the country.<\/p><p>  Under the 2014-2020 Regional Aid Guidelines, which will enter into force on 1 July 2014, areas accounting for 51.28% of Ireland&rsquo;s population will now be eligible for assistance.  This represents a substantial increase from the 25% originally proposed by the Commission, and an increase from the 50% under the 2007-2013 Map.  Another key issue for Ireland in the negotiations on the Regional Aid Guidelines with the Commission was the prospect of not being allowed to grant aid large enterprises.

Horizon 2020 is a core part of Europe 2020,  the Innovation Union and the European Research Area and is responding to the economic crisis through investing in future jobs and growth, addressing people&rsquo;s concerns about their livelihoods, safety and environment and strengthening the EU&rsquo;s global position in research, innovation and technology.<\/p><p>  Ireland is well positioned to benefit from Horizon 2020, building on our excellent performance in the last EU programme for research and development, the Seventh EU Framework Programme (FP7), where some &euro;600m in funding was awarded to companies and academics in Ireland.  Irish-based foreign multinationals are actively supported by to engage in collaborative international research.  In FP7 there were over 400 participations by 70 IDA Ireland client companies, with over &euro;32m of funding awarded to such companies. <\/p><p>  In December 2013, the Government approved a national strategy for participation in Horizon 2020 together with an ambitious target of &euro;1.25 billion in funding to Ireland over the lifetime of Horizon 2020. The strategy sets out a comprehensive range of actions designed to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the programme and achieve the target, involving all of the key Departments, agencies and research performers. A Horizon 2020 High Level Group, under the chairmanship of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has been established to oversee the implementation of the national strategy. This includes identifying key areas of opportunity where researchers, agencies and companies in Ireland can maximise their participation in the programme. <\/p><p>  A national support network of National Contact Points coordinated by Enterprise Ireland has been established, comprising knowledgeable and experienced practitioners from relevant Departments and agencies, charged with helping companies and academics access the funding opportunities presented by Horizon 2020. <\/p><p>  I am confident that, building on our successful performance in FP7 and supported by our national strategy and a strong national support network, Irish companies and multinational corporations based in Ireland will continue to have excellent support to compete for Horizon 2020 funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500050#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":132,"content":"<p>Question No. 54 answered with Question No. 52.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":133,"content":"<p>Question No. 55 answered with Question No. 49.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services Provision","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500050#WRC01150"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[23971\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500050#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which science and innovation continues to play a role in the setting up of new or supporting existing enterprises here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":136,"content":"<p>The importance of investment in science, technology and innovation to Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing and future economic and social development has been well recognised by the Government. Our focus has and continues to be very much on prioritising public investment in research while better exploiting results in order to lead to an acceleration of growth and job creation. This investment in scientific research  is having many positive impacts including powering an innovative and enterprising economy, creating high-value jobs, attracting, developing and nurturing business, scientists and talented people and ensuring Ireland is connected and respected internationally.<\/p><p>  In order for companies to grow their employment, they need to increase their competitiveness and grow their sales and export growth; to achieve success on the global market they must be innovative in order to differentiate themselves.  Investment is based on a dual approach. Firstly, investing in people, infrastructure and associated facilities to build the science base and secondly, direct support to the enterprise sector to build their capacity for research and development.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland, together with the IDA and Science Foundation Ireland, provide a spectrum of science, technology and innovation development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which sustainable employment will grow and expand. <\/p><p>  Employment by companies supported by Enterprise Ireland increased by a net 5,442 in 2013.  This represents the highest level of job growth in a decade and is a positive indication of a productive indigenous enterprise sector where investment in science, technology and innovation continues to play a key role.  Similarly, IDA Ireland saw a fourth consecutive year of employment growth with 7,071 net new jobs in 2013 and 164 new investments won, with 27 of these specifically in Research, Development and Innovation. Science Foundation Ireland is a key part of the enterprise ecosystem and in 2013 SFI had links to 41% (2618) of 6,449 jobs (90 company announcements) announced by the IDA in all fields.<\/p><p>  The commercialisation of research represents one of the most direct ways a return from the investment in science and innovation can be seen and this return is most recognisably evidenced by the number of commercially valuable technologies transferred from the higher education sector to industry and the number of spin out companies created that are based on academic research. Enterprise Ireland has responsibility for the commercialisation of all research funded in the State and it employs two main approaches in this regard; by funding the commercialisation &amp;amp; technology transfer infrastructure in the State and by operating a commercialisation funding programme.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s research commercialisation activities helped to create thirty-four spin-out companies from higher education research and facilitated the transfer of over 100 pieces of commercially valuable technology to companies in 2013. Over 100 companies were created via its on-campus entrepreneurial training initiative, New Frontiers. These activities were supported by the extensive campus incubation facilities which housed 350 companies employing over 1500 people in 2013.<\/p><p>  The recent launch of Knowledge Transfer Ireland (KTI) - the state funded central technology transfer office - further advances the Government&rsquo;s plan to strengthen and standardise the Irish knowledge transfer infrastructure. <\/p><p>  KTI is the first resource of its kind in Europe and offers businesses the ability to search research and expertise available in Irish HEIs, find opportunities to licence new technology and IP, and access practical guides and model agreements - all of which can be used by business as a starting point to engaging with the research sector.<\/p><p>  The 2014 European Commission&rsquo;s Innovation Union Scoreboard, published recently shows Ireland increasing its position from tenth to ninth in the overall ranking of 28 Member States. It is also particularly encouraging to see that Ireland is the overall leader in the indicator for the economic effects of innovation. This captures the economic success of innovation in employment in knowledge-intensive activities, the contribution of medium and high-tech product exports to the trade balance, exports of knowledge-intensive services, sales due to innovation activities and license and patent revenues from selling technologies abroad.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs gives a clear mandate to Enterprise Ireland to drive entrepreneurship and new business start-ups. 2013 was a very strong year with many highlights, including the big increase in female led start-ups and the strong showing of new start-ups from overseas and spin-outs from Irish Universities and Institutes of Technology. In 2013, Enterprise Ireland invested in 104 new High Potential Start Up companies and also provided critical funding to 85 early stage entrepreneurs under its Competitive Start Funds. These companies come from a wide range of sectors including key areas that the Government has targeted for growth, including the financial services, ICT, games, pharmaceutical and medical devices. <\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 emphasises the importance of innovation and the use of technology as core drivers of job creation in Ireland&rsquo;s key sectors during 2014 and into the coming years. Research and development support programmes and initiatives remain key to the setting up of new and supporting existing Irish business in order to drive growth, sustainability, exports and employment.  My Department and its enterprise agencies will continue to promote the application of research, development and innovation to gain competitive advantage and to build on the strengths that have emerged from the investment to date in Science, Technology and Innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500050#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":137,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500050#WRC01350"},{"type":"question","counter":138,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[23972\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500050#WRC01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which he expects jobs to be created in the small and medium enterprise sector in the coming years; the way this compares with previous years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":139,"content":"<p>The Action Plan for Jobs is the Government&rsquo;s main policy instrument to support job creation.

In addition, it can be possible for companies to also access State or EU supports from other sources. However many companies are not exclusively in either the manufacturing or services sectors and not all such companies are eligible for assistance,  depending on complex rules. For these reasons, there is considerable difficulty in providing clearly defined data as sought by the Deputy and the information requested is not easily available in the format requested.<\/p><p>  The Forf&aacute;s Strategy for the Manufacturing Sector, which I commissioned and which was published last year, identified that an additional 20,000 jobs can be created in the sector by 2016. To this end, the enterprise agencies and other relevant players have been tasked with working to enhance the competitiveness of manufacturing in Ireland by working with companies and implementing the recommendations in the Strategy. Some of this assistance will take the form of mentoring and management development, rather than financial support. That sector lost 50,000 jobs in the years up to 2010 but at the end of 2013, there were a total of 215,900 people directly employed in the sector, which was an increase of 10,000 on the numbers  identified at the time the Strategy was published.  This sector also supports a similar number of jobs indirectly, only some of which would be State supported. <\/p><p>  Foreign-owned firms contribute substantially to Ireland&rsquo;s exports, jobs, expenditure in the Irish economy and to Exchequer funds and IDA Ireland has been very successful in attracting these foreign companies, many of which have manufacturing or service-related activity, or even both, but not all of whom would qualify for financial support.   It has been established that every 10 jobs created in multinational companies lead to approximately 7 jobs being created elsewhere in the economy in supply and service businesses, so the employment generation is very significant. <\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) works in partnership with Irish enterprises to help them start, grow, innovate and win export sales on global markets. That Agency works with about 3,500 client companies and those clients include many in Manufacturing and Internationally Traded Services sectors, but also others in the innovation space, which are not as easy to exclusively categorise.<\/p><p>  The Services sector accounts for two thirds of total employment within Ireland. While the majority of service firms are not supported by the State, in respect of agency supported companies, the job creation trend is very positive.  A range of sectoral initiatives have been devised to facilitate new and established services companies to grow, with particular focus on International Financial Services, Business Process Outsourcing\/Shared Services, Education Services, Retail and Wholesale, Tourism, Construction Services and ICT Services. <\/p><p>  Both the manufacturing and services sectors are therefore important sectors for job growth potential and there will be a continued focus on their development, but inevitably only some of this support will be financial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500050#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":144,"content":"<p>Question No. 60 answered with Question No. 49.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services Provision","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500050#WRC01950"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[23976\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500050#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which there are incentives to encourage entrepreneurship among young persons currently; if the strategy employed is sufficiently effective; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition.  The State pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.   <\/p><p>  I am informed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the specific compulsory retirement age and minimum pension age provisions which affect an individual public servant will reflect his or her particular employment sector and time of original recruitment.     Public servants who must retire at age 65 can draw their public service pension at age 65.  The State pension changes have no impact on such persons where they are in the modified social insurance category.  <\/p><p>  Where alternatively they are in the full social insurance category their public service pensions (and contributions) are, as with many occupational schemes, integrated (or co-ordinated) with social welfare benefits.  This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State pension.  The State pension (contributory) entitlement is calculated with reference to the complete PRSI record, including contributions made while working in the public and private sectors, and it would not be possible for my Department to state how many, if any, such retirees have been impacted by changes to the State pension (contributory).<\/p><p>  In the case of retirements of fully insured public servants at age 65, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the rules of the public service scheme to bridge the gap until State Pension commencement at age 66 years. This supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of his own or her own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate.<\/p><p>  It is therefore necessary to claim the available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension. This situation is not new and already applies to public servants with a retirement age below 65 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500050#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Free Travel Scheme Review","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500050#WRC03150"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[24002\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500050#WRC03200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will report on her Department's review of the free travel scheme; her proposals to alter the current scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"954","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[24040\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500050#WRC03300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"further to the review of free travel, which her Department is currently undertaking, if the intention of the review is to restrict the free travel arrangement currently in place; and when a decision is likely.","asker":"1192","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":166,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 71 together.<\/p><p>  The current free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.

The Scheme is comprised of Officials from the Department of Defence, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Military management and the Representative Associations.<\/p><p>  The unsatisfactory age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force was an issue of serious concern during the 1990&rsquo;s and was the subject of severe criticism by a series of external reports, mainly Price Waterhouse Consultants and the Efficiency Audit Group (EAG). One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995. In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. <\/p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.<\/p><p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:<\/p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service;<\/p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years;<\/p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.<\/p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter. In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500051#WRD02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500051#WRD02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500051#WRD02150"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[24008\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500051#WRD02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment under the disadvantaged area based payment for 2013 will be paid in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; the reason for the delay in issuing this payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>The payment in respect of the 2013 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme issued to the nominated bank account of the person named on 17 April 2014.

Each year farmers in Ireland benefit from funding of over &euro;1.5 billion under Schemes such as the Single Farm Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the Agri-Environment Schemes, etc. This comprises the entire net income of many thousands of Irish farmers.<\/p><p>  The European Commission has an obligation to ensure that Member States manage and use the EU funding granted to them in accordance with the very restrictive provisions governing the Schemes and general financial provisions. Under the Common Agricultural Policy, this is done by way of a Clearance of Accounts procedure. This is a formal process and both the Commission and Member States are obliged to adhere to the requirements laid down in the legislation. In general, the process involves audit missions to the Member State by Commission officials; follow-up correspondence between the two parties on the findings of the mission and the observations and remedial actions undertaken by the Member States. There is also a formal bi-lateral meeting between the two parties followed by further correspondence. At the end of this phase, the Commission issues its letter of findings; as indicated, this letter issued very recently. The Member State has the right to ask for the matter to be reviewed by the Conciliation Body. This body will review the case and seek written and oral observations from each party. It will make its recommendations and the Commission will consider these before arriving at its final definitive decision. <\/p><p>  In the case of Ireland, the Clearance procedure is currently covering five financial years involving the 2008 to 2012 scheme-years. I can confirm that my Department has been informed of a potential flat rate financial correction that the EU Commission may impose on Ireland in respect of the period 2008 to 2012 covering EU direct aid for the period of some &euro;9 billion.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s case and the position of Irish farmers is strenuously argued during the process. I can also reassure the Deputy that every effort is being made to protect the interests of all Irish farmers during the process including the interest of that majority of farmers, who were fully compliant in the declarations they made on an annual basis under the Schemes. During the years 2002 to 2012, the Commission imposed financial corrections amounting to almost &euro;5 billion on Member States. Ireland&rsquo;s share of this total amounted to &euro;25.6 million (or 0.5% of the total amount corrected &ndash; one of the lowest percentages among Member States). Under the EU Regulations, the Commission has to right to impose a flat-rate correction of 2%, 5%, 10% or greater depending of its assessment of the risk to the EU Fund involved &ndash; a 2% correction on the 2008 &ndash; 2012 scheme years would mean, according to the Commission&rsquo;s figures, a loss of &euro;182m in funding to Ireland. On the other hand, the level of the correction can be based on the assessed risk if the Member State can establish the risk and the Commission are satisfied with the calculations.

This is delivered in partnership with the young person, his or her family, foster carers, social workers, key residential social care workers and other statutory, community and voluntary agencies. Approximately 450 children leave care annually.<\/p><p>  Aftercare is the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him\/her in making the transition to independent living. The most important requirements for young people leaving care are for continuity of relationships; secure, suitable accommodation as well as further education, employment or training. <\/p><p>  The core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years. This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged. Many young people remain in their foster care placement after 18 &ndash; the assistance they need may be a continuation of the fostering arrangements and support in accessing educational opportunities. Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in either supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare. The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person. The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports. The draft provisions also clarify the range of agencies providing relevant services with which the Agency will cooperate in the development of the plan.<\/p><p>  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, at its sitting on 1st  April, considered the draft aftercare provisions. I understand that following this meeting a report is being prepared, which will be forwarded to me in due course. I will consider its content prior to refining the text of the provisions in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.<\/p><p>  There is no funding directly available from my Department to not for profit organisations providing services for care leavers. Aftercare is delivered directly by the Child and Family Agency with additional support provided through Service Level Agreements between the Agency and Focus Ireland, Cross Care, Don Bosco and the Simon Community. The Agency has advised that there is no new funding currently available to develop such additional services. However, any organisation interested in providing aftercare services is invited to forward their proposal to the relevant Regional Service Director of the Agency. These will be considered by the Agency in the context of its ongoing review of funding to all service providers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060500053#WRF03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"}]
