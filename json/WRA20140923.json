Not only am I aware of it, but I have made addressing the concerns of these farmers a priority for the Government.  \u00a0   <\/p><p>  The Deputy is correct in noting that beef prices will always be subject to a degree of volatility.  This is the same for most agricultural commodities such as milk prices or cereals reflecting the globalised world in which Irish agri-food produce is traded.  As a country that exports most of what we produce, we are perhaps even more susceptible to the highs and lows of evolving prices than some of our neighbours.   \u00a0   <\/p><p>  This volatility has possibly never been more evident as it has been over the last three years.  Prices in 2012 and 2013 rose steadily to an unprecedented peak of over &euro;4.40 per kilo last year but have since declined.  In looking at these changes, we cannot ignore normal supply and demand factors.  This year we have slaughtered nearly 13% more animals than last year and the number of animals slaughtered is 23% higher than at this stage in 2012.\u00a0 Added to this supply increase, there has been a drop in beef consumption throughout Europe as well as in the returns to farmers notably in the UK also.  The combination of these points will inevitably take its toll on prices here.   <\/p><p>  Putting structures in place to alleviate the impact of these price changes, and assisting farmers to be better prepared for these fluctuations, have been central to this Government&rsquo;s term in office.  The &euro;1.2 billion per year secured in direct payments each year forms a constant and secure income for farmers, and this is a particularly important buffer as prices decline.  In addition, the need to ensure a viable future for the beef sector has been central to the draft &euro;4 billion Rural Development Plan submitted to the EU Commission in July.   <\/p><p>  While this plan is still under discussion with the European Commission, I am proposing in it a number of elements which will be of benefit to beef farmers throughout the country, including the beef data and genomics measure which will be worth around &euro;49 million per year and should bring about long-term improvements to the sector through improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.  Also, the continued support under the new agri-environment scheme GLAS and the &euro;195 million per year support for disadvantaged areas should all benefit farmers in the event of fluctuating prices in the future.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  These investment supports, together with the actions falling out of the Beef Roundtable, will help to put the sector on the appropriate strategic footing for the future.  One such outcome arising from the Beef Roundtable involves better and more timely communication between processors and producers aimed at transmitting early and clearer market signals which bring about more strategically planned sectoral responses.  Another key outcome has been my announcement of a public consultation regarding possible establishment of producer organisations in the beef sector.  This public consultation has now closed and my Department is currently assessing the responses before deciding on next steps.  Producer organisations can play\u00a0a key role in conveying contractual negotiation powers on groups of farmers which can help to address imbalances in the supply chain.   <\/p><p>  While I cannot influence the price paid by factories I can of course help to put in place the structures and schemes which will drive on-farm efficiencies.  I am confident that these structures in place, funded through this year&rsquo;s &euro;40 m investment, as well as the considerable investment through the RDP, will achieve this aim. \u00a0   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300053#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300053#WRA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[35156\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300053#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the Indecon report into the greyhound industry published in July, which confirmed significant animal welfare problems in the industry, including whether hare coursing should now be banned.","asker":"1192","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>The Report produced by Indecon International Economic Consultants on completion of their <i>'Review of Certain Matters Relating to Bord na gCon&rsquo;<\/i>was published in July 2014.

That Committee is charged with the responsibility of identifying problems and proposing appropriate solutions to a variety of greyhound welfare issues over the entire life span of a greyhound.  The Report also noted that Bord na gCon recently appointed a Director of Racing Compliance and Governance.  <br\/><br\/>The Report also makes reference to the Retired Greyhound Trust which focuses on retired and unwanted greyhounds with a view to providing homes for these greyhounds as pets. <br\/><br\/>Bord na gCon employs three Area Stipendiary Stewards and 13 Control Stewards, who together with the Welfare and Racing Operations Manager, have all been appointed Welfare Officers under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.<br\/><br\/>In addition many racetrack employees and officials have an animal welfare element included in their duties.

The ICC has confirmed that it has systems in place to underpin the welfare of animals participating in coursing and that it goes to great lengths to ensure the highest standards of hare and greyhound welfare are adhered to.  These procedures include mandatory inspections of hares and coursing venues in advance of the commencement of an event. <i><\/i><br\/><br\/>The ICC ensures that a veterinary surgeon and an ICC control steward are present at all coursing meetings.

Moreover, Russia had already imposed a blanket ban on exports of pig-meat from the EU earlier in the year arising from an African Swine fever outbreak in Eastern Europe.  There were also existing temporary restrictions in place on certain Irish plants producing dairy products, beef, beef offal and seafood arising from a Russian audit visit earlier this year so that the effect of the Presidential ban was incremental.  <i>As to the actions taken, imediately upon announcement of the Presidential ban, I asked Bord Bia to establish an advice line to make the most up to date information available to Irish companies exporting to Russia and to assist them in progressing market opportunities elsewhere.

Given that fact, it is not possible for me on a unilateral basis to change that rate without the agreement of both the Commission and all other Member States.  At each Agriculture Council over the last year the issue of additional measures to ensure a &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo; to milk quota abolition in 2015 was discussed.  Several Ministers, including myself, called on the Commission to take action to ease the burden of the super levy in the final year of the quota regime but such an agreement was not forthcoming at the time and remains so presently.  As there is no common position at the Council of Agriculture Ministers such an improvement looks unlikely to be achieved.  <\/p><p>  It must be clearly noted that a number of other countries are opposed to any action on this and have sought to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone.  I am obviously resolutely opposed to any talk of supply controls after quota abolition next April on the basis that these quotas have only served to shackle Irish farmers over the last 30 years.  The resultant stalemate means there is insufficient support for any change to the regulations and no agreement has been possible.  The current Italian presidency agreed to consider the issue at their first Council meeting in July and I fully expect that the issue will remain high on the agenda for discussion at future Councils where I will continue to seek to have the matter progressed in a way that is fair to both Irish and EU dairy farmers.   <\/p><p>  In preparation for quota abolition, I have announced a number of significant investments by my Department in the Irish dairy sector particularly at farm level.  These include the Dairy Expansion Scheme and the TAMS funding for the dairy sector.  Furthermore, the draft Rural Development Programme 2014 -2020 provides for significant on-farm capital investments through the TAMS II scheme and will include funding for dairy equipment.  Discussions with the Commission prior to approval will facilitate agreement of the overall RDP with the expectation for commencement of this scheme from next year.  These current and prospective investments complement the excellent work being undertaken by Teagasc and ICBF in preparing dairy fairy farmers to take advantage of the significant opportunity which quota abolition will present.   <\/p><p>  For the information of the House, the estimated total volume of milk supplies up to the end of August 2014, taking into account the relevant butterfat adjustment, leaves Ireland 6.44% over quota at end of that month.\u00a0 This compares to 0.36% under quota this time last year and is down from 6.79% over quota at end of last month.  In preparing their enterprises for the post quota era, I have at all times urged that farmers have regard for the fact that milk quotas would remain in place until April 2015, along with the associated superlevy regime, and I would take this opportunity today to reiterate this call.  I would again urge farmers to use the time period between now and the removal of milk quotas to identify, with their dairy adviser, steps to manage both their milk supply and their dairy herds so that they have an efficient herd as they enter the post quota era.  In this regard, I am organising a major dairy conference on November 19 next to assess our readiness for quota abolition and to take stock of the current challenges and opportunities facing the sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300053#WRA02200","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":24,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300053#WRA02300"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[35176\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300053#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will ensure that there are no further cuts to the disadvantaged area scheme and reverse the cuts imposed to date including the restoration of payments on the first 45 hectares.","asker":"1050","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":26,"content":"<p>The adjustments made to recent DAS Schemes ensured that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in DAS areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows:  <\/p><p>- To ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community;   <\/p><p>- To maintain the countryside;<\/p><p>- To maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection measures.   <\/p><p>  Rather than simply apply an across the board cut to the rates payable or reduce the maximum payable area as a means to achieving these savings, it was decided that real efforts should be made to focus the Scheme on those farmers who are most actively contributing to achieving the aims of the Scheme.

The overall effects, taken in conjunction with the other global market circumstances, are potentially severe.  The Russian market has become, in recent years, an extremely valuable one for the Irish fishing industry, especially for pelagic species such as mackerel, horse mackerel and to a lesser extent herring.

To date, the Commission is continuing to examine the setting up of <b>a taskforce.  However, it has said that the establishment of an emergency fund would present legal difficulties.  I remain hopeful that these difficulties can be overcome. <\/b><br\/><br\/>I am fully aware of the potentially very severe effect of this Russian import ban on our Irish fishing industry and will continue to press for the measures that I have set out, which I believe will help to mitigate the effects of this Russian import ban.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300053#WRA02800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300053#WRA02900"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[35155\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300053#WRA03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if in the course of his discussions with EU colleagues, the unified position has been adopted in the context of any trade discussions between the EU and the US with a view to ensuring a stable Irish and European agri-food sector and with particular reference to the need to ensure security of supply throughout Europe while at the same time meet the requirements of producers and consumers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":32,"content":"<p>I would start by saying that Ireland is very supportive of an EU\/US trade deal.

Capturing of badgers takes place under Section 34 of the 1976 Wildlife Act in areas where serious outbreaks of TB have been identified in cattle herds and where Department veterinarians have found following an epidemiological examination that badgers are the likely source of infections.  The mechanism used to capture the badgers is a restraint which is specifically designed with a &lsquo;stop&rsquo; so as not to tighten beyond a predetermined point and so will not cause death by strangulation. All restraints are monitored daily and any badgers are removed within a maximum of 24 hours of capture. A condition of the licence granted is that restraints are checked before noon the next day. Capturing of badgers is not permitted during the months of February and March in new capture areas.<\/p><p>  Research undertaken at the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis (CVERA) in UCD has shown that damage\/injury to captured badgers is none or minimal while in the stopped restraint and lower than with other capture methodologies. My Department also monitors the animal welfare aspects of badger culling on an ongoing basis and is satisfied that the existing culling arrangements and procedures result in minimal injury to badgers.<\/p><p>  In tandem with the badger removal programme, my Department continues to sponsor research and trials into developing a vaccination programme to control Tuberculosis in badgers, thus improving the overall health status of that species, and break infection link to cattle. The research to date has demonstrated that oral vaccination of badgers in a captive environment with BCG vaccine generates high levels of protective immunity against bovine TB. Current research is aimed at confirming that such a protective effect holds true in the wild population.<\/p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s ultimate objective is to incorporate badger vaccination into the TB eradication programme when data is available to ensure that it can be incorporated in an optimally effective and sustainable manner. A number of field trials are ongoing with this objective in mind, but it is anticipated that it will be a number of years before a viable oral delivery method can be put in place and, therefore, targeted badger removals will continue in the medium term in the interests of ensuring that the progress achieved in recent years in combating TB in cattle is maintained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300054#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Management","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300054#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[35164\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300054#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason there is no provision to provide funding in the proposed new forestry programme for the implementing of management plans for the extremely valuable and vulnerable 0.002% of ancient woodlands sites, most of which are NHAs and SACs; the further reason the new forestry programme fails to focus on these ancient woodland sites regards biodiversity, genetic material security, climate mitigation, measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>Ancient woodland refers to those woods that have had a continuous history of cover since before the period when planting and afforestation became common practice (mid\u20101600s).

These surveys are the two most useful historical sources when identifying ancient woodlands.  All native woodlands in Ireland are of conservation importance due to the small national resource estimated to cover only 1 \u2010 2% of the country.

I have argued that the size of the quota should not exceed European market absorption capacity, which is substantially reduced according to the latest forecasts. I have also proposed that the quota should be designed &ndash; via end use conditions &ndash; to ensure that imports are not all concentrated on high value cuts and I have argued that an in-quota tariff rate should continue to apply to imports within the quota.<\/p><p>  The most recent report of the European Parliament on the trade implications of the EU US trade bears out these Irish concerns in relation to the suckler cow herd in Europe which it finds will be adversely affected by the trade deal. In my meetings with the new Agriculture Commissioner I will continue to outline our concerns and seek mitigating measures in relation to the beef sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300054#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Programme Projects","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300054#WRB02900"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[35175\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300054#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will open applications for the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme at an early date; and if he will ensure that budget 2015 will provide adequate funding for same.","asker":"1050","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>The Rural Development Programme for the 2014-2020 period was submitted to the EU Commission approval for approval in July 2014.

A total of some 14,936 farmers declare commonage land under the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.  Commonage lands form a significant area of the lands declared annually by farmers in Ireland for the purposes of claiming the Single Farm Payment, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes, with approximately 7% of the lands declared are commonage lands. However, there is a growing risk of land abandonment on commonages as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. Farming of commonages is a complex matter, with issues about the legal right to claim, in addition to regular disputes about the grazing of the commonages. <\/p><p>  In the case of the treatment of commonage lands under the 2014 Direct Payment Schemes, the situation remains unchanged. However, from 2015 onwards, a minimum grazing requirement, equivalent to at least one ewe per 1.5 hectares, will be required of all those applicants declaring marginal lands including commonage under the Basic Payment Scheme and the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme. A lower grazing level will be fixed for marginal lands where it is necessary on environmental grounds. These requirements must be met by each individual claimant by end December 2015 at the latest. The minimum grazing requirement must be met in order to qualify for the Basic Payment Scheme and the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme under the new CAP and does not require a grazing plan with at least 50% of farmers using the same commonage.<\/p><p>  With a view to having a system to meet the requirements of the Basic Payment Scheme and Areas of Natural Constraint, which will be implemented in 2015, my Department will be writing to all commonage claimants in the coming weeks setting out their individual grazing requirements for marginal lands. The claimants will have the right, if they consider that the figures provided would not meet the requirements of their commonage, to submit an assessment by a professional planner providing alternative figures.<\/p><p>  Above the minimum stocking level of one ewe per 1.5 hectares, the management of the grazing requirement is a matter for the individual claimants, provided that the commonage is kept in good agricultural and environmental condition and meets all the requirements for both the BPS and ANC schemes. Farmers should bear in mind that they must keep the land adequately grazed in order to ensure that the commonage retains the area eligible for payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300054#WRB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[35163\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300054#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will revise the requirement for 50% of farmers on a commonage to agree a grazing plan in order to participate in GLAS; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":69,"content":"<p>The preservation and restoration of commonages, and the continuation of suitable and environmentally friendly farming practices on the hills, is a core element of GLAS and part of Ireland&rsquo;s overall plan for halting biodiversity loss. In recognition of the importance of commonages, hill farmers will get priority access into GLAS but I think it is accepted by all that the most effective management of these hills is achieved when those who are actively farming it work together. That is why the creation of a Commonage Management Plan, that encourages the shareholders themselves to take control of the grazing of their commonage, is the model we have chosen for GLAS. In addition, in order to qualify for an agri-environment payment, the actions undertaken by farmers must be above the baseline for the Basic Payment Scheme, and it is the actions in the Commonage Management Plan which demonstrate this.  The only requirement for commonage farmers joining GLAS is for 50% of active farmers to sign up to a GLAS commonage plan or sufficient farmers to bring in at least 50% of the land. There is no imposition of minimum or maximum stocking densities, and smaller commonages of less than ten hectares in size will not be subject to any minimum participation requirement. On commonages of that size, farmers can enter GLAS in their own right.<\/p><p>  I do not believe that a minimum participation requirement based on this model is insurmountable and there are ways in which the application process can be structured that might assist. However, where real difficulties are being encountered the farmers concerned can make a case to the Commonage Implementation Committee for entry to the scheme. If it is clear that the farmer or farmers have made every effort to meet the requirement but have failed through no fault of their own, they will not be locked out of GLAS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300054#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Diseases Issues","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300054#WRB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[35167\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300054#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he is taking to address the concerns of farmers that the increase in deer population may be adding to the number of herds with TB; the discussions he has had with other Departments regarding the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1184","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>Responsibility for the protection of wild deer in the State under the Wildlife Acts rests with the Minister for of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands.

In this context, an exercise conducted in 2007-2008 focussed on TB strain-typing in cattle, deer and badgers, found a significantly higher prevalence in badgers than in either cattle or deer.<\/p><p>  In response to current concerns, and following meetings with farmers from Wicklow, my Department is organising a cull of 100 deer in the North Wicklow area for laboratory testing for TB &ndash; the project will also involve Strain typing of the TB for comparison with that found in cattle and badgers in the same area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300054#WRB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300054#WRB04200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Census of Population Statistics","counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300054#WRB04100"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[35826\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300054#WRB04200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if it is the case that the Central Statistics Office does not plan to engage in any public consultation on the development of questions for the next scheduled census in 2016; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that no new questions will be added and it will be virtually identical to Census 2011; his views that this presents a serious obstacle to the accurate measuring of some statistics, such as the question on religion which is largely recognised as vague and misleading and includes other questions which have been rendered redundant, such as questions on water supply and sewerage; if he has had any consultation with the CSO on the forthcoming census; if the CSO will commit to a process of public consultation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":75,"content":"<p>The Census of Population is a very large statistical, administrative and logistical exercise that must be conducted with great care and professionalism.

The response to that consultation showed overwhelming support for a five-yearly census and the enormous value that the data brings, with particular emphasis on the value of small area data that only the census can provide. The Government accordingly decided that a census will be undertaken in 2016. Census day will be 24th April 2016.<\/p><p>  The CSO works hard to ensure that the information collected and provided from the census remains current, relevant and of maximum use to the public. It has been common practice in advance of each census to conduct a public consultation on possible new questions and changes to existing questions, which are then considered by a specially convened Census Advisory Group in advance of testing in the field in the form of a pilot survey of some 12,000 dwellings. Unfortunately given the very tight budget circumstances in 2013 and 2014, with constraints on resources right across the public sector, it was not possible to pursue this route for census 2016.

It would be a powerful committee, constructed on the lines of the Public Accounts Committee, bi-partisan in structure and chaired by a senior member of the opposition.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Committee would receive parliamentary petitions from individuals and groups in the community seeking the redress of grievances connected with the public services of the State and with the public administration generally. Its functions would be to act as a &quot;clearing house&quot;, directing complaints to those bodies most competent to act on them: the Ombudsman, the Data Protection Commissioner, the Local Government Auditor, the Oireachtas committee that has oversight of the relevant Department, and so on.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will refer to the Constitutional Convention, the issue of reducing the Voting Age to 17 and giving citizens the right to vote at Irish embassies in the presidential election.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will ask the Constitutional Convention, which is examining electoral reform, to make recommendations as to how the number of women in politics can be increased.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will introduce a new code of practice for the use of the government jet, ensuring transparent and cost effective travel.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will give committees the power to introduce legislation, while a new 10 Minute Rule will allow backbench TDs to introduce their own Bills.

It will be renamed the topical issue debate. There will be a minimum of 5 topical issues. These will be taken in the middle of the day and there will be provision for questions at the end.

D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will in future meet four days a week. There will be a summer recess of just six weeks and significantly reduced breaks at Christmas and Easter. We will abandon the practice of providing a &ldquo;mid-term break&rdquo; &ndash; a full week off at St Patrick&rsquo;s Day and Hallowe&rsquo;en.

The D&aacute;il plenary will sit only for questions, including Leaders&rsquo; Questions and the order of business and the remainder of the day will be taken up in committee.<\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will establish a petition system to the D&aacute;il, similar to that operating in the European Parliament, to be managed by a specific D&aacute;il committee that will investigate and report on petitions which raise issues warranting attention.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will enhance the parliamentary relationship with the European Parliament in conjunction with Ireland&rsquo;s MEPs. These arrangements will include regular attendance by MEPs at relevant D&aacute;il committees.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The standing orders on urgent issues are used regularly to attempt to raise issues that are not urgent and such requests are almost invariably refused. We will make the D&aacute;il rules for raising urgent issues more meaningful by requiring a minimum number of signatories for such a request. In future, Standing Order 32 requests will not be read out.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Taoiseach will be obliged to brief the Oireachtas prior to attending European Council meetings and to engage with the Oireachtas in debate on EU issues of national significance and concern.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Oireachtas will devote a full week each year to debating major EU issues of concern to Ireland such as the Draft Annual Work Programme, Green and White Papers and proposals for EU budget co-ordination.<\/td><td>Completed &amp;amp; Ongoing<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Oireachtas will be linked up with the Irish offices of the European Commission and the European Parliament in communicating Europe to the Irish people. Outreach programmes, meetings and competitions particularly in schools will be organised and TDs and Senators invited to participate.<\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Under the Lisbon Treaty provisions the Oireachtas is entitled to receive all documents produced by the EU Commission at the same time as the EU institutions and the Irish Government receive them. We will ensure all EU documents are forwarded to the Oireachtas through the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach. They will transmit them to the Oireachtas library and the relevant Committees. Every TD and Senator will be informed of the documents as they arrive, so that they can engage in EU matters that concern or interest them.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We propose that Oireachtas Committees will play the major role in scrutinising the EU in the coming years.  Greater emphasis will be placed on deepening the involvement in EU matters of the Oireachtas committees that shadow the work of each Government Department. We will oblige all sectoral committees to deal with EU matters that come within their remit within a defined period of time.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Committees will be supplemented by a system of subcommittees and a system of rapporteurs who have a particular interest in an area of policy or scrutiny and who volunteer to carry out an in-depth study for the relevant committee.<\/td><td>Completed &amp;amp; Ongoing<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) prepared for Ministers on all EU Directives and significant Regulations will be forwarded automatically to the relevant sectoral Oireachtas Committees.

The initiative aims to improve the employability and maintain the work readiness of those who have been unemployed for 24 months or more. Responsibility for delivery of this initiative rests with individual county and city councils. Sufficient resources are available to provide for 3,000 placements in 2014.<br\/><br\/>The process of identifying work opportunities for Gateway participants and consulting the all the relevant stakeholders, including relevant unions, is a matter for the county and city councils.  A variety of tasks have been identified and are being made available to Gateway participants, including a mixture of new opportunities and opportunities to work in services that have not been provided by county and city councils due to the pressure of scarce resources. The types of projects being considered are varied and include village enhancement schemes, landscaping, tourism ambassadors and working in libraries. <br\/><br\/>Participants are primarily selected by a random process conducted by the Department of Social Protection from those persons in receipt of a jobseekers allowance payment for 24 months or more.  Jobseekers may also access Gateway by applying to their local Council or by contacting the Department and, in this context, the Deputy should note that up to 20% of the total cohort may be selected in this manner.<br\/><br\/>The number of persons participating on Gateway as of 19 September 2014 is set out in the following table. Work is on-going with the Department of the Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government and the County and City Management Association to ensure that the target of 3,000 placements will be filled by the end of 2014.<br\/><br\/>Data collected in respect of 9,433 jobseekers selected to date for Gateway indicates that seven jobseekers were subject to sanctions resulting in the temporary disallowance (up to a maximum of 9 weeks) of their jobseekers&rsquo; payments for failure to engage with the initiative. A further 99 jobseekers claims have been closed following engagement between Departmental officials and jobseekers.  In some of these cases, a different DSP payment was deemed more appropriate to the individual&rsquo;s circumstances.  Overall, the Deputy should note that no jobseeker will be compelled to take up a Gateway position that would result in a decrease in the value of their family income or impose other hardships.  Review processes are ongoing in a number of other cases of jobseekers who have not taken up the offer of engagement on Gateway.<br\/><br\/><b>Table 1: Numbers engaged on Gateway as of 19<\/b><b><sup>th<\/sup><\/b><b>September, 2014<\/b><table><tr><th>County or City Council<\/th><th><div>Placements filled at 19.09.14<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow Co Co<\/td><td><div>14<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan Co Co<\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare Co Co<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City Co<\/td><td><div>17<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork Co Co<\/td><td><div>14<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal Co Co<\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal Co Co <\/td><td><div>81<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown Co Co<\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City Co<\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway City Co<\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway Co Co<\/td><td><div>30<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry Co Co<\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare Co Co<\/td><td><div>11<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny Co Co <\/td><td><div>20<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois Co Co <\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim Co Co <\/td><td><div>25<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick Co Co<\/td><td><div>85<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford Co Co<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth Co Co<\/td><td><div>34<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath Co Co<\/td><td><div>56<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan Co Co<\/td><td><div>23<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo Co Co <\/td><td><div>84<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly Co Co<\/td><td><div>17<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon Co Co <\/td><td><div>22<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo Co Co<\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin Co Co<\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary Co Co<\/td><td><div>35<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford City Co<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford Co Co<\/td><td><div>27<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath Co Co <\/td><td><div>31<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford Co Co<\/td><td><div>25<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow Co Co<\/td><td><div>19<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td><div>781<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300056#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":183,"content":"<p>Question No. 73 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":185,"content":"<p>Question No. 74 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services Card","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300057#WRE00250"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[35258\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300057#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will report on the introduction of the public services card; the steps that her Department has taken to date to ensure that this new facility does not give rise to any data protection or identity theft concerns; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":188,"content":"<p>The Public Services Card (PSC) has been introduced to enable individuals gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible. The PSC is designed to replace other cards within the public sector such as the Free Travel Pass and the Social Services Card (SSC) of this Department and to make it easy for providers of public services to verify the identity of customers. <\/p><p>  Considerable progress has been made in the roll out of the Public Service Card. Approx. 925,000 PSCs have been produced to date. These include c.241,000 Free Travel variants. <\/p><p>  A PSC is currently issued following a registration process which is called a SAFE registration process.  This involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature and the verification of identity data already held by the Department. Both the PSC and SAFE registration are provided for in primary legislation.<\/p><p>  Face-to-Face registration is taking place countrywide in 81 offices of the Department for individual applicants for a Personal Public Service (PPS) Number and people applying for or in receipt of social protection payments or benefits, including Jobseeker payments, Free Travel entitlement, Child Benefit payments, State Pensions, and One Parent Family payments. <\/p><p>  Selected low-risk customers have also been invited to avail of a &lsquo;postal&rsquo; registration process which involves utilisation, with consent, of information already provided to other Government agencies, for example, a photograph supplied in connection with an application for a passport. <\/p><p>  In addition, selected pensioners over 66 who collect their payments at a Post Office are being invited to register by post. This process includes the person providing two passport-standard photographs.<\/p><p>  The Department is committed to protecting the rights and privacy of individuals in accordance with the Data Protection Acts. The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner was consulted and involved in card design discussions. The card design reflects those discussions. The card has multiple protection mechanisms, all of the highest current international standards, to prevent and detect tampering with the physical card and its contents.  As well as some hidden security features, the card contains visual measures such as its overall graphical design, branding, microprinting, use of optical variable ink and a kinegram.  In addition, a PSC and a card reader will communicate with each other by cryptographic means. Only card readers specifically programmed to accept PSCs can undertake this functionality.<\/p><p>  The SAFE registration process and the roll-out of the PSC holds a number of benefits for the customers, the Department and for other Public Service bodies.  These include improvement in existing cards (e.g. Social Services Cards and Free Travel) through better security features, considerably reducing the potential for forgery and fraudulent use, a reduction in the rate of fraud and errors caused by incorrectly identified and authenticated people, and improvement in the efficiency of every service delivered by the State through the removal of the duplication caused by multiple agencies each solving the problem of identity and authentication themselves.<\/p><p>  The introduction of the card, in addition to providing a more efficient service for customers, is also helping to deter and prevent irregularities, including identity theft. The Department has deployed facial image matching software to help detect and deter duplicate SAFE registrations. This has led to the identification of 36 cases (individuals) of facial matches. Some prosecutions are pending as a result and it is estimated that, at a minimum, the level of fraud detected and stopped to date amounts to in excess of &euro;1 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300057#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300057#WRE00450"},{"type":"question","counter":190,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[35264\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300057#WRE00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the progress to date in the determination of an appeal for carer's allowance in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":191,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 25 June 2014.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 73,800 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.<br\/><br\/>Rent supplement is subject to a statutory limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur and these limits are generally reviewed every 18 months.  The most recent review was completed in June 2013 with revised rent limits introduced on 17 June 2013.  Despite pressures on the social protection budget, the last review saw rent limits increase in line with market rents in some areas, including Dublin and Galway, with Dublin limits increasing by a weighted average of 9%.  The different rent limits established reflect the differences in the respective rental markets throughout the country.  All major urban population centres were tested to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access accommodation whilst seeking employment opportunities.<br\/><br\/>A new rent limit review has commenced within the Department and will be finalised to feed into the budgetary process.  This review involves a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of sources including rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the Central Statistics Office rental indices, websites advertising rental properties, relevant Departments and Agencies and non-government organisations such as Threshold, Focus Ireland and the Society of St Vincent de Paul.  The review report will be published on the Department&rsquo;s website when finalised.<br\/><br\/>The current difficulties in the rental market and the difficulties faced by prospective tenants, including those seeking access to rent supplement, is a shortage of supply of suitable properties in areas of high demand.  I would be concerned that raising rent limits is not the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers and students.<br\/><br\/>Where a customer is unable to negotiate rent with their respective landlord to reduce their rent within the prescribed limits the customer may be advised to secure alternative accommodation.  Where this has been advised there is a long-standing administrative arrangement for a period of thirteen weeks to be provided to the customer as an appropriate timeframe.  As I have previously outlined, there were a number of increases in the maximum limits in the previous review in areas such as Dublin and Galway including the introduction of new increased rent limits for North Kildare, reflecting the higher rental values for these particular areas.<br\/><br\/>I can assure the Deputies that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  Discretionary powers are available to staff to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant.  A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy, has recently been circulated.<br\/><br\/>Statistics are not available on the number of persons who are in emergency accommodation having previously been in receipt of rent supplement.  However, in view of the current supply difficulties, the Department has agreed a protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf.  Since the launch of this initiative in mid June 2014, 118 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department.<br\/><br\/>Rent Supplement statistics are maintained at county level and are provided in the following tabular statement.

The revised estimates for the Department provide for expenditure of &euro;3.3bn in 2014 in respect of the jobseekers schemes.<\/p><p>  Reduced rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009. Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to recipients under 26 years of age.<\/p><p>  This is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency. It aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.<\/p><p>  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.<\/p><p>  In this context it may be noted that starting in 2014, processes and programmes will be rolled out to ensure that all of those young unemployed people who need most support (i.e. are assessed as having a low to medium probability of securing employment in the absence of any support) will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months of an initial one-to-one interview.<\/p><p>  As part of the normal budget process, all potential budget measures, including any changes to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme are assessed in terms of the impact they would have if introduced.  The Department has also published a social impact assessment of the main welfare and tax measures in Budget 2014.  The analysis shows that the combined welfare and tax measures for 2014 result in a loss of 0.8 per cent in average household income.  There was no significant change in the at-risk-of-poverty rate, as social transfers continue to perform strongly, substantially reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate during the economic recession.<\/p><p>  With regard to the concerns raised by organisations working with homeless people, the Department is engaging with them to review the approach in relation to rent supplement, particularly with regard to young persons in emergency homeless accommodation.  The Department is also engaging with Simon and Focus Ireland in relation to the development of a specific programme for homeless people on the community employment scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300058#WRF02700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":252,"content":"<p>Question No. 106 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Guarantee","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300058#WRF02850"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[35555\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300058#WRF02900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of young jobseekers who have been offered and completed personal progression plans as part of the youth guarantee.

This number is relatively low as the engagement process does not currently discriminate on the basis of age.  In order for earlier engagement with under 25s to take place, legislation allowing positive discrimination was passed over the course of the summer which allows the full implementation of the youth guarantee and, in particular, the process of earlier engagement with under 25s is now able to proceed.

Revenue has made great progress in tackling the problem of diesel laundering over the past three years and now media reports indicate the emergence of another form of fuel fraud, commonly referred to as petrol-stretching.\u00a0 This involves the illegal addition of kerosene or some other low tax commodity to petrol to defraud the Exchequer and the motorist.<\/p><p>  Petrol stretching is an offence under S102(1A) Finance Act 1999 and carries a penalty on summary conviction of &euro;5,000 or, at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both.  If convicted on indictment the fine is to a maximum of &euro;126,970 and the prison term is to a maximum of five years or both.<\/p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that they are investigating the recent reports concerning petrol stretching and have been in contact with the motor trade in this regard.  I am also advised that they have taken samples from a number of filling stations that it has claimed may have been the source of adulterated fuel.  These enquiries will seek to establish if there is evidence that kerosene has been added to the petrol being sold by the retailers in question and whether there is evidence to support a prosecution.<\/p><p>  Revenue and the oil sector have cooperated very successfully to tackle diesel laundering and I am confident that with this cooperation, and with the supply chain information available to Revenue, the problem of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully.  In this regard it is essential that petrol distributors report on any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific retailers are shifting some of their sourcing to laundered or 'stretched' fuel.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol from, and report any suspicions concerning the source of adulterated petrol that may have damaged their engines to Revenue.  Revenue will investigate such reports and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.  In that regard, Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically on the shadow economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices such as petrol stretching.<\/p><p>  A key part of the mineral oil tax regulatory system to protect the Exchequer and consumers is the licensing system that ensures that dealers in mineral oil, including forecourt operators, keep proper records and only source and supply legitimate fuel. At Revenue's request, I have strengthened the legislative framework to refuse and \/or revoke mineral oil licences. Revenue has been very pro-active in this sector over the last three years and from mid-2011 to the end of August 2014, 132 filling stations were closed, mainly for breaches of licensing conditions.<\/p><p>  I will carefully consider any new proposals by Revenue to ensure that the licensing system is robust and acts to protect consumers, the legitimate trade and Exchequer receipts.<\/p><p>  I would also like to advise the Deputies that the first point of contact for motorists whose vehicles have been affected should be the insurance companies they hold their policies with.\u00a0 Further to that, those affected should also contact the point of purchase and seek redress through them.\u00a0 If they remain unsatisfied they may have recourse to civil remedies and as such could seek legal advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300061#WRJ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Agreements","counter":337,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300061#WRJ01900"},{"type":"question","counter":338,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[35813\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300061#WRJ02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason Ireland abstained on a recent UN vote (details supplied) when other EU countries mainly abstained; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1030","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":339,"content":"<p>I understand from contact with the Deputy's office that the intended question was why Ireland voted no on the recent UN vote.\u00a0 As I stated in response to Question 34804 on 17 September, 2014, Ireland recognises the importance of an appropriate international agreement regarding sovereign debt restructuring due to its significant economic, social and financial implications.<br\/><br\/>In common with other EU Member States, Ireland was unable to support the recent UN resolution on a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring, and this position was based on shared concerns regarding the substance of the resolution and the process followed in proposing it, particularly with respect to the pace at which this complex proposal was launched, the timing of the proposal at the end of a session of the General Assembly, and the pre-determined outcome which it prescribed.<br\/><br\/>Together with many other UN member states, Ireland is actively engaged in ongoing processes that address, and seek to identify solutions to, the issue of sovereign debt restructuring.

Revenue's commitment in this regard is clearly evidenced by the fact that in each of the years specified by the Deputy there were almost 16,000 taxpayers facilitated with phased payment arrangements in preference to deploying debt collection\/enforcement options.<\/p><p>  As I have advised the Deputy in reply to previous questions on this issue, Sheriffs are officers of the Court, holding office under Section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1945 and are not accountable to Revenue for their debt collection activities.  Their activities in this regard are generally covered by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, as amended.  The execution of Revenue certificates (warrants) is specifically provided for in Section 960L of the Taxes Consolidated Act 1997, as amended.  When acting in execution of such tax certificates, Sheriffs are governed by the general law, which applies to the collection of civil debts of all kinds, and not by the provisions of the Tax Acts and are answerable before the courts for any breach of the civil debt collection law.<\/p><p>  For this reason, data is not collated by Revenue in a manner that would facilitate the provision of a response to the Deputy's questions relating to the seizure, storage and sale of goods, including tools of the trade and computers, by Sheriffs in the years 2011, 2012 and 2013. Revenue could confirm to me however that Sheriffs only undertake seizures in a very small minority of cases and only after the defaulting taxpayer has not engaged with requests for payment. The money secured by the Sheriffs through such activities is paid over to Revenue in settlement or part settlement of the outstanding debt minus the operational fees and expenses incurred. <\/p><p>  As I have also previously informed the Deputy, I understand that the Sheriffs operate a Code of Practice, available from any Sheriff or on Revenue's website, which sets out how Sheriffs will engage with taxpayers in relation to their tax collection enforcement activities. For example, it includes commitments that when goods are seized, a written inventory is given to the taxpayer as soon as possible, and there is a commitment to furnish the taxpayer with an account of the proceeds of the sale of any goods seized. The Code also sets out the process whereby a taxpayer may make a complaint and how it will be handled.<\/p><p>  In regard to Question 35873\/14 relating to data protection, this issue is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to answer.  However, I am informed that Sheriffs are subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Acts and I believe that the Minister has already responded to the Deputy on this issue.<\/p><p>  In regard to Question 35877\/14, since January 2009, there have been 125 legal cases in total (not relating to Sheriff action) initiated against Revenue, consisting of 76 general court actions and 49 judicial reviews.  Of these, Revenue reached settlement in ten cases with three cases subject to confidentiality clauses.  Cases are only settled following legal advice from the Revenue Solicitor's Division and Counsel.  Confidentiality clauses are standard practice in the settlement of cases and are subject to negotiation between both parties' legal representatives.<\/p><p>  Revenue has also received personal injury and property damage claims that are handled by the State Claims Agency as delegated to it under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.  Statistics for these claims since January 2009 is not currently available to Revenue and will be forwarded as soon as received from the State Claims Agency.<\/p><p>  Because Sheriffs are not directly accountable to Revenue, the Commissioners do not have data in relation to the number of cases of legal action taken against them (the Sheriffs) in the past five years.<\/p><p>  Revenue does however liaise with the individual Sheriffs through a dedicated unit that ensures the timeliness and accuracy of referrals and payments between both parties and also deals with various issues that arise in individual cases.  Given the number of Questions that the Deputy has raised on this issue to date, it may be that she has a particular case in mind.  That being the situation, Revenue has confirmed to me that it will investigate the circumstances of the case with the relevant Sheriff if the Deputy provides the case details.<\/p><p>  Finally, I am satisfied that Revenue operates a very balanced approach in the deployment of its enforcement powers including referrals to the Sheriffs.  I specifically want to commend the Commissioners for taking a proactive approach where possible in assisting viable businesses and taxpayers to meet their tax obligations through agreed arrangements in preference to debt collection\/enforcement proceedings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300061#WRJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":347,"content":"<p>Question No. 154 answered with Question No. 149.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Pricing","counter":348,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300061#WRJ03000"},{"type":"question","counter":349,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[35225\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300061#WRJ03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in view of the high percentage excise increase of wine in the past two budgets, if he will refrain from any excise increase in this budget.","asker":"1065","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":350,"content":"<p>It is not my practice to comment on what measures may or may not be introduced in advance of the Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300061#WRJ03200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Application","counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300061#WRJ03300"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[35229\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300061#WRJ03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding a rent relief form in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":353,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have received a Form Rent 1 from the person concerned.

For instance, the VAT Directive provides that Member States must apply a standard VAT rate   which in Ireland is 23%.\u00a0 The Directive also allows Member States to apply up to two reduced VAT rates to goods and services as listed in Annex III of the Directive.  The application of the 9% VAT rate to tourism activity is possible because of this provision.  In addition, the VAT Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under set conditions.\u00a0 Article 110 allows for the continuation of the application of a zero rate or a rate less than 5% to goods or services where that rate applied on and from 1 January 1991.\u00a0 Ireland takes advantage of this provision in our application of the zero rate to most food, books, medicine and children's clothing, as well as our application of the 4.8% VAT rate on livestock. \u00a0Furthermore, Article 118 of the Directive allows Member States to retain the application of a reduced VAT rate of 12% or more on goods and services not contained in Annex III, that had applied at a reduced VAT rate on and from 1 January 1991.  The application of the 13.5% VAT rate in Ireland to domestic fuels, commercial construction and some labour intensive services is based on this provision. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, making changes to existing VAT rate treatment is also conditional on the terms of the EU VAT Directive, especially considering much of Ireland's VAT rating is historic and subject to specific rules.\u00a0 It is possible to apply the standard VAT rate to all goods and services.\u00a0 Taking any particular good or service currently applying at the 23% standard VAT rate, it is only possible to apply a reduced VAT rate of 9% or 13.5% to it if it is listed in Annex III of the VAT Directive; it is not possible to apply a zero rate to it as this only applies to goods and services applying at the zero rate since 1991.\u00a0 It is not possible to apply a different reduced VAT rate to it as it is only allowable to apply two reduced VAT rates. <\/p><p>  It is possible to apply a reduced or standard VAT rate to the goods currently applying at the zero rate, however, the conditions of Article 110 provide that it would not be possible to revert those goods back to the zero rate as the zero rating must be continued from 1991.\u00a0 Similarly, it is possible to apply a standard VAT rate to the goods and services currently applying at the 13.5% rate under Article 118, but it would not be possible thereafter to revert them to a reduced VAT rate.  In addition, as stated earlier, it is not possible to apply a rate of less than 12% to goods and services under Article 118, which means that it would not be possible to apply our 9% VAT rate to the goods currently applying at the 13.5% rate under this Article.<\/p><p>  Outside of the conditions laid out in the EU VAT Directive, Ireland is free to set the level at which the various VAT rates apply, and free to apply a reduced or standard VAT rate to the goods and services contained in Annex III of the Directive.

Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grant, scholarship, employer contribution or other means are deducted in arriving at the net qualifying fees.

These returns include a Form 11S, a short income tax return.  It is acknowledged by taxpayers and agents that details required on this form are not overly burdensome and a much smaller number of fields have to be completed than for the full Form 11.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>The main criteria used by Revenue to issue the Form 11S to taxpayers are:<br\/><br\/>- the taxpayer is not a mandatory electronic filer on Revenue's records and is therefore not obliged to file and pay using Revenue's On-Line Service (ROS);<br\/><br\/>- the previous year's gross turnover returned by the taxpayer is less than &euro;75,000;<br\/><br\/>- the taxpayer has only declared 1 or 2 trades in the previous year;<br\/><br\/>- the total of all other income in the previous year is less than &euro;50,000.<br\/><br\/>Any taxpayer who meets the above criteria is issued with a Form 11S, while those who do not meet the criteria will receive the longer version of the paper return Form 11 or will file electronically, via ROS, Revenue's On-Line Service.<br\/><br\/>There are significant advantages for a taxpayer in filing their tax return using ROS.  These include:<br\/><br\/>- relevant information that is available to Revenue is pre-populated on the return;<br\/><br\/>- the taxpayer has only to input data to the income panels and accounts details relevant to their business and can ignore other non-relevant parts of the return;<br\/><br\/>- any liabilities in respect of Income Tax, PRSI &amp;amp; USC are automatically calculated within the system;<br\/><br\/>- an extended return filing date is available.<br\/><br\/>I am advised by the Commissioners that 87% of all farmers who filed their Form 11 in 2012 did so through the online system, sending a very clear signal that they find the online version very user friendly.  This mirrors the experience of other taxpayers who also use the ROS system extensively to file their returns.  A further 5% of farmers were provided with a simplified return Form 11S for 2012.<br\/><br\/>I am further advised that the Commissioners have recently been in correspondence with farmers' representatives on the subject of simplified tax returns and they have offered to have further discussions with those representatives, if required.<br\/><br\/>In addition, I am informed that Revenue will have their usual strong representation at this week's National Ploughing Championship where a team of ROS Liaison Officers will be available to provide information about online filing as well as tax return filing in general.<br\/><br\/>It appears to me that the Revenue Commissioners have put in place options for those taxpayers, including farmers, whose tax affairs are not overly complex to make it easier for them to file their returns.  In particular, the ROS return has significant advantages for all taxpayers and this is widely acknowledged.

In summary, it was found that State funding for basic research lies in the range of 37% - 49% and applied research in the range 51% - 63%. State funding for basic research within the Higher Education Institutions lies in the range 50% - 68% and for applied research in the range 32% - 50%. The majority of State funded research takes place in Ireland within the Higher Education Institutions. The OECD country mean for State funding of basic research in HEIs was found to lie in the range reported here, at 55 %.<br\/><br\/>Since then a number of developments are occurring within the public research policy system, including the extension of the legal remit of Science Foundation Ireland to fund applied research; the development and implementation of our National Research Prioritisation Exercise; the work by the Advisory Council for Science Technology and Innovation on the overall state funded research centre landscape; and the current work within my Department on the market focussed element of the research centre landscape.  <br\/><br\/>Science Foundation Ireland has been successfully supporting research teams carrying out oriented basic research in Higher Education Institutions, but this research is typically at an earlier stage than applied research which would involve companies carrying out research necessary to bring products or services to market. The extension of Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s legal remit will provide better support to enable ideas generated by Irish research groups to be further developed and commercialised.<br\/><br\/>The recognition that a country of Ireland&rsquo;s size can only excel in a limited number of fields of research was also recognised and the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group, formally adopted by Government in 2012, aims to accelerate the delivery of economic outcomes from Government investment in public research organisations by aligning future public investment by research funders to 14 opportunity areas.  <br\/><br\/>The report from the Advisory Council on Science, Technology and Innovation (see ) identified an absence of research centres at the applied end of the research spectrum, and recommended that a Research Technology Organisation (RTO) type model should be introduced in Ireland and outlined the rationale and options for its establishment.  (The European Association of RTOs defines RTOs broadly as organisations &ldquo;which as their predominant activity provide R&amp;amp;D, technology and innovation services to enterprises, Governments and other clients&rdquo;). This approach was endorsed by the OECD in their 2013 Economic Review of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Building on this, my Department is currently undertaking a study aimed at strengthening the market-focussed element of the research centre landscape as committed in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.  <br\/><br\/>The first phase of this study is establishing the extent to which the expansion of SFI&rsquo;s remit, the new Research Centre and Spokes Programmes with increased industry contribution requirements and the evolving EI\/IDA Technology Centre Programme are increasing applied research activity and determining the profile of the research expenditure across the technology readiness level, TRL, scale. Based on this analysis, recommendations will be made on approaches to strengthen the market-focussed research centre landscape to ensure an appropriate research profile between basic research and applied research in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300064#WRM02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1078"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Appointments","counter":497,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300064#WRM03000"},{"type":"question","counter":498,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[35803\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300064#WRM03100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"in view of the fact that there are over 275,000 persons employed by the Irish retail industry, making it Ireland's largest private sector employer; his views on the appointment of a junior Minister with specific responsibility for the retail industry.

The proposed Beef Data and Genomics Programme is intended to deliver an accelerated improvement in the quality and environmental sustainability of the beef herd through the application of genomics technology. This will help farmers to maximise productivity in a sustainable way, while supporting improved quality and traceability in the national suckler herd, as set out under the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.<\/p><p>  The programme will provide support to farmers to take samples for genotyping from selected animals in their herds and to provide vital breeding data to support the development of a national cattle breeding databank. The data will provide farmers with the tools to select higher quality and more efficient breeding replacements through the use of cutting edge genomic technology. The data will allow the farmer to target animals based on ease of calving, high weight gain thereafter, and animals that can be finished earlier. The scheme will have a substantial environmental dividend while improving productivity, reducing input costs and improving margins for farmers.<\/p><p>  In addition, data gained from the implementation of genomic selection in Irish dairy cattle since 2009 shows that genomic selection could increase genetic gain by up to 50%; this is dependent on good accuracy of selection for which the main requirement is individual animal performance data on a very large number of animals of known parentage.<\/p><p>  Payments will, subject to the approval of the programme by the EU Commission, be paid to farmers for work carried out, including the development of a herd breeding plan, training and transaction costs.

Officials in my Department are currently in discussions with the EU Commission on the final details of the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300065#WRN01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme Expenditure","counter":532,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300065#WRN01150"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[35933\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300065#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide funding of &euro;30 million for a significant invest programme TAMs to improve on-farm efficiency across all sectors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The legislation requires that all bovines must be tagged within 20 days of birth with a specific individual tag that identifies the holding, with the birth recorded on the herd register of the keeper and details of date of birth, breed, sex and dam registered on the Department&rsquo;s Animal Identification and Movement (AIM) database within 7 days of tagging.

As I have stated before, I do no t believe a Beef Regulator is appropriate.  As the Deputy will appreciate, questions of price are ultimately matters to be determined between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle.  It is neither appropriate nor possible for me or any other Minister for Agriculture in the EU, to intervene directly on these issues. Cattle prices are determined by supply \/ demand dynamics which are in turn influenced by the seasonality of production, the length of the production lifecycle and market conditions such as retail promotions, consumer confidence, competition with other meats and the overall macroeconomic situation.  However, the state, through the Competition Authority already has a well established infrastructure for dealing with allegations of anti competitive practices and I do not consider it appropriate to replicate that structure by establishing a beef regulator.  I should also point out that there is an array of information available on the prices paid in Ireland and elsewhere. My Department collates the prices paid for domestic cattle on a weekly basis and reports this data to the European Commission in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1249\/2008 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 148\/2014. To ensure price transparency, results for Members States are published on the DG Agriculture &amp;amp; Rural Development website. The published weekly data includes market prices for carcases and live animals as well as information on production and herd inventories. This publicly accessible information allows stakeholders to monitor the evolution of the market situation in each Member State.   <\/p><p>There is also a wealth of information available to farmers under the Beef Pricewatch section on my Department&rsquo;s website, including the prices for Steers, Cows, and Heifers across the classification grid, for each DAFM approved factory.  I have also committed to making this existing information even more user-friendly and my Department is currently working on developing a Beef pricewatch app which will be released shortly. <\/p><p>  As regards the specifications applied at factory level, these are a matter for agreement between producers and processors. What is important, from my perspective, is that these specifications sufficiently remunerate farmers for producing quality animals, provide appropriate production incentives that are reflective of market demands, and are communicated to producers in a clear and timely manner. I will, of course, continue to engage with both farmers and processors to ensure that these specifications are applied in a fair and transparent manner. As the Deputy is aware, I established a Beef Roundtable earlier this year to facilitate such discussions between the parties.  One of the key outcomes arising from this Roundtable involves better and more timely communication between processors and producers aimed at transmitting early and clearer market signals which bring about more strategically planned sectoral responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300066#WRO01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Equine Data","counter":603,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300066#WRO01950"},{"type":"question","counter":604,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[35533\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300066#WRO02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he will take in relation to the seizure of 63 horses from Ballyguile Hill on 4 December 2013 by Wicklow County Council.

I am obviously resolutely opposed to any talk of supply controls after quota abolition next April on the basis that these quotas have only served to shackle Irish farmers over the last 30 years.  The resultant stalemate means there is insufficient support for any change to the regulations and no agreement has been possible.  The current Italian Presidency of the EU agreed to consider the issue at their first Council meeting in July and I fully expect that the issue will remain high on the agenda for discussion at future Councils where I will continue to seek to have the matter progressed in a way that is fair to both Irish and EU dairy farmers.   <\/p><p>  The estimated total volume of milk supplies up to the end of August 2014, taking into account the relevant butterfat adjustment, leaves Ireland 6.44% over quota at end of that month.\u00a0 This compares to 0.36% under quota this time last year and is down from 6.79% over quota at end of last month. In preparing their enterprises for the post quota era, I have at all times urged that farmers have regard for the fact that milk quotas would remain in place until April 2015, along with the associated superlevy regime, and I would take this opportunity today to reiterate this call. I would again urge farmers to use the time period between now and the removal of milk quotas to identify, with their dairy adviser, steps to manage both their milk supply and their dairy herds so that they have an efficient herd as they enter the post quota era.  In this regard, I am organising a major dairy conference on November 19 next to assess our readiness for quota abolition and to take stock of the current challenges and opportunities facing the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300066#WRO03100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Appeals","counter":621,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300066#WRO03150"},{"type":"question","counter":622,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[35747\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300066#WRO03200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position in relation to a single payment appeal case for a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; the reason for the excessive delay in processing this appeal case; if he is aware of the hardship being caused to the person;and if he will take steps to expedite this appeal.

The deputy is correct in noting that the sector will always be subject to a degree of volatility. This is the same for milk prices, and indeed for cereals.  As a country that exports most of what we produce, we are perhaps even more susceptible to the highs and lows of evolving prices than some of our neighbours.   <\/p><p>  This volatility has possibly never been more evident as it has been over the last three years. Prices in 2012 and 2013 rose steadily to an unprecedented peak of over &euro;4.40 per kilo, but have since declined. In looking at these changes, we cannot ignore normal supply and demand factors.  This year we have slaughtered nearly 13% more animals than last year and the number of animals slaughtered is 23% higher than at this stage in 2012. Added to this supply increase, there has been a drop in Beef consumption throughout Europe.  The combination of these points is clearly taking its toll. <\/p><p>  Putting structures in place to alleviate the impact of these price changes, and assisting farmers to be better prepared for these fluctuations, have been central to this Government&rsquo;s term in office.

My Department engages on a daily basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies&rsquo; personnel on market access issues.  These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing agreement to import from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran which allow the import of Irish beef; with Singapore, South Africa, UAE, Canada and the Russian Federation-Customs Union for the import of Irish sheepmeat and with Australia and Serbia for the import of Irish pork.  To date in 2014, the Lebanon has agreed to re-open its market to Irish beef, sheepmeat and cooked meats.  A certificate has also been agreed with Hong Kong allowing for the export of Irish sheepmeat and agreement has been reached with Namibia on a certificate for the export of beef, sheepmeat and goatmeat.  In recent weeks we have also gained access to Vietnam for pigmeat and to the Philippines for beef, sheepmeat and pork.   <\/p><p>  In November 2013, the US lifted its ban on the importation of beef from the European Union.  This was one of my priorities the previous year when I visited the US, where I pushed the matter strongly with the US Department of Agriculture Secretary of State, Tom Vilsack and in meetings with Senators.  My Department is working with the meat industry to advance the various technical requirements to ensure commencement of the trade at the earliest possible date.   <\/p><p>  In December 2013, a delegation from my Department visited China for discussions with authorities there on the lifting of the beef BSE ban which prohibits imports from any EU country.

Bull beef is not a traditional system in Ireland; our grass fed steer and heifer production systems suit our climate and land availability. Producing quality young bull beef that meets specification requirements for meat factories requires intensive periods of meal feeding and finishing within a short timeframe, thus adding input costs to the producer.  Feedback received by Bord Bia from customers in various Continental markets consistently indicates that they highly value prime steer beef coming from grass-based production systems. Young bull beef is seen as more of a commodity and tends to sell for a lower price. There will continue to be niches, in markets like Italy, where there is demand for a certain amount of young bull beef. However, Irish beef producers should be mindful that this is a specialised market for a restricted carcase specification and that it has become more price competitive in recent years.   <\/p><p>  It is likely that more farmers will revert to traditional steer beef finishing because Irish steers are a unique selling point for our beef industry that enables us to achieve premium prices for that product. In the domestic cattle market, the relationship between processors and producers is a highly interdependent one. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of both sides working together to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market so that the supply chain does not undermine the viability of beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers. I note that Michael Dowling, in his recent report to the Beef Roundtable, suggested a greater role for contracts in the production of young bulls; this requires further exploration on both sides. It is essential that any farmer considering a move to produce bull beef has a clear signal and understanding from his processor that a market exists for this product.   <\/p><p>  Current market conditions clearly highlight the need for industry operators to improve communication on market trends and signals throughout the supply chain. As the Deputy is aware, I established a Beef Roundtable earlier this year to facilitate such discussions. One such outcome arising from this Roundtable involves better and more timely communication between processors and producers aimed at transmitting early and clearer market signals which bring about more strategically planned sectoral responses.

Indigenous production of cereals is of course, an important part of primary agriculture production. In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereals sector is a key source of grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector. Annual cereals production in Ireland has fluctuated around 2 million tonnes in recent years and it is desirable to try and sustain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported cereals.  The 2014 harvest is estimated in the region of 2.5 million tonnes, well above the long-term average production of 2 million tonnes. <b>Since Ireland is a deficit market for cereals, prices here are greatly affected by world prices and supplies<\/b>. This is very much in evidence at the moment as a buoyant European and World cereals harvest continues to exert a downward pressure on prices of native grain. Volatility in prices is likely to become a constant feature of Irish cereal prices in future and grain producers should factor such fluctuations into their planning and marketing strategies. <br\/><br\/>My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency of, quality and viability of cereal production. These services include seed certification, seed testing and recommended list of varieties, research funding through the &lsquo;Stimulus&rsquo; programme and funding for the quality assurance scheme. In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers. The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereals producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world. <br\/><br\/>Food Harvest 2020 outlined a number of challenges facing the cereal sector in the coming years including price volatility, climatic and disease issues, high input prices, small and fragmented holdings and the cost of rented land. However, the report also pointed to positive projections for cereal prices as markets are relatively well-balanced and world cereal prices are projected to be higher than in the last decade. It is known that global grain production is struggling to meet the increasing demand for food, feed and industrial uses. In addition to a rising global population creating a bigger demand for cereals, an increasing demand for meat is disproportionately increasing grain demand even further. It is predicted that global demand for cereals will reach 3 billion tonnes by 2025 compared with 2.3 billion tonnes currently. <br\/><br\/>The primary growth in requirement for Irish cereals in the years ahead is likely to be for animal feed, given the targets for increased livestock output proposed in Food Harvest 2020. However, considerable potential also exists in grains for the drink industry such as malting barley and recent significant investments by the large brewing and distilling companies here in Ireland are proof of such potential. Further, it is envisaged that there will be increased demand for Irish oats milled for human food for the home and export markets and in this context, the success of the Agribusiness sector in securing, long-term contracts with US-based Foods companies to supply milled Irish oats to a premium Irish oatmeal brand in the US market, is particularly welcome. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300067#WRP01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Labelling","counter":642,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300067#WRP01200"},{"type":"question","counter":643,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[35769\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300067#WRP01300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which labelling and traceability continues to be effective and accurate in every respect; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":644,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[35778\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300067#WRP01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which traceability and labelling continues to be effective in respect of all food imports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":645,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 258 and 267 together.<\/p><p>  Food production and labelling in EU Member States operate in accordance with harmonised rules and controls.

Dairy exports in 2013 were valued at &euro;3 .1 bn and the dairy sector is by a number of measures the country&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry. Due to its reputation and significant global footprint, the dairy sector in Ireland retains significant future growth potential. The removal of quotas will be a key driver in this respect. Ireland strongly supported the decision to abolish milk quotas with effect from 1st April 2015 on the basis that quotas were widely regarded by both the Irish dairy sector and market analysts as a brake on the potential of the sector to respond positively to market opportunities.   The abolition of quotas will facilitate an expansion in the sector and through the Food Harvest 2020 Report the industry has set itself an ambitious target for a 50% increase in milk production by 2020. <\/p><p>  The projected increase in milk production under Food Harvest 2020 from 4.9bn litres in 2007\/2009 to 7.4bn litres in 2020 will come from the two obvious sources, namely increased cow numbers and also increased yield production per cow. Increased milk yield per cow, in turn, will come from two main sources, namely improved breeding (EBI) and greater on-farm efficiency. It should be noted that 0.5bn of the required 2.5bn litre increase has already been achieved.   <\/p><p>  A comparison with New Zealand highlights the expansion potential. Dairy production in Ireland rose at a rate of 5.6% per annum in the years from 1975 to 1984, to a total of 5.2bn litres. Today, Ireland&rsquo;s dairy production, at approximately 5.4bn litres in 2013, is roughly the same as that in 1984. In that same period, production in New Zealand, with a grass-based system similar to Ireland&rsquo;s, has increased from 7.6bn litres to about 19bn litres. This illustrates the latent potential inherent to the sector and the massive opportunity that now presents itself. Based on i ndustry, farmer and stakeholder responses to date, I fully expect that this potential will be wholeheartedly embraced.   <\/p><p>  I am also acutely aware of the need to develop as many market outlets as possible for Irish Dairy Products. Notwithstanding this successful trade performance, I am working with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa, the Gulf States and elsewhere.   China is an obvious destination for certain dairy products and in particular f or dairy based infant formula, M y Department is working very closely with the industry to build on our presence there . I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future. Most market analysts predict that medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good, with growth in world population and wealth expected to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products. My aim is to help position the Irish dairy sector to be able to take advantage of this opportunity.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300067#WRP01800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry Development","counter":649,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300067#WRP01850"},{"type":"question","counter":650,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[35771\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300067#WRP02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total number of persons directly involved in the fishing industry including catching, processing and transport; the extent to which opportunities continue to be examined for expansion in the area resulting in increased production and employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":651,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[35773\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300067#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which employment at all levels in the fishing industry has fluctuated in the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":652,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[35774\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300067#WRP02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he expects the fishing industry to expand in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":653,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 260, 262 and 263 together. <\/p><p>  The seafood sector provides employment for approximately 11,000 people around the coast of Ireland. Employment levels have been broadly stable in most sub-segments, with the processing sector increasing at a rate of on average 100 per year, supported by in excess of &euro;7 million of grant aid since 2010, co-funded by the Exchequer and European Fisheries Fund. <\/p><p>Food Harvest 2020 has recognised the potential of the seafood sector to grow sales to &euro;1 billion by 2020 and to increase employment by 3,000 to 14,000.

Over the two years 2012\/2013 seafood sales rose by another &euro;85 million to reach &euro;845 million, a very impressive increase from the Food Harvest baseline of &euro;700 million, indicating that the sector is well on its way to achieving the Government&rsquo;s growth targets.   <\/p><p>  My Department is presently working on development of a new operational programme for the seafood sector for the period 2014-2020 under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.

That analysis has identified many opportunities for the seafood sector to grow in the years ahead, together with the challenges that must be overcome.   The new Operational Programme will seek to address those challenges and to build on the opportunities to maximise the contribution of the seafood sector to the economy and to further increase employment in coastal communities. A draft of the Programme will be published for consultation before the end of 2014 and the Programme should begin to be implemented from 2015.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300067#WRP02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[35772\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300067#WRP02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which families dependent on the fishing industry may rely on a sustainable income in the future notwithstanding any restrictions arising from EU or national conservation measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":656,"content":"<p>The new CFP which was finalised last year under the Irish presidency will result in real meaningful reform to how EU waters are fished in the future.

The outcome has a crucial bearing on the development of the Irish agri-food sector in accordance with the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. It also makes an important contribution to the achievement of the objectives in the Europe 2020 strategy, which aims to deliver smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The changes are consistent with the smart, green, growth objectives of Food Harvest and provide farmers and the agri-food sector with stability and policy certainty to 2020.    There were three key aspects to the reforms. First a greater emphasis has been placed on sustainability through the &ldquo;greening&rdquo; of direct payments and the requirement to support agri-environment measures in rural development programmes. Second, new and enhanced support is being introduced for young farmers under both pillars on the CAP. Third, the reformed CAP continues the movement towards greater market orientation, through the phasing out of production quotas for key products, the provision of safety-net supports in the case of severe market disturbance and the introduction of flexible measures that can be mobilised promptly and effectively to deal with crises. <\/p><p>  Already the additional flexibility to manage crises has allowed the EU Commission to introduce additional market support measures to address the effects of the Russian import ban on EU agri-food products. The changes made to the direct payments system, including the provisions on greening, will not come into force until next year but I am convinced that the reforms will help the agri-food sector in Ireland to achieve its full potential. In short, I believe that the reforms agreed last year will underpin sustainable intensification of production in the years ahead, will support environmental stewardship and contribute to the maintenance of a vibrant rural economy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300067#WRP03000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Fisheries Policy Review","counter":661,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300067#WRP03100"},{"type":"question","counter":662,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[35776\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300067#WRP03200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the degree to which the Common Fisheries Policy review has positively affected the fishing industry here and throughout Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":663,"content":"<p>From the outset of the Common Fisheries Policy revision process, Ireland&rsquo;s overarching goal was to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to safeguard fish stocks for future generations. I strongly believe that the new CFP will achieve that goal both here at home and throughout Europe.  The new CFP will bring real meaningful reform to how EU waters are fished in the future. The agreement is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters, utilising best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas in the future. A key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield). This should lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns. The Commission proposals for TACs and quotas for 2015, expected to be published in late October \/ early November, will take account of delivering MSY for 2015 where possible and on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks.   <\/p><p>  The new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks around our shores, the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processing while supporting the communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.

Ireland works with fellow Member States involving UK, France, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands on developing appropriate measures for fisheries in the North Western Waters. This group works closely with the North Western Waters Advisory Council and the Pelagic Advisory Council. A discards plan for pelagic stocks in North Western Waters is being finalised as the landing obligation applies to these stocks from 1 January 2015.

Local State Solicitors are retained by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for criminal prosecution work on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office is a constituent element of the Office of the Attorney General and is the principal provider of solicitor services to the Attorney General and to all Government Departments and Offices. It also provides solicitor services to certain other State Agencies and acts for the State before Tribunals and Commissions of Inquiry.  The Office does not act for members of the public. While not an office under my remit as Minister, it is my understanding that, under the Customer Charter of the Chief State Solicitor's Office 2011-2014, if someone has a complaint about the standard of service provided by the Office and is unable to resolve the matter with the officer concerned or his\/her immediate superior, that person may refer the complaint to the Human Resources Manager, Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office at Osmond House, Little Ship Street, Dublin 8. In the event that the complaint cannot be resolved by the Human Resources Manager, then he\/she will arrange for<i><\/i>a review of the complaint to be carried out by a member of the Office's Management Advisory Committee nominated by the Chief State Solicitor. Under the Charter, all complaints and reviews of them will be dealt with promptly, objectively and in a consistent open and fair manner. Again, while not under my remit as Minister, it is also my understanding that, if the matter giving rise to a complaint about a State Solicitor relates to a criminal prosecution, then such a complaint should be directed to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Infirmary Road, Dublin 7, e-mail address, dpp@dppireland.ie.<br\/><br\/>More generally, under the Solicitors Acts 1954-2011 and their attendant regulations, the Law Society of Ireland, the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and the Office of the Independent Adjudicator are the independent statutory bodies charged with investigating or resolving complaints against solicitors, including as may be, State Solicitors. Under the statutory complaints framework the Law Society is, therefore, the main route of redress for aggrieved clients of solicitors, outside of taking an action through the courts. The Society&rsquo;s Complaints and Client Relations Committee, which includes lay members, determines complaints in relation to misconduct, inadequate services or excessive fees made directly to it by members of the public. The Society provides guidance on &ldquo;making a complaint&rdquo; on its website, www.lawsociety.ie.<br\/><br\/>The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal deals with complaints of serious misconduct and such complaints are either referred to it by the Law Society or made directly to the Tribunal by members of the public. The Tribunal members are appointed by the President of the High Court and act independently of the Law Society. In more serious cases, where the Tribunal considers that a solicitor should be suspended or struck off it will make such a recommendation to the President of the High Court. Further details are available on the Tribunal&rsquo;s website www.distrib.ie.<br\/><br\/>Members of the public who are dissatisfied with the way the Law Society has dealt with a complaint may also refer it to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (www.independentadjudicator.ie). The Office of the Independent Adjudicator was established to provide an independent point of contact to which members of the public could have recourse if dissatisfied with the manner in which the Law Society had dealt with a complaint. It is important to note that the Adjudicator&rsquo;s role is to investigate the handling of the complaint by the Law Society and not to investigate the substance of the original complaint.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy will be aware that the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which is due to return to Report Stage in the D&aacute;il in the coming weeks, will establish a new, independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority with responsibility for the oversight of both solicitors and barristers. There will be a new complaints system to deal with complaints about professional misconduct and inadequate professional services independent of both the Law Society and the Bar Council backed up by a Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal. Members of the public who wish to make complaints will no longer do so through the Law Society or the Bar Council as they do at present, but through the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300069#WRR02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":760,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300069#WRR02050"},{"type":"question","counter":761,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[35453\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300069#WRR02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide in tabular form the partial year and the full year monetary effect of her Department's budget 2014 reductions to expenditure; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":762,"content":"<p>The reduction in the Departments budget for 2014 (Vote 24) was &euro;15.8 million on a full year basis and it is expected that the reduction in question will be in realised in full.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300069#WRR02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":763,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300069#WRR02250"},{"type":"question","counter":764,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[35454\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300069#WRR02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide in tabular form the legislation she proposes to bring to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann within the next 12 months; the date she expects this legislation to reach Second Stage; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Office is currently engaged in a review of our approach to the integration of migrants with a view to the preparation of a new updated overall integration strategy in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the integration of migrants. A Cross Departmental Group on Integration was reconstituted in March to this end with a mandate to review the activities being undertaken by Government Departments and agencies directed to promoting the integration of migrants, preparing a Draft Integration Strategy taking account of the policies and actions already being implemented, and undertaking consultation with key stakeholders. A public consultation process was subsequently launched on 28 March 2014 as part of the review. Over eighty submissions were received from stakeholders, a large number of whom have now met with the Cross-Departmental Group on Integration. The Cross Departmental Group has also held a number of thematic meetings focussing on key policy areas relevant to the integration of migrants, including education, access to public services and social inclusion, and the promotion of intercultural awareness and combatting racism. Work on the development of the updated integration strategy, which will include further thematic meetings and engagement with stakeholders, is ongoing and will continue into 2015 when the new updated strategy will be published.<br\/><br\/>More generally It should be noted that the activities of a number of key Departments and agencies in the field of integration are already being taken forward on the basis of specific strategies to ensure that their services respond to Ireland&rsquo;s changed demographic in an interculturally sensitive and inclusive manner. The strategies developed include: an Intercultural Health Strategy; an Intercultural Education Strategy; a Cultural and Arts Policy and Strategy; the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Diversity Strategy; and an Action Strategy for Integrated Workplaces.

It is intended to have these completed by October 2014.<\/p><p>  The Irish Prison Service aims to ensure all releases from Irish prisons and places of detention are planned releases. The policy will standardise pre-release planning across the Irish Prison Service Estate and ensure the informed and effective transition of the offender from prison to the community, in compliance with statutory, legal and sentencing provisions.<\/p><p>  This policy will apply to all prisons and places of detention in the Irish Prison Service estate and covers such areas as: Housing\/Accommodation Needs, Financial Supports, Healthcare, Public Safety and Statutory Requirements, Families &amp;amp; Personal Relationships, Education, Training and Employment.<\/p><p>  It is recognised that a serious deficiency exists in the infrastructural provision for female prisoners, in the context of a transition from a traditional, secure custodial location to a facility with a lower security level, prior to release into the community. Male prisoners can transfer from a closed prison to the Training Unit, a semi-open institution with a focus on vocational training and an established programme of escalating release to education, work and training or addiction treatment in the community. Suitable male prisoners can transfer to one of two open centres in the jurisdiction, where they can enjoy a significantly lower level of supervision and security, along with more relaxed visiting arrangements. Transfer to such facilities from closed prisons is of enormous value to prisoners, in the context of normalisation, increasing personal responsibility, consolidating family supports and easing the transition from custody to community, all of which contribute towards reducing tendencies towards reoffending. <\/p><p>  To date, no such facilities have been available to female prisoners; however, I am informed by my officials that plans are well advanced for the construction of a day and residential campus in North Dublin to meet the needs of vulnerable women. This will offer a safe environment with day and residential programmes and services offered to single women who need respite and care. The services provided will be offered in such a way to support the women to become as independent as possible. <\/p><p>  Many women are sent from the courts to the D&oacute;chas Centre on short sentences of less than a year - usually for non-violent matters, including Theft, Burglary, TAIB (Threatening, Abusive, and Insulting Behaviour) and Intoxication in a Public Place. The fact they are serving short sentences gives the prison-based services little time to identify their issues and address their needs. Often the D&oacute;chas Centre is a place of respite for this category of offender. It is the experience of the Irish Prison Service that many women are imprisoned directly or indirectly because of addiction, mental health, poverty and homelessness. The overall picture is that women offenders are likely to be poor, have limited education and are either unemployed or in low skilled employment. Many experience accommodation problems, often resulting in homelessness, and problems of addiction and\/or mental health often feature. Significant numbers of women offenders have experienced abuse, either in childhood or in adulthood. Many women offenders are mothers of young children and may struggle with parenting because of their personal circumstances and unmet needs. <\/p><p>  This new facility will play a significant role in providing a gradual, supported transition from prison to community for women prisoners. The campus will be subject to a management steering group comprising representatives of the statutory agencies involved, they are: Dublin City Council (Lead), the HSE, The Probation Service, CDTEB and Irish Prison Service. The campus will also be used as a community resource for the people of Finglas so that the campus truly reflects a community based resource. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300070#WRS01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deportation Orders","counter":805,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300070#WRS01550"},{"type":"question","counter":806,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[35578\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300070#WRS01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will use her absolute discretion to revoke a deportation order in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Meath, with particular reference to his employment history within the state from 2005 to 2014.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":807,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that no deportation order has been made in the case of the person referred to by the Deputy. <br\/><br\/>The person concerned was first registered as a Student in the State in 2010 and kept this permission up to date until November 2012.

Despite the challenging budgetary situation, the pre-school year has been maintained as a universal and free programme, ensuring that a significant number of children can avail of quality pre-school services who would not otherwise be in a position to do so.<br\/><br\/>There is an increasing body of Irish and International evidence quantifying the benefits of early years interventions in terms of improving outcomes for children and in delivering significant economic and societal return to the State. In this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes.A second free pre-school year would represent &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 worth of free childcare to parents and would be likely to generate 4,000-5,000 new jobs, albeit mostly part-time. <br\/><br\/>However, the introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision, which is &euro;175 million per annum.  This additional funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.

","asker":"1080","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":860,"content":"<p>My Department commissioned the Centre for Effective Services (CES) to undertake a review of the implementation of the Youth Homelessness Strategy, 2001 to establish the extent that the strategy has been successful and to identify any blockages or challenges to its implementation. The report found that there have been significant improvements in the service response to homelessness of children and this has contributed to a decrease in the number of children presenting to services as being homeless.<\/p><p>  It should of course be noted that policy responsibility for homeless young people, insofar as it extends to my Department, relates to children under 18 and any child welfare and protection concerns that may arise in the context of the Child Care Act 1991. Young people who are homeless, either singly or as part of a family unit and not falling within this category are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.  Young people who were formerly in the care of the State and presently in receipt of aftercare services will, as part of this support, have their accommodation needs identified.<\/p><p>Children under 16 who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care. Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided a service under Section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991. Such children are typically more challenging to care for as they may be out of school; have experienced neglect and serious family discord; problematic drug use; have mental health or learning difficulties. These children often wish to be only involved with peers and they may be less inclined to engage with social work services. Services need to provide early and flexible options to engage with these children and to support them beyond their 18th birthday.<\/p><p>  Aftercare is the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him\/her in making the transition to independent living. The children most vulnerable to homelessness as care leavers are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements. Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that helps them achieve positive outcomes. It is essential that these young people have an opportunity to develop a relationship with a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with them to identify their needs and ensure that services are in place to help provide them with the stability and support they need.<\/p><p>  The Child and Family Agency has advised that they are in the process of establishing interagency aftercare committees at local level bringing together Local Authorities, HSE and other statutory and voluntary agencies. These committees will develop interagency wrap around aftercare plans for young people, particularly for those with complex needs, including housing requirements.<\/p><p>  A protocol, developed by the Child and Family Agency and the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association, in relation to dealing with accommodation issues of young people leaving care, is nearing completion and is expected to issue shortly.  When agreed and implemented, the protocol will see the relevant local authority housing representative attend aftercare planning meetings with social workers of the Agency in relation to those young people for whom social housing has been identified as the most appropriate form of accommodation support.  This, it is hoped, will facilitate a more efficient service for those leaving care in obtaining social housing suitable to their needs.  <\/p><p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare. This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.<\/p><p>  The prioritisation of services for young people receiving aftercare is considered in the context of the statutory and administrative criteria and rules relating to State provision of services and the requirement of all State bodies to provide services in accordance with resources available to them. The Agency and officials of the DCYA have been and continue to explore these matters further with the relevant Departments and agencies, on a bi-lateral basis, to continue to support the improvement of aftercare for this vulnerable cohort.<\/p><p>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, at its sitting on 1st April, considered the draft aftercare provisions. The Committee&rsquo;s report on the Bill was made available to the Department in mid-July and is currently under consideration, prior to refining the text of the provisions in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300071#WRT01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Work Projects Funding","counter":861,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300071#WRT01750"},{"type":"question","counter":862,"qnumday":334,"qnumall":"[35569\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300071#WRT01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 690 of 30 April 2014 when he plans to publish the value-for-money review of youth work funding schemes.

This vision is for: <br\/><br\/><i>&ldquo;Ireland to be one of the best small countries in which to grow up and raise a family, andwhere the rights of all children and young people are respected, protected and fulfilled; where their voices are heard and where they are supported to realise their maximum potential now and in the future.&rdquo;<\/i><br\/><br\/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures<\/i>puts the everyday lives of children and young people at its centre and requires Government Departments and State agencies to work together in an integrated way along with non-government organisations to achieve better outcomes for children and young people.<br\/><br\/>It emphasises an integrated and evidence informed approach to working across government, on horizontal and vertical levels, which transfers to all sectors and settings working with children and young people.<br\/><br\/>The implementation of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures<\/i>involves the establishment of clear and efficient structures to ensure accountability, drive implementation and provide a forum for stakeholder engagement. These structures have been designed to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. They bring together in a concerted manner the key players across government, the voluntary sector and the voices of children and young people. The new implementation structure streamlines and redesigns existing structures and forums in this area so that their input is represented at a strategic level on the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium.<br\/><br\/>The establishment of the Advisory Council is a significant action within <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures<\/i>to leverage engagement with the whole-of-society, in this case through the NGO sector, with the inclusion of other independent experts and individuals with specific expertise in working with and for children and young people. <br\/><br\/>The Advisory Council brings together for the first time a diverse range of sectoral stakeholders in the domains of children and young people&rsquo;s policy and provision into one forum. The Advisory Council will provide the platform for the NGO sector involved in the area of children and young people to actively guide and support the implementation of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures<\/i>. <br\/><br\/>As the NGO sector connects with and mobilises communities, families and individuals, they are an essential partner to implementation so as to ensure that better outcomes for children and young people are achieved.<br\/><br\/>The Advisory Council will comprise 16 members, in four groups of four, under an independent chair. The first three groups represent the sectors of: Early Years, Children and Youth. The representative bodies for the groups in these areas have each been asked to provide three nominees to me for inclusion on the Advisory Council. These groups are:<br\/><br\/>- Early Years &ndash; The National Voluntary Childcare Collective<br\/><br\/>- Children &ndash; The Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance<br\/><br\/>- Youth -  The National Youth Council of Ireland<br\/><br\/>Presently, work is ongoing in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in finalising the remaining candidates for the positions on the Advisory Council. This will completed shortly and it is expected that the first meeting of the Advisory Council will take place before the end of October. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300071#WRT02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":867,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300071#WRT02150"},{"type":"question","counter":868,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[35595\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300071#WRT02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of children in care in each county, the number of these with a care plan in each county; and the number of these in each county who have had a scheduled review of their plan within the target timeframe for such a review.","asker":"1185","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":869,"content":"<p>I have requested the information from the Child and Family Agency and I will revert to the Deputy when this information is to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300071#WRT02300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":870,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300071#WRT02350"},{"type":"question","counter":871,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[35607\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300071#WRT02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the criteria that is used for evaluation for funding under the Tusla programme for residential care centres fo people with disability.

The Health Act 1970 (as amended) provides for two categories of eligibility for all persons ordinarily resident in the country, i.e. full eligibility (medical card) and limited eligibility (all others).  Full eligibility is determined mainly by reference to income limits and is granted to persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE) are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services to persons and themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.  There is a provision for discretion to grant a card in cases of &quot;undue hardship&quot; where the income guidelines are exceeded.<\/p><p>  The Government decided, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Public Expenditure, that the Minister for Health would revert to Government with options for providing eligibility for a range of health services on the basis of specific and defined medical conditions.  The Director-General of the Health Service Executive established an Expert Panel to examine and recommend the range of medical conditions that should be considered as a basis of eligibility.  The Expert Panel is chaired by Professor Frank Keane, past-president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and clinical lead of the National Clinical Programme for Surgery. The panel includes a range of 23 clinical experts from primary care, specialist services and therapies.  The panel also includes a patient representative to ensure that the views of patients are central to the process.

The HSE advises that there are no therapies or drug treatments for ASD that are curative.   <\/p><p>  This Government is committed to providing specialist supports to enable each individual with a disability, including those with ASD, to achieve his or her full potential and maximise independence, including living as independently as possible.  Services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory, non-statutory and community groups. <\/p><p>  Services provided by ASD service providers include assessment, diagnosis and ongoing treatment and intervention supports.  Ongoing interventions and supports may include home support services, respite services and multi-disciplinary team supports to assess the individual needs of each person with ASD and provide for the appropriate interventions. <\/p><p>  Products that claim to treat medical conditions such as autism are considered to be medicines and require an authorisation prior to being placed on the market in Ireland. The product referred to as Miracle Mineral Solution is not authorised as a medicine for sale or supply in Ireland.

Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable products. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price the Health Service Executive (HSE) will reimburse to pharmacists for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine's prices.<br\/><br\/>Eligible patients using State drug schemes like the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme will not face any additional costs for products priced at or below the reference price. If a patient would like to receive a particular brand that costs more than the reference price then the patient will have to pay the additional cost of that product. In cases where substitution is prohibited for clinical reasons, patients will not face any additional costs if the prescribed product costs more than the reference price.<br\/><br\/>The HSE advises the public that if they are being charged prices which exceed the reimbursement price listed on the HSE website (<i><\/i>), plus a dispensing fee of between &euro;3.50 and &euro;5, then they should discuss the differential with their pharmacist to ensure they get the best possible price for the medicine concerned.<br\/><br\/>In addition, measures have been taken to increase price transparency among retail pharmacies.

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). <br\/><br\/>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. Due to the very difficult and challenging economic environment in which the Government targeted additional savings in health expenditure of &euro;619 million in 2014, which must be achieved while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible, the HSE decided it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. <br\/><br\/>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost effectiveness of Fampridine. Biogen Idec's Irish management indicated to the HSE in November 2013 that it intended to re-submit an application in April 2014. The HSE has advised it received a revised application from Biogen Idec on Friday 25th July. This application is currently being assessed in line with the agreed procedures and timescales.

","asker":"1048","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1101,"content":"<p>Medical cards are provided to persons who, under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, are, in the opinion of the HSE unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. Standard medical card scheme applications and those for persons aged 70 and older generally require supporting financial and\/or medical documentation to be furnished in order for the application to be assessed in line with the HSE&rsquo;s Medical Card and GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines and application forms can be accessed online\/by post or at local health offices.<\/p><p>  However, this process differs in the case of persons seeking emergency medical cards. The HSE has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford. Medical cards that are applied for in an emergency situation are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. Such an application can be initiated through the Local Health office and details of this procedure are available to all GP's and Social Workers.<\/p><p>  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months.<\/p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness, a means test does not apply.  Once the terminal illness is verified by a GP or Consultant, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. For the purpose of the decision making process for an emergency medical card, in these circumstances, a &quot;terminal illness&quot;, or a person who is &quot;terminally  ill, is a person who is certified by a Doctor or a Consultant as &quot;terminally ill&quot; and is in a palliative care situation. Terminally ill means that the person is suffering from an illness that will end in death, where there is no possibility of recovery and the person is more likely to die of their illness in the next six months than not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300075#WRX03400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Agency Staff Data","counter":1102,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300075#WRX03450"},{"type":"question","counter":1103,"qnumday":415,"qnumall":"[35897\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300075#WRX03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total spend by his Department on agency staff in each year from 2010 to 2013, inclusive; and the projected spend for this year.

The primary emphasis of Emigrant Support Programme funding is on supporting culturally sensitive frontline welfare services targeting the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities.  These services have made a substantive difference to the lives of Irish communities overseas, reducing homelessness, tacking social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access the local statutory entitlements.  The Programme has evolved in light of recent emigration to respond to the needs of the newer profile of Irish emigrants, including young families, in countries such as Australia and Canada.  Emigrant Support Programme funding is increasingly directed to Irish welfare centres in those countries which play an important role in supporting Irish emigrants, including new arrivals, who experience particular challenges.  Over &euro;2.4million of funding was allocated to organisations in Australia under the Programme between 2003 and 2013.  This network of Irish community support organisations offers a range of responses including information provision, outreach and crisis assistance.  Organisations supported in Australia include the Irish Australian Welfare Bureau and Resource Centre New South Wales, Claddagh Association Perth and the Irish Australian Support Association of Queensland.<\/p><p>  Our Embassies and Consulates continue to ensure widespread awareness of the Programme and have actively encouraged applications for new projects from regions that support new arrivals.

During the recent conflict, most of these schools were used to provide shelter to large numbers of civilians who were fleeing from other areas.  Some 111 schools were damaged in the conflict, in most cases from the effects of impacts nearby.  However, in seven cases it appears that school premises were directly hit by fire, leading to large numbers of casualties among people sheltering there, including children.  It is likely in most cases, and certain in some, that missiles or artillery shells fired by Israeli forces were responsible.  In at least one case however, Israel stated that its forces had not been involved, and that the blast resulted from a missile, fired from Gaza towards Israel, dropping short in Gaza itself.  This is not an unknown occurrence, and we have no means ourselves at this point of ascertaining exactly what happened.  Nor do we know if incidents of schools being hit by Israeli fire were intentional or not, although in some cases at least it seems likely that the school was the intended target.  It is also necessary to be clear that in a number of cases UNRWA itself discovered rockets and other weapons hidden in school buildings without its knowledge.  In each case UNRWA disposed of the munitions and made public the facts.  Such incidents do not of course justify in any way any subsequent attacks on schools housing refugees, nor does there seem to have been any correlation between the two.  It is however an indication of the complexities involved.<br\/><br\/>The UN Human Rights Council has established an investigative panel to examine all of these alleged or apparent abuses of human rights or breaches of international law.

Ireland is supporting the efforts of the EU, UN and international community to provide a strong and effective response to the crisis, which is focused both on stopping the spread of the virus and treating those affected.  Ireland was one of the co-sponsors of a UN Security Council resolution on Ebola adopted on 18 September, which led to the establishment of a new UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER).<\/p><p>  The two countries most seriously affected by the Ebola crisis, Liberia and Sierra Leone, are partner countries of Ireland for our development aid programme.  We have already provided funding of &euro;350,000 direct to NGO organisations working on the Ebola response there, particularly those that are involved in a very important programme of community sensitisation aimed specifically at halting the spread of the Ebola virus.  Yesterday I announced additional funding of &euro;660,000 for UNICEF, to provide life-saving nutritional supplies to children who have been affected by the crisis.

The decision to abolish the grants was not taken lightly, and it has to be viewed in the context of the prevailing requirement to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies where possible.

My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld. Application forms for taking a section 29 appeal are available on my Departments website at the following link , or by contacting Section 29 Administration Unit, Friars Mill Road, Mullingar, Co.

School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.

Local authorities have confirmed that 1,604 of the properties identified are considered unsuitable by reference to sustainable planning and housing policy or are located in areas with no demand. A further 1,179 units originally identified as available were subsequently discovered by NAMA to be unavailable as the units had already been sold or leased by their debtor in accordance with their strategy for repaying their debt, or became unavailable when the loans associated with these properties were sold and NAMA no longer hold an interest. The potential of a further 540 units is being evaluated.<br\/><br\/>Of the current 1,971 available properties for which a social housing demand has been confirmed by the local authorities, <b><\/b>736 have been delivered for at the end of June 2014. This figure included 531 complete and operational units and 205 units where contracts had been signed and final completion works were under way.  A breakdown by Authority is provided in the table below. A further 603 properties are considered as being active transactions whereby terms are agreed or active negotiation is on-going by all parties concerned or where a detailed appraisal (i.e. determining the most likely delivery mechanism) is being carried out. <br\/><br\/>The process to source NAMA units requires agreement between several parties and operates is subject to a range of legal and financial constraints.

The introduction of the National Asset Residential Property Services Limited (NARPSL) special purpose vehicle (SPV) has aided delivery with some 367 units were delivered in 2013 alone, almost a doubling of what had been delivered in the previous full year of operation. Efforts to source as many suitable properties as possible through this process are on-going, including the reviewing of units previously deemed unsuitable .

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities and the purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988. <br\/><br\/>While it is clear that a proportion of funding must be used to provide sufficient bed capacity to accommodate those in need of emergency accommodation it is equally important that resources are channelled to deliver more permanent responses to homelessness in a focused and strategic way. <br\/><br\/>The level of funding available to housing authorities in 2015 for housing programmes including homelessness is currently being considered in the context of the Estimates process. In light of budgetary demands, I am working with my colleagues in Government to ensure that appropriate funding priority continues to be attached to homelessness.<br\/><br\/>In February 2013, the Government&rsquo;s <i>Homelessness Policy Statement<\/i>was published in which the aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined. The statement emphasises a housing-led approach, which is focused on accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness. The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.<br\/><br\/>On 20 May 2014, the Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness was published in which the Government's approach to delivery on its objective of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined. A copy of this plan is available on my Department's website at, <br\/><br\/><font color=\"#1F86FF\"> <\/font><br\/><br\/>This plan sets out a range of measures to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households within the next three years and mobilise the necessary supports. Progress in implementing the plan is reported quarterly through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and a copy of the Quarter 2 Progress Report is also available on my Department's website at the link provided above. <br\/><br\/>Based on data recorded on the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS), a recent survey of lead housing authorities confirmed that 2,509 unique individuals utilised Section 10 funded emergency accommodation nationally during the week of 14 to 20 July 2014. A copy of this report is available on my Department's website at the link provided above.<br\/><br\/>Bringing vacant local authority properties back into productive use as quickly as possible is one of the critical actions in the implementation plan and steps are being taken across the country to bring 1,800 such units into use before year end.<br\/><br\/>Other suitable vacant residential properties in State ownership are also being considered to be brought into productive use as quickly as possible. Some large sites in Dublin City have been identified by key State stakeholders including OPW, the Department of Defence, and the HSE and these are being considered by Dublin City Council. I understand that proposals on the use of prefabricated units are also being considered by the City Council; in the event that the Council submits formal proposals in this regard, these will require careful consideration by my Department. The use of construction innovations, such as timber-framed housing, could be also considered for meeting immediate need on sites that become available.<br\/><br\/>The Homelessness Policy Implementation Team charged with overseeing and monitoring the delivery of actions outlined in the Government's implementation plan has been considering this matter further and options are being considered to alleviate the immediate problems in the Dublin region. <br\/><br\/>The supply of housing more generally will be addressed in the short to medium term by the actions being progressed in the Construction 2020 Strategy and will be strengthened further through the Social Housing Strategy which I expect will be finalised in the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>I understand that the night bus previously operated by Dublin City Council and which picked up rough sleepers and transported them to emergency accommodation was discontinued in 2011. This issue is being considered further by the Homelessness Policy Implementation Team.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300079#WRBB04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":1301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300079#WRBB04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1302,"qnumday":483,"qnumall":"[35256\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300079#WRBB04400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding the affordable housing scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1303,"content":"<p>As announced in the Government&rsquo;s 2011 Housing Policy Statement, all affordable housing schemes have been stood down in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.

Similarly, I have no function in relation to industrial relations issues such as workers&rsquo; rights and conditions or industrial dispute resolution in the waste or any other sector. <\/p><p>  Waste collection is the statutory responsibility of local authorities, in this case, Dublin City Council. Under section 33 of the Waste Management Act 1996 (as amended) there is a general duty on a local authority to either itself collect the household waste in its functional area or alternatively to arrange for its collection by third parties. Given the strategic importance of waste management to the welfare of the environment and society in general, my Department wrote to Dublin City Council requesting a written report on the contingency\/scenario planning that has been undertaken by the City Council to provide\/arrange for the provision of an alternative household waste collection service in the event of an inability of Greyhound Recycling and Recovery to maintain collection services to their customers in the City Council area.   <\/p><p>  The City Council has confirmed that it is satisfied that there is a sufficient number of other permitted operators in a position to provide a household waste collection service to households in the City Council area at a competitive price.

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  The NPPR Charge is based on self-declaration and therefore the onus is on the property owner themselves to register their property and make the payment.  The 2009 Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR Charge.  There are no plans to revise this legislation.<br\/><br\/>A residential property not in use by an owner as his or her sole or main residence is liable for the Charge.  This may not necessarily be a second home; a person may have vacated a property and be living in rented accommodation elsewhere for work or other reasons, for example, and, in such a case, the property that the owner is no longer living in is liable for the Charge, even if it is the only residential property that person owns.  It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable. <br\/><br\/>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted.

It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR Charge liability from owners.  In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment.  The Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.

A scheme exists whereby a local authority (LA) can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (LA- mortgage-to-rent).  The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-mortgage-to-rent).  Both schemes are designed to assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are now unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. <br\/><br\/>On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears the Government launched the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012 and extended it nationally in June 2012.  The scheme is currently in operation and continues to accept applications from lending institutions. <br\/><br\/>To be eligible for the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme a household must have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, agree to the voluntary surrender of their home, be in negative equity, and be deemed eligible for social housing in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  There is a cap on the value of the property which applies but the location of the property is not a criterion for inclusion or exclusion to the scheme.  Notwithstanding this, approved housing bodies must treat each case on its merits and issues such as the operational presence of the AHB or the market rent available may impact on its decision. <br\/><br\/>A total of 2,496 cases have been submitted to date.  31 of these cases are currently being progressed under revised procedures introduced to improve the process.  Of the other 2,465 cases submitted, 1,003 were ineligible or terminated during the process, of which 258 cases were not progressed because the household in question was deemed to be over or under accommodated.  Agreement on the sale could not be agreed on a further 50 cases.  Of the remaining cases submitted, 48 have been completed, 1,221 are currently with the lenders who are seeking the consent of borrowers to share information and for the carrying out of an independent valuation, and the remaining 143 are actively being progressed.

As part of this programme, an allocation of &euro;0.5m has been provided in my Department's Vote in 2014 to advance the development of a cultural centre at Teach an Phiarsaigh in Ros Muc.    The Deputy will also be aware that in May 2014 the Government announced as part of the Phase 4 Infrastructure Stimulus an allocation of &euro;22m in 2015 for the Commemorations Programme. This funding will help, inter alia, to finance the costs associated with the flagship commemoration projects in 2015, including Teach an Phiarsaigh.<\/p><p>  The development of a cultural centre at Teach an Phiarsaigh is being progressed by a steering group comprising the various stakeholders, including &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Galway County Council, the Office of Public Works, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and my own Department. The project has been developed through a collaborative process with all stakeholders with regard to linguistic, social, sustainable and economic considerations. I understand that all the stakeholders have indicated their full support to ensuring that the project is brought to fruition. <\/p><p>  With regard to the progress made to date, I can confirm that an economic appraisal of the project has been completed. I can also confirm that the procurement of the services of a project management team and design team for the project has been completed and that they have commenced work. <\/p><p>  In addition to being one of the flagship projects of the Commemorations Programme, I am advised that the project location has been chosen by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to be a key 'discovery point' on the Wild Atlantic Way project. I am also advised that Teach an Phiarsaigh is afforded special recognition in F&aacute;ilte Ireland's Connemara Destination Plan and Connemara Driving Tour and is a key component of its strategy to develop the tourism sector in Connemara. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300083#WRFF02600","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme Payments","counter":1493,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300083#WRFF02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1494,"qnumday":557,"qnumall":"[35918\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300083#WRFF02700","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the position regarding the moneys paid to Bullrush in full under the turf compensation scheme and if this 200 plus acre of bog is now officially the property of NPWS.","asker":"1192","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1495,"content":"<p>Under the provisions of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 and the Wildlife Acts, compensation is payable in certain circumstances where activities must cease for the conservation of a designated site.
