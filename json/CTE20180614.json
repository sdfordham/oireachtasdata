We have asked representatives from the HSE and the State Claims Agency back to explain an apparent conflict in evidence and we will deal with this matter first.  Following that, we will have a short engagement with Nursing Homes Ireland to inform our examination of the National Treatment Purchase Fund financial statements in the afternoon.  We will take other business of the committee separately at an appropriate time during the meeting.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is matters relating to CervicalCheck and evidence given to the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have invited representatives from the HSE and the State Claims Agency to provide clarification in respect of a contradiction in evidence given by the two bodies to the committee at our meeting of 17 May.  As Chairman of the committee, and I know I speak for all of the members, I have to say that if information given to us is inaccurate or misleading, we regard it as a most serious matter.  Witnesses do not give evidence just to the eight or ten people in the room but to the national Parliament on the public record while representing a State organisation.  It is even more serious in this case as it relates to one of the most significant health issues we have experienced in many years.  If we suspect that any witness has failed to provide accurate information to us, we will engage with him or her again until we are satisfied that we have obtained clear and correct information.<\/p> <p>  We are joined today from the HSE by Mr. John Connaghan, director general, Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, national director of strategic transformation and planning, Mr. John Gleeson, programme manager of CervicalCheck, Mr. Paul Connors, national director of communications, and Mr. Damien McCallion, national director of the national screening service.  We are joined from the State Claims Agency by Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director, Mr. Pat Kirwan, executive head of business development, Ms. Jenny Foley, solicitor and clinical claims manager, and Dr. Cathal O&rsquo;Keeffe, head of clinical risk.  We also have Ms Celeste O'Callaghan and Ms Mary Jackson from the Department of Health.  We did ask the State Claims Agency for its legal representatives to be present but we received correspondence - No. 1376 - from Mr. Breen explaining why they are not here today.  He might elaborate on this during the course of the meeting.  I understand Mr. Breen is fully informed and in a position to answer all questions that would have been directed to the agency's legal representatives in any event.<\/p> <p>  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be completely switched off or placed on aeroplane mode.<\/p> <p>  I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186, that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<\/p> <p>  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.<\/p> <p>  The committee was given clear views at the previous meeting but the matter of clarification has been mentioned.  If something on the record is not correct, we want the record corrected.  Clarification, expansion, further explanations and more information are not the issue.  If information on the public record is not exactly right, the record must be corrected.  If inaccurate information has been placed on the record, the committee will require an apology because this is the record of the national Parliament.  Talking around the issue or expanding on it will not deal with the inaccurate information on the public record.  I make this point clearly because witnesses often believe that if they expand on statements made at a previous meeting, it will explain the context.  However, if the record is not correct, it must be corrected and appropriate action must be taken by the relevant witnesses.<\/p> <p>  I will set out what happened regarding our previous meeting with representatives of the Health Service Executive.  The committee received a letter from the State Claims Agency after the meeting stating Mr. Gleeson's assertion did not accord with the facts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#C00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1528963200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Is the Chairman reading from the letter of 22 May?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#C00300","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1528963200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Yes, and that is the only sentence I will read from it.  What is really troubling before we even start, and I say this to all public bodies, is that when the witnesses left the room they may have been in doubt about whether what was said was accurate.  The HSE should have reverted to us with a statement setting out the exact position and clearing up any confusion that arose.<\/p><p>Representatives of the HSE would not even be here today if the State Claims Agency had not written to us.  If it had not written to us, we would not know we had not been given fair evidence with full candour.  If representatives of public bodies ever leave the committee room, go back to their offices and think that perhaps they did not explain a particular point, they should write to us and correct the record straight away rather than leaving us to pick it up from a third party.  I think the witnesses understand that general principle.  I say it to all representatives of public bodies who appear before the Committee of Pubic Accounts.  <\/p><p> At the meeting of 17 May, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien asked questions about who in the HSE, CervicalCheck and the State Claims Agency attended various meetings or spoke with people.  People watching proceedings will not remember that particular exchange.  We will ask the communications unit to play an extract of the meeting on screen so people will remember the precise issue we are talking about.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#C00400","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528963200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Members viewed a video presentation.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1528963200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>That is a recording of the conversation we had at that meeting.  The witnesses will understand that we left the room with a clear impression.  We want the record corrected with regard to this matter.  The public expects that when senior Department officials and officials from State agencies attend here there is a level of truthfulness and candour.  We are entitled to believe it.  We accept all the evidence we get in good faith.  It is a source of major concern to us when we are alerted by somebody else that the evidence given may not have been accurate.  That is why we have a duty, not only in this case but in cases involving all witnesses who come in here from week to week, to make sure evidence is accurate.  If it is not accurate, witnesses should come back to us as quickly as possible and correct the record.  That did not happen in this case.  That is why we are here today.  It adds to an issue involving delayed information and women not being informed when the national Parliament is not adequately informed.  It gives a very bad impression of how the HSE is dealing with the issue.  It is Mr. Connaghan's responsibility to take that forward.<\/p> <p>  At this stage, Mr. Connaghan wants to make a short statement, followed by Mr. Gleeson.

I thank the committee for the invitation to attend the committee today.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Damien McCallion, Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, Mr. John Gleeson and Mr. Paul Connors.  I will begin by setting out some points regarding the issues of concern about the evidence given by the HSE to the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts held on 17 May and further concerns raised by the committee at its meeting of 31 May.  I reassure members of the committee that as director general I fully understand the obligation placed on me to provide any information requested, to act with integrity and to be accountable, open, honest and transparent in evidence provided to this or another committee of the Oireachtas.  My colleagues are also aware of these obligations and have and will fully comply with them.<\/p> <p>  Before I address the specific issue of the evidence given to the committee regarding the conference call with the State Claims Agency, I will briefly update the committee on the interim report on recommendations issued by Dr. Scally last Tuesday and to bring it up to speed on the actions we have taken since the last meeting of the committee, bearing in mind that members of this committee have previously raised issues on communication, transparency, management and governance.<\/p><p>On Dr. Scally&rsquo;s interim report, we welcome the report and the recommendations.  In the interests of transparency, it would be my intention to not only publish any recommendations on the HSE website but to also publish our progress tracker against each of the recommendations in the final report such that the public can observe and measure progress.<br\/><br\/>Since the commencement of the scoping exercise, the HSE has prioritised the provision of all relevant documents to Dr Scally in a manner that is both useful and timely.  As previously advised to the committee, we have a special team in place to do this work in a manner that is both useful and timely.  This remains an ongoing process.  The HSE had a productive engagement with Dr Scally and his team yesterday morning, Wednesday, 13 June, with regard to how required documentation has been provided up to this point and how the HSE can guarantee the future management of documents to the satisfaction of Dr Scally.  The HSE has provided to Dr Scally as many of the documents as possible that have been requested by him within the timescale required.  Documents pertaining to contracting of the laboratory services have been prepared for release but in some instances require legal clearance and in others the consent of other parties prior to their release.  This was discussed with Dr. Scally at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting.  We have been working intensively with our legal teams to release the laboratory contracts without compromising the terms of those contracts.  We have made a breakthrough in the past number of hours on this matter.  Consequently, we hope to be in a position to release the contracts to Dr. Scally shortly.  <br\/><br\/>The HSE has provided the vast majority of documents to Dr. Scally&rsquo;s team in electronic format.  Due to certain technical issues, relating to software limitations in some locations, it has not been possible to provide some documents in a searchable format.  However, a methodology is being agreed with Dr. Scally to overcome this problem in the future, which is designed to further enhance and sharpen the focus of the document searches.  This involves more specific technological interventions.As director general of the HSE, I reiterate my intention to continue to fully co-operate with Dr. Scally in the most productive manner possible to ensure that he is properly assisted in his work.<br\/><br\/>Turning now to the actions we have taken thus far, we have strengthened the overall management of the programme with a national director, Mr. McCallion, reporting to me as director general.  Mr. McCallion&rsquo;s role is broad in scope and will not only cover the existing task of informing and supporting the women involved but will extend after the Scally review reports to ensure all recommendations are implemented fully.  We have engaged external support as part of a records support team to ensure we fulfil the requirement to meet both legal requests and access requests for clinical records.  I ask the committee to note that in the absence of a fully computerised electronic healthcare record, this entails a manual search for records dating back, in some cases, years and potentially over a number of sites.  We are committed to meeting the standard of 30 days on access requests. <br\/><br\/>The committee previously voiced concern on risk management and oversight in screening.  We are in the process of establishing a risk committee, which will be chaired independently by someone from outside the screening programme, enhanced with the appointment of a chief risk officer to support the work of that committee.  The CervicalCheck programme has a quality assurance committee, which has an independent chair.  <br\/><br\/>Since the establishment of the helpline, we have taken more than 24,000 calls with the vast majority of these now returned.  Four support centres have been established, with 50 staff engaged to provide that support at various stages.  I ask the committee to be aware that we continue to receive calls on a daily basis, although these are reducing significantly in number.  With regard to practical support for the 209 women, each of these has an individual named person who is based in each community healthcare organisation.  For those who want to access that support, it has so far covered the provision of medical cards, home support, physiotherapy, counselling, etc.  Our job is to provide immediate support to the women affected and to ensure that is delivered with empathy and consideration. <br\/><br\/>We are supporting the international review panel, which is being commissioned by the Department of Health.  We have provided matching data from the national cancer registry.  We are transitioning from the CervicalCheck audit process to the audit process being developed by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.  This will require a significant team to be put in place within the HSE to support this process.  We understand the Department is concluding the contract for this work and the scope of work will include all women who were part of the CervicalCheck audit and those registered with the national cancer registry. <br\/><br\/>Turning to the substance of today&rsquo;s meeting, at a meeting of the committee on 10 May 2018, the State Claims Agency, SCA, confirmed that it was told by CervicalCheck that all the women had been communicated with<i>.  <\/i>The SCA, by letter dated 22 May 2018 to the committee, confirmed the basis for this initial evidence to be a teleconference held on 20 April 2018 in which the SCA legal team of four was provided with information by Mr. John Gleeson of CervicalCheck.  This information, as<i><\/i>carefully noted<i><\/i>by the SCA legal team, was &quot;that all women whose smear was part of the audit had now been informed or assumed that they had been informed by their treating clinicians&quot;<i>.  <\/i>The committee will be aware from my letter of 30 May that I had asked the SCA and CervicalCheck to discuss why there were two apparently contradictory statements.  My letter of 30 May accepted that the advice on the teleconference of 20 April that, &quot;All women whose smear was part of the audit had now been informed or assumed that they had been informed by their treating clinicians&quot;, is correct and accepted by the SCA and CervicalCheck.  In particular, Mr. Gleeson has advised me he does not dispute the note as recorded by the SCA on the legal file as it reflects his understanding of the position regarding communication with the women at that point in time - 20 April.  With the Chairman's agreement, I will ask John Gleeson to make a short statement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#D01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Connaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528963200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Before Mr. Gleeson makes his contribution, is the HSE in a position to give the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the 209 women affected to Dr. Scally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#E00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528963200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Dr. Scally has requested that he would provide us with a letter, which he has done, and our advocacy unit will communicate to the women on his behalf.

There was no reference to a particular meeting or exchange.  As the transcript illustrates, Mr. Connors replied to the Deputy first before, as he can explain, under the impression that the person was not in the room.  I, therefore, replied, \"No\" - first, because I thought there must have been another meeting between the HSE and the SCA at which I was not present and, second, because I would not have made such an unqualified statement.  In subsequent explanation and questioning by Deputy O&rsquo;Brien when he said that the person was a CervicalCheck person, I felt that he must in fact be referring to me.  The recent exchanges I had had with the SCA, including telephone calls and teleconferences, concerned a specific court case.  I did not recall the specifics of every question and answer during those exchanges but I sought to clarify on two occasions during the PAC meeting what would have been the substance of what I could have said.  As the transcript shows, what I tried to say later was that I did not think anyone from CervicalCheck could have said that because it would never have been our understanding.  Communications would have issued to the treating clinicians in respect of all women with cytology reviews and we would have believed that the clinician would have communicated with the women as appropriate.<\/p> <p>  In the letter provided to the PAC subsequent to that on 22 May, which I had sight of after that, the statement \"All women whose smear was part of the audit had now been informed or assumed they had been informed by their treating clinicians\" and reference to a legal note is, I believe, consistent with what I have said, with what I intended and with the understanding shared with the SCA of what was meant in our exchanges.

It is on file - I am sure the letters are here in front of me - that the HSE highlighted that the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 had not yet commenced and this was proving an obstacle to open disclosure.  The witness had to know that the section on open disclosure has still not been commenced.  The HSE put it in writing that the failure to commence Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 relating to open disclosure was an obstacle to open disclosure.  Mr. Gleeson and all senior figures in the HSE must have known that open disclosure was not fully operational because the legislation to back it up and give people protection had not yet commenced at that point.  It still has not commenced.  That correspondence was sent months ago, in January or February this year, which means Mr. Gleeson must have known there was an issue with open disclosure.  Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 was designed to facilitate open disclosure.  The HSE knew Part 4 had not been implemented, yet Mr. Gleeson is hanging onto the view that open disclosure was occurring.  What was the purpose of the legislation if Mr. Gleeson believes there was 100% open disclosure?  He could not have believed that.  While I accept that he was acting in good faith in making the assumption that the women affected had been informed, it was not a valid assumption to make based on the state of his knowledge of the issue of open disclosure.  Does the witness accept that?  I am trying to understand his assumption.

We are now being told that in the absence of fully computerised electronic healthcare records, the retrieval process entails a manual search for records going back many years in some cases and potentially over a number of sites and that, although the HSE is committed to meeting the 30-day target, that does not always happen.  We understand that records may go back for a significant period and that people may wish to access their full health records but the scope of this issue is relatively narrow.  People will not look for their records because they had a broken toe when they were aged five.  Specific records are being sought.  We were given an assurance at that meeting that there would be no obstacles to the retrieval of such records but it now appears that issues are arising because the HSE does not keep records in a certain way.

The request for access to records may come directly from women or from their solicitor, which may be by means of a freedom of information, FOI, or data access request.  All those requests are currently being met.  I am aware of one case in which an extra day will be needed and that was agreed yesterday with the woman concerned.  We are currently providing access to records in accordance with the deadline.  An issue which initially caused some problems was the volume of legal correspondence received which meant that we could not concentrate on getting the records out but, rather, had to try to deal with that correspondence in terms of acknowledgements and so on.  We have now put extra resources in place such that legal letters are acknowledged in a timely manner.  With the exception of the case that arose yesterday to which I referred and which was clarified this morning with the lady involved, we are meeting the targets for access to records.  For access requests the current target is 30 days, while for legal requests, it is meeting the deadlines for pending court cases.<\/p> <p>  Several steps are needed to provide the records, including the hospital records regarding the woman's cancer treatment and so on, the screening records and the associated correspondence between the hospital and the screening system.

I appreciate Mr. Connor's directness on that.  To be fair to my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, he is the one who pursued this matter.  What worries me is that we are left with this ram-jam of a story and we will have to make a decision on what we believe happened.  We must take the word of witnesses that there was no disagreement at the meeting between the State Claims Agency and HSE.  However, neither organisation should have intercepted something that would obviously come back before the Committee of Public Accounts once the letter had been written to the SCA.  Having been before the committee before the State Claims Agency wrote to the committee, surely Mr. Connaghan was aware that there was a problem with this evidence?  Soon after the meeting it became clear that the information given at the meeting was incorrect.  Given that this is glaringly obvious to everyone following proceedings and everyone present, why did Mr. Connaghan choose to do and say nothing?  The only reason the committee is addressing this issue again is that the State Claims Agency wrote to us about it.  Mr. Connaghan needs to reflect on that deeply.<\/p><p> In layman's language, this was a case of the HSE believing the committee had not noticed this and the HSE had, therefore, got away with it and would say nothing.  However, when Mr. Breen and his colleagues wrote to the committee, the HSE had to deal with the issue.  If ever a series of events symbolises my view of arse covering in the HSE, it is this.  We are being told a story and we have to take people's word for it.  The committee took their word last time and it has since transpired that there were inaccuracies.  That is fine.  We will take the word of the HSE again today and it may stand up.  The committee will have to make a judgment on that but it is not a court of law.  <\/p><p> However, the bigger issue is why the HSE did not deal with the issue once it became clear there was a problem.  In fairness to Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, that became obvious when he raised the matter.  While I acknowledge Mr. Connaghan's statement that there is a lesson to be learned from this, it is not damn well good enough.  We represent the public and the whole country is following these meetings, as are HSE management and staff.  The impact of the performances of HSE witnesses at this committee and other committees has had a serious and negative impact on its staff.  The administrative work creeping up on the HSE is multiplying as a result of those performances.  HSE staff did not like what they saw, namely, multiple instances of arse covering.  As a result, many people in the organisation believe they must push everything up the line, rather than assume personal responsibility in case their managers land them in it.  I have outlined one such example and the events that transpired following a meeting of this committee.  While the problem that has arisen may have been accidental, the fact that it was not dealt is emblematic of the HSE.  If Mr. Connaghan cannot see what is glaringly obvious, I do not know where we are going.  He may respond if he wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#K05600","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528963200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I have already responded on the reason I asked the HSE and State Claims Agency to look at the facts.

I am not accusing anybody of telling lies or giving misinformation or whatever nice version one wants to use about lying.  As we all heard, Professor Scally has a history of dealing with stuff like this in other organisations.  It does not make sense that it would be acceptable to somebody at his level to receive scanned documents on a disk or a USB stick.  Neither he nor anyone at his level would think it was practical to go through documents in that manner.  It is not believable and I find it incompetent that scanned documents would be given in a format that was not searchable, as Mr. Connaghan said.  It is a needle in a haystack job.  It is not the way to go about it.  That it took until 11 June to find out that this was the format in which he had been given the information does not add up.<\/p> <p>  Many of us on the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Health, including me, believe we are constantly met with resistance, avoidance of disclosure and every barricade that can be put in our way in our engagement with the HSE.  For the public looking in, I estimate the combined salaries of the witnesses present per year to be in the region of &euro;2.5 million, leaving the rest of us out of it.  I have said here before and at the Joint Committee on Health that we are dealing with a population the size of that of Manchester.  For normal people looking in, this is madness.  It is a dysfunctional system that is rotten to the core and not fit for purpose.  We have all of the witnesses, many of whom do great work, but committee members are like a court of law.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien has to read transcripts and we then start dancing on the head of a pin with words such as \"assurances\" and \"assumptions\".  The last time we had the word \"feelings\" from Dr. O'Keeffe.  All of this language does not give us answers and, to my mind, it is a complete waste of time.  Somebody needs to take control.  I thought Mr. Connaghan was in control, but the fact that he has admitted that he has only met Dr. Scally once, which was at the outset, seems mad.  It seems reasonable on something of this magnitude that he would be meeting Dr. Scally on a weekly basis to be updated.  To have to sit here on a such beautiful day land listen to Mr. Gleeson talk about things he had \"assumed\" is disrespectful to us and the public.<\/p> <p>  I do not buy the notion that somebody thought that giving scanned, unsearchable documents was the way forward.  It seems to be a deliberate attempt to stop information from being received.  I do not buy either the notion of not having statutory authority because I have often inquired of the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, and it seems people with no medical qualifications have access to medical records.  The issue can be dealt with.  Many people go to doctor A for treatment and doctor B gets to see their files and there is no confidentiality issue.  It is just another barricade put in our way in trying to get the answers.<\/p><p>I just wonder what the point of all the witnesses is at this stage.  They are not able to answer us.  Who is to blame?  Is it the labs, the audit process, the system, politics or something else?  We are still here.  I do not know what is the point of this meeting.  It must be the tenth or 12th meeting with the witnesses I have attended and we are no further along.  There is no point to the witnesses being here because they are not giving us answers.  If this is - I am trying to think of a word that does not include bad language - the mess we are in, they clearly cannot manage things.<\/p><p> The public and the medical people are becoming more annoyed because we are now undoing all the good that was done through the screening process in this country over ten years.  We will probably reverse our 7% reduction in cervical cancer rates.  The whole negativity around this is bad for public health, which, as far as I am concerned, it is supposed to be the witnesses' job to protect.  I am a Government Deputy and I just think the whole lot of them should be sent packing and we should get new people to do this.  It is the middle of June.  This has been going on for weeks now and we are none the wiser.  We are looking at people who are paid with taxpayers' money and who are supposed to be accountable to us telling us \"Well, maybe\", \"Oh, I assumed this\" and \"I felt this\".  I just do not have any time for it because I do not buy it.  It reminds me of when I used to try to get away with things with my parents when I was a teenager and I tried to baffle them with my various versions of the story so they would not know where I was.  That is what the witnesses have managed to do today.  We do not know who is in charge, who is accountable or what qualifications people have.  I looked at the organisational structure of the HSE and it has changed in the past two days.  The HSE has been shifting the deck-chairs around on the Titanic as well.  It is just insulting.  The witnesses' continuous behaviour at these meetings is insulting to the elected Members of this House and to the public.  It is a waste of our time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#P04600","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528963200,"counter":534,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy have a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#Q00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1528963200,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I have a question somewhere.

We now know information which we did not know previously, particularly in relation to women being informed.  It was assumed that women were being informed through their clinicians.  Unfortunately, we now know that was not the case.  That is what has caused a lot of controversy in this committee and a lot of trauma and hurt for the women themselves.  I presume lessons have been learned in that regard.  Is it the case that we are not relying on clinicians now?  Are we still relying on clinicians to inform women into the future?  Is the process changing?  Can someone explain what happens now?  At the meeting of 17 May, I made the point that because of the failure to put in place a check at the end point, we did not close the loop.  I asked Mr. Gleeson who was responsible for ensuring the loop was closed.  I was told it was not possible at the time to state who was responsible.  Mr. Gleeson said it may or may not have been his responsibility.  I asked him whether he would go away and reflect on whether it should have been his responsibility.  Somebody needs to be held accountable.  I am genuinely not looking for a head on a plate.  Somebody needs to put their hand up and say \"I was the person responsible for ensuring the loop was closed, but it did not happen and I apologise for it\".  Nobody has done that yet.  I think somebody should do it.  I want to give the people in the room an opportunity to take responsibility for the loop not being closed.  If they can take responsibility for it now, and if they want to comment on it, the floor is open to them.  I think it is important.  Much of the stuff that is out there at the moment relates to the fact that the women who have been affected by this issue feel that nobody is being held accountable and nobody is taking responsibility.  That, outside of everything else they are going through, is causing hurt to these women.  They see a lot of officials and politicians coming in and having a ding-dong back and forth without anybody putting up their hand and saying \"I was responsible, I apologise, this will not happen again\".  Do we now know who was responsible for closing that loop?  If that person is here, would he or she like to make a comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#S04600","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528963200,"counter":663,"content":"<p>Maybe I can start with some kind of answer to that.  I am relatively new in the role of director general and in my understanding of the full scope of responsibilities and accountabilities in that role.  From my perspective and in my role, I need to be accountable and responsible for the performance of the system.  I understand the committee had a discussion at a past meeting about whether the previous director general was accountable and responsible for the actions of every single person inside the system.  The answer at that point was that it was going to be pretty hard to have such accountability and responsibility, given that people sometimes step out of the system.  The role of the director general and the board of the HSE, when it is established, is to make sure that a proper set of system controls and procedures is in place, that there is a safe system of working and that all of this is regularly monitored with good procedures.

In my experience, it is the setting of a date that prompts the settlement.  In terms of the 3% and the horrific cases we read about and the families involved in those cases, would it not be more appropriate for the State to deal with these matters more directly and with the admission of liability rather than expending hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of euro on an annual business saving face for individuals?  It may be that there is a report stating that individuals did not do anything wrong in accordance with procedure and medical practice, but ultimately the State is still coughing up large sums of money to compensate patients.  Where in this equation, from a taxpayers' money perspective or a patient care perspective, is it worthy of the State to pursue individuals through the courts and then finally settle on the steps of the court without admitting liability, which is often what happens?  To me, it seems horrific to do this to people.  I understand these are complex cases but, putting it mildly, this practice has to stop.  There must be a process of mediation before cases get to the courts so that these families do not have to go through that experience, not to mention the public moneys being expended in that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#V00600","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528963200,"counter":801,"content":"<p>I agree.

This is an inevitable situation in which we find ourselves at times.  Where settlement demands are so significant and beyond our professional estimate of what should be given we are compelled to go to court.  We do so because we have a duty to the taxpayer.  The 3% of cases that go to trial are cases where there would be a very fundamental liability point.  I will give another example.  Two weeks ago, we had a case which we requested be discontinued, based on our expert report prior to the trial.  We were willing to provide our expert report on why the case did not have merit yet the case progressed and was withdrawn after one day.  There are inevitable situations where this happens.<\/p> <p>  In cases of catastrophic injuries to infants, many are settled before court but they require to be ruled on by a court and, therefore, it appears that we are bringing a family into court but we are not.

Agreed.<\/p><p>The next item is No. 1352C (i) to (iii) from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 29 May 2018, provides information requested by the committee on alleged PRSI misclassification of employees.

The correspondent has been in touch with me and a number of other committee members.  We will meet one or two of the people who have asked for a meeting and return to the issue later.  We will not deal with this matter today.<\/p><p>No. 1356C (i) to (iii) is from an individual, dated 30 May 2018, enclosing copies of letters regarding the Irish Horse Welfare Trust in Wicklow sent to Deputy Andrew Doyle and the animal health and welfare division of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I propose we note the correspondence.  No. 1359C (i) to (iii) is correspondence from an individual, dated 31 May 2018, relating to an FOI request to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The committee is being copied on the correspondence which relates to road contracts and the disposal of waste.  We will note that.  We are not being asked to deal with anything as such but are being copied in on correspondence. <\/p><p>No. 1361C (i) to (ii) is correspondence from an individual, dated 4 June 2018, regarding evidence provided by officials of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment related to RT&Eacute; at the meeting of this committee on 3 May 2018.  The individual states that information given to the committee regarding a request by RT&Eacute; to the Broadcasting Authority for RT&Eacute; 2+1 to be included on the Sky platform was not correct.  The individual also sent a copy of this correspondence to Ms Cronin of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Ms Cronin has written directly to the committee, as per item No. 1374C, dated 11 June, on the matter.  Ms Cronin explains the process followed and apologises for the lack of clarity which may have risen.  I am not satisfied with that correspondence and have a proposal to make in that regard.  I raised an issue at the meeting in question.  RT&Eacute; representatives were talking about the commercial situation and I asked why RT&Eacute; 2+1 was not on the Sky platform.  The witness from the Department gave the impression that a request had been received but would have to go to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, first.  I asked what stage the application was at and was told that it was with the BAI.  An individual who was watching proceedings carefully felt that what was said was not true and submitted an FOI request to the BAI which confirmed that it had received no such application.  The letter from the Department does not correct the record.  Evidence was given in public by a very senior assistant secretary of a Department that was not accurate.  We had a similar issue this morning and brought the people involved before us.  While I do not propose that we go to that stage on this issue, we would not have known about it were it not for a vigilant member of the public contacting us to tell us what was said was incorrect.  That has been proven to be the case.  In the meantime, the assistant secretary has written to the committee to explain the background and context but has not corrected the record.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#KK01400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1528963200,"counter":911,"content":"<p>Is there any sanction for people who come in here and make false statements?

I put in a parliamentary question the other day and received a written answer on Tuesday night.  The Minister said, however, that to date he has not received any formal proposal from RT&Eacute; requesting permission to transmit an RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel.  In the D&aacute;il on Wednesday night, the Minister said no such proposal had been lodged.  Both RT&Eacute; and the Department allowed the discussion to take place as to where the process was.  I gather that informal discussions may have taken place but a formal proposal was never made so I am asking RT&Eacute; to clarify its position.  Specifically, I want to ask it if there is such a thing as an RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel, because somebody has told me it does not even exist yet, never mind being on the Sky platform.  We want the record to be corrected and we do not want there to be a lot of beating around the bush, referring to context and background, etc.  What was said on the record was not accurate and it is to be corrected and apologised for.  We will accept it in good faith if we get straight answers.

We have had previous correspondence with the committee.  We also made a submission in March 2017.  The budget amounts to almost &euro;1 billion of health spending per annum.  The way the State spends that budget effectively means that HSE nursing homes are being paid fees that are, on average, 60% higher than those payable in respect of residents in the private and voluntary sector.  In some instances, the fees in respect of residents in HSE nursing homes are four times those provided for residents in the private and voluntary sector.  That is outlined in detail in appendix 1.  In excess of 70% of private and voluntary nursing homes are small family-run, owner-operated business with fewer than 60 beds.  Independent analysis provided to the Department of Health described the scheme as operating in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>manner, lacking rationale, consistency and fairness, only applying to the private sector and in the long run being unsustainable.<\/p><p>The NTPF is abusing its dominance as a monopoly purchaser, threatening the viability of the private and voluntary nursing home sector.  Last week, HIQA, the independent regulator, informed of the voluntary closure of five nursing homes during 2017 due to financial concerns.  Its report states: &quot;There are examples of certain smaller nursing homes &ndash; which provide a more homely environment &ndash; closing voluntarily due to concerns over the financial viability of running such services.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Private and voluntary nursing homes provide care in a home from home to more than 23,000 residents throughout the country.  Nursing homes are an essential part of our health service, providing care in the community in line with Government and cross-party support, as presented in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Four in ten applications for the fair deal scheme are from persons in acute hospitals.  Each year, almost 9,000 people, which is an average of 800 per month, avail of transitional care in private and voluntary nursing homes.  Without our sector, acute hospitals would grind to a halt.<br\/><br\/>HIQA's report last week stated, &quot;nursing home providers are committed to excellence and striving continuously to improve the quality of their services&quot;.  Furthermore, the regulator stated, &quot;inspectors met and spoke with many people who use services and found that they were well looked after by competent and caring staff&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Our members are tasked with providing care under the fair deal scheme for fees that are, on average, 60% less than those payable to HSE counterparts.  It is a fact that one third of the fair deal budget is allocated to State nursing homes that provide 20% of capacity.  The fees in respect of HSE nursing homes are not subject to independent scrutiny.  There is no negotiation process, no scrutiny of expenditure and no transparency, and there is long delayed and infrequent publication of those fees.<br\/><br\/>Another anomaly I bring to the attention of the committee is the myriad costs, including but not limited to capital costs and commercial rates, that are not included in the publicly published fees.  Appendix 2 contains the statutory instrument, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the commencement of the scheme.  The HSE, as administrator of the scheme, in effect pays the nursing homes under its control whatever fee it deems appropriate.<br\/><br\/>The most recent publication of HSE fees in February this year revealed the disparity in fees between HSE and private nursing homes has increased from 53% to 60%.  Over the 16 month period from October 2016 to February 2018, the fees in the HSE or State sector increased by an average of 11%.  Over the corresponding period, the increase in private and voluntary nursing homes was on average 3.9%.  Analysis of the most recent data informs the extent of this disparity.  Appendix 1 outlines the examples of County Westmeath, where the fee differential is 163%, County Laois where it is 122% and County Longford where it is 115%.<br\/><br\/>There has been some admission by the State that the cost of care in public nursing homes requires deeper analysis.  The review of the fair deal scheme, published in July 2015 and commissioned by the Department of Health, recommended a value for money review be undertaken by the Department with regard to public nursing home costs.  The review recommended actions and timelines to address any cost distorting factors that cannot be attributed to inherent differences between the public and the private sectors.  That was in 2015, more than three years ago.  Speaking to the committee in March last year, representatives of the HSE committed to the review being undertaken in 2017.  It remains outstanding.  In April 2018, the Minister for Health informed the D&aacute;il of the value for money analysis and stated the Department would work on the analysis throughout 2018.  We highlight that accountability and transparency remain outstanding with the continued delay of the value for money review.<br\/><br\/>The gross inequity in the funding of nursing home care is threatening the viability of the private sector and I mentioned the five nursing homes that closed last year.  The Department of Health's DKM Economic Consultants report, published in 2015, stated the fair deal pricing model &quot;operates in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>manner, lacks rationale, consistency and fairness, only applies to the private sector, and in the long run is unsustainable&quot;.  This is the pricing model set by the NTPF, whose representatives will appear before the committee after this session.  Of stark concern, the report warns: &quot;It is untenable that the State quality regulator can assess differentiated dependency levels and in doing so impose costs on nursing homes, while the State price regulator (NTPF) claims it is unable to reflect the same factor in its pricing decisions&quot;.<br\/><br\/>When the fair deal scheme commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The review was published six years later, in 2015.  It pointed to the NTPF in its methodology used historical prices and, on many occasions, geographical location to set fees.  It stated there was a requirement for a review of the system to be undertaken within an 18 month period.  Thirty-three months on from this recommendation, and nine years after the introduction of the fair deal scheme, this pricing review of the scheme remains outstanding.  This is evidence of prevarication by the NTPF, inexcusable delays and a lack of transparency from what is, in essence, a public body.<br\/><br\/>To say our members are frustrated would be an understatement.  We reiterate our call for the publication by the NTPF and the Department of Health of the pricing review.  In Appendix 5 of our submission we have outlined what we argue are some pertinent questions the committee may consider appropriate for the NTPF in the afternoon session.  Our members are under sustained pressure to sustain services.  It is unsustainable and untenable that the State tasks private and voluntary nursing homes with providing this specialist care for such low fees, which are, on average, 60% below those applied by their HSE counterparts.  The inequity in the fair deal scheme is compounded by the fact there is no independent appeals process in the NTPF.  This effectively means the NTPF, acting on behalf of the State, can adopt a take it or leave it approach with regard to fees to provide care regardless of the consequences.<br\/><br\/>The fair deal scheme is explicit and definitive in defining the goods and services covered.  It explicitly excludes a range of services, therapies, specialised wheelchairs, transport and social activities that are essential to support the health, well-being and day-to-day living of nursing home residents.  In Appendix 3 of our submission we have included the extract from the NTPF deed of agreement which our members are required to sign to be party to the scheme.  Nursing homes are obliged to provide certain services that are explicitly outside the definition of long-term residential care services.  Accordingly, it is appropriate for nursing homes to charge for services provided that are outside the definition.  All charges for services excluded under the fair deal scheme are detailed in the contract for care and agreed with the individual resident on admission to the nursing home, as required by regulations.  The regulatory requirements stipulate registered providers must ensure that contracts of care are clear, unambiguous and contain full details of the services to be provided and any charges.  Our guiding principles as an organisation commit our members to clarity, openness and transparency with regard to all fees and charges.<br\/><br\/>It is also a fact that there is discriminatory or limited access to medical card services for residents in private and voluntary nursing homes.  When people cross the threshold of a private nursing home the services they would ordinarily hold on to in their community are no longer available.  This is discrimination of older people on the basis of where they reside, which is, in essence, their home.<br\/><br\/>The NTPF, as a monopoly purchaser, adopts a take it or leave it approach to negotiations.  The Department of Health review informed that pricing is set on historical and geographical determinants and, as I stated, there is no independent appeals process.  We acknowledge and respect the role fulfilled by the HSE in nursing home care and the dedicated staff in the public service.  However, very serious questions arise surrounding transparency, accountability and fair allocation of funds for the provision of care in HSE nursing homes.<br\/><br\/>That the Government committed to a review of the system for pricing is an acknowledgement that the current pricing system is not fit for purpose.  Appendix 4 of our submission sets out the terms of reference for the pricing review.  The committee will note that according to one of the terms of reference, the deadline for completion was 1 June 2017, which is more than one year ago.<br\/><br\/>The minutes of the meeting of the working group to oversee the recommendations confirm that Deloitte and Prospectus provided a draft pricing report to the Department in June 2017.  The minutes further confirm that the NTPF requested a revised draft to be produced, and confirm that the revised draft has been received by the NTPF and is being considered by it.  This draft report has not been published.  We are concerned about the delay in publishing the report.<br\/><br\/>The harsh reality is that the State wants to fund care for residents in the private and voluntary nursing home sector for fees that are significantly less than what it costs the State to provide such care.  Critically, policymakers need to ensure the system strikes a balance between value for money and acknowledging the costs and ensuring the sustainability of the private and voluntary sector.  While the private and voluntary sector is characterised by committed and resilient providers and staff, it is undoubtedly the case that failure to acknowledge the true cost of care threatens the sustainability of current provision.  Transparency must be applied to HSE expenditure.  We welcome the committee's examination of NTPF and wish it well with its work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#MM02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528963200,"counter":975,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Daly very much for that comprehensive statement.<\/p> <p>  Speakers have indicated in the following sequence: Deputy MacSharry, Catherine Murphy, Cassells and Connolly.

The nursing home sector is important.  As Mr. Daly stated, hospitals would effectively grind to a halt if the sector did not operate efficiently.  When one considers that 30,000 people call one of the 458 private or voluntary facilities or the 122 public facilities home, it crystalises how important the sector is.<\/p> <p>  That 79% of facilities are private makes the points the witnesses have articulated for us all the more important in how we tease out the funding mechanisms.  In the HSE's 2016 accounts some &euro;900 million was allocated for nursing home support schemes.  From a public expenditure point of view, the Comptroller and Auditor General would be interested in examining how that nearly &euro;1 billion was spent and, if there were significant disparities in the funding models, determining how to go about addressing them.  The facts outlined by the witnesses speak for themselves and show the major disparities.  Under the fair deal scheme, a private provider has an average spend of &euro;35,000 versus an average spend of &euro;71,000 in the public sphere.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Marc MacSharry touched on the issue of geography.  The methodology is similar to that used to fund local authorities.  It is difficult to work out from the graph on screen.  The Deputy used the example of Dublin versus Sligo and cited land costs.  In my county of Meath there is an average weekly cost of &euro;1,600 in the public sector versus &euro;2,200 in the adjoining county of Westmeath, which is difficult to understand.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Daly touched on the type of care provided.  According to his opening statement, many people with dementia were refused admission to HSE-operated facilities because they were \"not independently mobile\".  If those with the most pressing and complex needs find themselves in private nursing homes and public homes are being funded to the tune of twice what private providers are receiving, how does it impact on the quality of care provision by and the resources available to private providers?  I am interested in hearing his views on how such homes are even surviving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#QQ01300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528963200,"counter":1059,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.

They are only caring for 20% of residents.  That means that 80% are in voluntary and private nursing homes.  That is very unfair and the figures Mr. Daly is throwing out do not sound right to me.  One third of all the money that is being spent is going towards 20% of the care.  That means two thirds is going to 80% of the care.  Straight away there is something wrong and there are questions marks over that.  In my own county of Kilkenny, there is one nursing home and eight voluntary and private homes.  I get representation on a continuous basis from the private nursing homes in my area, which is natural being a local politician.  The voluntary sector has to fundraise.  I know that because there are one or two of them very near to me.  I give towards the fundraising as well because it is just to keep the doors open.  This sounds very wrong.  One nursing home in Kilkenny costs &euro;1,596 per week while in the voluntary and private sectors, it costs &euro;901 per week.  That is almost &euro;600 of a difference, or 77%, according to the chart in front of us.  That is massive money.

Mr. Daly has raised more concerns for the Committee of Public Accounts today than he has dealt with questions.  I note instances where a witness appears before the committee, even in a voluntary capacity, and they do not answer questions.  There is a very real public interest in this issue.  The content of this meeting has been reported in the media several times, and Mr. Daly had an opportunity today to clear up some issues.  He could have said that the word \"boycott\" was not used, if indeed it was not.  That would have cleared that up.  However, he is not in a position to do so, which I think speaks volumes.  I think we will have to come back to it at some point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#VV03700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1528963200,"counter":1347,"content":"<p>I want to conclude because of the late hour.

He might summarise it as best he can because of the late hour.  Before he does so, I will ask him two questions, on which he can come back in writing to the committee.  I am not going to take up the committee's time.  I refer first to the waiting list initiative, which is detailed on page 16 of the NTPF's accounts.  The NTPF has done a lot of work on orthopaedics, ear, nose and throat, ENT, general surgery, and the waiting list initiative.  I ask the witnesses to come back and tell us how much of this was done in private hospitals.  I understand that in the past some of it could be done in public hospitals.  I ask the witnesses to give us the breakdown of this, the details of the waiting lists for these people and, to the extent that the witnesses can, because I know an average is only an average, the average cost of the treatments under orthopaedics, whether a hip, a knee or anything else, and the average cost for ENT and ophthalmic procedures on cataracts.  We all know awfully old people who come to our clinics and who have no quality of life.  I am sure the procedure only costs a grand or two.  I do not know the figures.  The witnesses need not provide the figures now, but I ask them to give us a full breakdown of how that money is spent.  There is a crying demand from people who have been on waiting lists for a long time for some detailed information on this.  The witnesses can get us the full breakdown in their own time and as soon as practical.  We would appreciate that.  If we have any further requests for information after we receive that reply, we can come back to the witnesses in writing at that stage.<\/p><p>Mr. Fitzgerald, who is the assistant national director for older people and palliative care, might send me, as Chairman, or the secretariat a detailed report on where we are in respect of Abbeyleix District Hospital.  He has been in contact with the people there.  A decision was announced years ago to close the hospital.  This has not happened, it is still there, and I hope the facility can be kept in public use long into the future.  All I am asking Mr. Fitzgerald is to send a detailed note by way of up-do-date information to me.<\/p><p>I am looking for Deputy Aylward, who was due to take over from me.

The National Treatment Purchase Fund, often referred to as the NTPF, was established in April 2004.  The NTPF board is an independent body operating under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The board's financial statements before the committee in this session relate to the financial year 2016.  The audit of the board's 2017 financial statements is scheduled to commence in July of this year.<\/p> <p>  The role and focus of the NTPF has evolved over time, reflecting changes in policy and available funding.  The original remit of the NTPF required it to make arrangements for the provision of hospital treatment, either within or outside the State, for patients on long-term waiting lists and to collect and validate information about patients waiting for public hospital treatment.<\/p> <p>  In 2009, the NTPF acquired responsibility for negotiating and agreeing payment rates with private and voluntary nursing homes for the provision of residential home care for older people being supported under the fair deal scheme.  Responsibility for the administration of the fair deal scheme rests with the HSE.<\/p> <p>  In 2012, the NTPF moved away substantially from the direct commissioning of patient treatment and put more focus on data and analytics, pricing, and audit and quality assurance.  The board reduced its staffing levels to reflect its changing role and the reduction in annual budgets.  In 2015 and 2016, the NTPF provided administrative support to the HSE by disbursing payments to private hospitals providing patient treatment for the longest-waiting public patients.<\/p> <p>  In 2016, the NTPF received funding of almost &euro;29 million to pay for patient care and &euro;5.1 million for its other activities.  The NTPF reported an operating deficit of around &euro;320,000 for the year.<\/p> <p>  The graph now being shown to members profiles the changes in the National Treatment Purchase Fund's spend over the years 2012 to 2016.  Patient care expenditure accounted for around 89% of the NTPF's expenditure in 2016.  The balance, 11%, related to administration expenses.<\/p> <p>  The primary focus of the patient care expenditure in 2016 related to the provision of treatment in orthopaedic cases, at around 43%; ear, nose and throat cases, 14%; and general surgery cases, 12%.  The balance, 31%, covered a range of treatments.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the NTPF's financial statements for 2016.  The report draws attention, however, to the NTPF's accounting treatment of staff pension benefits.  The legislation establishing the NTPF gives the Minister for Health the authority to set the accounting framework for the board.  In doing so, the Minister directed that pension benefits should be accounted for as they are paid, rather than as liabilities accrue, which is what generally accepted accounting practice requires.  As I have explained previously to the committee, this accounting treatment for pensions is common to a number of health bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#WW01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1528963200,"counter":1358,"content":"<p>I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General.

While not wishing to delve too much into the history of the organisation it is worth noting that in its first decade as an independent agency, the NTPF succeeded in reducing inpatient waiting times for public patients from their original levels of two to five years - depending on the category - down to an average waiting time of 2.5 months.  This was achieved through the direct commissioning of patient-level treatment for public patients by the NTPF - mostly in private hospitals.<\/p> <p>  In 2012 the Government assigned additional responsibilities to the NTPF and effectively signalled the end of the organisation&rsquo;s direct patient treatment commissioning role.  It also reflected a major resulting change in the operational framework of the NTPF, as this commissioning work had represented a significant part of the activity of the NTPF since its inception, as we have seen in the presentation by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The result was that the organisation re-focused its efforts on areas such as data and analytics, audit and quality assurance and its role in respect of the nursing home support scheme, which was referred to earlier.  Through these, the organisation continued to provide valuable support services to the broader healthcare system at a time when it was undergoing significant change and reform.<\/p> <p>  In 2014 a new NTPF board was appointed, one of the first selected under the Public Appointments Service process.  This board has a wide range of skills covering areas such as medical, legal, accounting, IT, procurement, personnel and general management.  While continuing to oversee the ongoing operations of the organisation, at that time this board applied itself particularly to the task of preparing the organisation through the development of a detailed strategy and action plan, all aimed at supporting performance improvement for the faster treatment of patients.  The outcome of this work meant that the NTPF was well placed to support the commitments contained in A Programme for a Partnership Government of 2016 in the specific funding allocated to the organisation to reduce waiting lists in 2017 and 2018.<\/p> <p>  On foot of the decision of the then Minister for Health in 2016 to re-establish the individual patient-level commissioning role of the NTPF and, importantly, with the allocation of the enabling funding, the organisation is particularly well placed now to make an increased positive and valuable contribution again towards shorter waiting times for patients.  I say this with confidence based on the organisation's proven track record of having done so in the past.  It is also based on what has been achieved more recently - in the past 12 months.  The outline of the organisation's objectives is contained in my written statement, which has been provided to the committee.<\/p> <p>  In order to deliver on the requirements placed on the organisation under the programme for Government 2016 the NTPF budget was increased to &euro;20 million last year, with a further &euro;55 million committed for the current year.  I am pleased to report that we have successfully resumed commissioning of patient treatment and that detailed arrangements are in place with private hospitals for this work.  An in-sourcing initiative was also undertaken to treat patients in public hospitals for specific procedures and treatments.  Through this process - and using &euro;5 million of the &euro;15 million allocated to us for patient treatment work in 2017 - day-case patients were brought into the system and more were then placed on treatment pathways in private hospitals.  A further tranche of funding was then committed to an in-sourcing initiative under which up to &euro;5 million was provided for treating patients in public hospitals.  In the second half of 2017 a third phase of spending was decided upon based on our experience with the first two private and public elements.<\/p> <p>  A specific target was that the active inpatient and day-case waiting list numbers would be less than 9,153.  At the end of October the number was down to 7,282.  We aimed to remove 7,000 patients from this list through acceptance of offers of treatment funded by the NTPF and a total of 8,192 people were removed from the list.  It was proposed that 700 of the longest-waiting patients would be treated from the gastrointestinal scope waiting list and as a result of our initiative, 1,382 patients were removed.  These are just figures but in human terms each one of these patients, and their families, have had their pain and suffering dealt with at an earlier date and have been enabled to get on with their lives.<\/p> <p>  Importantly, from the perspective of the Committee of Public Accounts, the NTPF can identify each patient and the precise treatment that he or she received.  We can assure this committee that value for money was achieved and that despite the funding allocation being small in the context of the overall spend on health, a real impact was made.  Our decisions on the specific uses for the current year's funding allocation of &euro;50 million for patient treatment were informed by our experiences with last year's approach.  By the end of this year, the organisation will have arranged treatment for a further 20,000 inpatient and day-case patients.  NTPF-funded treatment is being provided in private hospitals or in public hospitals where there is available capacity.  The focus will be on those waiting longest, for around 50 different procedures.<\/p> <p>  To date, in 2018, the NTPF has made arrangements for almost 9,000 inpatient and day-case patients and this has contributed to the number on the inpatient and day-case waiting list, reducing by a further 3,000 in the first five months of 2018, despite the challenges posed earlier in the year by Storm Emma.  The number on this waiting list is currently 7,500 lower than at its peak ten months ago, a reduction of 9% on the list.<\/p> <p>  Earlier, I mentioned the nursing home support scheme - the fair deal scheme - which was established in 2009.  The NTPF was given a specific key role on the pricing of long-term residential care.  Given the significant sums of public moneys, of the order of &euro;1 billion, being allocated to this scheme, this matter will be of particular interest to the members of this committee.  While the NTPF&rsquo;s role is very precisely defined and quite limited, through the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act the organisation was given a vitally important task for the users of the system and for national finances.  Specifically, the NTPF is mandated by statute to negotiate with nursing home proprietors for the purposes of reaching an agreement as to the maximum amount that will be charged for the provision of specified long-term residential care services.  I am happy to be able to record that the NTPF has delivered consistently on this mandate over the past eight years.  The organisation has done this by setting up the system of agreeing prices, which had not existed previously, by successfully negotiating and agreeing prices with approximately 430 nursing homes and by renegotiating and updating these prices on a fully negotiated basis with each nursing home over the years of the operation of the scheme.  By the end of April 2018, more than 430 nursing homes had pricing contracts with the NTPF and the average price of long-term residential care paid to these nursing homes amounted to &euro;955 per resident per week.<\/p> <p>  Another key figure is that these nursing homes are providing care to 17,500 fair deal residents.  On behalf of the organisation, I assure members of this committee that the NTPF will continue its work to ensure that value is achieved for the taxpayer and that the substantial funds being made available to the fair deal scheme are maximised for the benefit of those assessed as being in need of long-term residential care.<\/p> <p>  The review of the nursing home support scheme has been discussed with the other group.  Any proposals to amend a successful system benefitting the 17,500 residents and involving State expenditure of close to &euro;900 million should be very carefully scrutinised and considered.  The NTPF is currently working in the first instance with the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform in a review to ensure that viable and effective systems continue to be provided for both providers and users of long-term residential care nationwide.  I assure the committee that the NTPF has undertaken this task with all the due diligence that would be expected of us.  Our overriding concern throughout the process has been to provide the best possible inputs to the steering group, which includes the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.  This group will, in turn, bring its proposals to a broader working group that will include officials from the Department of the Taoiseach and the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>  When the review was initiated by the Department of Health, it was recognised by it that the NTPF would require professional and independent costing and other technical and relevant expertise to inform our review of pricing.  We have been working with Deloitte on this and it has consulted a wide range of stakeholders and interested parties.  Their work is close to completion and these matters will be considered by the steering group in the near future.<\/p> <p>  The remainder of my written statement contains information on the NTPF annual accounts, which are a matter of record and I am sure we can get into in more detail on those later.  As the chairman of the NTPF board, I wish to reassure members that our objective is to ensure the National Treatment Purchase Fund continues to be well directed and managed in accordance with all appropriate governance requirements.  We have a cohort of skilled board members, a committed executive team and employees giving us a base of significant experience and skills.  Our aim is to ensure that all of the functions allocated to us by Government are carried out effectively and efficiently and that we will continue to be in a position to demonstrate that all funding voted to the organisation is being spent as intended to reduce waiting times for patients in the public healthcare system.  I thank the Acting Chairman and members of the committee.  The members of the executive and I will gladly take any questions members may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#XX00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Horan"},{"type":"speech","time":1528963200,"counter":1362,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Horan.

To me that does not sound fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#DDD01300","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528963200,"counter":1669,"content":"<p>Certainly, it would not be fair if it was the case that a person was in a residential care centre and, therefore, we were not providing that requirement to the person.  Certainly, that is not our position.  I was in the Gallery and heard that stated several times.  I would be most concerned if that was happening.<\/p> <p>  I wish to point out that when a person is in residential care, whether the set-up is public, private or voluntary, the person is being provided with 24-hour care and with a level of service.  These people are no longer able to stay in their own homes.  Let us suppose a person receives primary care services through the medical card or whatever and is provided with therapies and so on.  Those services are available at a certain level.  The service is a scarce resource.  The service provider will be concentrating on those people who are residing alone, perhaps.  Such interventions might keep people at home for longer.  The fact that a person is in long-stay care, regardless of the centre and whether it is public, private or voluntary, means that person is less of a risk because of the 24-hour care and service provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#DDD01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1528963200,"counter":1670,"content":"<p>It is one thing to be less of a risk but another if a person needs treatment.

There should be no discrimination for a person because that person is in residential care, especially if the person has a need for a service.  The fact that a person is in residential care should not mean he or she should not get the services.  That is what I am saying.  I agree with that.  I am simply saying that if an occupational therapist has a long waiting list, in fairness, the people he or she is more likely to look after are those who are at home.  It would be a natural thing for the service provider to do that.  That would be a clinical call.  Let us suppose a person is in a residential care setting and needs a service.  Is there sufficient capacity to provide that service for everyone?  That is another question.  There may not be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018061400002#DDD01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1528963200,"counter":1672,"content":"<p>We have had a long discussion.
