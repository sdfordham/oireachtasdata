I look forward to working with his successor in due course, once the nomination process has been completed.<\/p>  <p>  The meeting with Secretary Tillerson was conducted in a warm and constructive atmosphere, as befits the relationship between our two countries. <\/p>  <p>  While we discussed a wide range of bilateral and global issues, the Deputy will appreciate from her own time as T&aacute;naiste that much of the detail of such discussions must, by its nature, remain confidential. <\/p>  <p>  I am happy however, to confirm to the Deputy that amongst the topics which we discussed were the plight of undocumented Irish citizens living in the United States, the appointment of a new US ambassador to Ireland, the situation in the Middle-East, Brexit and the situation in Northern Ireland, including the possible appointment of a US Special Envoy.<\/p>  <p>  On the undocumented, I reiterated once more the priority which the Irish Government attaches to achieving a solution for our citizens and to finding greater legal pathways for migration from Ireland to the United States. As the Deputy will be aware, the issue was also subsequently discussed by the Taoiseach and President Trump when they met in the Oval Office on March 15 last.  Our efforts to find a solution, working with the Administration and with our friends on Capitol Hill, and with the Government&rsquo;s Special Envoy to the US Congress on the Undocumented, Deputy John Deasy, will continue.<\/p>  <p>  On the broader Ireland-US relationship, I indicated to the Secretary of State how well-received the appointment of a new US Ambassador to Ireland in the near future would be and how it is seen as a very important position in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  I updated Secretary Tillerson on the current situation in Northern Ireland. In particular, I indicated that we would welcome the appointment of a Special Envoy for Northern Ireland by the US Administration, as part of its continuing support for the Peace Process. <\/p>  <p>  I also briefed the Secretary of State on the EU-UK Brexit negotiations, emphasising Ireland&rsquo;s continued commitment to the EU and our opposition to a hard border on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We discussed the Middle East Peace Process, an issue to which I have attached a high priority as Minister for Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade, as I have reported to the House previously.

I am particularly concerned by the impact of the recent fighting in the Afrin region, including the displacement of over 100,000 civilians. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly welcomed the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2401 calling for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access on 24 February. Ireland regrets that this has not yet been implemented and calls on the international community to redouble efforts to ensure the immediate and full implementation.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department met with the Turkish Ambassador to Ireland in early February, shortly after the commencement of the Turkish operation. They conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s overarching concern for the protection of civilians, including in the context of this particular operation, and urged caution to avoid escalating the conflict any further. <\/p>  <p>  Moreover, at the EU-Turkey leaders&rsquo; meeting in Varna on Monday, the EU informed President Erdogan of the EU&rsquo;s concern regarding Turkey&rsquo;s actions in Syria, in particular the situation in Afrin. They stressed that escalating violence and displacement in an already tragic and volatile situation must be avoided. They also emphasised Turkey&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure the protection of civilians and the delivery of humanitarian assistance to all those in need.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU understand Turkey&rsquo;s concern about the conflict raging on its southern border. Turkey has borne a heavy burden in terms of knock-on effects of the conflict, including in terms of migration and spill-over of violence. However, our primary concern is for the safety and well-being of civilians on both sides of the border, especially displaced and vulnerable communities. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a long-standing supporter of the UNHCR which has been providing humanitarian assistance in response to the developing crisis in the Afrin region. Ireland provided core funding of &euro;7.5 million to UNHCR in 2017. Core funding enables UNHCR to respond efficiently and effectively where assistance is most needed, including in response to sudden displacement emergencies. Ireland has also provided over &euro;7 million to UNHCR specifically for its response to the Syria crisis since 2012. <\/p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to reiterate my call on all parties to exercise restraint in order to avoid any further exacerbation of this already fragile situation, and to cooperate in the effort to find a political solution under UN auspices. This alone can bring lasting peace to Syria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800070#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Issues","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800070#WRC00600"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[14022\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800070#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of the funding of &euro;100,000 available to community and voluntary organisations to promote dialogue on the future of Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":19,"content":"<p>The funding to which the Deputy refers is the Communicating Europe Initiative.

The vast majority of the TCOs will be on a 26 week contract. The Passport Service commenced recruitment in October and November of last year for the intake of TCOs for this year.  This intake commenced in early January, and all of the TCOs will be in place by the end of March. The allocation of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) staff assigned to the Passport Service as of 1 January this year is 322.  This is an increase of 7% on the previous year.

I am pleased to advise that 20 more newly appointed, permanent staff have joined the Passport Service since 1 January. Targeted overtime for the Passport Service was also sanctioned to increase processing capacity.   In managing increasing application volumes, my Department&rsquo;s approach has not been merely to recruit or assign additional staff, but to continue to implement service improvements in order to provide an exceptional service and minimise the impact exceptionally high application volumes have on turnaround times.  The Passport Reform Programme is delivering major upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements.  The award winning online passport application service, which was launched last year, will continue to make a major contribution to the effective management of exceptionally high volumes by allowing existing resources to be more effectively deployed within the Passport Service.

The situation in Syria is indeed unconscionable, and I take this opportunity to reiterate my unreserved condemnation of the barbarous violence against civilians that has been the hallmark of this conflict to date. The brutal repression of dissent by the Assad regime, which has included use of chemical weapons and medieval &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; tactics, has cost the lives of over 400,000 people. It has led to a situation in which 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, 3 million people are trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas, over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region. The recent increase in violence, in particular the vicious siege of Eastern Ghouta, underscores the extent to which an end to the violence is urgently needed in order to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254, which calls for an end to violence; release of political prisoners; formation of a transitional governing body with executive powers and a constitutional reform process. The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. <\/p>  <p>  I attended the UN Security Council briefing on Eastern Ghouta in New York last month at which UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres appealed for an immediate suspension of violence in Eastern Ghouta to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid, and for evacuations. Ireland strongly welcomed the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2401 calling for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access on 24 February. However, the regime&rsquo;s bombardment of civilians and civilian infrastructure, including homes, hospitals and schools, has continued in defiance of this resolution. There have even been reports of further chemical attacks in recent weeks. The international community must redouble efforts to press for the immediate and full implementation of the ceasefire, and unimpeded humanitarian access to populations in need.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland provides political and financial support to a broad range of measures to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria. This includes the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism established by the UN General Assembly to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes under international law committed in Syria, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria established by the Human Rights Council, and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Fact Finding Mission and Joint Investigative Mission with the UN. Ireland co-sponsored a resolution at the UN Human Rights Council earlier this month that requested the Commission of Inquiry to urgently conduct an investigation into the recent events in Eastern Ghouta. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures. The relevant working groups in Brussels keep the impact of sanctions under review and propose options to address any unintended negative impacts where they are identified. For example, in 2016 the EU amended the Syria sanctions regime to make it easier for NGOs operating in Syria to buy fuel. In 2017, EU Member States including Ireland consulted with NGOs to identify any further difficulties they were experiencing in carrying out humanitarian work in Syria that may have been linked to the sanctions. Based on the feedback of the NGOs, the European Commission published a Frequently Asked Questions document to clarify certain provisions of the sanctions identified as unclear by NGOs, as well as the humanitarian exemptions and derogations. More recently, last month EU Member States undertook to consider the preparation of best practice guidelines on humanitarian exemptions, with a view to further facilitating the work of NGOs participating in the humanitarian response to the crisis in Syria.<\/p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Syria at their informal meeting on 15 February and again at the Foreign Affairs Council meetings on 26 February and 19 March. The EU and its Member States have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.4 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort. The EU hosted a donor conference for Syria in April 2017 at which pledges totalling &euro;5.6 billion were made, and will host another donor conference for Syria in April 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;95 million to the humanitarian effort in response to the conflict in Syria, including &euro;25 million in 2017 alone. Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the Syria crisis.

Maintaining frequent bilateral contact with EU partners is also a priority, both at political and official level. Such meetings provide an opportunity to communicate Ireland&rsquo;s priorities, including in relation to agriculture, with a view to shaping the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position with regard to the draft Withdrawal Agreement, including its Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as the EU&rsquo;s approach to framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  As concerns my personal engagement with the Taskforce, I have met with Michel Barnier in advance of both the February and March meetings of the General Affairs Council (Art. 50). These efforts are yielding clear results. The Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is an integral part of the draft Withdrawal Agreement currently being negotiated between the EU and the UK, sets out in legal terms the backstop arrangement. It allows for full alignment with those rules of the EU's internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the Good Friday Agreement.  As set out in Article 5 of the draft Protocol, this arrangement would include alignment with the provisions of Union law on sanitary and phytosanitary rules as well as provisions of Union law on the production and marketing of agricultural and fisheries products.   It has always been intended that the backstop will apply unless and until another solution is found. In this regard, the Government shares the UK&rsquo;s preference to resolve these issues through the wider agreement on the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK. I look forward to seeing the UK&rsquo;s detailed proposals in this regard, and to considering proposals on specific solutions. I also welcome the Guidelines on the future EU-UK relationship which were adopted by the European Council last week, which confirm the EU&rsquo;s readiness to initiate work towards a balanced, ambitious and wide-ranging free trade agreement (FTA) insofar as there are sufficient guarantees for a level playing field. The EU proposes that such an agreement should cover all sectors, including agriculture, and should address, inter alia, disciplines on technical barriers to trade (TBT) and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and a framework for voluntary regulatory cooperation.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit is an issue that naturally arises during the frequent bilateral contacts which I, my Government colleagues and our officials have with our UK counterparts. While stressing that Ireland is a member of the EU27 and that the issues involved can only be substantively considered and addressed through the ongoing EU-UK negotiations, such opportunities provide an opportunity to build the UK&rsquo;s understanding of Ireland&rsquo;s concerns and priorities with regard to the Irish-specific issues as well as the future EU-UK relationship, including in the area of agriculture. <\/p>  <p>  In recent months, I have had numerous engagement with British Ministers.

Minister Creed has also met with his counterpart, Secretary of State Gove, during the course of his St Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit to London.

The campaign leading to the vote in 2020 is well under way.  Member States normally signal their intention to seek election many years in advance.

Based on these Directives, Michel Barnier reported to the GAC (Art.50) on 20 March that agreement had been reached at the level of negotiators on the text of transition in the draft Withdrawal Agreement. The European Council on 23 March welcomed this agreement but made clear that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that all issues in the draft Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, need to be agreed to ensure progress in the negotiations.  <\/p><p>I welcome that the terms reflected in the draft Withdrawal Agreement are fully consistent with the EU&rsquo;s objective of agreeing a transition period based on the status quo. This is an approach that I strongly advocated as it will provide certainty and limit disruption for our citizens and businesses. Under such an arrangement the UK will be expected to continue to apply the full EU acquis.<\/p><p>As concerns the duration of such a transition, the Government agrees that in the interests of long term certainty, and to accelerate agreement on the future relationship agreement, it must be time bound. This is the overall view of both the EU and of the UK.  Therefore a date of 31 December 2020 has been set for the end of the transition period and this has been reflected in the text of the draft Withdrawal Agreement. This also takes account of the EU&rsquo;s budgetary processes and the fact that the current Multiannual Financial Framework will conclude at the end of 2020. But equally, as the negotiations progress, the overriding objective on both sides must be to avoid any gaps and any cliff edge effects.

Holding elections is a key element of the Action Plan, and must be a priority for resolving Libya&rsquo;s political fragmentation. There have been some positive signs on voter registration, with 2.5 million Libyans now eligible to vote, and, notably, a strong participation rate by women. I hope that this can be translated into a high turnout in the elections. However, I understand the concerns of those who caution that holding elections precipitately may complicate, rather than expedite, a lasting political solution to Libya&rsquo;s governance crisis. Indeed, the UN Special Representative is conscious that there is much work to be done to lay the ground for credible elections, as he expressed in his briefing to the UN Security Council last week.   Specifically, there are significant logistical challenges to holding elections in a country where armed groups control large swathes of territory, and where serious security threats persist. In addition, there are a number of constitutional and legislative measures that need to be resolved. Finally, there must be a commitment by all parties to accept the outcome of the elections. <\/p>  <p>  As I have stated previously in the House, I am deeply troubled by the abuses perpetrated against migrants in Libya. My EU colleagues and I have raised these concerns on a number of occasions at the Foreign Affairs Council, as did the Taoiseach at the European Council in October. I call on the Libyan Government, and all parties, including those with de facto control of territory, to take steps to eliminate ill-treatment of migrants, and to facilitate access to detention centres by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations. <\/p>  <p>  Libya needs a functioning coastguard in order to rescue people in danger at sea. It is unacceptable that, on being rescued, migrants would be placed in inhumane conditions. The EU provides training, including in international humanitarian law, human rights and gender issues, to Libyan authorities. The EU is also working with the African Union and the UN to save and protect the lives of migrants and refugees in Libya, accelerating assisted voluntary returns to countries of origin, and the resettlement of those in need of international protection. The success of this cooperation is dependent on a Libyan government with effective, united and accountable institutions.  <\/p>  <p>  In sum, a functioning and stable government for all Libyans is crucial to addressing the many challenges the country faces, including ongoing efforts to improve the situation of migrants and refugees, and to ensure accountability for their ill treatment. Free, inclusive and credible elections would be an important step in this direction. I call on the Libyan Government, and all parties to the conflict, to guarantee the freedoms of assembly, association and speech, in order to foster an environment in which the democratic will of the Libyan people can be freely expressed. I am conscious that this will be a considerable test for Libya, and indeed the international community, and will require a spirit of compromise and good will on all sides. However, if successful, this would represent an important milestone in Libya&rsquo;s transition towards an inclusive, democratic and peaceful future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800071#WRD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":103,"content":"<p>Question No. 85 answered with Question No. 63.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":104,"content":"<p>Question No. 86 answered with Question No. 57.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800071#WRD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[11048\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800071#WRD03500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on Ireland's response to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights report on the database of all business enterprises in the occupied Palestinian territories; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>Human Rights Council Resolution 31\/36, adopted in March 2016, called upon the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to produce a database of all business enterprises involved in activities relating to Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian Territory.

Despite these reservations, Ireland of course assured the OHCHR that we would cooperate fully with any request for assistance in the task they had been assigned. The OHCHR subsequently wrote to all UN Member States seeking any information relevant to the compilation of this database. In the case of Ireland the name of one company, which had been reported to have such connections with settlements, was included by the OHCHR in this request.   The Government does not collect or maintain any information of its own in relation to such activities in settlements, and the communication from OHCHR gave no details of the reported activities of this company.

An all-island schools competition is also underway, in co-operation with the Department of Education, and a prizegiving ceremony will take place for the winners of this completion in Dublin in May. <\/p>  <p>  Further events, organised or supported through our Mission network, are currently planned for Abuja, Boston, New York, San Francisco, Toronto, Brussels, Kosovo, Warsaw, Beijing, Tokyo, Geneva and Tel Aviv.<\/p>  <p>  While I do not propose to establish a dedicated all party group for the purposes of marking this anniversary, I would be happy to continue to consult and engage with all political parties and other interested stakeholders and have asked my officials to do likewise. <\/p>  <p>  The events marking this important anniversary will provide an opportunity to reflect on the peace process, past and present; to remember the loss of life during the years of conflict; and to look back at all that has happened on the journey of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>This journey is of course an ongoing one, and the continued imperative to work to realise the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement will form an essential part of the Government&rsquo;s approach to the 20th   anniversary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800071#WRD04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800071#WRD04300"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[14203\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800071#WRD04400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to advocate at the EU Foreign Affairs Council for the need for EU members to work together with a view to working towards a resolution to the worsening humanitarian crisis in Yemen; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":116,"content":"<p>I am extremely concerned about the current situation in Yemen, which is the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis. The war is now ongoing for more than three years, and has had devastating consequences for civilians, with allegations of violations of human rights, international humanitarian law, and significant loss of life. Ireland has provided over &euro;11 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2015, and we are committed to maintaining support. In 2017, Irish funding of over &euro;5 million was allocated to the UN&rsquo;s Yemen Humanitarian Pooled Fund (YHPF), which supports NGOs and UN agencies, including UNICEF, which have the best capacity to deliver services on the ground. Furthermore, the EU is the largest humanitarian donor to Yemen and has provided over &euro;170 million in aid since the conflict began, to which Ireland contributes via the EU Development Budget.    At the Foreign Affairs Council in December last year, I urged stronger EU action on humanitarian access in Yemen, and I will continue to raise these concerns with all appropriate interlocutors whenever opportunities arise. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also worked in the UN system to address our grave concerns about human rights in Yemen. At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption by consensus of a Resolution on Yemen. The resolution established a group of international experts to examine the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground. This group will report back to the Human Rights Council, as an important step towards accountability in Yemen.<\/p>  <p>  My predecessor, Minister Flanagan, raised concerns about the conduct of the war in Yemen and the humanitarian impact with Ministerial counterparts in Saudi Arabia and UAE on a number of occasions.  More recently, officials from my Department met with the Saudi Embassy in Dublin late last year, and passed on my strong concerns in relation to humanitarian access. There have also been EU contacts with Saudi Arabia on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in the situation for the Yemeni people is through a negotiated end to this conflict. Ireland welcomes the recent announcement of Martin Griffiths as the new Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General for Yemen and fully supports the efforts of UN Special Envoy and his team, who are working towards a peace agreement. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to urge stronger international action and will press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen, as well as respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and improved humanitarian access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800071#WRD04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":117,"content":"<p>Question No. 91 answered with Question No. 51.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":118,"content":"<p>Question No. 92 answered with Question No. 57.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800071#WRD04800"},{"type":"question","counter":120,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[14031\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800071#WRD04900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has discussed the issue of the continued incarceration of a person (details supplied) in an Israeli prison and the recent ruling against an open trial with his counterparts across Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":121,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my reply earlier today to Question No 50 in relation to this case, to which I would add the following: This case and its recent conclusion have not been specifically discussed at Ministerial level meetings in the EU.

I have no difficulty with discussing this at European level, but it is a matter of judgement what is the most important and fruitful aspect to try and advance at any given time or meeting.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has already previously raised at EU level the question of whether settlement goods should be excluded from the EU market &ndash; this being a separate question from suggestions of sanctions on trade with Israel, which we do not support. In addition, the EU and its Member States are in near continuous discussion and negotiation at official level on all aspects of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, including many which bear in some way on questions to do with settlements and settlement goods. <\/p>  <p>  It is absolutely clear from these continuous contacts that there is no possibility whatever of getting substantial support, still less consensus, for a proposal to exclude settlement goods. The reality is that a substantial number of EU partners are highly resistant to such proposals, precisely because they consider them to be steps towards a trade ban, which they will not at this point countenance. Advocacy on this issue would only be likely to be counterproductive for other ideas we might pursue.<\/p>  <p>  We have therefore instead focussed our efforts in relation to settlements on practical measures to differentiate in EU policies between Israel itself and the illegal settlements.

The reports by UNHCR catalogue a number of human rights concerns that are having a particular effect on children, including settler violence, displacement and forcible transfer, home demolitions and forced evictions, and the arrest and arbitrary detention of children.<\/p>  <p>  Many of these issues are linked to settlement construction and discriminatory policies favouring settlers and settlements over the rights of the Palestinian population.  Ireland therefore continues to advocate for a greater international focus on these issues, and for stronger measures against settlements. The settlement project is contrary to international law, gravely threatens the prospects for a peace agreement, and inherently involves continuing and cumulative injustices and provocations to Palestinians.  It is clear however that these injustices will only be fully ended when the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory is ended. I have therefore also prioritized, in my engagement at local, EU and international level, the need for continued political effort to revive a political process to end the occupation.  Ireland also supports Israeli and Palestinian NGOs who are actively engaged in combatting injustices and discrimination on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  During my working visit to Israel and Palestine in January, on which I have reported to the House, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the impact of the continuing occupation, including settlement construction and the treatment of minors in detention, in my contacts with the Israeli administration.

The conflict, which is now in its eighth year, has cost over 400,000 lives.  Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including close to 3 million people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas.  Over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  The recent increase in violence in Syria, in particular the vicious siege of Eastern Ghouta which has cost the lives of hundreds of civilians, underscores the extent to which an end to the violence is urgently needed in order to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people. Ireland fully supports the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254, which calls for an end to violence; release of political prisoners; formation of a transitional governing body with executive powers and a constitutional reform process.  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.    Ireland strongly welcomed the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2401 calling for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access on 24 February.  However, the regime&rsquo;s bombardment of civilians and civilian infrastructure, including homes, hospitals and schools, has continued in defiance of this resolution.  The international community must redouble efforts to press for the immediate and full implementation of the ceasefire, and unimpeded humanitarian access to populations in need.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;95 million to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, including &euro;25 million in 2017 alone.

The EU will host another donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in April of this year at which Ireland will announce its pledge to the humanitarian effort in response to the Syria crisis in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The EU is also supporting the Turkey Refugee Facility in response to the almost 3 million refugees being hosted in that country, and &euro;3 billion has been committed to this by the EU between 2016 and 2019, with Ireland contributing &euro;22.9 million. &euro;15 million of this has already been provided to date.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland is also supporting refugee hosting communities in Lebanon and Jordan. Ireland has already contributed &euro;9.67 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Lebanon channelled through UN and NGO partners, and &euro;5.89 million to Jordan through the Jordan Humanitarian Fund. <\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), administered by the Department of Justice, Ireland has also committed to accept up to 4,000 refugees from the region.  To date, almost 2,000 people have already arrived. <\/p>  <p>  In Iraq, the UN estimates that 11 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, as the country begins to recover from the atrocities committed by Da&rsquo;esh.  The current number of internally displaced persons requiring humanitarian assistance stands at almost 3.3 million, of which 1.6 million are living outside of camps in host communities.  In addition, there are an estimated 240,000 Syrian refugees in Iraq.  The EU is working to support the Iraqi government on stabilisation and reconciliation.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2014, Ireland has provided over &euro;10 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq, including &euro;2 million in 2018 for the UN Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund.

The application of carbon tax to solid fuels was delayed to allow for the development of a robust mechanism to counter the large scale sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland where lower sulphur standards apply.  Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011. <\/p><p>In May 2013, carbon tax was extended to solid fuels with the introduction of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax (SFCT).  SFCT was charged at an initial rate of &euro;10 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted when combusted.\u00a0 In 2014 the rate for all carbon charges was increased to &euro;20 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted.  Current SFCT rates per tonne are &euro;52.67, &euro;36.67, &euro;17.99 and &euro;27.99 respectively for coal, peat briquettes, milled peat and other peat.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that from May 2013 to the end of 2017 net receipts from SFCT amounted to &euro;91.6m. Currently there are 210 active SFCT registrations. \u00a0Annual SFCT net receipts are given in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>&euro;m <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2013 <\/td><td>7.3 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014 <\/td><td>17.2 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015 <\/td><td>23.5 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016 <\/td><td>24.4 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017 <\/td><td>19.1 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>91.6 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>SFCT applies on the first supply of coal and peat in the State and is payable, on a bi-monthly basis, by a taxable person who is registered for VAT and making a first supply.  Every supplier who intends to make a first supply of solid fuel in the State must register with Revenue. <\/p><p>Suppliers in the State who import solid fuel and make first supplies in the State are required to register for SFCT.  Importers of solid fuel that is exclusively for their own use (self supply) for the purposes of manufacturing are also required to be registered for SFCT. The obligation to register with Revenue for the purposes of SFCT also applies to suppliers based in Northern Ireland who deliver solid fuel into the State for sale direct to the public.  In this context, I am advised by Revenue that a number of Northern Ireland based suppliers are registered for SFCT. <\/p><p>It should be noted that SFCT is not payable by a Northern Ireland supplier where that supplier makes the supply at their premises in the North, nor is it payable by private individuals travelling to the North to buy solid fuel for personal consumption if the individual accompanies the fuel back into the State.  It should also be noted that European Union Single Market constraints preclude the use of any cross-border movement controls in the administration of SFCT.  Therefore, Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel.  Similarly, the transport or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue's officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession.<\/p><p>Revenue collects SFCT on a self-assessment basis and enforces compliance by way of audit of solid fuel carbon tax returns. Liable fuel suppliers must file a return and pay for each bi-monthly period by the last day of the following month. Where suppliers do not submit returns by the due date Revenue will issue an estimate of the tax due. The estimate is the amount of tax that Revenue will pursue if a supplier does not complete and file their\u00a0return.<\/p><p>If a taxpayer fails to pay the amount due, including any debt for which an estimate has issued, Revenue may refer the debt for enforcement action.  This can include sheriff enforcement, civil proceedings through the courts or attachment of third parties.  To date SFCT enforcement actions have included;<\/p><p>- 35 warrants issued to Revenue Sheriffs with a total value of &euro;461,794 <\/p><p>- 45 solicitor referrals amounting to &euro;116,670 <\/p><p>- 1 Notice of Attachment issued for the amount of &euro;32,567. <\/p><p>SFCT collection is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime covering the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State.  This regulatory regime is operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and enforced by local authorities.\u00a0 I am advised by Revenue that it is in ongoing contact with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in relation to this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800074#WRG03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Audits","counter":254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800074#WRG04000"},{"type":"question","counter":255,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[14338\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800074#WRG04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of external reviews which have taken place in the Revenue Commissioners in respect of taxes due; and the number of these reviews that have resulted in repayments to taxpayers as a result of external reviews in each of the past five years.","asker":"1225","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":256,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that external reviews are undertaken under Revenue&rsquo;s Complaint and Review Procedures, which are contained in Leaflet CS4.\u00a0 These Procedures were introduced on 1 January 2013 and provide customers with a mechanism for making a complaint and seeking a review of Revenue&rsquo;s handling of a case.\u00a0 It is a three stage process with stages 1 and 2 being dealt with in the Local\/Regional\/Divisional Office.\u00a0 The final stage, stage 3, can be invoked if the complainant is dissatisfied with the outcome of stages 1 and 2.\u00a0 The complainant can seek a stage 3 review to be conducted by either an Internal Reviewer or an External Reviewer, but not both.\u00a0 The Internal or External Reviewer conducts a review of the stage 2 decision and Revenue will be bound by the outcome of the Review Procedures, unless in their view the decision of the Reviewer is not in accordance with the relevant legislation.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Since the Procedures commenced 65 External Reviews have been completed to end-2017.\u00a0 Of these, 8 were decided in favour of the complainant and 11 had the original decision revised or partially revised &ndash; see table:<\/p><p><b>External Reviews<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Decision   against the complainant<\/th><th>Decision in favour of the complainant<\/th><th>Decision revised\/partly revised<\/th><th>Discontinued<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>45<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>65<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>An analysis of the total number of external reviews shows that 16 related to taxes due and of these 7 related to refunds of taxes.\u00a0 Of these 7 only 1 was found in favour of the complainant and this resulted in a refund to the taxpayer. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800074#WRG04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":257,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800074#WRG04300"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[14370\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800074#WRG04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the tax rules surrounding the early extraction of pension funds, specifically if a person wishes to extract funds from their pension and invest it directly in sovereign bonds; if such a transaction is taxed; if the person wishes to transfer the funds to another registered pension fund if it would be subject to exit tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":259,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that approval of occupational pension schemes under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is given on the basis that retirement benefits are generally paid at normal retirement age which cannot fall before age 60.

The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need, including the establishment of special classes in mainstream primary and post primary schools. <\/p>  <p>  Special classes offer a supportive learning environment to students with ASD who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day. Special classes are for students who have a recommendation for a special class placement in their professional reports.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned. The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the NCSE will consider:<\/p>  <p>  - the school&rsquo;s accommodation and accessibility<\/p>  <p>  - the number of special classes, if any, already in the school.<\/p>  <p>  In order to identify need in any area for the forthcoming school year, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) refer to professional reports indicating students require the support of a special class. In this regard parents\/guardians of students with ASD seeking a special class placement should provide the relevant professional report to their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) to inform the planning process. <\/p>  <p>  The report must state that:<\/p>  <p>  - S\/he has ASD<\/p>  <p>  - S\/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has advised officials in my Department that 2 new ASD Primary classes will be established in Firhouse Educate Together N.S for the forthcoming school year. <\/p>  <p>  The Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to 2 special classes, the special education teaching allocation provided for 2017\/18 was maintained at the allocation that the school, referred to by the Deputy,\u00a0received in the previous school year. In October 2017, the school was provided with an additional SEN allocation of 2.45 hours on the grounds that the school qualified for one additional developing mainstream teaching post. The school has now received a revised total special education teaching allocation which equates to over 2 full time additional Special Education Teachers. This is a very significant allocation for a school of this size, which has a current enrolment of 169 pupils. <\/p>  <p>  DES Circular 0013\/2017 for primary schools and 0014\/2017 for post primary schools were published on 7th March 2017 which set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800075#WRH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Question Heading for question(s)  156","counter":300,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800075#WRH02900"},{"type":"question","counter":301,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[14346\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800075#WRH03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 206 of 13 February 2018 and 259 of 27 February 2018, if he will provide a reply to the issue raised; if his office has been contacted by the Ceann Comhairle regarding the question; if he has consulted with the Secretary General of his Department on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":302,"content":"<p>A response in this regard has issued to the\u00a0Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800075#WRH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Oibreacha Feabhs&uacute;ch&aacute;in do Scoileanna","counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800075#WRH03200"},{"type":"question","counter":304,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[14372\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800075#WRH03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"maidir le ceist 190 ar 3 Deireadh Fomhair 2017, an dtabharfaidh s&eacute; soil&eacute;iri&uacute; maidir le st&aacute;das an iarratais at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an scoil (sonra&iacute; tugtha), go h&aacute;irithe &oacute;s rud &eacute; gur chuir an scoil an soil&eacute;iri&uacute; ar na costais a bh&iacute; iarrtha ag an Roinn isteach an 29 Meitheamh 2017; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1316","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":305,"content":"<p>Cheadaigh mo Roinn deontas suntasach cineachta i m&iacute; Mhe&aacute;n an Fh&oacute;mhair 2014 don scoil at&aacute; i gceist le haghaidh s&iacute;neadh buan agus oibreacha athch&oacute;irithe a d&rsquo;&eacute;asc&oacute;dh le gach foirgneamh r&eacute;amhdh&eacute;anta a bhaint &oacute; shu&iacute;omh na scoile. <\/p><p>T&aacute; mo Roinn ag fanacht le tuilleadh faisn&eacute;ise maidir le plean costas athbhreithnithe.

They recognise that firearms dealers are entitled to be in possession of large quantities of firearms but require them to conduct business from a premises that has been constructed to a high standard. The Regulations also recognise the different categories of firearms dealers and scales the requirements depending on the quantities of ammunition and firearms being stored. For example, a time lock requirement does not apply to those dealers who deal only in small quantities of ammunition. <\/p>  <p>  This Statutory Instrument derives from the powers conferred under Sections 9(10) and (11) of the Firearms Act 1925, which were inserted by Section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006. Section 9(10) provides &ldquo;The Minister, after consultation with the Commissioner, may by regulations specify minimum standards to be complied with in relation to premises in which a firearms dealer carries on a business or proposes to do so&rdquo;.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 9(11) provides &ldquo;The minimum standards shall be determined by reference to<\/p>  <p>  (a) the security of the premises<\/p>  <p>  (b) their safety, and<\/p>  <p>  (c) their standard of construction,<\/p>  <p>  and having regard to their use for, as the case may be, the manufacture, repair, testing, proving or sale of firearms or ammunition&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  These provisions were passed by the Oireachtas on 5 July 2006 and signed into law by the President on 16 July 2006 and commenced on 1 January 2008.<\/p>  <p>  The Regulations were developed following consultation with a sub-group of the Firearms Consultative Panel (FCP) consisting of registered firearms dealers. It was agreed by the FCP when this sub group was being established that the firearms dealers on the Panel at the time should sit on the sub-group for the purpose of examining this particular issue. Firearms dealers&rsquo; premises were visited in fourteen counties prior to and during the drafting of this legislation. The dealers who sat on the sub-group are knowledgeable of the security that they and their colleagues utilise.  Additionally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who were represented on the group have extensive experience with regard to security measures available in the industry and particularly in firearms dealers&rsquo; premises. <\/p>  <p>  Concerns have been raised by some firearms dealers, particularly in relation to the time lock requirement.   The inclusion of the requirement for time locks was originally suggested by the sub-group to act as a significant deterrent and discouragement to criminal attack. Some dealers have claimed that their monitored alarm system serves the same purpose as a time-lock.  This is not correct.  The existing monitored alarm system will alert if the strong room is opened but it will not prevent the door from being opened.  The time-lock mechanism will prevent the door from being opened until a time pre-determined by the firearms dealer.  This measure is to make a &lsquo;Tiger Kidnapping&rsquo; situation less likely to occur whereby a dealer could be forced to open the strong room under duress.  The time-lock will lock the door at a time decided by the dealer (e.g. at the end of the business day) and cannot be opened until a pre-determined time (e.g. the commencement of the next business day.)  It is also understood that some dealers view is that time locks would prevent access in the event of a fire and could lead to dealers being held kidnapped for a longer period while waiting for time locks to open. It is likely that criminals would not risk waiting for the deactivation of time locks when there are risks that other security measures included in the premises could be activated e.g. duress panic buttons. <\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has strongly endorsed the security measures contained in this Regulation and has advised that the inclusion of a requirement for a time-lock on the strong room door will deter criminal activity and require the use of greater resources by any person attempting to access firearms or ammunition illegally.  Similar security measures have been applied successfully elsewhere, e.g. in banks, pharmacies and the jewellery sector.     <\/p>  <p>  In order to minimise the financial impact, a lead-in time of twelve months (to 1 February 2019) for compliance has been included in the Regulation in order to permit dealers sufficient time to comply with the legislation. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that I have no plans to amend these regulations which have been introduced as a public safety measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800076#WRJ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Youth Diversion Projects","counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800076#WRJ03300"},{"type":"question","counter":364,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[14411\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800076#WRJ03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason it has been decided without consultation that there will only be one service provider per Garda division; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":365,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department is obliged to carry out a Call for Proposals process during 2018 in relation to the provision of Garda Youth Diversion Project (GYDP) services, to fully comply with requirements related to the co-funding of projects by the European Social Fund Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure State-wide coverage of GYDP services for young people, (which does not exist at present), the intention is that, in general, service provision will be aligned with Garda Divisions or other appropriate local areas with a distinct community identity as may be agreed during a wide ranging consultation process which is currently in train.

It has been well established that children exposed to valproate in the womb have an increased risk of congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014, following a European Medicines Agency (EMA) review of valproate, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) circulated recommendations to further restrict the use of valproate in women and girls.  The HPRA also recommended that the use of valproate be restricted to doctors experienced in managing epilepsy or bipolar disorder in female patients, and provided advice for situations where it was considered that valproate treatment needed to be continued during the pregnancy.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2017, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the EMA initiated a new review of the use of valproate-containing medicines in the treatment of women and girls who are pregnant or of childbearing age.\u00a0 This review has now been completed, and the committee&rsquo;s recommendations were published by the EMA in February.  The key measures recommended by the PRAC are as follows:<\/p>  <p>- Valproate must not be used in pregnancy for the treatment of migraine or bipolar disorder.<\/p>  <p>- Valproate should not be used in pregnancy for the treatment of epilepsy.  However it is recognised that for some women with epilepsy it may not be possible to stop valproate and they may have to continue treatment (with appropriate specialist care) in pregnancy.<\/p>  <p>- Valproate must not be used in female patients from the time they become able to have children &ndash; unless the conditions of a new pregnancy prevention programme (PPP) are met.<\/p>  <p>- The PRAC has also recommended that the outer packaging of all valproate medicines must include a visual warning about the risks in pregnancy.  In addition to boxed text, this may include a symbol\/pictogram, with the details to be adapted at national level.<\/p>  <p>- A patient reminder card will also be attached to the outer package for pharmacists to discuss with the patient each time the medicine is dispensed.<\/p>  <p>- Companies that market valproate should also provide updated educational materials in the form of guides for healthcare professionals and patients.<\/p>  <p>  The PRAC&rsquo;s position on sodium valproate has since been endorsed by an EMA regulatory committee, the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures &ndash; Human (CMDh), and the recommendations will now be sent to the European Commission for a legally binding decision on all member states.  Officials in my department are already working with other stakeholders, including the HPRA, HSE, and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, to determine how these recommendations should be implemented in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  At my request, officials from my department met with representatives from FACS (Foetal Anti-Convulsant Syndrome) Forum Ireland in November.

Ireland has been very consistent on this issue in recent months especially as discussions around potential increases in GNI contributions have been floated. \u00a0The Taoiseach, in his address to the European Parliament\u00a0in January 2018, has already indicated\u00a0that Ireland is open to contributing more to the EU budget, but only if it is spent on policies that contribute to the advancement of the European ideal. <\/p>  <p>  Both I and my colleague Minister of State Doyle will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible as negotiations on CAP post 2020 intensify.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800079#WRM02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Applications","counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800079#WRM02900"},{"type":"question","counter":532,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[14382\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800079#WRM03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive a GLAS payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":533,"content":"<p>The person named was approved into GLAS\u00a01 with a contract commencement date of 1\u00a0October 2015 and has received full payments in respect of the 2015\u00a0scheme year.<\/p>  <p>  The outstanding Nutrient Management Plan has now been correctly submitted to the\u00a0 system operated by Teagasc.

In addition, their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.   <\/p>  <p>  The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published in October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure. In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers were to be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review&rsquo;s findings.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for PRSI Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  <\/p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.<\/p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.<\/p>  <p>  The Actuarial Review provides government with a timely and evidence-led opportunity to undertake a full review of our social insurance system and to consult with stakeholders.  The review will take account of the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800080#WRN04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Employment Service","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800080#WRN04100"},{"type":"question","counter":605,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[14286\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032800080#WRN04200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of referrals made to the local employment service in each of the years 2013 to 2017.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":606,"content":"<p>Local Employment Services form part of the State&rsquo;s public employment service.
