International evidence indicates that systems based on universalism are associated with lower rates of child poverty and deliver better outcomes for <i>all<\/i>children, with disadvantaged children benefitting more when services are provided within a universal programme design.  Progressive universalism further recognises the importance of the provision of additional support to those with the greatest need.<\/p><p>The new scheme is highly progressive overall, with eligibility based on net parental income and the highest levels of support offered to those on the lowest incomes.  It is more equitable and accessible than the current targeted subsidy programmes, under which many low-income families are not currently able to access subsidised childcare because of the requirement to be in receipt of certain state benefits or attending certain training programmes.  It will also enhance affordability, offering greater levels of support overall to low income families than the current targeted schemes.  For example, a person in receipt of the maximum level of subsidy under the current Community Childcare Scheme (by far the largest of the current targeted schemes) might face a weekly co-payment of &euro;89 per week.  Under the new scheme, a person in receipt of the maximum rate of subsidy might be expected to face an average weekly co-payment of &euro;12 per week.<\/p><p>The universal subsidy for children under 3 recognises the fact that the cost of childcare is generally highest when children are under 3 years of age and this cost can push many parents out of the labour market when paid maternity leave ends.  This higher cost is due to both the hours of care required (i.e. notably longer than afterschool care needs) and the underlying cost of providing quality childcare for very young children.  Recent reports also suggest that cost and sustainability issues are affecting the availability of childcare places for children under 3 years.  The Government commitment to provide a universal subsidy for this age cohort, as well as to provide higher rates of targeted subsidy, recognises and responds to these issues.<\/p><p>Finally, the Deputy has also asked about families above the income cut-off for targeted subsidies.  Of course, all targeted schemes, by their nature, have thresholds and cut-off points.  However, the new Affordable Childcare Scheme is designed to be flexible, with the ability to adjust income thresholds, subsidy rates and income taper rates, over time and as further Government investment becomes available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800057#WRB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unaccompanied Minors and Separated Children","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800057#WRB01900"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[33522\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800057#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if, in view of the unfortunate record of treatment of some unaccompanied minors and young asylum seekers, she has satisfied herself that the care system for these most vulnerable young persons is appropriate and up to international best practice.","asker":"1291","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has operational responsibility for accommodating and caring for unaccompanied minors who arrive into Ireland.

Against this backdrop, my Department has engaged in a reform programme to ensure quality effective, value for money services that are evidence based and designed to secure the best outcomes for young people.<\/p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people.  It is estimated that the voluntary youth services involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  The schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is made available on an annual basis to thirty national and major regional youth organisations, the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme which supports youth work activities at a local level and the Youth Information Centre Scheme which funds twenty five Youth Information Centres.<\/p>  <p>  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, along with all government departments, was required to deliver substantial savings on all funding programmes in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012 &ndash; 2014.  My Department sought to ensure that front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people, were protected as far as is possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding.<\/p>  <p>  You will be aware that the targeted schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of the impact youth service provision has on young people&rsquo;s lives.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Programmes over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020, published last October, was developed in close consultation with statutory youth interests and the voluntary youth organisations and services that work with young people.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy sets out Government&rsquo;s aims for young people, aged 10 to 24 years, so that they are active and healthy, achieving their full potential in learning and development, safe and protected from harm, have economic security and opportunity and are connected and contributing to their world.  The Strategy identifies some fifty priority actions to be delivered by Government departments, state agencies and by others, including the voluntary youth services over 2015 to 2017.  They include actions to address issues which are a high priority for young people themselves.<\/p>  <p>  There have been other significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services.  These include the setting up of the North South Education and Training Standards Committee for youth work and the introduction of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 which, inter alia, provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.<\/p>  <p>  At EU level, the Council of Ministers for Youth has adopted an EU Youth Strategy and has taken a number of policy initiatives to promote quality in the provision of youth work services.  The National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making 2015-2020, which was published by my Department in June, 2015 is particularly relevant.

The Manual on Government Deficit and Debt (MGDD) provides further guidance on the implementation of ESA 2010 when reporting GFS.<\/p>  <p>  To test whether a unit is in government, the decision rules that need to be followed are as per ESA 2010 and MGDD. These rules establish that an entity should be classified in the government sector if it is (a) under public (government) control and (b) if it is a non-market entity.  The first step in the classification process is therefore to determine  if the unit is under public control.  Not all publicly controlled entities are in general government. This is because if a publicly controlled unit is a market producer (i.e. selling their output at economically significant prices) it is classified outside government as a public corporation.<\/p>  <p>  Historically the universities were classified as privately controlled non-profit institutions in the National Accounts.  The CSO, having reviewed the Universities Act, 1997, concluded that, on balance, the universities have sufficient degree of autonomy under this legislation to be classified as being privately and not publicly controlled. Therefore the universities are not currently included in the list of public corporations published by the CSO.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2012 the CSO reclassified the universities as market producers meaning they were classified to the non-financial corporations sector rather than the non-profit sector.  Therefore, currently the universities are classified outside Government on the basis that they are (a) privately controlled and (b) market producers.   This second assessment currently considers the fee income including the portion paid by the State (which is considered a transfer to households who then pay the fee) as sales.  Other income combined with these fees is sufficient to meet over 50% of costs. <\/p>  <p>  According to the rules of the MGDD the market \/ non-market criterion is applied taking results over a \"number of years\" - in practical terms usually a three year period is taken.  Only when a clear pattern is observed is a reclassification undertaken.  This ensures that government figures are not made volatile through reclassifications arising from exceptional events. <\/p>  <p>  In common with other entities in receipt of significant public funds the universities are subject to routine checks on their sector classification by the CSO.  If the universities were to be classified as under public control as a result of such a review, only then would the market\/non-market criterion apply to the decision as to whether they should be classified in the government sector or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800058#WRC02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":124,"content":"<p>Question No. 70 answered with Question No. 62.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":125,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800058#WRC02750"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[32914\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800058#WRC02800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the amount that his Department spent on external legal advice in each of the years 2013 to 2015, inclusive; and the names of each of the legal firms that provided advice to his Department in each of those years.

For the 32 week duration of phase 1 of their training they receive a<\/font>basic weekly allowance of &euro;184 and full board in the Garda College.  After 32 weeks they are fully attested and move onto the first point of the Garda incremental pay scale of &euro;23,750.  The incremental scale rises to &euro;42,138 per annum after 8 years with two further increments after 13 and 19 years' service which bring the maximum of the pay scale to &euro;45,793 per annum after 19 years.  New Garda&iacute;, like all public servants, will see their salary increased by &euro;1,000 in September 2017 under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, as part of the Government's commitment to the gradual restoration of pay. <\/p><p>When considering Garda pay it is, however, important to recall that the Garda salary scale does not represent the full earnings of a Garda as it does not include any allowances which form a very significant part of Garda earnings.  Newly attested Garda&iacute; assigned to frontline duties work the Garda Roster which attracts unsocial hours payments.  They also qualify for uniform allowance and boot allowance.  Taking account of these allowances I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the average earnings of a newly attested Garda in the first year of their probation is approximately &euro;30,500. <\/p><p>In January 2010, the first point of the Garda salary scale was &euro;25,745.  Having regard to a restructuring of the training programme in the intervening years this is not directly comparable with the position that pertains at present.  In addition, newly attested Garda&iacute; at that time qualified for the rent allowance.  Following a review of all allowances in the public service during 2011 and 2012, the Government decided on 18 September 2012 that this allowance should be abolished for all new public servants including Garda&iacute;, Prison Officers and Fire Officers.  It is acknowledged that this decision has had a significant impact on new Garda&iacute; recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, on Thursday last the Labour Court issued recommendations in respect of disputes involving the Garda Representative Association (GRA) and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI).  The Court's recommendations, which are to be balloted on by members of the two Associations in the coming weeks, would benefit new recruits in a number of ways.  In particular, the Court has recommended that the rent allowance abolished for new recruits in 2012, be restored and increased by &euro;500 per annum to &euro;4,655.  The allowance is to be incorporated into pay which would result in increased unsocial hours and overtime payments.  The Labour Court has also recommended the introduction of a premium payment of &euro;15 for every annual leave day to acknowledge the fact that the operation of the administration of justice has the effect of diminishing the certainty of approved annual leave for Garda&iacute;.  Paid 15 minute pre-tour briefing\/tasking sessions are also recommended by the Court and together with the recommendations referred to above, would benefit all Garda&iacute;, including new recruits.<\/p><p>These recommendations, if accepted, will have a significant positive effect on the remuneration of new recruits and I am sure that all concerned will give them the detailed consideration that they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800059#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Lottery Funding Disbursement","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800059#WRD00600"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[33276\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800059#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if national lottery funding is available at present through her Department to support the work of community groups; if so, if there are specific programmes eligible for grant assistance; the details of same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that at present there is no National Lottery Funding available to my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800059#WRD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Applications","counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800059#WRD00900"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[33311\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800059#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of an application for asylum in respect of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":150,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that, if the person whose details were supplied has made an application for asylum or subsidiary protection in the State, I must advise that it is not the practice to comment on such applications until they have fully completed the protection process.

However, I can assure the Deputy that the investigation of white collar crimes remains a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this Government will continue to provide the necessary legislative and administrative supports to help bring the perpetrators of such crime to justice.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) has dedicated expert staff to address white collar crime.  There are currently two full-time forensic accountants assigned to the Bureau and a competition to appoint a further two forensic accountants has recently been completed by the Public Appointments Service. <\/p>  <p>  The previous Government brought forward new legislation in the Criminal Justice Act 2011 which was an important step forward in our response to this form of criminality.  Its main purpose is to address delays in the prosecution and investigation of complex white collar crime by improving certain important procedural matters and strengthening Garda investigative powers.  Another recent provision is Part 5 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 which allows for the selection of additional jurors for longer trials, such as those involving complex financial matters where jurors might become unavailable due to the length of the proceedings.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of forthcoming legislation, work on the drafting of the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill  is at an advanced stage and it is hoped to publish it in the coming weeks in line with the Government's legislative programme.  Provisions in the Bill  will replace  and update the offences of giving and receiving bribes, address the bribery of foreign officials, provide discrete offences outlawing trading in influence, criminalise the making of payments knowingly or recklessly to a third party who intends to use them as a bribe.  The Bill will also enhance the ability of the DPP to bring prosecutions by providing presumptions of corrupt gifts or payment.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop relevant investigative strategies utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodology.  Multiple approaches, including the powers in the Criminal Justice Act 2011 as well as proceeds of crime legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau, are all utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted.  I am also advised that there is the closest of cooperation between the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) and the Criminal Assets Bureau.<\/p>  <p>  As illustrated in the major banking investigations, the GNECB also works closely with other bodies with relevant enforcement functions, but whose legislative and regulatory functions are not under my Ministerial remit, including the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Central Bank and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I might add that some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021.  This major investment as well as the programme of ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment will clearly benefit all criminal investigations, including those relating to financial crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800059#WRD04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":184,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800059#WRD04500"},{"type":"question","counter":185,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[33460\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800059#WRD04600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress to date in determination of an application for an EU residence card as a spouse-partner of an EU national in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":186,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that  INIS wrote to the person concerned on 3rd September, 2016, at the address provided by the Deputy, advising that the application for a residence card under the Free Movement provisions was approved for a period of five years expiring on 2nd September, 2021.

Under the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013, the Circuit Court has been given jurisdiction to deal with repossession proceedings involving principal private residences, irrespective of when the mortgage was created, its rateable valuation or its market value.  I regret that attempts are being made to create a contrary perception.   <\/p>  <p>  The Courts Bill 2016 is a short, technical Bill which is being introduced to address the implications of a Court of Appeal ruling in July last.  In that case, the Court of Appeal ruled that where Circuit Court jurisdiction to hear cases involving property is based on the property's rateable valuation, that Court has no such jurisdiction if the property is not rateable under the Valuation Act 2001.  While the Court felt obliged to reach this conclusion, it acknowledged that the ruling was likely to lead to consequences which were &ldquo;both unfortunate and unintended&rdquo;.  The Court added that certain proceedings would have to be commenced in the High Court instead of the Circuit Court and that this would simply create additional costs for litigants &ldquo;and will serve to deprive the parties of access to local courts in the manner in which the Constitution actually intended.&rdquo;  The Bill seeks to address these unintended consequences and to avoid disruption to the orderly management and discharge of court proceedings already under way, as well as any additional costs arising from a collapse or withdrawal of proceedings based on rateable valuation. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a new, innovative mortgage arrears resolution service - Abhaile - was officially launched recently by myself and the Minister for Social Protection.  The new nationwide service marks a departure in State assistance by providing free, independent expert advice and support on financial and legal issues.  The number one objective is to help people to stay in their home wherever possible.  The scheme started in late July and is already proving very effective.  The scheme is designed to help keep families in their homes by identifying sustainable solutions in mortgage arrears cases.  Under the scheme, eligible clients are given vouchers to obtain expert advice from financial and legal advisers in order to resolve their debt issues.  In addition, they can get assistance in court where needed, have access to solicitors, and get help obtaining legal aid.  A major Government information campaign will be launched in the coming weeks to raise awareness of the scheme.  I believe that the introduction of the scheme will help people get out of debt and, wherever possible, to stay in their own homes and would strongly encourage anyone worried about mortgage arrears on their home to contact MABS, the Government gateway for accessing free expert help and advice.<\/p>  <p>  This new service builds on the protections granted by the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 which assists homeowners in mortgage arrears by granting the Court specific powers to adjourn repossession proceedings in order to allow such a borrower to consult with a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP) with a view to making a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) under the Insolvency Acts and to instruct the PIP to make such a proposal.  In addition, the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015 has been enacted in order to further assist homeowners in mortgage arrears.  The 2015 Act introduced a new \"court review\" process applicable in cases where creditors such as a lending institution refuse a proposal for a PIA drawn up to resolve the homeowner's debts, including the mortgage on their home.<\/p>  <p>  Addressing mortgage arrears is necessary in order to assist homeowners in mortgage arrears to remain in their homes and avoid additional pressures on the rental or social housing sectors.  The Government is committed to building on recent reforms and creating a framework that removes fear and brings predictability to a difficult process.  Through a range of actions, including the launch of Abhaile, Government Departments and relevant bodies will continue to work to find ways to encourage those who have not been able to engage with their lending institutions to date to reach suitable long-term debt solutions with a view to avoiding repossessions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800059#WRD05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":190,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800059#WRD05100"},{"type":"question","counter":191,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[33495\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800059#WRD05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if her attention has been drawn to a matter (details supplied) regarding a visa.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":192,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that, on the basis of the information provided, it is not possible to identify the individual concerned.<\/p>  <p>  I would expect in situations such as this, where the passport expires before the immigration permission runs out,  that the balance of the permission is entered on the applicant's new passport without incurring a second fee.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established specifically for this purpose.

This includes arrangements within the Courts system where the adjudications of legal costs under the new structure will be conducted in succession to the existing taxation of costs regime.

The aim of the booking system is to give certainty to applicants that they will be dealt with on a particular date and within a stated time period. The introduction of the appointment booking system has been a major success and has meant that the long queues that have been associated with the Office are now a thing of the past. This has resulted in a significant improvement in the customer experience. Since its introduction, over 20,000 appointments have been booked on the appointment system.<\/p><p>As this is the busiest time of the year for the registration office additional staff on overtime have been engaged and the Office is also open on most Saturdays in the autumn. This is in addition to the normal office hours of 8 am - 9 pm Monday to Thursday and 6pm on Fridays. The capacity of the Office to accommodate appointments is monitored on a daily basis, taking into account staffing levels, the type of appointments sought and the general number of appointment cancellations. Where additional capacity is identified further appointments are released.<\/p><p>The Burgh Quay registration office has facilitated appointments in certain emergency situations, since the introduction of the appointment booking system, and continues to do so.

Similarly, there are peaks for re-entry visas at the start of the summer and in advance of the Christmas \/ New Year holiday period.

Under the Road Traffic Acts, any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is allowed to stop a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and demand production of a driver licence or learner permit.  In addition, Garda&iacute; may inspect the vehicle for compliance with vehicle standards legislation, which makes it an offence to drive without reasonable consideration, drive carelessly, or drive dangerously.  The Garda authorities also have powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under road traffic legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that the use of quad bikes and scramblers in public parks and open spaces is strictly prohibited by the local authorities under the Parks and Open Spaces Bye-Laws 2011.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the road traffic and other relevant legislation available in this area, the Garda authorities have indicated that the use of quad bikes and scramblers by minors and youths in public parks has proven difficult to deal with from an enforcement perspective.

If such pursuits were to take place, there would be a high risk of these ending in collisions at speed resulting in serious injury or death, so the opportunity to actually bring these vehicles to a stop is rare.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have advised that the issue is one which is best addressed through a multi-agency approach.

No. 383 of 2016, I commenced those provisions of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 as necessary to get the new Regulatory Authority up and running, particularly in terms of its membership and appointment. On 29 September 2016, I signed the Order appointing 1 October 2016 as the official &ldquo;establishment day&rdquo; of the Regulatory Authority as provided under section 7 of the 2015 Act - S.I. No. 507 of 2016 refers. In conjunction with these initial steps the nomination, approval and appointment procedures for the eleven members of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority set out in Part 2 of the 2015 Act have been completed. This has included the required resolutions approving such appointment having been passed by each House of the Oireachtas. Dr. Don Thornhill has also been appointed as Chairperson of the Regulatory Authority. The Authority, which has a lay majority and Chairperson, held its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016. I had the opportunity to meet with the members of the Authority to mark this historic occasion which I have warmly welcomed as a key step towards the realisation of the important reforms to the provision of legal services and to the transparency of legal costs that are contained in the 2015 Act.<\/p>  <p>  Now that the new Authority has had its inaugural meeting as an independent statutory regulator, the working focus is, of necessity, on the managed roll-out of the Authority's functions in tandem with the phased commencement, by the Government, of the various remaining Parts and provisions of the 2015 Act. This is no small endeavour as the setting of establishment day of the Authority for 1 October 2016 has automatically triggered a number of working obligations on the new Authority. Moreover, several of these are statute-bound in terms of their delivery deadlines and in terms of the completion of public consultations and reports on the specified matters concerned. These are tasks for which the new Authority will need to build up its working resources in the short term. My Department and the new Regulatory Authority will, therefore, continue to liaise closely to ensure that we can successfully coordinate the commencement, from my side as Minister, and delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various provisions concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Against this background, it is intended that the phased commencement of the remaining Parts of the 2015 Act will be implemented over the remainder of this year and into early 2017 in relation to major undertakings such as the start-up of the Authority&rsquo;s critical public complaints function. The immediate focus includes the phased commencement of respective sections or Parts of the 2015 Act such as those requiring early public consultations and reports and those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols. Following this, in the new year, the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced in tandem with the developing resource base and capability of the new body. I would anticipate that the planning and progress of all of these matters will come to be determined in much more precise terms by my Department in conjunction with the Legal Services Regulatory Authority over the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800060#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting Applications","counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800060#WRE01750"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[33692\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800060#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to outline the cause of delays in the Garda vetting process with regard to volunteers working in schools and with youth groups; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":226,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that there is no particular delay in the Garda employment vetting process; rather there has been a very significant improvement in vetting processing times in recent months.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that at present 80 percent of vetting applications are processed by the Garda National Vetting Bureau in under five working days. This represents a dramatic improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013. This improvement has come about as a result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in providing this service, including an increase of over 80 percent in staffing levels and the roll out earlier this year of an e-Vetting system.<\/p>  <p>  In April this year I commenced the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 and in tandem with that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched the e-Vetting system.  E-Vetting facilitates the on-line processing of applications and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications.  I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that the vast majority of vetting applications, over 85 percent of applications, now received by the Vetting Bureau are received and processed via the e-Vetting system.<\/p>  <p>  One very important feature of the e-Vetting system is that the individual applicant can track the progress of their own vetting application on-line and can, therefore, see when their application has been processed and returned to the relevant registered organisation.<\/p>  <p>  There are a small number of registered organisations who are not yet operating the e-Vetting system and continue to use the old paper format for applications.  For vetting applications that continue to be submitted in paper format, the average turnaround time is in the order of four weeks from the receipt of the application by the Vetting Bureau and this represents a minimum time frame given the administrative input required.  The Garda Authorities continue to work with the organisations who are not yet operating the e-Vetting system to encourage and support them to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Processing times for any given application can be longer in individual cases when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary or where errors have been made in the application.  It is important to note that delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda Authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the vetting service is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the importance of protecting children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, the current processing period is not unreasonable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800060#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800060#WRE01950"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[33710\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800060#WRE02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to outline the position regarding the provision of a new Garda station for Clonmel, County Tipperary; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1348","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has the responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.

The scheme was originally introduced in response to concerns raised by cross border workers concerning the tax position of employees resident in the State and employed in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of section 825A TCA is to give relief to those workers who commute to a place of work outside the State and who exercise the duties of their employment wholly outside the State. The relief therefore is not easily aligned in a self-employed context as many elements of a self-employed business of an Irish resident would most likely be carried on from within the State. This could include for example, planning and organisation of activities and jobs, as well as various other ancillary and administrative functions. Therefore, unlike a foreign employment which is a clear, discrete activity carried on in wholly in another jurisdiction, self-employment assignments are much less defined and could present control issues. It should be noted of course that the employees of a self-employed contractor would be eligible for the relief.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, an extension of the relief to the self-employed would likely provide an incentive for businesses to relocate north of the border in circumstances where the Irish income tax rates compared unfavourably with the prevailing UK rates. Finally, self-employed individuals have the option to incorporate and benefit from lower corporate tax rates whereas employees have no such option. One of the reasons for introducing the relief for cross-border employees was to shield their exposure to the higher rates of Irish income tax.

That is what this Government is doing.  This will help enhance the resilience of the Irish economy.<\/p>  <p>  At a more micro-economic level, Budget 2017 contains several measures designed to ensure that firms in Ireland - especially those in the SME sector - are prepared for a potentially more difficult trading environment.

Furthermore, there are a number of additional supports for SME credit coming on stream, including a &euro;150 million agri-loan fund; and a revamped Credit Guarantee Scheme.

In addition, the EU also pays some additional receipts directly to private beneficiaries under 'centralised direct management', most notably under the EU research funding programme.<\/p><p>For ease of reference, Ireland's receipts from and contributions to the EU Budget for the years 2010 to 2015 are set out in the following table. <table><tr><th>YEAR<\/th><th>Public Sector Receipts &euro;m<\/th><th>Direct Management<br \/><br \/>Receipts* &euro;m<\/th><th>Total receipts<\/th><th>Payments to EU Budget &euro;m<\/th><th>Net Receipts  &euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>1885.3<\/td><td>80.4<\/td><td>1965.7<\/td><td>1352.4<\/td><td>613.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>1950.2<\/td><td>80.2<\/td><td>2030.4<\/td><td>1349.7<\/td><td>680.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>1837.7<\/td><td>108.8<\/td><td>1946.5<\/td><td>1393.2<\/td><td>553.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>1672.9<\/td><td>113.0<\/td><td>1785.9<\/td><td>1726.2<\/td><td>59.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>1419.7<\/td><td>83.9<\/td><td>1503.6<\/td><td>1685.5<\/td><td>-181.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>1770.9 (p)<\/td><td>147.7<\/td><td>1918.6 (p)<\/td><td>1952.1<\/td><td>-33.5 (p)<\/td><\/tr><\/table>Source: Department of Finance<\/p><p>(p) provisional<\/p><p>* - Direct Management - funds which are awarded and spent directly by the Commission.

HAP is now available to all qualified households in 19 local authority areas, with over 14,500 households currently being supported by the scheme and 9,500 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to those households.  A breakdown of the number of households supported by HAP in each local authority area at the end of Quarter 3,2016 is available on my Department's website at the following link: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>As HAP is deemed to be a social housing support under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, households in receipt of HAP are not included on the local authority waiting list for social housing support.  However, HAP recipients may access other forms of social housing supports by applying to go on the local authority transfer list.<\/p><p>On 16 December 2014, a statutory direction was issued to all authorities involved in the HAP statutory pilot, instructing them to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefitting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through a transfer option.  Local authorities were also directed that HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.  The practical operation of transfer lists in the context of the Ministerial direction is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their scheme of letting priorities.  In general, housing authorities offer HAP recipients the opportunity to apply to go on the transfer list at the point when their HAP application is approved and the differential rent contribution is signed by the household.  The 2 week period referred to is not a statutory period.  I understand that it is a timeframe operated by local authorities for the purposes of receiving a reply to correspondence with HAP recipients.  Local authorities and my Department are working closely together in order to ensure the successful implementation of the scheme and the Ministerial Directive relating to the operation of transfer lists, and I am satisfied that all local authorities are informing HAP applicants of the opportunity to apply to go on to the transfer list , as a matter of course.  It is ultimately the choice of the HAP recipient to choose if they wish to be placed on a local authority's transfer list and I understand that the majority of HAP households do avail of this option.  As of the start of November 2016, over 190 households across the country have transferred from the HAP scheme to other forms of social housing support.<\/p><p>The Homelessness Pilot of the HAP scheme has been operational since February 2015 across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, i.e. Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council, and is being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE).  The focus of this pilot scheme is to transition qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies.  There are currently 637 households being supported by the Homeless HAP pilot scheme across Dublin.  At this point, the full HAP scheme is only available to all qualifying households in one of the four Dublin local authorities, South Dublin County Council.  The full roll-out of the scheme to the remaining Dublin local authorities is planned for Q1, 2017.<\/p><p><i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>commits to meeting the housing needs of 1,750 homeless households through the Homeless Pilot of the HAP scheme over 2016 and 2017, as part of the overall accelerated HAP target of supporting 27,000 new households over the same period.  As of 7 November, 586 tenancies had been set up under the pilot scheme this year, meeting the <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>target of 550 homeless households to be supported by the scheme in 2016.  My Department does not hold data on the number of persons that have been offered the homeless HAP scheme that have refused to participate in the scheme to date.  The performance of the Homeless HAP scheme continues to improve with a doubling in the number of new households being supported by the scheme each week since the review of HAP rent limits in July of this year.<\/p><p>While I am happy with the improved performance under the scheme, I have asked my Department to continue to monitor it closely and engage directly with the relevant local authorities to ensure its effectiveness and its attractiveness to homeless households.<\/p><p>The data sought in relation to numbers of HAP- supported households in full time employment, in part time employment, in training and that are unemployed broken down by local authority is not held by my Department.  My Department, local authorities and the HAP Shared Service Centre (SSC) - being provided by Limerick City and County Council - are working together to develop data collection and reporting mechanisms to provide robust indicators in relation to the activation objective of the HAP scheme.  The development of these indicators is being overseen by the HAP Oversight Group that is jointly chaired by the Secretaries General of my Department and the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the scheme under review.

The provision of social housing is carried out by local authorities and Approved Housing bodies (AHBs) through a range of delivery methods, including construction, acquisition, leasing and other approaches, which allow local authorities, as housing authorities, to respond flexibly to meet local demand and operate within local property circumstances. The operation of the rent supplement scheme is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.  The Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan For Housing and Homelessness published in July 2016 recognises the need to significantly increase the level and scale of supports available to those whose circumstances mean they need State help in meeting their housing needs. The Action Plan allows for a broad range of flexible delivery mechanisms including an accelerated and expanded social housing construction programme. The Action Plan sets an ambitious target to deliver 47,000 units of social housing in the period to 2021, while at the same time making the best use of the existing housing stock and laying the foundations for a more vibrant and responsive private rented sector. Of the 47,000 units-  <\/p><p>- 26,000 will be exclusively built as social housing;<\/p><p>- 11,000 will be acquired by Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies from the market or the Housing Agency; and<\/p><p>- 10,000 will be leased by Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies.<\/p><p>I have secured &euro;5.35 billion exchequer investment to deliver these 47,000 new social housing units over the period of the Action Plan.  This &euro;5.35 billion investment comprises some &euro;4.5 billion in capital funding and &euro;844 million in support of programmes funded from current expenditure, specifically the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).  This significant capital investment will assist local authorities and AHBs to continue their re-engagement in substantial social housing construction activity.<\/p><p>A number of financial and economic studies carried out support the rationale for the provision of social housing through mechanisms such as the leasing and renting of privately owned accommodation. In 2010, the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG) published a specific chapter (Chapter 23 of the C&amp;amp;AG's 2009 Annual Report) relating to the leasing of social housing. In addition, a financial appraisal of the long-term costs of leasing in comparison with other social housing delivery options, commissioned by my Department was carried out by the Housing Agency in 2011. Both the C&amp;amp;AG findings and the study commissioned by my Department broadly indicated that leasing represents good value for money in social housing provision when compared to direct market acquisition or construction of units.

There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory.  These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a minimum of 10 years of paid contributions.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age).<\/p><p>Social insurance contributions (Class S PRSI) were introduced for self-employed people on 6 April 1988.

The legislation providing for this partial pension came into effect from 9 April 1999 to provide a basic payment for groups who would not otherwise qualify for a contributory social welfare pension, and who did not satisfy the means test for the State pension (non-contributory).  In this case, the measure was designed to benefit self-employed people who were already over 56 years of age when compulsory self-employed social insurance was introduced in 1988, who had not paid other contributions (such as voluntary contributions, or other contributions while in employment), and who could not therefore satisfy the condition of having entered insurance 10 years before pension age.  The pension requires a minimum of 5 years contributions and is payable at 50% of the standard rate.  The pension was seen as a reasonable response to the position of the self-employed who were in their late 50s when Class S contributions were introduced, and I believe most would agree that it represents good value for the contributions made  <font color=\"#0000FF\">.  <\/font><\/p><p>It is worth noting that the most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found that the self-employed achieve very good value for money from the fund.<\/p><p>Where a person<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>is unable to meet the qualifying conditions for a State pension (contributory), or is only eligible for a reduced rate of contributory pension, they may alternatively apply for State pension (non-contributory) amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate which is subject to a means-test. <\/p><p>It is the case, therefore, that a person in receipt of this pension, in addition to having made very little contribution to the Social Insurance Fund (which funds contributory pensions), would have significant other means, as otherwise they would be expected to receive the State pension (non-contributory), at up to 95% the rate of the full contributory pension rate.  <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800066#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Applications","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800066#WRL01400"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[33374\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800066#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason a State pension (contributory) was terminated in the case of a person (details supplied) when the pension is likely to be restored with any arrears due; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>An application by the person concerned for state pension (contributory) was received on 16 September 2009.

The use of a means test is to ensure that scarce resources are directed to those in greatest need.  <\/p>  <p>  Payments from the United Kingdom (UK) are assessed as income under current legislation.  In assessing means derived from payments received from non-European Monetary Union (EMU) States, the Department uses the conversion mechanism provided for under Article 107 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 574\/72 on Social Security for Migrant Workers.  The exchange rates for converting sterling and other non EMU currencies are published quarterly in the Official Journal of the European Union.  The Department obtains this rate at the beginning of each quarter and uses it in all conversions during the course of that quarter irrespective of whether the value of the currency concerned rises or falls in that period.  The conversion rates published in 2016, which are reflective of the changes in the value of sterling, are  Q1: 1.36450;   Q2: 1.32523;   Q3: 1.26216;   Q4: 1.18898.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of a new claim, when calculating the value of a sterling payment, the conversion rate used is that applicable to the quarter in which the effective date of the claim falls.  <\/p>  <p>  It is open to any person in receipt of a social assistance payment to request that his\/her entitlement be reviewed if they wish.  It is important to note, however, that any such review will involve a full reassessment of all of the customer&rsquo;s means to ensure that the person continues to receive the correct payment in line with their overall entitlement and such reviews cannot of their nature just focus on the income derived from the UK.  When conducting such a review, the conversion rate used is that applicable to the date of last increase in the sterling payment of the UK State Pension or the rate applicable in a subsequent quarter if that rate has been published by the date of the decision and is more favourable to the customer. <\/p>  <p>  Following the outcome of the UK referendum, negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU will take time.

The loans under the scheme range from &euro;100 to a maximum of &euro;2,000, and have a maximum interest rate of 12% per annum.  Over 1,200 loans were drawn down under the Scheme during the pilot with an overall value of over &euro;720,000.  The average individual loan value drawn down was &euro;500.  The focus of the pilot scheme was social welfare recipients who availed of the loans from their Credit Union and were facilitated, with their consent, in the repayment of such loans through the Household Budgeting facility, operated by An Post.  The deductions from their weekly social welfare payments were then transmitted on to the relevant Credit Union. <\/p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government<\/i>provides for the rollout and extension of the Personal Microcredit Scheme.  Following an evaluation of the pilot, the Implementation Group, which is chaired by my Department and comprises all relevant stakeholders, is working towards this aim.  <\/p><p>Incremental progress is being made towards extending the geographical coverage of the Personal Micro Credit Scheme through efforts to recruit Credit Unions to participate in the scheme.  To help with this I have written to all Credit Union Chairpersons and Managers to encourage their participation.  This is being followed up with engagement with the Credit Union representative bodies and individual credit unions.<\/p><p>Almost 80 Credit Unions are currently signed up to participate in the scheme, which will result in the availability of the <i>It Makes Sense <\/i>loan in almost 150 local Credit Union offices.

The Implementation Group is working through these enhancements and they will be incorporated into the scheme when finalised and the appropriate structures are in place.  <\/p><p>In regard to advertising, the Implementation Group has decided that the most appropriate approach is to promote the availability of the <i>It Makes Sense<\/i>loan at a local level, in the areas where Credit Unions are participating in the scheme.

This naturally has implications for how we approach trade, cooperation, and the movement of persons, both north-south and east-west. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding trade, we are all acutely conscious of the importance of the UK market to Irish exporters &ndash; let me assure you that every effort is being made to protect existing trade and to continue to grow it.  Furthermore, in my role as Minister for Trade, I am also intensifying our efforts on other markets, near and far.  I believe we have the capacity for much greater market penetration in other EU member states.  But we are also looking beyond Europe&rsquo;s borders.  Indeed, at a meeting of the Export Trade Council on 18 October there was a strong focus on markets in Asia in particular.  In September I attended the UN General Assembly where I had a series of bilateral meetings with countries from the Americas, Asia and the Antipodes.  I gave the strong message that Ireland will remain at the heart of Europe; we will continue to be an English speaking gateway to a market of 500 million people; and we will continue to offer a business friendly environment and a talented and adaptable workforce.   <\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to work closely and cooperatively with the Northern Ireland Executive, and at the last North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in July, it was agreed that the Irish Government and the Northern Irish Executive would work together to ensure that the Peace Process is protected. It was also agreed that how we cooperate north-south has to be fully recognised in any new arrangements.  An agreed work programme of ten clear actions was agreed, and these issues will be discussed again at the next NSMC on 18 November.  Regarding east-west relations, contacts between the Irish and British governments are ongoing at a political and official level, and the next British Irish Council summit will take place in Cardiff later this month.<\/p>  <p>  As part of our commitment to working cooperatively and collaboratively, the Government also held the inaugural All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit on 2 November in order to hear from people from all parts of the Island, with representatives from a broad range of civil society groups, trade unions, business groups, non-governmental organisations and representatives from political parties. Both north-south and east-west issues were discussed in detail, and the Government plans to deepen the analysis and build on the insights generated by this dialogue. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the movement of people, the Irish Government has been clear throughout all our discussions with our UK and EU counterparts that we are committed to maintaining the open and effectively invisible border and protecting the Common Travel Area (CTA).  The CTA is an important feature of the close relationship between Ireland and the UK with long-established benefits for trade and tourism between our two countries, both north-south and east-west.  The CTA allows for free movement between Ireland and the UK, but it also facilitates voting rights and access to social welfare for our respective citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800067#WRM01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Lottery Funding Disbursement","counter":618,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800067#WRM01250"},{"type":"question","counter":619,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[33273\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800067#WRM01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if national lottery funding is available at present through his Department to support the work of community groups; if so, if there are specific programmes eligible for grant assistance; the details of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":620,"content":"<p>My Department has not received any funding from the National Lottery Fund to support the work of community groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800067#WRM01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":621,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800067#WRM01450"},{"type":"question","counter":622,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[33323\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800067#WRM01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the killing and persecution of Christians in Mosul, Iraq generally and throughout the Middle East, by Islamic State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":623,"content":"<p>The protection of Christian and other religious minorities in Mosul, Iraq and across the Middle East from terrorism and religious extremism is a core objective for Ireland&rsquo;s human rights policies. <\/p><p>Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur or who the victims are.

The website has been populated with helpful information for both potential registrants and those whom they lobby featuring tailored guidelines for lobbyists and designated public officials, instructional videos, sample returns and frequently asked questions.

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and debilitating.  Many infected people have no symptoms at all.  The commonest noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called erythema migrans that is seen in about 80-90% of patients.  This red, raised skin rash (often called a bulls-eye rash) develops between 3 days and a month after a tick bite and spreads outwards from the initial bite site.  People can also complain of 'flu-like symptoms such as headache, sore throat, neck stiffness, fever, muscle aches and general fatigue.  Occasionally, there may be more serious symptoms involving the nervous system, joints, the heart or other tissues.  Lyme Disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe. <\/p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis is a notifiable infectious disease, the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form, Lyme neuroborreliosis.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects and collates surveillance data on the condition.  The Weekly Infectious Disease Report, published by the HPSC on 26 October 2016, indicated that for week 42-2016 (16\/10\/16-22\/10\/16) there have been 16 cases notified so far in 2016 - an increase of 5 on the same period last year.  However, the diverse and unspecific nature of the symptoms means that a number of the less serious cases may not be diagnosed, leading to an underreporting of cases.  Recent estimates suggest that there may be up to 50-100 cases in Ireland per year.<\/p>  <p>  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered. In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2006.  This pharmacological regime can be summarised thus:<\/p>  <p>  - Doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime for the treatment of adults with early localised or early disseminated Lyme disease associated with erythema migrans, in the absence of specific neurologic manifestations (ceftriaxone in early Lyme disease for adults with acute neurologic disease manifested by meningitis or radiculopathy);<\/p>  <p>  - Doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime for adults with Lyme arthritis but without clinical evidence of neurologic disease;<\/p>  <p>  - For late neurological disease in adults - intravenous ceftriaxone, cefotaxime or Penicillin G.<\/p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency and an Environmental Health Officer.  Representation has also been sought from a Lyme Disease advocacy group.<\/p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference of the Sub-Committee are:<\/p>  <p>  - To raise awareness in Ireland of Lyme Borreliosis amongst clinicians and the general public;<\/p>  <p>  - To identify and highlight best international practice in raising awareness about Lyme Borreliosis for the general public;<\/p>  <p>  - To develop policies of primary prevention of Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland based on best international practice;<\/p>  <p>  - To explore ways in which to improve surveillance of neuroborreliosis in Ireland;<\/p>  <p>  - To develop strategies to raise awareness among the general public particularly in areas of higher tick populations;<\/p>  <p>  - To produce a Final Report covering all the above areas.<\/p>  <p>  The initial work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involves a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland for general practitioners, and ongoing work in drawing together the Final Report of the Sub-committee.  The Sub-Committee  is expected to report in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800071#WRQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Investments","counter":807,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800071#WRQ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":808,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[33381\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800071#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the fact that taxpayer funds are currently invested in three separate tobacco companies as part of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, managed through the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA,; his views on the appropriateness of this investment; if he has expressed any concerns regarding this matter directly to the NTMA, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; his views on calls to add tobacco companies to the list of prohibited investment categories; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":809,"content":"<p>The Minister for Finance informs me that as at 31 October 2016 the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) had equity holdings in three tobacco companies with a value of &euro;1.5m or .02 per cent of its total assets.<\/p>  <p>  I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, that the Fund operates to high international standards and invests in line with both the UN-sponsored Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and the Santiago Principles, which are the globally accepted best practice principles for sovereign investment funds such as ISIF.

The vaccine has not been available in Ireland since the end of April 2015.  The manufacturer has had difficulties in the production of the BCG vaccine.  The manufacturer has informed the HSE there will be no supply of BCG until 2017.  Consequently, BCG vaccination clinics in HSE Clinics and Maternity hospitals have been postponed until new stock arrives.<\/p>  <p>  There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and to other countries within the EU.  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG\u00a0vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available.  The HSE has also asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which licenses and regulates all human medicines in Ireland, to source an alternate supplier of the BCG vaccine.  Efforts have been made to find a company who can provide the vaccine for use in Ireland which satisfies all the HPRA requirements on safety and efficacy.  To date no suitable alternative BCG product has been found.  Therefore the HSE has been unable to procure the BCG vaccine from any other source and still awaits the product from the HPRA licensed supplier of the vaccine. <\/p>  <p>  The supplier has indicated that supplies of the vaccine are not expected to be delivered into Ireland until early 2017.  When there is confirmation of the date of new supply a decision will be made, guided by the recommendations of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, on who should be prioritised to receive the vaccine.  Arrangements will then be made to administer the vaccine,  including to those prioritised in Cavan and Monaghan.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland the number of cases of tuberculosis (TB) has been falling.  TB is a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2016 (S.I. No. 276 of 2016).  In 2015, 318 cases of TB were notified to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, giving a national TB notification rate of 6.9 per 100,000, the lowest rate reported since surveillance commenced.  According to the World Health Organisation, the definition of a low incidence TB country is one with a national TB notification rate of less than 10 cases per 100,000, Ireland is in this category.  The risk to babies remains unchanged, even allowing for delay in getting BCG vaccine in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800071#WRQ04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rape Crisis Network Funding","counter":849,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800071#WRQ04700"},{"type":"question","counter":850,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[33435\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800071#WRQ04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will consider making funds available to facilitate the creation of a rape crisis outreach centre in Navan, County Meath (details supplied).

These are people from local communities who are trained in basic life support and the use of defibrillators that attend a potentially life threatening emergency in their area.

If an emergency 999\/112 call for cardiac arrest, choking, chest pain or breathing difficulties is made to the National Ambulance Service in an area where a CFR group is established, the on-duty CFR member gets a text from the National Ambulance Service at the same time that an ambulance is despatched with location and call details.

The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.

Recruitment is challenging given nursing shortages globally, intense competition at home and abroad and the standing of Irish trained nurses and midwives.<\/p>  <p>  There are many initiatives currently underway to improve staffing levels throughout the country.  The HSE is offering permanent posts to 2016 degree programme graduates, and full time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts.  The HSE is also focused on converting agency staffing to permanent posts.  The HSE's National Recruitment Service is actively operating rolling nursing recruitment campaigns.  The campaigns encompass General, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Registered Children's Nurses, and also Midwives.  In addition, a relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 is available to nurses who return from overseas.<\/p>  <p>  A number of specific measures have also been taken in relation to pay that will support the recruitment and retention of Irish nursing and midwifery graduates.  Measures to date  include the first stage of pay restoration under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, additional pay in return for taking on some duties from doctors and an increase in the rate of pay for the student nursing placement to 70% of the first point of the staff nurse pay scale.  Last month the Government approved restoration of incremental credit for all nurses in respect of the 36 week clinical placement undertaken by 4th year student nurses in the context of the 2017 Estimates.  This decision means that all nurses and midwives will receive incremental credit for the 36 week placement restored from 1 January 2017, restoration of the credit to 2016 and future graduates having been approved earlier this year.  It is estimated that the inclusion of 2011 to 2015 graduates will benefit around 4,000 nurses who are currently working within the public health service and potentially another 3,000 who may wish to return to the public system in the future.<\/p>  <p>  There has been an increase of almost 1,200 nurses employed in the public health service (34,336 to 35,534) from September 2014 to September 2016, numbers having fallen by almost 4,600 from 2007 to 2014.  The total budget for the health service in 2017 is &euro;14.6 billion, the highest budget ever allocated to the health service and this will allow for the recruitment of additional frontline staff to meet service needs.  It is intended that this will support the recruitment of up to 1,000 additional nurses.

The legislation will involve the making of regulations under the 2005 Act in tandem with the enactment of necessary amendments to that Act to allow existing qualified title users to continue to use the title.  It is my intention to seek Government approval to include these amendments to the Act in a Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that is currently being drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800076#WRV00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Funding","counter":1080,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800076#WRV00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1081,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[33807\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800076#WRV00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure that necessary funding is made available to a group (details supplied) to expedite orthotics for a person (details supplied);

This was to ensure that payments were targeted at &lsquo;trained young farmers&rsquo; who have a genuine interest in farming as a career.  Approximately 2,000 young farmers required Green Cert places arising from the education requirements of the Young Farmers Scheme and National Reserve.<\/p>  <p>  In order to address this situation, it was agreed that additional temporary resources would be provided to Teagasc to enable them to rapidly expand the number of Green Cert places and clear the back log of applications in the shortest possible timeframe.  In conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Teagasc was approved to appoint 70 education officers and 7 administrative staff on two year employment contracts.  The allocation of those resources to the different agricultural colleges etc. is an internal operational matter for Teagasc and not my Department.

The main element of the administrative check is an area assessment. This is achieved by using the Land Parcel Identification System which currently records some 1 million individual land parcels.<\/p>  <p>  The work of my Department in this critical area must meet demanding EU and national audit requirements.  Only valid applications under the BPS and ANC that fully comply with the requirements of the EU legislation are paid.  Consequently, all applications under the schemes are subject to administrative checks.  In 2016 these administrative checks commenced on 31st May when on-line applications were subject to preliminary checks to identify in particular over-claims and dual claims.  An overall \u00a0validation process was then carried out on all applications\u00a0once the data capture of 31,000 paper applications was completed.<\/p>  <p>  Cases that did not pass the validation process went into error and cannot be paid until the error concerned is resolved.  These errors include over-claims, dual claims and incomplete application forms.  My Department entered into correspondence, mainly through the issuing of query letters to farmers, in order to resolve these error cases.<\/p>  <p>  The selection of cases for on-the-spot-checks, either by means of\u00a0ground or\u00a0remote sensing inspection, is governed by EU regulations.  All cases to be selected for inspection must be eligible beneficiaries under the\u00a0various area-based schemes.  Therefore the selection of cases for inspection, while commencing\u00a0after the closing date for receipt of applications,\u00a0i.e. 15 May for the 2016 Scheme\u00a0year,\u00a0is an\u00a0on-going process so as to ensure this\u00a0specific regulatory requirement is\u00a0adhered to.<\/p>  <p>  The process of a\u00a0remote sensing inspection involves the comprehensive review of a range of satellite imagery received at various stages during the year to ensure that the actual\u00a0claimed area in the application form corresponds to the area farmed by the applicant, that the different crop types are as claimed, and that ineligible land or features are not included for payment purposes.  The EU regulations prescribe that for on-the-spot checks involving\u00a0land eligibility, any notice of an inspection must be strictly limited to the minimum period necessary and must not exceed 14 days.  As the commencement of a remote sensing inspection is dependent on the receipt of a range of satellite imagery throughout\u00a0the year it is not possible to give a definitive notice date.

It should be noted that there has never been a national waiver scheme for household waste collection.  During the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual Councils offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria.  As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then, for only a limited time. <\/p>  <p>  The vast majority of such contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired.  In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price.  However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions towards the cost of, or pay for, the collection of waste from certain households.

To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services. <\/p>  <p>  Approximately 1.3m premises in Ireland can now get high speed broadband and at least one mobile operator is delivering 4G services to over 90% of the population.\u00a0 It is estimated that up to 42% of premises in Co. Monaghan will have access to \u00a0commercial high speed broadband services provided by telecommunications operators, while the\u00a0remaining 58% consisting of just over 19,000 premises in Co. Monaghan will fall within the proposed State led intervention under the National Broadband Plan. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The breakdown of premises covered, per townland, is available on the High Speed Broadband Map at www.broadband.gov.ie.  The maps shows that 9% of the townland of Dohamlat, Co Monaghan\u00a0\u00a0falls within the AMBER area and\u00a0will therefore be included in the State intervention procurement process.\u00a0 The remaining 91% of Doohamlat\u00a0is included in the BLUE area where commercial providers are either currently delivering or previously indicated that they have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode. \u00a0If customers in Doohamlat, Co Monaghan cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode, and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The rollout of services by commercial operators in the BLUE area is being kept under constant review by the Department to ensure that all premises can get access to services, either through commercial investment or the State intervention. <\/p>  <p>  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area comprising\u00a0over 750,000 premises, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. \u00a0Householders and businesses may\u00a0get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.

It should be noted of course that the employees of a self-employed contractor would be eligible for the relief.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, an extension of the relief to the self-employed would likely provide an incentive for businesses to relocate north of the border in circumstances where the Irish income tax rates compared unfavourably with the prevailing UK rates. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, self-employed individuals have the option to incorporate and benefit from lower corporate tax rates whereas employees have no such option. One of the reasons for introducing the relief for cross-border employees was to shield their exposure to the higher rates of Irish income tax. There are no such exposures for a self-employed individual who incorporates his\/her sole trade.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance is aware of this position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800080#WRZ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement","counter":1313,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800080#WRZ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1314,"qnumday":492,"qnumall":"[33383\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800080#WRZ01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on the reports to the Human Rights Council and General Assembly by a UN independent expert warning that the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement is incompatible with the rule of law, democracy and human rights and gives undue power to corporations at the expense of national governments and human rights; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1315,"content":"<p>The Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) is a high standard trade agreement which safeguards and promotes the EU&rsquo;s norms and values.<\/p><p>It is important to note that Independent Experts are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.

I subsequently brought the Council&rsquo;s Competitiveness Scorecard report to the Cabinet Committee for Economy, Trade and Jobs and to Government for consideration prior to publication.  I set out how improved competitiveness has been a key part of the upturn and how Brexit means competitiveness is more important than ever for growth and jobs. All of the countries with whom we trade and compete with for FDI and export share are improving their performance. We cannot stand still.   Recommendations to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness particularly in light of Brexit will be included in the Council&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge report which will be submitted to me later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Favourable exchange rates vis-&agrave;-vis our main trading partners makes firms based in Ireland more cost competitive and allows them to trade more effectively in international markets. The value of the Euro against Sterling is critical for Irish exporters, particularly SMEs and employment intensive sectors such as the agri-food sector which are very dependent on strong trading activity with the UK. The value of Sterling weakened in the run up to the Referendum in the UK and has declined further in light of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s exposure to currency fluctuations &ndash; arising from our high level of trade outside the Euro area, particularly with the UK&ndash; reinforces the need to maintain focus on domestically influenced aspects of competitiveness.

While there is a lack of clarity as to how the negotiation process will proceed, the UK will remain an attractive market for many Irish companies, with a population of over 65 million people.<\/p><p>As a small, open, trade-dependent economy exchange rates, in particular, have a significant impact on Ireland&rsquo;s national competitiveness. The importance of exchange rate fluctuations was raised earlier this year by the National Competitiveness Council in a Competitiveness Bulletin, published in April.<\/p><p>This Bulletin noted that volatility in exchange rates always presents challenges. The current situation of a weakened Sterling rate means that Irish exports are now relatively more expensive in the EU, while conversely, imports from the UK are cheaper. This naturally, presents particular challenges to Irish firms exporting to the UK. <\/p><p>The present exchange rate volatility highlights the importance of focusing on a wide spectrum of competitiveness policies &ndash; in particular policies to enhance competition and productivity. A competitive, sustainable, cost base can help to create a virtuous circle between inflation, wage expectations and productivity, and can provide a buffer against such exchange rate fluctuations and other uncontrollable, external factors.<\/p><p>In July of this year, the National Competitiveness Council published its annual <i>Competitiveness Scorecard<\/i>benchmarking report which provides an in-depth assessment of all aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness performance. As well as highlighting Ireland&rsquo;s strong overall competitiveness, this year&rsquo;s report highlighted a range of competitiveness implications arising from Brexit &ndash; slower growth in the UK, the realignment of the deep inter-linkages between Ireland and the UK in terms of physical , economic and regulatory systems, both on and off the island, together with exchange rate fluctuations. <\/p><p>The Council also noted that Brexit brings into sharp focus the need for Irish based enterprise to step-up their own productivity and innovation performance to compete in international markets and for Ireland's policy system to be agile in responding to the competitiveness challenges and opportunities of the UK outside the EU.<\/p><p>The analysis contained in the Scorecard report is informing the development of the Council&rsquo;s annual policy report <i>Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge 2016<\/i>which will shortly be submitted to Government for consideration.

Under the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016, registered providers of pre-school services will, from 31st December 2016, be required to ensure that each employee working directly with children attending the service holds at least a major award in Early Childhood Care and Education at Level 5 on the National Qualifications Framework or a qualification deemed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to be equivalent. <\/p><p>Earlier this year my Department asked Childcare Committees Ireland (CCI) to lead on a national piece of work, with the 30 City and County Childcare Committees, to ascertain whether there were services who would struggle financially when the new regulations came into effect and all staff who were treated as part of the staff \/ child ratios would have to have a Level 5 qualification.<\/p><p>In working with services on this exercise, CCI was asked to explore  how challenges could be resolved <i>within existing resources. <\/i>In any services where difficulties are being experienced, the CCCs are tasked with supporting services to assess the contributing factors and manage any change that may assist the service.  This is done initially through the use of of business tools which focus on the finances and overheads of the service. For example, a fee calculation exercise looks at whether the fee being charged by the service is appropriate.  There is also a staff ratio calculation applied to look at the numbers of children in the service, when they are booked in, and what ratio needs to be applied.  For example, it may be that the service should take two fewer children in the morning, and two more in the afternoon in order to maximise the potential and run a viable service.  <\/p><p>This methodology has been found to be very effective in many services across the country, and whilst sometimes unpopular decisions have had to be made in the short term, the medium and long term results should justify these decisions.<\/p><p>I hope that the support offered to the services can assist them reform their services to enable them to continue. I will of course be working extremely hard to seek further investment in childcare that will improve affordability for parents but also assist providers in running viable and high quality services. My Department has long-standing relationships with community\/not-for-profit childcare providers, and recognises the important role that this sector has to play in childcare provision. I can certainly empathise with the challenges these services face and I continuously commend all early years services, particularly those operating on a not for profit basis, for the work they do.  <\/p><p>The CCI review  is due to be completed shortly, but preliminary results suggest that some services became over-reliant on unqualified CE participants to be part of core staff ratios over the years. Many services across the country began preparing for the regulations some time ago and have reduced or eliminated their reliance on CE participants as part of the ratios, but I understand that some remain, and this seems to be the case in the service in question.  <\/p><p>I believe that the work presently being undertaken by my Department and the CCI will influence policy over the coming months and years as we seek to establish a high quality childcare infrastructure in Ireland. You will also be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to independently evaluate the cost of providing childcare. This report will give us solid evidence which will also inform future policy. Such evidence will be critical to ensuring that whilst we work to make high quality childcare more accessible and affordable for parents, we also invest sufficiently to enable services to operate to high standards and attract and retain their valued staff.<\/p><p>CCI and Cork City CC are engaged with this service to identify the specific challenges that the service face and to make recommendations on a sustainable business model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800081#WRAA05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1406,"content":"<p>Question No. 523 answered with Question No. 44.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":1407,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800082#WRBB00250"},{"type":"question","counter":1408,"qnumday":524,"qnumall":"[33833\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800082#WRBB00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which she is satisfied regarding the adequacy of safety and protection measures for all children in institutions or foster care; if it is expected that extra protective measures will be introduced arising from experiences in the past; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

I am satisfied that Tusla takes its responsibility very seriously regarding the welfare of children in care and that there is a robust framework of regulations and standards, to ensure that children are placed in safe and caring settings.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla, within its national office, has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team.  This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, and includes detailed reporting on child safety and protection services.  Tusla also provides me with information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers.  Within my Department there is a Unit which scrutinises these reports and briefs me and senior officials on issues of note.  The reports also provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlights challenges and areas where further improvement is required such as the recruitment of additional social workers including link workers.

I wish to assure the Deputy that Tusla deals immediately with emergency cases, including for instance, if a child has been abandoned or is in immediate physical danger or at risk of sexual abuse.<\/p><p>At the end of Quarter 1 2016, Tusla reported that 60% of referrals received were of a child welfare concern with the remaining 40% related to child protection concerns.  The number of referrals reported over the last five years is detailed in the table categorised by child welfare or child protection concerns.<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Child Welfare Referrals<\/th><th>Child Protection Referrals<\/th><th>Total Number of Referrals<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>21,143       (53%)<\/td><td>19,044      (47%)<\/td><td>40,187<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>22,192       (53%)<\/td><td>19,407      (47%)<\/td><td>41,599<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>24,954       (57%)<\/td><td>18,576      (43%)<\/td><td>43,630<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>25,361       (58%)<\/td><td>18,235      (42%)<\/td><td>43,596<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016 (Q1) <\/td><td>6,754        (60%)<\/td><td>4,552      (40%)<\/td><td>11,306<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Referrals can come from a number of sources so there are some duplicates in these totals, and some will be more appropriate for universal services, such as those provided in the education or health sectors.  Also, not all referrals will result in a need for a social work service or in a child being received into care.  <\/p><p>Each referral received by the Agency is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  Preliminary screening is aimed at establishing the appropriateness of the referral to Tusla services and, if necessary, is followed by an initial assessment of the concern to determine the best course of action for the child and their family.  As a result, every year, approximately 50% of referrals can be expected to proceed from preliminary enquiry to the initial assessment stage. <\/p><p>Tusla's policy is to refer child welfare referrals to relevant family and community support services.  At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, from which there is an ongoing risk of significant harm, the child protection pathway is followed.  In a minority of cases this may lead to the child being placed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS) or the child being received into care.<\/p><p>At the end of August 2016, the number of cases awaiting allocation to a social worker stood at 4,727, a 30% decrease since December 2015.  The priority or category of high, medium or low given to the case after a preliminary enquiry, is based on information received.  It is important to note that &quot;high priority&quot; should not simply be equated with immediate risk.  Examples of cases categorised as high priority would include cases relating to a child subject to a child protection plan, a child in care living with non-approved relative carers, a child in care in an unstable placement or a young person at high risk.  At the end of August 2016, the number of high priority cases awaiting allocation was 639, a 36% decrease on December 2015.  Social work duty teams keep unallocated cases under review by regular checking to ascertain risk to the child, and where necessary will reprioritise the case. <\/p><p>My Department has a range of systems in place to ensure it is informed of risk to children and families.  Tusla, within its national office, has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team.  This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, and includes detailed reporting on key performance indicators on waiting times for cases to be allocated.  Tusla also provides me with information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers.  My officials use information provided by Tusla to monitor the current status of service provision and the effect as reforms to services take effect.  Activity indicators allow for attention to be focussed on areas where further improvement is required.  In addition to regular reports, Tusla also provides occasional or special topic reports, as needed, which can then be used for budget and resource planning.<\/p><p>As required under Section 8 of the Child Care Act 1991, my Department also receives the annual 'Review of Adequacy' report compiled and published by the Tusla, which reviews the adequacy of the child and family services provided by the Agency.<\/p><p>The additional funding of &euro;37 million which has been secured for Tusla in 2017 will provide increased resources to meet identified risks and service demands.  Key to reducing the number of cases awaiting allocation to a social worker, and the associated risk, is the recruitment of staff, including additional social workers and support personnel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800082#WRBB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Priorities","counter":1416,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800082#WRBB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1417,"qnumday":526,"qnumall":"[33835\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110800082#WRBB01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans for the development of child support services in the future having particular regard to challenges likely to arise; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1418,"content":"<p>Services which support children and young people structure and span the policy and operational domains of my Department.
