It is about time people realised that and about time the Opposition highlighted it.  It is about time the Government did something about it and legislated to improve people's lives.<\/p><p>  We are looking for an urgent debate on the changes to the health service mooted yesterday.  In that vein, I propose to amend the Order of Business to have an urgent debate today about the small hospital framework and the proposed grouping of hospitals in the two reports published yesterday by the Minister for Health.  It is important to have the debate today.  The reports are very vague and we do not know what will happen.  Specific commitments have been given to a number of hospitals, including Kerry, Wexford, Letterkenny and Waterford.  I congratulate the Leader on the representations I assume he made in respect of Waterford.<\/p><p>  There are winners and losers in this report.  Among the losers are Clonmel, Kilkenny and Castlebar, of which there is no mention in terms of the retention of services.  Navan is being downgraded yet today Deputies are reissuing promises about the accident and emergency units despite the fact that the report is very clear that the accident and emergency units will be reduced in status and hours.  There is a major question mark over the regional hospital for the north east, which was promised in a front-page article in <i>The Meath Chronicle<\/i> two weeks before the election.  At a briefing session last night, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, denied any knowledge of this.  There is also considerable doubt about services at Sligo hospital although there is a suggestion it will be linked to Letterkenny, which is specifically mentioned for the retention of services.  We need a debate to clarify exactly what is going on, who asked for what, who got what and whether this is being done for political interests, in the interest of consultants or in the interests of patients.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p><p>  With regard to the price of oil and gas and specifically motor fuels, a European Commission investigation started with dawn raids on a number of premises in the UK.  There are serious concerns about the price of fuel in this country.  Taxation is one aspect of this but another is the pricing of oil companies.  It is opportune for us to have a wide-ranging debate on this without straying into the European Commission investigation.  We could examine the price of fuel and why we are paying very high prices in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500003#B00500","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1368610200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>It would be good to have a debate on the hospital reconfiguration plan, which has received a broad welcome, although we do not think it should be today.

It is in line with the Labour Party manifesto commitment to initiate a wide review of the tax regime for oil and gas exploration.  It is an area around which there is the major concern about the terms on which oil and gas exploration companies have been able to conduct drilling and investigations.  It is good to see a review of it.  It would be good for the House to debate the terms on which oil and gas production should take place.  I ask the Leader for a debate before the summer recess.<\/p><p>I welcome the announcement by Dublin City Council that the dublinbikes scheme will be expanded to Kilmainham and Inchicore, on one side, and to the North Wall quay on the other side.

The number increased by 50% last year.  I knew people did not pay their television licence as it has a 15% non-compliance rate.  That 50% more people are going to jail for not paying their television licence fee means there must be a better solution than the one we have.  This is particularly the case when the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, says that next year he will do away with the television licence in so far as everyone must pay a licence fee irrespective of whether they have a television set.  It will increase the number of people who go to jail.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is already concerned about the number of people going to jail.  I had no idea so many people were going to jail for not paying their television licence fee.<\/p><p>I refer to what has been announced about substituting low carbon streetlamps in Scotland.  The savings arising from 100% low energy streetlamps are considerable.  In Aberdeenshire, 40,000 streetlamps were costing a substantial sum, &pound;1.6 million, and streetlamps made up 10% of the total carbon footprint of Fife Council.  The measures, which include investment of &pound;350 million in low carbon measures, will reduce energy bills by &pound;900 million in respect of streetlamps alone.  I have not heard this being discussed and it is something to which we should draw attention.

It is important that Members have a debate on this issue.  The Leader is aware the new configurations will have profound applications for acute hospital services across the State for generations to come and not simply for decades.  There are some positive aspects of the report, which I welcome, but people also have real and genuine fears on the establishment of these groups or trusts.  They pertain to how they will operate, the composition of their boards, their democratic accountability or lack thereof in respect of them and the fact that having six autonomous groups competing against one another for patients and services potentially will have implications for smaller hospitals.  The Leader and I are from the south east, where there was real concern that two hospitals in the region located in Wexford and Kilkenny would be taken out of the south-eastern configuration and placed in a new grouping with hospitals in Dublin and regarding the consequences that might have for Waterford Regional Hospital in the long term.  All these issues must be teased out properly.  People have genuine, real concerns and fears about all this and Members have a responsibility to ventilate them properly, as well as to challenge and question the Minister.

The Minister might come into the Chamber to clarify this point because I have investigated the issue and found the same situation arose in the United Kingdom.  The position there was challenged and VAT is not now charged in the United Kingdom on the provision of the same type of service.  Many couples and families who engage with the personal insolvency system will be hit with a 23% VAT charge on the cost and while one is told this will be borne by the banks, in effect such costs will be borne by the client.  Consequently, I ask the Minister to consider this point and I will forward to him the legislation from the United Kingdom that overturned the tax authorities' interpretation of it.  However, the Minister or the Minister of State should come into the House to explain the reason VAT is being charged here for a service, whereas it is not being charged in the United Kingdom for an identical system.<\/p><p>Second, on the property tax, if the Opposition read the legislation everyone knew it contained the 15% provision.

It is what it does not contain and certainly, I congratulate the Leader and his colleagues.  The south east definitely won its political argument, not least for maintenance but to be enhanced to being a university hospital.  In that regard, well done to the Leader in this regard.  However, the report does nothing to address the blatant disregard for the patients of the north west, in the context of how the clinical programmes, which cater so well for 80% of the population, completely ignore the health of the people in that area.  The region lacks both cardiac catheterisation facilities and cancer services despite all that is known - I need not mention again all the broken promises made before the election.  When I asked Professor Higgins last night about commitments and about what would be the position in the future for the population of 250,000 people served by Sligo Regional Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital, he simply expressed the hope that this synergy would continue.  However, it simply cannot be managed from University Hospital Galway, where the consultants themselves readily admit that hospital is beyond capacity.  At present in Sligo, at particular times it takes an hour to get an ambulance.  One hears talk of an air ambulance which, in the winter, for example, will fly up to 3 p.m.  I hope people can time their heart attacks because otherwise, they are dead.<\/p><p>As for last night's briefing, I completely agree with my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague.

Then I had Professor Higgins, for whom I have the utmost respect, tell me the road between Galway and Sligo will be improved in the fullness of time.  Is such a level of disdain and absolute contempt what the people who, on foot of the pre-election promises, are expecting Senator Ivana Bacik's centres of excellence, must accept?  This document is a sham.  It does nothing for the people of the north west, who had better make sure they do not have heart attacks or expect cancer treatment until the road is done up in the fullness of time, in the words of Professor Higgins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500004#C00800","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1368610800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The Senator's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500004#C00900","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1368610800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>How dare he?

The human rights situation must be monitored in particular, because it also is being downgraded in the interests of finance.  A signal of this development was the renaming of the Department of Foreign Affairs as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In this context, for example, I refer to organ harvesting in China.  One can fly into Shanghai, one goes to Hospital No. 1, one orders a liver and a prisoner is sedated.  Moreover, on occasions I understand the organs are removed from the body when this person is still alive.  This is not acceptable.  In addition, there are the self-immolations in Tibet and our friends in America are using drone aircraft to murder people without any trial or accusation but simply through the pushing of a button.  Consequently, we face a violation of the most fundamental aspects of human rights.  Similarly, I refer to the case of Mr. Magnitsky in the Russian Federation, as well as an attempt to blackmail the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade by the Russian Embassy, which threatened-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500004#C01500","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1368610800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500004#C01600","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1368610800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Yes, I seek a rolling debate because there are so many such issues and I note the anniversary is approaching of the arrest and detention of all the leaders of the Baha'i religious group in Iran.<\/p> <p>This would help to counterbalance the necessary emphasis on finance.

Tenants who move into voluntary housing units require assurance of their tenancy and guarantees on the maintenance and upkeep not only of the house but also of the estate.

In some towns in County Mayo one can buy diesel for &euro;1.41 per litre.  As one travels east, one notes garages are selling diesel for &euro;1.53 per litre, representing a difference of 12 cent per litre or, in some cases, &euro;8 or &euro;9 per fill of diesel.  We have discussed the issue of cartelism in the House before.  There must be a degree of cartelism in various towns because in any town one will not see one supplier selling diesel for &euro;1.41 a litre and another for &euro;1.53.  The prices in any town will all be either &euro;1.41, &euro;1.48 or &euro;1.53.  At a time when hard-pressed motorists are under so much pressure, I call on the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Finance to have it investigated.

On numerous occasions I have suggested that amendments be made to the Fines Act whereby fines can be deducted at source, be it wages or social welfare payments.  In this case, if an elderly person was unable to pay a television licence fee it would amount to just &euro;3 per week.

The current health insurance system is not sustainable, as both gentlemen said.  It is losing members, contrary to the Government's objective to have a universal health insurance system in operation in a few years.  The current system is protectionist and is not cost conscious.  The Minister said to Pat Kenny last night that people should check the bills to ascertain if they received all the items on them.  That is difficult for sick people to do.  We need competing companies but they cannot survive under the current rules, which are designed to benefit the VHI company, as has been pointed out by the European Court and the Supreme Court.  In the current edition of <i>Time <\/i>magazine the professor of global health in Harvard says: &quot;In Rwanda, for example, just ten years ago there was no community-based health insurance scheme.  Now almost 95% of Rwandans are involved in at least some kind of health insurance.&quot;  We might ask the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid, Deputy Joe Costello, to report on how that was done in Rwanda when it is proving impossible here.  Will the Leader impress upon the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, the need to redouble his efforts to make affordable universal health insurance available in this country, in light of recent research, including the ESRI report yesterday, which shows that the bulk of the burden of the recession has been borne by people under 45 years of age?<\/p><p>  Last Thursday, the Supreme Court overturned section 3 of the Industrial Relations Act as contrary to Article 15.2.1 of the Constitution.  The important part of this is that it was the usurpation of the functions of the Oireachtas by an administrative body.  There has been a number of those with regard to health insurance and taxis.  Can the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who has responsibility for reform in this area, be invited to address the House on the need to strengthen Parliament against the undermining of Parliament by the administrative arm?  One thing we must do in our reform programme, to which we are deeply committed, is address the institutions, practices and people which put the country on the rocks in 2008.  Undermining the Parliament by administrative action is unacceptable.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will address us on preventing recurrences of that nature.

Prior to the commencement of the walk, a letter from the founder of Pieta House, Joan Freeman, was read out in which she made certain commitments, among them that Pieta House would open more centres to ensure the organisation can play its part in dealing with the devastation suicide is causing in this country.  She also gave a commitment that she would not rest until the Government dealt seriously with the issue of suicide, to such a degree that Ireland can become a place to which the rest of the world might look for hope in respect of mental health and dealing with suicide.  I commend what the Government has done in this area already, but a great deal more must be done.  As has been regularly pointed out, there are many more deaths from suicide in this country than from car accidents.

I will not go into the detail of the report but I have grave concerns.  There appears to be an agenda to transfer the responsibility for centralising services to a group to be established under the direction of the Minister for Health.  That will affect hospitals in peripheral areas.  The north west has the largest geographical catchment area.  Letterkenny General Hospital is the seventh busiest hospital in respect of inpatient numbers nationally.  That hospital does not have regional hospital status and, as a result, it receives a smaller budget than other competing hospitals.  There is no university in the north west.  Due to those two factors, the hospital in Letterkenny will suffer.  There will be a focused centralisation of services at the closest point of contact with a university which, in this instance, is Galway.  That is a retrograde step.  It is a passing the buck exercise by the Minister for Health.<\/p><p>Finally, I refer to this morning's radio interview on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, regarding oil and gas exploration.  A totally unacceptable position was adopted by the Minister, who lectured the Irish Parliament and people prior to the last general election that there was total exploitation of natural oil and gas resources.  Now he has turned gamekeeper from poacher.  He has totally disregarded a cross-party report produced by the natural resources and agriculture committee over 12 months ago.  He put it on a shelf and it is now gathering dust.  He is kicking to touch on this issue.  The report makes clear recommendations on the licensing and taxation regime and it is time the Minister got off the fence and implemented it.  It is amazing.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, appears to have changed the spots on his skin since the last election with regard to this issue.

Criticisms in this regard were stoutly rebutted by the managers of these two local authorities, but the representatives of the Traveller community made a strong impact at the meeting as they called for an independent authority to deal with Traveller accommodation.  There has, undoubtedly, been a great deal of discrimination against Travellers for many years.  On the other hand, there has also been a great deal of anti-social behaviour by certain members of the Traveller community.

A good start would be to do what was done in the D&aacute;il yesterday, namely, to have a debate on the committee's report.  I am surprised that the D&aacute;il took the initiative in this regard ahead of the Seanad.  In fact, with others, I have called on several occasions for a debate of this type.  The D&aacute;il upstaged us in this instance because this is the type of debate in which we have always been to the forefront.  Senator Ivana Bacik may not be aware that the Minister was interviewed on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning and he impression he gave was that he did not intend to take up many of the specific recommendations made in the report, including the proposal for an increase in taxation.  While he made a very cogent argument in that regard, I am not sure I welcome everything he said in terms of the rationale for discarding several of the recommendations made in the report.<\/p><p>Will the Leader consider inviting the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, to the House once again?  He is a regular visitor - one of the few Ministers, in fact, to make himself available to us on a consistent basis - and usually very lucid and comprehensive in his exchanges with Members.  A report in recent days shows that farm incomes have dropped yet again, which is out of line with the perception that the farming community is doing very well relative to previous years.  There has been an astonishing reduction of &euro;5,000 in average income, bringing pay back to 2010 levels.  This worrying decline must be viewed in the context of the continuing severe weather conditions.  Will the Leader convey to the Minister the ongoing concerns of the farming sector about the fodder crisis?  It is not over by any stretch of the imagination.  Notwithstanding the few days of growth a fortnight or so ago, the weather in the past week has destroyed any improvement that was beginning to be seen.  We must maintain pressure on the Government in this regard.  I welcome the Minister's initiative in extending the subvention he has given for an additional two weeks.  He must, however, continue to monitor the situation on an ongoing basis.  I appreciate that he has a heavy workload, including the negotiations on the Common Fisheries Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy taking place during Ireland's Presidency.  We must not, however, forget that there are people experiencing great hardship in the farming community in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500007#F00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1368612600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Regarding the suggestion made by Senator Feargal Quinn on the introduction of low-energy lamps, I am pleased to report that my own county of Louth introduced the use of lamps with low carbon emissions some 12 or 13 years ago.  As I travelled to Dublin from Carlingford yesterday morning, via Dundalk and Drogheda, I passed thousands of traffic route lighting installations along the motorway, all of which seemed to be on for one hour longer than necessary.  If one can travel with side lights at that time of the morning, there is surely no need for the lighting to be on.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on energy costs for local authorities and how savings might be made and carbon emissions reduced?  There is certainly scope to reduce the megawatts of lighting on roads at least for certain periods of the night.  Senator Feargal Quinn mentioned a nine year payback period in terms of savings.  Without knowing the exact projections in this regard, I undertook an exercise to see what savings might be achieved.<\/p> <p>My own local authority, Louth County Council, would save &euro;500,000 on its lighting bill alone, and there would be a significant saving for all local authorities throughout the country.  I call for an urgent debate to review the cost of the lighting system and assess whether we are being charged too much at off-peak hours.  Importantly, this would also mean we would be playing our part in reducing carbon emissions throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500007#F00500","speaker":"1138","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368613200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I join with other speakers who yesterday paid tribute to that wonderful teenager, Donal Walsh, who unfortunately died over the weekend.  In particular, his appearance on \"The Late Late Show\" was a great inspiration to many people.  His work in regard to suicide displayed tremendous courage, faith and hope from somebody who realised he was terminally ill.  It is very difficult and nobody knows how they would react if they were in that situation.  It must be very easy to focus inward because of one's own personal predicament.  The fact he had such commitment to the common good, which superseded his own predicament, is a tremendous tribute to himself and his family.  I know others have expressed their admiration and their sympathy with his family, as I would wish to do.<\/p><p>One of the initiatives which the Leader undertook in this Seanad was the introduction of public consultation.  A report was issued in recent days which surveyed the unemployment situation in each county.  I am minded to raise this because youth unemployment in my county of Wexford is at an appalling level of 47%, which is terrible for those caught in that situation.  I ask the Leader to look at innovative ways, perhaps through public consultation, where we could engage with all interested parties and come forward with some measure that would really address this issue.  While the Government is making efforts and the previous Government took initiatives, this is not as effective as it needs to be, given the major issue unemployment has become.  Socially and in every other way, including in regard to health, it is having grave implications for society, particularly for those caught up in it.  If we did nothing but focus on that issue, we would be serving the State well.<\/p><p>Finally-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500008#G00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1368613200,"counter":82,"content":"<p>T&aacute; an t-&aacute;m istigh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500008#G00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1368613200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>We all received an invitation from Deputy Timmins within the past few days to attend the AV room this afternoon at 4.15 p.m. to hear Women Hurt, who are a group of women who have had abortions and who have shared their stories.

In this regard, it wrote to various Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas in early March, whom it was alleged were in receipt of donations for political purposes and had travelled to the US upon receipt of those donations.  The letter reminded those Members of their obligations in relation to the maximum donation permitted under the Electoral Act 1997, as amended.  Reminders issued on 24 April 2013.  The names of those Members were mentioned in various media articles in the last few weeks.  The Standards Commission also wrote to the Committees on Members' Interests of D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 12 March 2013 to ensure awareness of the new disclosure thresholds and donation limits that came into effect on 01 January 2013. <br \/><br \/>  On Monday 13 May 2013, a member of staff of the Secretariat of the Standards in Public Office Commission, Ms Jacqueline Moore, spoke to Mr Juno McEnroe of the Irish Examiner and in response to various questions in relation to this matter about to whom the Standards Commission had written and from whom replies had been received, information was provided indicating from whom no replies had been received and a general indication as to the responses from those from whom replies had been received.  The Standards Commission receives many calls from the media and is always happy to provide answers, albeit on the proviso that the information is not confidential, and does not come within the prohibition on release of information provisions in section 35 of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995. <br \/><br \/>  The Standards Commission rejects the allegation made by the Senator. <\/blockquote>That is the reply I have been asked to furnish to the House.  <\/p><p>  Senator Clune expressed concerns about Pfizer and the fact 130 jobs are under threat there.  We all hope the job losses will be minimised and that replacement jobs will be found for those who will lose their jobs.<\/p><p>  In response to Senator Norris, there are two Bills on the Order Paper today.  We will debate and examine legislation thoroughly as we get it.  In regard to a debate on human rights violations, I will ask the relevant Minister to come to the House as it is quite some time since we had a debate on human rights issues.<\/p><p>  Senator Landy referred to voluntary housing groups.  There was a requirement that these groups would register voluntarily but given that so few have responded, there may be a need to put this on a statutory basis.  It is an issue we can raise with the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who will be in the House shortly.  <\/p><p>  Senator Leyden referred to the hospital groupings, which we will debate.

Wind energy is a highly-topical issue and looks set to remain in public focus for some time to come.<\/p><p>It is important to clarify my exact role and that of my Department regarding wind energy.  I do not set policy on wind energy development or renewable energy, in general.  Nor do I have direct responsibility to deliver on Ireland's ambitious targets.  All of these matters are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  <\/p><p>As a member of Government, the issue of wind energy, specifically, and the wider related matters of energy security, emissions reduction, economic renewal by harnessing our abundant renewable energy sources and job creation are high on my agenda.  The Government has set challenging international and domestic targets in the area but is preparing to meet them head on.<\/p><p>My specific role as Minister of State responsible for housing and planning, is to provide the right policy and legislative framework for Ireland's planning system to function properly and in the interests of a wider good.  This includes the assessment of planning applications in respect of wind energy development.  <\/p><p>The planning system operates primarily through legislation set out under the Planning Acts and associated regulations. <\/p> <p>This provides a highly detailed and process-driven framework for forward planning, development management and enforcement.  As we are all too aware, it is not perfect.  We have already made some important legislative changes and signalled further fundamental legislative reforms with the announcement last week of our intention to establish an independent planning regulator.<\/p><p>The legislative underpinning for our planning system is supplemented by an extensive suite of statutory planning policy guidance.  Over 25 sets of such guidance exist, covering such matters as local area plans, environmental impact assessment, retail planning, spatial planning and national roads, development management and wind energy.  The existing wind energy development guidelines were published by my Department in June 2006.  They provide advice to planning authorities on catering for wind energy through the development plan process.  The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments.  A central component of the guidelines is the need for a plan-led approach by local authorities.  All development plans are therefore required to incorporate both a statement of the planning authority's policies and objectives in relation to wind energy development and matters it will take into account in assessing planning applications for specific wind energy development proposals.  Local authority development plans must achieve a balance between the overall Government policy on renewable energy and enabling the wind energy resources of the planning authority's area to be harnessed in a manner that is consistent with proper planning and sustainable development.  Authorities are required to identify through the development plan areas that are considered suitable or unsuitable for wind energy development.  This is intended to provide clarity for developers, the planning authority and, perhaps most importantly, the public at the earliest possible stage.<\/p><p>The making of a development plan is in theory a very open and transparent process, which provides opportunities for public participation.  In terms of planning reform, we have a job of work to do in encouraging community participation in forward planning development from conception to adoption.  This is not just restricted to wind energy development.  Senators will be all too familiar with situations in which communities became aware of a zoning designation or other planning decisions after the adoption of a statutory plan.  Individuals and communities have a real opportunity to shape the wider development plan and the wind strategies contained therein and it is incumbent on all public representatives to encourage their participation.<\/p><p>The plan-led and statement of overall policy approaches in the development plan and wind strategy provides the framework for the assessment of individual wind energy development proposals.  To further support the proper assessment of applications for wind energy development, the guidelines provide detailed advice to planning authorities on a range of potential impacts, including those related to natural heritage, ground conditions, archaeology, architectural heritage, safety aspects, wind-take and shadow flicker.  Specific guidance is also provided in respect of noise.  The guidelines state that the noise impact of proposed wind energy development should be assessed by reference to the nature and character of the relevant locations.  In the case of wind energy development, a noise sensitive location would include any occupied dwelling house, hostel, health building or place of worship and may include areas of particular scenic quality or special recreational amenity importance.  In general, a lower fixed limit of 45 dB or a maximum increase of 5 dB above background noise at nearby noise sensitive locations is considered appropriate to provide protection to wind energy development neighbours.  However, the guidelines also acknowledge that in very quiet areas, the use of a margin of 5 dB above background noise at nearby noise sensitive properties is not necessary to offer a reasonable degree of protection and may unduly restrict wind energy developments, which should be recognised as having wider national and global benefits.  Instead, in low-noise environments where background noise is less than 30 dB, it is recommended that the daytime level of the LA90 - ten minimum - of the wind energy development noise be limited to an absolute level within the range of 35 db to 40 dB.  It is also important to recognise that separate noise limits should apply for daytime and night-time.  During the night, the protection of external amenity becomes less important and the emphasis should be on preventing sleep disturbance.  A fixed limit of 43 dB will generally protect sleep inside properties during the night.<\/p><p>Currently, there are no specific conditions in the legislation covering the distance from sensitive properties, including houses, at which wind turbines should be sited.  I understand that the issue was considered when the existing wind energy guidelines were prepared in 2006, but it was decided that it would be impractical and inappropriate to set a minimum distance because distance alone does not dictate noise levels from wind energy developments.  A wide range of other factors can also impact on noise, including background noise levels, topography, local climatic factors and type and height of turbine.  The guidelines acknowledge, therefore, that, in general, noise is unlikely to be a significant problem where the distance from the nearest turbine to any noise sensitive property is more than 500 m.  They advise planning authorities to seek evidence that the types of turbine proposed in a particular development will use best engineering practice in terms of noise suppression and provide specific limits to permissible increases in noise above background noise from wind energy developments to protect neighbouring properties.  The current system, therefore, provides for a degree of specificity and uniformity across all planning authorities while leaving the final decision in the hands of local decision makers, who will have the benefit of submissions and observations from third parties.<\/p><p>The fact is, however, that the issue of noise has become the most contentious of all aspects of wind energy development.  In the last 15 months, two separate Bills have been published which focus largely on noise and its possible impact on human health, one of them by Senator Kelly who is in attendance.  I am aware of the genuine concerns held by Senator Kelly and Deputy Penrose which prompted the drafting of the two Bills.  I am also well aware of the concerns of many communities across the country regarding wind energy and noise in particular.  I have met with various stakeholders to discuss their concerns, including CREWE, which recently gave a very detailed presentation to the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It is important that these concerns be taken on board and properly addressed to ensure that Ireland can continue to meet its renewable energy targets while ensuring that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities.<\/p><p>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders, is undertaking a targeted review of certain aspects of the 2006 wind energy guidelines.  This is a timely review.  Wind energy technology has developed rapidly in the past number of years with, for instance, an increase in the height of turbines and also an expansion in the scale of many proposed projects.  I am keenly aware of the concerns that this has engendered.  We are looking at an industry where turbine heights of 150 m will not be out of the ordinary.  By way of contrast, the Spire in the centre of Dublin city is 120 m high, a point which has been made in the Seanad.  Development on this scale must be properly planned and decisions supported by the best evidence available.  My Department's focused review is examining the manner in which the guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise and proximity.  My Department issued a press notice in January of this year inviting submissions from the public on its targeted review.  More than 550 submissions were received from individual members of the public and various stakeholders in response to the notice.  This is a very strong response to what was the very first stage in a process that will provide further and more extensive opportunities for the public to shape the review.<\/p><p>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources recently commissioned the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to invite proposals from suitably-qualified organisations for the completion of a desk study of peer reviewed studies and other documents that examine the significance of noise related to onshore wind farms.  The objective of the study is to obtain evidence upon which to evaluate the appropriateness of the existing guidelines in relation to noise impacts and, if necessary, suggest changes.  It will take account of the following key contextual issues: the evolution of wind turbine technologies since the current guidelines were published in 2006; experience to date in the application of the current guidelines; research relating to wind turbine noise issues since the current guidelines were adopted; and Ireland's binding targets in relation to renewable energy update and penetration.  The study will form a key input into the review of the statutory guidelines.  It is expected to be completed by the end of the summer to facilitate the preparation and publication of revised statutory guidelines in draft form.  All statutory planning guidelines appear first in draft form for a public consultation during a period of a couple of months.  Once the consultation period is closed, any submissions on the draft guidelines are considered and taken into account in the final form of the guidelines.  As with all new or revised guidelines, the draft guidelines will be subject to extensive public consultation for a period of six weeks to two months.  The indicative timetable for the publication of the draft guidelines is the fourth quarter of 2013.<\/p> <p> I thank Senators for initiating this timely debate.  I am conscious of the concern in communities regarding the development of wind energy.  It is right to state my commitment to renewable, clean energy and I do not see the positions as mutually exclusive, nor do other Members.  We can fashion a renewable energy policy, underpinned by an open, transparent planning framework that delivers benefits for Ireland at both national and community level.  In that regard, I share the opinion expressed by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, that Bord na M&oacute;na's land holdings can play a crucial role in facilitating the development of wind energy in the years ahead.  Bord na M&oacute;na is already engaged in the wind industry and I look forward to seeing a strategic view of Bord na M&oacute;na's role advanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500010#J01100","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368615600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach inni&uacute; chun an t-&aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhactach seo a phl&eacute;.  Wind energy has garnered public attention over the past number of months and years.  This is not least due to the implications for local communities when large wind turbine enterprises are developed.  Wind energy has immense potential to provide a major renewable, environmentally friendly energy source in Ireland.  It is an integral part of the target to achieve 40% of electricity from renewable resources by 2020.  There are examples, not least in the constituency in which I live in Donegal, of wind farms being developed or planning applications pending and it is giving rise to genuine local concerns.  The 2006 guidelines, to which the Minister of State referred, and the submissions made as a result of the public call in January must be reflected upon.  The guidelines must be changed forthwith.<\/p><p>More than 1,100 turbines are in operation in Ireland.  The vast majority, on 176 wind farms, are onshore and only seven are located offshore in the Arklow Bay area.  Senator Kelly brought a well-constructed Bill before the House last year.  Unfortunately, I was not in a position to contribute because I was not in the House on that day.  We need clear and concise guidelines to deal with public disquiet, particularly in light of the great potential and the exploitation by multinational companies in respect of development of wind farms in the State.  We know what is happening in the midlands, with massive companies with huge resources coming in.  We welcome the development of renewable energy and we know that technology has moved substantially forward.  Boston College and other third level institutions have compiled detailed analysis and technical information showing that floating platforms can be used so that wind turbines can be developed at sea at a much lower cost than that argued by the wind companies.<\/p><p>Concerns are coming from local communities and these must be borne in mind.  I have received a large volume of representations from people in the constituency in which I live and other parts of country.  Setback distances deals predominantly with the noise issue and genuine health concerns.  There is medical evidence to suggest there are genuine health concerns that must be addressed.  Setback distances of at least 1 km from any occupied dwelling and, thereafter, further setback distances according to the height of the turbines must be set in legislation in order to alleviate concerns raised by genuine groups and members of the public.  The Bill introduced by Senator Kelly was supported but it seems to be sitting in the Department of the Communications, Energy and Natural Resources gathering dust.  Why is the Bill not being supported by the Government and brought forward before the House so that we can have an input into the debate?  We can make amendments and work constructively to bring about the change required.<\/p><p>Since the original guidelines were drafted in 2006, much has changed.  We know about the exploitation of the potential of wind energy by multinationals and the money they bring.  Very often, local authorities, the Government and the Department listen to the large multinationals instead of the communities.  That happened in the constituency in which I live and it is not right.<\/p><p>The height of wind turbines has increased threefold.  Other issues are the shadow flicker nuisance, the impact on the local economy in terms of tourism dependent enterprises, the noise and its effect on health and the reduction in the residential property values for properties in close proximity to the turbines.  One submission made to the Department is for setback distances to be based on the height of the turbine.  If the turbine is between 49 m and 99 m, the minimum distance should be 1 km.  Where turbines are higher than 99 m but do not exceed 149 m, the distance should be 1.5 km setback from any dwelling house.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500012#L00200","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1368615600,"counter":127,"content":"<p>There are many speakers and only one hour remains.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500012#L00300","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1368615600,"counter":128,"content":"<p>If the height is greater than 149 m, the distance should be more than 2 km.

This is an important debate and I am delighted to contribute to it.  Senator Tony Mulcahy is our energy spokesman but he is unavoidably delayed.  The Seanad is playing its part in inviting an international conference on wind energy and renewable energy to Dublin Castle on 21 and 22 June.  We will have further opportunity to discuss it with various interests, including MEPs from across Europe and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, who is the guest speaker.  Today, we will focus on wind energy and planning but we must also concentrate on why we need wind energy and good guidelines and regulations to ensure that what we put in place ensures outcomes and results, such as reducing our dependency on fossil fuel imports, ensuring investment in the network and delivering investor certainty through predictable response of regulatory policies.  It must be responsive to the needs of the community and the commercial people out there who will invest money in it on the ground.  Energy-related emissions account for almost 80% of the EU greenhouse gas emissions.  The vast majority of energy consumed on the island of Ireland, 90%, is imported.  We are highly dependent on imports.  In cash terms, that amounts to &euro;7 billion a year or &euro;1 million leaving the shores of Ireland every hour.  If we are targeting self-sufficiency, renewable energy and a reduction in greenhouse gas, we must be mindful of making regulations to ensure we can build towards self-sufficiency.<\/p><p>The Government renewable energy strategy launched in May 2012 outlines 36 specific recommendations.  In terms of the 2020 renewable energy target, we are at 630 MW.  We must achieve the 2020 renewable electricity targets because we do not have a way out.  We will pay dearly if we do not achieve them.<\/p> <p>Non-achievement will result in compliance costs and the necessity to purchase emissions permits.  As legislators, Members must take into consideration all these factors.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has estimated such costs could amount to approximately &euro;100 million to &euro;150 million per annum unless Ireland reaches its targets.  Consequently, a balanced view must be taken in respect of wind production, economic development and on jobs for the local community.  Most importantly, today's debate is about regulations to ensure that when wind turbines are put in place, the needs of the local community are taken into consideration.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State has outlined, a review is under way of the departmental wind energy development guidelines of 2006.  This review must consider that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy target, while at the same time ensuring wind energy does not have a negative impact on local communities.  While I am all in favour of renewable energy and wind farms, I am also conscious of the needs of local communities.  The Minister of State should ensure these are met through consultation, local democracy and so on.  I acknowledge that in her speech, the Minister of State outlined how she is going about the public consultation guidelines.  I have one further question on the timetable for publication of draft guidelines.  While I read somewhere they are due in the third or fourth quarter of 2013, the Minister of State might provide a date.<\/p><p>I understand a two-week consultation period took place in February 2013 in respect of energy guidelines.  As for the newer issues concerning the new technology and new research on noise pollution, a major debate on this issue is taking place at present in the midlands, County Donegal and right across the west of Ireland where there is potential for high-producing wind energy.  In this context, as Ireland's wind capacity on tap is four times as great as that in Germany, we must ensure that we avail of it.  However, Members also must ensure the fears of local residents are allayed and must put in place regulations, including statutory regulations.  The Minister of State will acknowledge that guidelines are one thing, while statutory guidelines and regulations are another.  When mobile telephone masts first came on the scene, I was a member of South Dublin County Council, which had precisely the same debate on regulations and guidelines.  Only guidelines were put in place, which were walked over and a horse and carriage driven through them.  At times, absolutely no notice was taken of them.  Guidelines sometimes are not worth the paper on which they are written.  It may not have been fashionable at the time but I had it written into South Dublin County Council's development plan that there should be a mandatory distance between masts.  I started with a gap of 300 m but found that such a restriction within an urban area would leave one without a telephone in south Dublin.  One must be careful that regulatory guidelines do not actually hinder development with no good cause for the residents.  In the case of mobile telephones, South Dublin County Council ended up with a statutory distance of 100 m written into its development plan.  Consequently, limits should be considered in a local context because a wind turbine situated in one area might not have the same noise level effect as one situated in another.<\/p><p>The experts are out there and the Minister of State awaits the report on the subject.  The current information deficit gives rise to unnecessary concern among some communities, as well as huge concerns among other communities.  People do not wish to wake up one morning to find a mast at their back door.  They wish to be assured that when buying a house in location A, B or C, the regulations or whatever is put in place cannot be interpreted by a planner with a different methodology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500012#L00700","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368616200,"counter":133,"content":"<p>The Senator must conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500013#M00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1368616200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I congratulate Senator Kelly on introducing a Bill to the Seanad.

As always, I welcome to the House the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  I share the environmental concerns that have moved the Senators to introduce the Bill and they undoubtedly will deal with them.  However, it raises concerns that windmills are noisy and they disturb neighbourhoods.  It is a matter of opinion as to whether they are visually intrusive in the countryside - it is my personal view that they are.<\/p><p>However, I wish to raise the economics of this matter with the Minister of State.  I hope the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, will also take up this issue.  The OECD review of the Irish economy called for a &quot;discontinuation of supports for offshore, wave and tidal energy&quot;.  Environmentalists have been very successful in putting forward the view that this is all free.  However, this is not the case, as it is highly expensive energy.  Moreover, it adds to the costs of energy in Ireland.  The cost in 2011 of the public service obligation, PSO, scheme to support high-cost energy was &euro;157 million, of which &euro;43 million was for renewables.  While I might have some view that it is bad if environmental concerns are raised by Senator Whelan and his colleagues, it is a matter of some concern that those who are doing it, thereby making the cost of electricity in Ireland dearer, are subsidised.<\/p><p>In the international comparisons I have considered, Denmark, which is held as the great centre of the wind industry, invariably has the most expensive electricity.  Is this related to the amount of wind energy Denmark is using?  It costs &euro;0.29 per kilowatt-hour there, as opposed to Ireland's rate of &euro;0.21 per kilowatt-hour and importantly, the equivalent figure of &euro;0.16 per kilowatt-hour in the United Kingdom.  How are we supposed to make electricity here with wind and export it to the United Kingdom, when that country already appears to have electricity prices that are approximately one fifth lower than Ireland's?  Why are subsidies required to do it?  In other words, the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte or the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, should at some time ensure Members actually get the numbers on what this costs.  One should not simply make this fashionable, environmental and so on.  If it is damaging the economy, that is serious.<\/p><p>To put it another way, if wind energy is so good, why is the sector always seeking subsidies, in addition to annoying Senators in their neighbourhoods?  What price of alternative fuels should we build into the model?  Documents were circulated to Members of the Oireachtas by the Shannon LNG proposal, which, as Members are aware, is to import liquefied natural gas to the mouth of the Shannon.  The group states that compared with a United Kingdom price of $9.17, they can import gas from the United States at $2.59.  While one wishes to prevent imports - I appreciate Senator Keane's point in this regard - perhaps some imports are actually better value than are the windmill-based projects.  There is a revival under way in the economy of the United States at present based on its ability through fracking to become energy-independent.  I acknowledge fracking has environmental aspects and our colleague, Senator Mooney, is concerned about its impact in County Leitrim, as are others in respect of County Fermanagh.  However, the United States has become independent by using sources of energy such as fracking and gas.  What if this then becomes the shadow price against which Ireland should evaluate wind and tidal projects?  The OECD tells us we should phase out the subsidies under the renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT, which is a kind of back-door subsidy to the windmill industry.  While the subsidy is relatively small, the OECD recommends it should be phased out over a period.  What will the market look like then?  In addition, it points out that if one opts for high wind energy targets, another problem arises in the cost of connecting it to the grid, as the latter goes through people's farms and so on.  An ESRI estimate indicates it could add up to 9.8% to an already high cost of electricity in Ireland.  This is from the Forf&aacute;s Review of Energy Competitiveness Issues and Priorities for Enterprise dated December 2011.  It also states the only way in which Ireland is remaining competitive is through a rebate scheme for large users of electricity and this is due to be phased out this year.  Consequently, why would we wish to add to our electricity bills?  Why should we seek the imposition of these PSO levies?  Why did the OECD, to say the least, cast a bucket of cold water over some of the renewables in the circumstances in which Ireland finds itself?<\/p><p>Consequently, I would like the economics underlying this issue investigated much more thoroughly.  All Members have heard the advocates of wind, waves and so on but my question is whether it stands up in an economy in which, as Members learned yesterday, the impact of the recession has been borne overwhelmingly by people under the age of 45.  We are trying to get the country back on its feet after the disasters between 2008 and 2010.  Is this a luxury, as has been shown in Denmark, we cannot afford?  Should Ireland not be looking at the low-cost countries producing electricity, which are the United Kingdom and France, as that is what Ireland needs to be internationally competitive?<\/p> <p>In addition to the environmental aspects, there is a lack of economic expertise in the Department.  There are many advocates and engineers who will build everything if we give them grants to do so but it is not necessarily in the wider national interest.  The consumer interest, in addition to the environmental interest, may be overlooked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500013#M00400","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368616800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to discuss this very important issue on which we have had interaction on a couple of occasions.  I have been beating my drum for the past 14 months since the introduction of my wind turbines Bill, which was very reasonable.  There was a similar set of circumstances in the United Kingdom when I introduced my Bill although the setback distances in the United Kingdom were much greater than those I was proposing.  My Bill was endorsed by many county councils from around the country.  When the Bill went as far as Donegal County Council, the county manager asked that the 500 m guideline already in place be lifted so turbines could be put at every crossroads in the county.  Since the introduction of my Bill, it seems there has been a race to the finish line.  Wind energy developers are trying to get planning permission applications in as quickly as possible in case there is any change with regard to the guidelines.  The Minister of State, who was in the House last week when the findings of the European Court of Justice were raised, will know that all the planning permissions granted between 1999 and 2012 were deemed illegal because they did not comply with an EU directive.  As a result of the court ruling, which I put on the record of the House last week, the Government, local authorities and wind energy sector will be open to being sued unless the issue is dealt with.  I outlined how it could be dealt with, that is, by a revocation of some of the planning permissions by the county councils and also by the withdrawal of the REFIT funding available to the wind energy sector.<\/p><p>To learn the effects of wind turbines on people, all one needs to do is talk to Dorothy and Michael Keane in Roscommon who lived 750 m from wind turbines and had to leave their house.  I passed by the turbines last week and on a close-by road.  The turbines are 100 m high and it is scary to look at them.  They are monstrous, yet they are only 100 m high.  When the guidelines were introduced in 2006, they were based on turbines that were 54 m high, approximately half of 100 m.  The turbines being erected at present all around the country are as high as 185 m, which is three and a half times the height of the original turbines, yet the specified set-back distance of 500 m is the same for all.  This guideline is being breached right across the country.<\/p><p>Wind energy policy was initiated by the last Government.  We are just playing along with it.  As Senator Barrett quite rightly pointed out, we need to examine the economics of wind energy.  Over the past 14 months, I have stuck to the core issues, namely, planning and the distance turbines should be from people's homes.  The other broad debate concerns what Senator Barrett alluded to.  It appears we are losing money.  We will not have cheaper electricity, but dearer electricity.  By the time we are ready to export electricity to the United Kingdom, it could be so dear it will not take it from us.  We could be landed with it and will have lost a lot of money.<\/p><p>What cost-benefit analysis has been done to date by people who know the business?  With the greatest of respect to civil servants, it is the Civil Service that was in place in 2006 that is still examining this issue.<\/p><p>I am dealing with people from every part of the country, including Damien McCallig in Donegal, who is quite rightly asking questions about a wind turbine that fell down in Glenties on 25 March.  Mr. McCallig is not receiving answers from anybody on how it happened.<\/p><p>It is really frustrating that we are still talking about this 14 months on.  As Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill quite rightly pointed out, all the public representatives are representing the people right across the country who are affected by wind turbines.  We and they are in the majority but the civil servants' views are the views that are being listened to.<\/p><p>In Roscommon, I deal with Mike de Jong and Ted Kelly, two very intelligent people.  I also deal with Mr. Ray Burn in Wexford, a very intelligent and well-read person.  These men know what they are talking about.  I deal with Mr. Peter Crossan in Donegal and Yvonne Cronin in Galway.  They all know what they are talking about but we are not listening to them.  We are listening to a group of civil servants for whom it is a case of business as usual.<\/p><p>With regard to the excuses we are listening to the whole time, such as the excuse that there are targets to be reached, we set a target in 2006 that 40% of our energy must be green energy in 2020.  On what scientific basis did we arrive at a figure of 40%?  Why was it not 80% or 20%?  When we came up with the figure, did we consider what it would mean infrastructurally?  Will it mean that we must have turbines at every crossroads, with the whole country crisscrossed by pylons, destroying absolutely our beautiful landscape?  A survey carried out in Donegal recently indicated the people are saying that if the county were to be destroyed by wind turbines, it would have a serious effect on tourism.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that the economics of wind energy is not the remit of the Minister of State but that of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I plead with her, however, to listen to the views of all the Senators who are to speak today on how wind turbines and wind farm developments are really affecting those people who must live beside them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500014#N00200","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1368616800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I agree with most of what has been said thus far.  The development of the wind energy strategy in Ireland has been an absolute shambles.  I place a lot of the blame on previous Administrations.  I will try to stick to the planning elements.  I was at a meeting in Moycullen in Galway on 19 February.  There are eight wind farms planned for that area, with 103 turbines within an 8 km radius.  Twenty-nine of those are to be within 4 miles of Moycullen village.  The implication is that there will be 1,176 trucks driving through that small village.  There does not appear to be much of a traffic management plan in place.  Each of the turbines requires 80 truckloads of concrete.  Therefore, in the case of one of the farms, 800 truckloads of concrete will be required.  The impact on the local community is massive.  A large segment of the local community was present at the meeting.  They claimed there was no meaningful public consultation on these developments whatsoever.<\/p><p>There is a lack of guidelines at national level and a lack of joined-up thinking between the various Departments that are dealing with various elements of the matter.  This is part of the problem.<\/p><p>There is a very interesting case before the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions that relates to Lettergunnet-Derrycrih windfarm.  It was brought by Yvonne Cronin and cites that there are six instances of contravention of the county development plan due to the omission of documents.  These include the community noise assessment, community impact assessment, habitats directive assessment, peatland conservation management plan, land and site susceptibility and risk management documentation and an environmental impact assessment, the last of which was not prepared.  The case never received a hearing because of a technicality.  The petitioners in question tried to have the planning permission revoked under section 44 of the planning legislation but, thus far, Galway County Council has not availed of the opportunity to do so.<\/p><p>There is very much a sense that the developers and executives in the county councils are working hand in hand on this issue.  This raises questions as to a conflict of interest in councils as they are due to benefit greatly from the erection of wind turbines across the county because of the moneys they will receive.  Therefore, one could argue it would be in the interest of the executives in the county council to put up as many wind turbines as possible.  From having talked to people in communities, I know they feel they have been ridden over roughshod or that there has been a sleight of hand regarding consultation processes, site notices, etc. <\/p><p>Considerable issues arise over developments that are going ahead and the way planning issues are being policed even when planning permission has been granted.  I have been told of instances in which blasting happens without people being consulted.  I have been told about considerable traffic congestion, insufficient traffic-management plans, traffic-management plans that were not communicated to local communities and noise from some of the sites.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister of State's opinion on the six documents I listed.<\/p> <p>Is the Department happy that all documents such as noise assessments, community impact statements, habitats directive assessments or HDAs and so forth are in place for every development?  If not, the relevant developments should be reviewed.  <\/p><p>As regards the use of section 44 of the planning Act, does the Minister of State believe councils should use it?  There is also a huge disparity among county councils in the way the guidelines are implemented.  Some will state one can locate a wind farm in a special area of conservation, SAC, while others will state one cannot.  What happens in these cases is that developers are given planning permission under wind energy strategies to develop wind farms very close to houses.  That is the reason many of them are totally unacceptable.<\/p><p>I am also anxious to hear the Minister of State's views on the concept that a public servant in a county council, for example, could be a director of EirGrid.  EirGrid is the organisation that grants the connections to the network.  There is a potential conflict of interest in terms of the county councils making a huge gain from where these connections might be put in place.  Wind energy is a natural resource.  This country made huge mistakes in the way it licensed oil and gas exploration.  I hope we do not take the same route in the way we develop wind energy projects, whereby it is totally developer-led and there is very little gain for local communities.  I agree with other Senators who have said there should be a moratorium on developments until we review the developments in place.  We must move on Senator John Kelly's wind turbines Bill.  Although it would not go far enough, it would at least be a first step.  We also must examine the European Court of Justice ruling which the Senator mentioned and consider making the provisions illegal because of the potential cost to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500014#N00300","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368617400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this issue.  Like Senator Sean D. Barrett, I will focus on the economic climate.  I appreciate it is not within the Minister of State's remit, but we are discussing wind energy.<\/p><p>The cost of energy has come down and we must keep it down.  Competitiveness is a serious issue for us, if we are to continue to attract foreign direct investment.  Energy policy is political and geopolitical.  Things change and the types and sources of power and energy available can change.  Senator Sean D. Barrett made a point I intended to make about the United States, where fracking is a new energy source.  As a result, the cost of energy has decreased and the United States is becoming more independent in its energy production.  Whether that is good or bad is another debate.<\/p><p>The targets we have are EU-wide targets.  We have committed to these targets, including having 40% of our electricity produced from renewables by 2020.  They are binding targets and to be implemented on a worldwide basis to ensure a reduction in emissions.  Nonetheless, there must be a balance when focusing on the cost of energy.  After 2020 further commitments will be made.  We do not know what they will be, but, as Senator C&aacute;it Keane said, it is important that people involved in the industry have certainty as we move forward.<\/p><p>I am glad that we have signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Kingdom to explore the potential of exporting electricity from this island or importing it.  However, many issues must be considered.  The cost of transmitting electricity is expensive.  Wind energy is free, but it is expensive to provide it at the point of use.  Most of the wind energy resource is along the west coast, but the cost of transmission is extremely expensive.  If we are to build interconnectors, will there be a fall-back on the consumer or those using the energy supplied?  That must not be the case.  We must also consider the fact that in our engagement with the United Kingdom Scotland has the potential to produce an enormous amount of wind energy and that it will probably be cheaper to import energy supplies from there through Great Britain than across the Irish Sea.  These considerations must be taken into account.<\/p><p>The OECD recommends that all incentives for wind energy production be lifted.  Taking that route would produce a level playing field.  There are many questions surrounding the economics of wind energy projects and they must be answered.  The task the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, is undertaking, of exploring the potential of exporting renewable energy to and engaging with the United Kingdom, will greatly focus minds on the financial benefits, or lack thereof, of wind energy production.  <\/p><p>I am sure we will debate this subject again.  Perhaps we will receive answers then and there will be a focus on the economics of the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500015#O00200","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1368617400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and thank her for agreeing to this debate which was sought only a short time ago by the Seanad.  She is receptive to our views and not dismissive of our position on the issue.  We are not looking for anything more than a little balance to be brought to the policy on wind energy production.<\/p><p>I am pleased and heartened that the Minister of State mentioned the community concern in her statement.  The Seanad has taken an early lead on this issue, as has been recognised.  Senator John Kelly brought forward a Bill at an early juncture to try to establish a balance in the debate.  Neither he nor I is against renewable energy or wind energy production which we consider has a role to play in the economic redevelopment of the country.  However, I am certain that we will be sleepwalking into another planning fiasco, another bubble and economic fiasco if we embrace what is on the table without questioning and amending it - a total of 2,500 giant turbines in the midlands, as a result of which everybody will walk away as a millionaire and have a swimming pool and there will be 70,000 jobs.  That was the proposition put to us as recently as a few months ago by the wind energy developers.  Now, because some of us have raised legitimate concerns on behalf of the communities and families in these areas, we are categorised as being anti-development, anti-wind energy and, in my case, anti-farmer.  I reject this as I live in a rural part of the country and all of my neighbours are farmers.  As my colleagues in the House who come from farming backgrounds know, I am very conscious of the needs of farming and rural communities.  We should stick to the issues and policy matters involved in the debate rather than personalising the issue.<\/p><p>The guidelines are at the heart of this discussion.  It is not Senator John Kelly or other colleagues in the House who are agitating or generating obstructive public debate on this issue.  Go to Clonbullogue, Ballyroan, Vicarstown or Rosenallis in the heart of the Slieve Bloom mountains, while tomorrow night communities from The Swan and Wolfhill are meeting in Luggacurran.  It is an organic response from communities which is being organised by women who are concerned that there will be turbines in their backyards.  They are concerned about the welfare and well-being of their families and it is a genuine concern.  I have a simple question for the wind energy developers.  Would they agree to have one or up to five of these turbines in their own backyard?  That is essentially what is being proposed.  If they cannot give an honest answer to that question, why would they impose it on their neighbours?  That is at the heart of the planning process.  As the Minister of State said, the scale of these turbines is not like anything we have seen previously.<\/p><p>The reason there should be a moratorium is that we are giving planning permission, the planning process is in train without proper regulation and there are no proper ground rules in place.  The wind energy developers are travelling through counties Laois, Offaly and Westmeath in the evening and at night with their cheque books.  They are signing up with options for everybody in an area, knowing that they do not intend to place turbines on that land or in these areas.  As they are not the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, why would they sign a contract for &euro;3,000?  They are doing so in areas that have not been designated for the development of wind farms.<\/p> <p>They are showing no regard for planning provisions or county development plans.<\/p><p>I emphasise that this is not merely a personal view or position.  The economist Colm McCarthy has pointed out that we are building the next bubble and will require a NAMA for wind farms at some future date.  Economists at the ESRI, meanwhile, have described the plan as currently constituted as unworkable.  The insight offered by these independent persons and bodies should be embedded in the guidelines, and those guidelines must be statutorily binding and consistently applied throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500015#O00300","speaker":"1143","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368618000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Everybody accepts that alternative and renewable energy projects are vital for this country's future.  The Bill brought forward by Senator John Kelly in this regard has great merit and deserves serious consideration by the Government.  The major issue, however, is location.  In Germany, for example, turbines are located on national primary routes, at considerable distance from residential areas.  Any of us could sit down and quickly identify locations in this country which would be suitable for wind turbines and which, crucially, would not impact on residences, which is the primary objective.  At the very least, we must have some type of arrangement whereby in cases where it is deemed to be in the national interest, it would be in order for an arrangement to be made between the Government, developers and landowners.  The ESB has always followed certain rules and guidelines in regard to the erection of electricity lines, many of which are lain along national primary routes.<\/p><p>As far as smaller units are concerned, it is essential that communities have the capacity to develop small wind turbines that would supply energy for a number of houses in an area.  Again, however, guidelines should apply in terms of required distances from dwellings.  The case of the family outside of Roscommon to which Senator Kelly and others referred is very upsetting.  These people settled in that location for the peace and tranquillity it offered, but now find themselves living beside a wind turbine.  It is not that the noise is excessive but rather that it is constant, which is very distressing for them.  We must consider all the options.  The offshore option, for instance, is very attractive albeit more expensive.  There are several unoccupied islands off our shores which might offer suitable locations for development.<\/p><p>We all accept that our potential to harness alternative energy sources must be explored.  There is a market abroad for what we can produce and development of this area will allow us to reduce our oil imports.  These are very practical benefits but, as I said, we must explore all our options and not just in the case of wind energy.  There are opportunities for harnessing small rivers, for example.  In Athleague in County Roscommon, for instance, the old mill on the River Suck could be mobilised for water turbines.  Yet no action is being taken in this regard.  There is, in fact, little evidence of an innovative approach by the State in the provision of alternative energy.  There should, as a matter of priority, be enhanced support for small enterprises to provide turbines, whether for wind or water energy.  There is also potential to facilitate the production of the turbines themselves in this State.  As I understand it, most of the equipment is currently imported from China.<\/p><p>In short, there is a balance to be struck in all of this.  Senator Kelly's Bill, with amendments, should be reconsidered by the Government.  It would offer some certainty to families who are very concerned by the location of these turbines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500016#P00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1368618000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this interesting debate.  Security of energy supply is vital for the economy and for society.  That supply must be continuous and must meet the everyday needs of homes and businesses.  Ireland's energy network compares favourably with those of our European counterparts and maintaining that network must be a priority if we are to continue to attract foreign direct investment.<\/p><p>Given that fossil fuel resources are finite, the capacity to establish a stable and robust supply of energy from alternative and renewable sources is imperative.  The renewable energy network must be capable of meeting the needs of the economy and society now and into the future.  Ireland is in an enviable position in this regard in possessing massive potential for wind energy, particularly along the western coastline.  By harnessing this resource, we can ensure a clean and effective energy supply which will ultimately reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels.  Moreover, by developing and investing in these technologies we will be meeting our obligations under the renewable energy directive, which requires Ireland to increase its take from renewable energies by 40% by 2020.  Reducing our dependence on imported fuels, meanwhile, has the additional benefit of significantly reducing our atmospheric CO2 levels.<\/p><p>There is an additional potential benefit for Ireland in investing in wind technology, namely, not only to supply domestic demand but to exceed it and thus offer opportunities for export.  In this regard, I welcome the memorandum of understanding that was recently agreed by the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, and his British counterpart establishing a commitment between Ireland and the United Kingdom to work closely in harnessing the economic benefits from a mutual trade in renewable energy.  The memorandum is a first step in establishing a successful export market for renewable energy which will reap benefits for the State in terms of employment growth and export earnings from the domestic market.  The United Kingdom is facing a potential energy shortage by 2015, which presents an opportunity for Ireland.  I also welcomed the Minister's announcement in April of an extension to the REFIT 2 scheme, which gives investors until 2017 to assist in achieving renewable energy targets.  This creates a positive incentive for investors in the renewable energy sector and will further assist in the achievement of our green energy targets, particularly in the wind energy sector.<\/p><p>I agree that it is important to consider the concerns of local communities when establishing new technologies.  Above all, the highest international standards of health and safety, environment and visual impact must be adhered to at all times.  In this regard, Government policy includes an imperative for State companies and individuals to engage early and with transparency with local communities and stakeholders in all energy projects.  In addition, State companies are mandated to plan developments in a safe and effective manner and to mitigate, as far as possible, the impact on the human environment and landscape.<\/p><p>The wind energy guidelines, which offer advice to planning authorities on a framework for wind energy projects, are under review.  I welcome this progress.  Much of the technology involved in delivering wind and renewable energy is very new.  As that technology continues to evolve and improve, so too should the guidelines in respect of the planning process.  There is a great deal of work to be done in this area and a balance must be found in terms of minimising the impact on local communities and the environment.  The potential of alternative energy to reduce our over-reliance on a finite import resource is substantial.  That will be an important consideration in devising an energy policy that is capable of meeting the demands of our economy and society into the future.  There is much to be gained from exploring the opportunities that exist in this area.  I listened carefully to Senator John Kelly when he spoke about the problems arising from the location of wind turbines on lowlands or in close proximity to buildings.  Along the western seaboard, however, there is ample opportunity to build the technology at a suitable distance from residences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500016#P00300","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1368618000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  This is a subject that causes raised eyebrows throughout the country, no more so than in Donegal where, from my experience as a councillor over the years, there is something of a negative view towards the development of wind energy.<\/p> <p>There seemed to an attitude in the east of Donegal, although it was not such an issue for the west of the county because we had the tourism factor there.  Everyone recognises the vast potential for wind energy in a county like Donegal.  However, the situation is similar to that concerning the mobile phone masts.  The biggest issue in that regard was that communities were not consulted and, therefore, they felt that something was going on in the background, whether between the council and developers or between certain individuals who had inside knowledge.  While this was not correct much of the time, it was a factor.<\/p><p>In one case, three years ago, a mobile phone mast was being erected near a school in Ramelton and the community was totally opposed to it.  To be fair, the company involved met and sat down with local people, and agreed to look for another site outside the town.  As a result, the issue of the mobile phone mast died overnight.  Legally, the company could have pushed the mast on the area, and it had all the background information to allay health fears, but it felt the community had to be consulted as they were the people who would have to live there for the rest of their days.<\/p><p>There is a psychological issue in having a turbine close by and visible in an area where people expect to see just hills or mountains.  Even if there is no health evidence, it is like the situation where a decommissioned ESB pole is hanging over a house, in that the fact it is there causes a difficulty.  The county councils and companies must consider this issue.<\/p><p>I urge that Senator Kelly&rsquo;s Bill be pushed forward by the Government sooner rather than later.  This all comes down to local communities getting a say and ensuring that fears are allayed.  There are parts of Donegal where no one is living for miles, and there may be a case for turbines to be located in such areas.  I am a supporter of alternative energy and believe everybody has a positive view of it.  However, this should not be to the detriment of the tourism industry and local communities.  I know 99.9% of a local community will work with those who want to develop wind turbines or mobile phone masts.  While I do not know how county councils are being directed at this stage, Senator Kelly's Bill is a good template the councils could use.  Nonetheless, the local people are as important as the planning office.  My experience is that, at times, some planners have a different attitude from other planners, and difficulties have arisen where a planner was determined to push ahead with a project against the wishes of the community.  This is where the whole thing falls down.  We should be cautious with all our legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500016#P00400","speaker":"1144","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368618600,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I support Senator Kelly and his colleagues.

This is a community in which everyone works together to be more efficient in the use of energy and it is a major team effort.  The development of a sustainable energy community requires an holistic approach, with the public sector, private sector and homeowners working together to reduce energy costs and their own energy bills.  The sustainable energy community in Dundalk is playing its part in achieving our national energy targets for 2020, having been established by the SEAI in conjunction with Louth County Council, other local authorities and other local and national partners.  Those bodies must be applauded for their vision and commitment to reducing energy costs and carbon emissions.  I believe SEAI, together with other local authorities, hopes to establish other sustainable energy communities similar to that at Dundalk.<\/p><p>Dundalk 2020 has successfully established a number of projects which save approximately 5,000 tonnes of CO2 gas emissions being emitted into the atmosphere annually, which is a major success.  The Dundalk zone is a 4 sq. km area where 2,500 people live, 3,000 people work and 5,800 people are in full-time education.  The Louth local authorities were the first bodies to implement a structured energy management system and they established a dedicated team that has in the past eight years saved &euro;500,000 for Louth County Council.  Dundalk Institute of Technology, DKIT, has installed an 850 KW wind turbine on its campus as well as a 125 KW storage battery to store energy, and I understand this is contributing to a reduction in the energy costs of the college campus.  In addition, 160 residents in the Ard Easmuinn estate in Dundalk, working together to conserve energy, have saved themselves in excess of &euro;300,000 per annum.  These examples of what has been achieved in Dundalk should be emulated in all local authority areas throughout the country, thereby saving energy and costs and, importantly, saving on emissions of CO2 to our atmosphere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500017#Q00200","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1368618600,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

Well over ten years ago in south Tipperary, in a small place called Ahenny on the fringes of Carrick-on-Suir and on the border of Tipperary and Kilkenny, a wind energy development company came visiting.  It tried to destroy that area with a wind farm.  I and other people in the area fought it on the basis of the destruction of the community and of the scenic and historical value of the Ahenny high crosses which were located there.  We won that battle and the company went away.  However, it has divided the community up to this day.  There were people in the community who were promised money, who were called on late at night and who were given post-signed cheques.  However, they never got to draw down those cheques and, to this day, they do not speak to me.  That is what this type of thing does to communities in this country, and we need to be aware of it.<\/p><p>At the moment, the same thing is happening again.  People have been visited across Laois and other areas and they have been promised money before any public consultation has taken place.  A public consultation is supposed to consult with communities, developers, the State and the local authority to see that what is being implemented is in the best interest of the community and also of the economics of the country.<\/p> <p>That is not happening.  The public consultation process in this country is a joke, not only in respect of wind energy but in respect of every other service.  I have attended meetings where hundreds of people congregate in small halls in rural Ireland.  The developers are there wearing their suits giving their hand-outs to the people.  There is no discussion or independent analysis of what is happening and no independent body set up or provided to examine what exactly happens as a result of the discussions.  Then we go away and grant planning permission.<\/p><p>Local authorities bring forward county development plans on a six-year rolling basis.  There is now a requirement within those county development plans to deal with wind energy.  Developers are riding over those plans, ignoring them in their rush to put up wind farms across the country.  I was a councillor for 23 years, as were many other people here.  If we go to meetings with concerned citizens about issues such as wind energy and tell them that as councillors we have no power whatsoever because the county development plans will be overridden by guidelines, what is the purpose of local authorities?  The guidelines that Senator Kelly is bringing forward need to be brought forward as statutory powers implemented in each county development plan.  This needs to happen quickly.  We do not want the opportunity to develop an energy source in this country because it will end up in the Supreme Court and will drag on for years on end.  That is what will happen.  I ask the Minister of State to give the lead in this and take action on the planning process.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will deal with the economics and the energy benefit.  I know that the Minister of State will deal with this and I look forward to her coming forward on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500017#Q00300","speaker":"1162","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368619200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

I am not sure that will happen.<\/p><p>There is a serious problem in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources because the Green Party&rsquo;s legacy from the last Government is still in place.  I mean no disrespect to Fianna F&aacute;il.  The other crew was the problem.  That legacy exists and it is wind, wind and more wind.  There are several biomass projects in the country, one of which I am promoting, a wood-burning industry that will create 5,000 farm incomes and provide real jobs in the construction and running of the plant and provide a renewable resource in the growing of timber to continue it.  That is a closed economy in the locality.  Domestic waste to energy projects, sewage waste to energy projects would also provide real jobs and income.  They would provide a small amount of electricity to our grid, and locally they will provide income in closed economies.  There is an absolute resistance within the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and within CER to anything other than wind.

A great deal of consideration must be given to this policy before we drive ahead and put up all these turbines.

There was a high level of engagement, concern and knowledge.  A couple of common themes emerged, the main one being the importance of the community, of listening to what the community has to say and of real consultation.  That is an absolute priority for me too.  As I said in my opening statement, we received 550 submissions when we had the initial consultation.  We will have a further statutory consultation later in the year.  I encourage people to give their views to the Department so that they will be in the mix.  I am sure the Senators will do likewise.  I too have received e-mails from people and Senator Whelan is right to say that women are leading in this respect.  People are expressing real and genuine concern.  It is our duty as legislators to ensure that we take those concerns on board.<\/p><p>This is about balance because we must also consider the statutory obligations and commitments that we have entered into and the importance of renewable energy in respect of climate change, etc., nationally and internationally.  We must take those obligations seriously too.  Everybody who contributed to the debate acknowledged that.  I think I have outlined the process fairly clearly already.  We will now read the submissions we have received and take them into consideration for draft guidelines which will be put out for public consultation for a period of between six weeks and two months.  The final guidelines will be developed from that process.<\/p><p>Some of the matters raised were strictly speaking for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and for the Government as a whole.  Senators Barrett, Clune and Mulcahy raised the broader issues of value for money and the benefit to the country.  I have no doubt that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is working on those areas.  It has also commissioned a study from Sustainable Energy Ireland which will feed into our process.  That is a somewhat limited study.  It does not cover the broad issues that the Senators raised.  There are much broader issues that must be addressed.<\/p> <p>A number of Senators highlighted the issue of consistency in the application and interpretation of plans.  I have strong views in this regard and I have been in touch with the local authorities with regard to what we call the hierarchy of plans, in other words, that other plans and guidelines should be taken into account in the drafting of development plans.  Some local authorities are better than others with regard to enforcement and compliance with the various statutory guidelines and plans.  This is an important issue.  <\/p><p>I refer to the significant role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la is available to be used by the public.  Senator Kelly and others are of the view that distances should be specified in legislation.  However, technology is changing.  Senator Mulcahy referred to the very large turbines that may or may not be coming down the line.  A number of factors relate to the technology of how to deal with the effect of noise on those living and working near the proposed developments.  It is reasonable to wait for the expert and peer review.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte has established a review of practices in other countries, such as Scotland, which will inform any decision.  We need to inform ourselves about a very rapidly changing situation.  The original guidelines were drawn up when turbines were much lower in height than the proposed turbines.  <\/p><p>On the suggestion that there should be a distance of 1,000 m between the turbines and other buildings, NUI Maynooth has carried out studies which show that a 1 km setback would mean only 9.4% of the country would be available for consideration for wind turbines.  Higher levels of setback for higher turbines would mean that even less of the country would be available.  The Department is considering that data from NUI Maynooth.  Many factors need to be taken into account but I accept that the view of the community must be to the fore and it may not have been taken into consideration heretofore.  I assure the House that from my perspective, this view will be taken into consideration.  As public representatives we must ensure that the views of local people are a central part of the consideration, while also ensuring that binding targets are achieved.  We will need to exploit the opportunities for the country presented by our natural advantage in a number of renewable technologies and energy.<\/p><p>I thank all those who contributed to the debate.  I have tried to respond as directly as I can to the points raised but I am available to hear other views.  I have outlined the timeframe for the process and the House will be informed of progress.  When the draft guidelines are issued I expect to hear very strong views expressed by those Senators who hold them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500018#R00500","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368619800,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I propose the suspension of the sitting until 3 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500019#S00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1368619800,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

The sustainability of the pensions system is a particular concern.  The demographics, or population bonuses, Ireland has mean we have many more older people living a lot longer.  In recent years the social welfare budget has gone up by &euro;200 million to &euro;300 million per annum in respect of an increase in the number of older people qualifying for retirement payments against the background of a deterioration in the public finance.<\/p><p>In the future the task of financing increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population.  Currently, there are 5.3 people at work to one retired person, but by 2060 the figure will decline to 2.1 working adults to one older person.  Life expectancy in Ireland is increasing and while this is a very welcome development, it also presents very real and obvious public policy challenges as to how we provide for the retirement people would like to enjoy.  It was in that context and the context of the financial crash the country had suffered, that in April 2012 I commissioned the OECD to review long-term pension policy in Ireland.  I launched the completed review of the pensions system jointly with the OECD on 22 April.  It is informed by the extensive consultation undertaken by the OECD in Ireland but also internationally as part of its work.  It takes account of the considerable body of work already completed in Ireland on the analysis of the pensions system and the different proposals for reform brought forward in recent years.  It provides excellent comparative data between the pension arrangements in Ireland and those in OECD countries with comparable systems.  It draws on international experience and examples in the recommendations and options proposed for reform.  It looks at critical issues, that is, the sustainability of the pensions system in the light of population and investment challenges; adequacy and coverage levels in order to ensure an adequate income in retirement, with a particular focus on the lower and middle income group; the modernity of pension systems to ensure flexibility in the labour market and supporting mechanisms for longer working; and equity within the pensions system.<\/p><p>During its visits to Ireland the OECD team met the representatives of a broad range of sectoral organisations, including representatives of older people, the pensions industry, employer and trade union groups, and academic, social and economic policy experts.<\/p> <p>It worked closely with my own officials and those in other Departments.  In addition, I hosted a very successful consultation forum, including all relevant stakeholders, at Farmleigh House in September 2012 when the OECD was presenting a preliminary assessment of its thoughts on pensions in Ireland.  The good news is that Ireland is in a relatively favourable position compared with most OECD countries with regard to pension spending and the adequacy of retirement income provision.  Most importantly, the economic situation of pensioners in Ireland is comparatively good with respect to other age groups in the population and international comparators.  The report also shows that recent decisions which have been made are in line with the roadmap needed for pensions reform.  Compared to the rest of the population, older people have the lowest poverty rates at 1.9% and are least likely to be at risk of poverty, which points to the adequacy of the State pension.  This highlights why it has been important to protect core pension and welfare rates, which I have been able to do in recent budgets.  However, the report also raises question marks about aspects of the Irish pensions system.  This is precisely why we asked an independent, respected body like the OECD to give us its objective perspective.  We must ensure that the State pension remains sustainable in light of demographic changes and that the public finances can support these changes.<\/p><p>I have introduced a number of significant reforms to pensions in recent years.  In 2014, the State pension age will be standardised at 66.  The State pension age will then be increased over time to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  In September 2012, a number of changes to the State pension rate bands came into effect for new customers.  In order to simplify the State pension, a move to a total-contributions approach to determining eligibility for the State pension is already planned in 2020 to replace the current averaging system.  This is a measure which is supported by the OECD.  These reforms will ensure that the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.  Aligning the rate of pension paid with the contribution made ensures that those who contribute more during a working life will benefit more in retirement.  It also makes the State pension system more transparent.  The overall objective of the pension system in Ireland is to provide an adequate and sustainable basic standard of living through direct State supports and to encourage people through generous tax reliefs to make supplementary pension provision so that they may have an adequate income replacement rate when they retire from work.<\/p><p>While the State pension is expected to provide sufficient retirement income for the lowest paid workers, many people retiring from work will have a significant income gap if they do not have supplementary private pension provision.  However, only 51% of people in employment aged 20 to 69 have pension coverage.  This relatively low rate of pension coverage is a key concern of the Government.  This is why the programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers.  We are talking, for instance, about women, many of whom have varied working patterns due to family commitments at different stages in their lives, and about atypical workers.  Many employers with zero-hour contracts offer relatively small employment hours and the people on such contracts often rely on two or three days social welfare per week to bring their incomes up to an adequate level.  It is for this reason that we are looking at an auto-enrolment system.  Such schemes are a very positive way to increase supplementary pension coverage.  As well as giving a pension to people who may never have received one, the scale of a single pensions system would bring benefits in terms of lower charges.<\/p><p>I issued the report on charges in the Irish pensions system a few months ago.  While the report identified that charges in Ireland can be very high, particularly for very small schemes, overall many of the charges for the larger schemes are broadly in line with international levels.  I recognise, however, that the introduction of an auto-enrolment system would be best supported by a more favourable economic environment than currently exists.  An auto-enrolment scheme is something I would look to introduce when the economy is in better shape and people's incomes have recovered.  In that context, the findings and recommendations of the OECD report are not prescriptive.  I note that the OECD did not do costings on all of the recommendations it made.  The recommendations are more indicative of a broad roadmap of what the country requires if it aims to have a sustainable pensions system which meets people's expectations, particularly younger and middle-aged people who come to retire in 20 to 30 years time.<\/p><p>The report provides a wide choice of measures for consideration which involve a number of Departments.  None of the structural options put forward has been costed and detailed analysis of some of these options will be required before decisions can be brought to Government.  The report is being examined in detail and I will bring a response to Government for decision setting out a roadmap for long-term pensions policy in Ireland.  We must recognise that there are costs involved in providing for good retirement incomes and that the earlier we can bring forward reform, the better.  My aim is to ensure that we engage actively in this process to ensure that all older people have a safe and secure retirement with an income which is capable of meeting the expectations they have for their retirement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500020#T00300","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368620400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I could not help but reflect while listening to her contribution that the much-maligned Fianna F&aacute;il Administration of 2002 to 2007 had an enduring legacy in the vision of the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, in setting up the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It was unique.  As subsequent events were to prove, it was a very useful pot into which the last Government and current Administration have been able to dip for reasons other than those for which it was established.  The Minister will remember clearly the buzzwords when the fund was established, including the reference to a pensions \"time bomb\".  The issue of a pensions time bomb has become more rather than less acute in the intervening years due to the changing demographic profile of the Irish population.  I have no doubt that it will continue to actively concern the Government and its successors.  I hope we do not ever reach a point where the non-productive element of the population starts to outstrip the productive element and that one person will be working to supplement the income of two who are retired.  That is what the pensions time bomb means.<\/p><p>The report is logical.  It recognises the importance of greater security for those approaching retirement and of ensuring fairness for younger workers saving for retirement.  It acknowledges that anomalies have built up which must be addressed.  The basic conclusion of the report is that the current system is disjointed and inconsistent in its coverage of and outcomes for public and private-sector workers and State pensioners.  The Minister addressed these issues to a great extent in her contribution.  There are certain figures in the report which suggest rather starkly the challenge faced by the Government.  According to the Pensions Board, only 54% of people in the workforce have pension coverage.  While the public service coverage is in excess of 90%, coverage in other areas is exceptionally low.  In the hotel and restaurants sector, coverage is only 23%.  In the wholesale and retail trade, coverage is only 25%.  These are stark figures which present the reality of the challenges the Government faces in squaring the circle.<\/p><p>An interesting aspect of the debate is that employers are obliged by law to offer employees access to a pension.<\/p> <p>Only 43% of those interviewed had not been offered access.  Of those, 93% had never asked an employer about access to a pension.  I am sure the Minister will have some comments on that.  The other aspect of the statistics concerns awareness of the tax relief on pension contributions.  While it is high, at 73%, the majority of people did not know or had incorrectly understood the amount of tax relief that applies.  Perhaps this is something the Department of Social Protection, in terms of knowledge and communications, could examine.<\/p><p>Some consideration has been given to mandatory pensions but the Minister has not touched upon it.  I can understand why because it is a thorny issue.  The State must grapple with the issue in years to come.  An interesting comparator is the Australian style of a compulsory 9% superannuation.  While attractive in the short-term, it would be politically unacceptable for any party in government in light of the continuing demands on the Irish electorate in terms of widening the tax base.  Of the OECD countries, only Ireland and New Zealand do not have compulsory pensions saving.  I am not suggesting the Minister should fly a kite because it is a political timebomb.  Any Government would shy away from it in the current tax environment.  The OECD report states that mandatory contributions to pensions may be perceived as a tax, discouraging people from working.<\/p><p>On the tax treatment of pension contributions, the OECD report has unequivocally concluded that the Government system of tax incentives disproportionately benefits higher income groups.  For those who have incomes too low to pay income tax and credits, the OECD proposes a Government subsidy or a matching contribution in an individual's retirement savings.  I refer to the Administration from 2002 to 2007.  One legacy, now long forgotten and consigned to history, is the SSIA scheme that encouraged people to save.  It was a runaway success.  It worked well in that case and perhaps, in the context of the Government providing a matching contribution or subsidy to an individual's saving scheme, it may be worth examining.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party recognises that pension tax relief is a significant cost to the State.  Our most recent budget proposals envisage a reduction in the annual earnings limit.<\/p><p>One of the persistent criticisms of the private pension industry is that it is designed to make vast sums of money for the pensions manufacturers, fund managers, administrators and intermediaries.  I can never get my head around it.  It is often described as opaque, confusing and offering mediocre to poor value for the pension holders.  The Department of Social Protection issued a report last year showing the impact of high charges, particularly in the case of small schemes.  Perhaps the Minister will comment in this respect.  We are encouraging people to take out pensions in their 20s.  The report showed that in the case of someone who saved &euro;250 a month from the age of 35, after 30 years of saving, and without any charges, the pension would amount to &euro;10,000 in retirement.  The average charge of 2.18% per year, it reduces the fund by &euro;62,000 leaving a sum of &euro;6,900.  This is a scandal.  The pension industry has much to be answerable for and I am sure the Minister, being the determined Minister she is, will have some issues in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500021#U00200","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368621000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  As she is one of the star performers in Cabinet and is no shrinking violet by any stretch of the imagination, I have no doubt the future of pensions is in good hands.  She will work diligently and determinedly to put together a template based on the recommendations of the OECD report referred to by Senator Paschal Mooney.<\/p><p>I agree with much of the commentary of Senator Mooney.  It is interesting to reflect on the time of Charlie McCreevy and the concept of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It is an awful shame they did not get more things right.  If they had, perhaps we would be in a better position to fund pensions.  It is important to acknowledge where good things were done and I am happy to do so.  The OECD report provides a template of best practice and the ideal scenario.  We must tailor that according to our needs.  We must implement a timeframe according to our economic recovery and tailor it in a way that suits our population.<\/p><p>It is a positive development that the health of the nation has improved to such a degree that we are dealing with the problem.  The idea that two adults will work to sustain one elderly person is why we invest in health services.  That is due to the advent of modern technology and improvements in medicine.  It leads us to the situation and is reflected internationally.  With that in mind, it is important to plan in the long term.  It is important to ensure the foundation is put in place during this Administration to ensure the problem is adequately dealt with.<\/p><p>The pension age will increase incrementally between now and 2022.  That is reflective of an ageing population.  It is important and critical that we get this right.  It is not a party political issue but it is a political issue.  It is not a political football because we are dealing with the future of every citizen in this country.  We need cross-party and cross-political consensus as far as it is achievable to ensure an effective, proper structured framework is in place so that when people come of age and move into their late 60s and early 70s, they have the comfort and security of being financially independent during good healthy years.<\/p><p>A couple of other issues have also been referred to, including the scandalous behaviour of pension companies.  This country has seen the devastation caused by the reckless and inadequately regulated banking industry.  We need tighter regulation in terms of pensions.  I commend the Minister for what she said in this regard.  I have no doubt it will be dealt with adequately.  The figures quoted by Senator Mooney, whereby &euro;3,100 is lost per annum in the case of someone who saves &euro;250 per week, is shocking and extremely worrying.  It is the greed of the private sector, which led this country into the state we are in.  It is the greed of right-wing economics.  The idea of light touch regulation did not work, as clearly demonstrated throughout the world.  Let us regulate it.  If necessary, I have no problem with overregulation as it is protecting the future of our people.  The notion of survival right-wing politics, philosophy and economics has totally failed throughout the whole world.  It will not resolve the challenges we face.  I was asked to speak on this topic at a late hour but I commend the Minister and I wish her well in an extremely important task for the future of our nation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500022#V00200","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1368621000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  When the Minister has the opportunity, I look forward to her publishing and discussing her planned roadmap for long-term pensions policy in Ireland.  This debate shows the interest we have in the policy.<\/p> <p>As time is limited, I wish to share my initial thoughts on the OECD review.  I have two major concerns regarding the manner in which the pensions system is operating - our ageing population and the State's reliance on current expenditure to cover pension costs.  I will address the latter first.  <\/p><p>Private companies fund their pension schemes through future liabilities, but the State uses current expenditure.  In the private sector many pension schemes have been adjusted, modified or even closed to new entrants and it has been necessary to cut entitlements.  While I am not happy about any of this, it is the reality of what is happening.  However, there is a real generational issue and the current generation is set to lose out.  The ESRI report published yesterday shows clearly that those who are in their 40s or under are bearing the brunt of the recession.  The national pensions framework published in March 2010 showed that there were six workers to each pensioner.  However, that figure will be halved by 2032 to a ratio of 3:1 and by 2050 there will only be two workers to each pensioner.  Moreover, that is not guesswork but mathematics.<\/p><p>The ratio in the public sector is more startling and has been exacerbated by early retirements and the recruitment moratorium.  The same generation that is disproportionately affected by the recession through high unemployment, mortgage arrears and negative equity will also be obliged to pay the price of a pensions shortfall unless the issue is dealt with.  By the time this generation retires, there will be nothing left in the pot.  There is a social insurance fund deficit of &euro;1.5 billion per year.  According to KPMG, the deficit will reach &euro;324 billion in the next 55 years unless action is taken now.  This sum of &euro;324 billion is a phenomenal amount.  It is nearly twice the national debt and more than twice Ireland's GDP in 2011.  Consequently, we really must get serious about talking about solutions and not simply talking about the ageing population.  There must be discussions on whether benefits will be reduced or whether PRSI contributions will be increased.  It has been estimated that PRSI contributions would need to be raised by three quarters from now, were that bill to be met over 55 years.  That is an indication of how serious this matter is.  Consideration must be given to providing an incentive for employers and employees to invest.  Senator Paschal Mooney mentioned the position in Australia, but I note the Labor Party Government there introduced that scheme in 1992 with a 3% contribution.  Thereafter, over a 15 year period, the Australian authorities raised the figure to 9%.  Perhaps there is an opportunity to start at a figure of 1% or 2% at a low age and then to raise it.  I do not suggest this is the answer, but the figures are dramatic and drastic and this is not a problem out of which one can hope the economy will naturally lift Ireland.<\/p><p>It is known that the earlier one starts to invest in one's pension, the better.  As the Minister stated, the basic State pension in Ireland is relatively generous when compared with that in other OECD countries, but I note retirees in other countries often receive bigger pensions overall because they contribute to mandatory pension schemes.  That is their culture and the system.  I also note the recent European Union White Paper, An Agenda for Adequate, Safe and Sustainable Pensions, concluded the financial pressure of an ageing population inevitably would lead to longer working lives and the need for private pension funding to fill the gap left by reductions in public pensions.  One need only consider the situation in Waterford Crystal regarding its defined benefit scheme.  One worker retires and receives 100%, but six months later the next one retires and receives between 18% and 20%.  Is that fair or equitable?<\/p><p>I will move on briefly to the issue of the ageing population.  Everyone is aware that in common with the rest of Europe, Ireland has an ageing population.  A total of 781,000 people, or approximately 7% of the population, are aged 60 years and over.  This figure is expected to double by 2050, when it will account for 29% of the population.  An ageing population will have serious consequences for Ireland, including longer working lives, lower economic growth, labour shortages, reduced consumption, considerable pressure on women to fill the gaps in the labour market, alongside caring for children and elderly relatives, and a considerable reduction in the social insurance fund and the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  However, Ireland does have something in its favour - its birthrate.  One cannot consider these issues in isolation and Ireland must invest in children.  It is our collective responsibility, given that in economic terms, children are a merit good.  Children have value to others beyond their family as future taxpayers and workers whose contributions will help to fund State pensions.  I will sum it up in one line from the English MP, Mr. Frank Field, who said, &quot;I may not have children; but I need someone to have them if my pension is to be paid.&quot;  Therefore, let us invest in children also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500022#V00300","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368621600,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her interesting conclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500023#W00200","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1368621600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I assure the Senator I will not be doing that, grandchildren perhaps but not children.  <\/p><p>I welcome the Minister who, as always, is welcome.  The report which all Members have read suggests all citizens should take out a private pension policy to supplement their State pension in years to come.  This, of course, is because people are living longer which is most welcome, but the flipside is that there is greater demand on the pensions pot.  I also came in armed with statistics and figures, but there is no need for me to reiterate them because everyone has articulated them well.  Consequently, I will not go into that side of things.  However, I will observe that the level of participation in the labour force drops dramatically at 65 years of age and that State spending on pensions will rise from 7% to more than 11% of GDP by 2060.  While I appreciate that Members will not be around to see this happen, it is incumbent on them to govern and ensure the seeds are sown today that can be reaped in the years ahead.  They must ensure there is enough in the pot to go around to ensure the children of today will not face poverty in their golden years.<\/p><p>One must not lose sight of the fact, however, that all workers in Ireland today and probably for a number of years to come are under financial pressure and strain.  People are cutting out things they feel they can do without simply to meet their everyday financial commitments.  I refer to items such as medical insurance, family holidays or even Sky packages.  My fear is that most such persons will perceive a private pension to be an unnecessary priority, being something from which they would benefit in 30 or 40 years time because they simply do not have the money.  I refer, in particular, to low and middle-income earners.  One cannot underestimate the impact of the economic downturn and the effect it has had on people's lives.  While planning for the future is commendable, people will not perceive it to be a priority.  I welcome the Minister's statement that she does not envisage the introduction of automatic enrolment until the economy recovers, which is good news.<\/p><p>The report also states charges for private pensions and small schemes, in particular, are extremely expensive.  It notes their unevenness and the need to address this issue.  A further finding is that older people in Ireland are better off socio-economically than in other countries.  I commend the Minister because her retention of the core social welfare rates for the present has kept it like this.  While one must acknowledge the household benefit package for the elderly has been cut somewhat, at least the core social welfare payments have been kept intact, I hope permanently but at least for now.<\/p><p>As for the main recommendations, the report indicates that the two best options for the State pension in the future are a means-tested basic pension and a universal basic pension.  I have problems with both options and will outline the reasons.  On the means-tested payments, workers who have worked all their lives in this country, who have saved a little to put something aside for a rainy day and who have contributed tax, PRSI, the universal social charge and health levies to mention but a few items would be penalised in their old age by a means-tested payment because their savings will come against them as capital, which would be grossly unfair.  As for the other proposal for a basic scheme for the entire population, I also have a problem with this.  In theory, a person could start work at 16 years of age and work until he or she was 26.  Thereafter, having satisfied the 520 pay contributions, such a person literally could be in receipt of social welfare payments for the next 40 years without having contributed much.  However, a person who had worked 50 years of his or her life, contributed to the economy and the State in a huge way, would only receive the same pension.  There is something wrong in that regard and it would not be right.  <\/p><p>As I note my time is up, I ask the Acting Chairman for one minute in which to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500023#W00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1368621600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Half a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500023#W00400","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1368621600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Self-employed persons cannot even access credited contributions.

I was delighted that Senator van Turnhout quoted Mr. Frank Field, who has really interesting thoughts on the whole area of social expenditure.  He is a most valuable member of parliament on the neighbouring island.  I thank the Minister for bringing the OECD report to us.  This is a problem we have been neglecting.  The late Minister, Mr. S&eacute;amus Brennan tried on several occasions to start a pensions debate but he did not succeed.  As other Senators have said, the fund former Minister, Mr. Charlie McCreevy set up has been substantially raided.  There is hardly anything in it at this stage because of the performance of our banks and other institutions.<\/p><p>We must consider seriously raising the retirement age.  The Minister saw the report last week on what is happening to young people.  Approximately 10% of them are secure employment while the other 90% are dependent.  The latter do not contribute until their mid-20s or even later given the high incidence of unemployment among young people.  Entering the labour force at 28 or 30 and leaving it at 65 to live on the pension until 85 is just not fundable by any standard.  We should actually grasp the nettle and raise the retirement age, even by more than the OECD recommends.  In the OECD report, it is stated that we should examine mechanisms by which people can combine half a wage and half a pension when they reach retirement age.<\/p><p>We need to regulate the pension funds.  There are so many trustees of pension funds who, until recently, were giving out added years like snuff at a wake.  The schemes are broke.  Governor Honohan is taking on board how we treat people who trade when insolvent.  Many private-sector defined-benefit schemes actually went bankrupt while the trustees were adding years.  Perhaps we should consider much stricter control over those.<\/p><p>I agree with what Senator Mooney said on charges.  This is mentioned by the OECD.  The case for a compulsory deduction for a pension is well made.  It implies a lower cost.  We all tend to put off thinking about it.  It is a matter of setting a contribution aside, starting small, as the Senator said, such that the money will be available when needed.<\/p><p>There is a recommendation on the household benefits package in respect of the travel and the energy.  It concerns the transfer into cash.  That sounds well to economists but I can imagine the resistance one would encounter among people who like those perks.  It is a suggestion that the OECD has made.  We appear to have a larger provision of those benefits.<\/p><p>One might ask about all the PRSI that was paid and the universal social charge.  Can one get for pensions an earmarked part of that money?  People could legitimately say they have been paying to the State for years and question whether there should be a top-up payment to get a pension.  I acknowledge there will be transition arrangements.  On our being allowed to examine social fund expenditure, some will wonder whether we give too much in child benefit at the top end.  The Minister shares the concern that too many disability and invalidity benefits were counter-productive, such that the social fund might have been more productively spent funding people's pensions.  During the boom period, many children were brought up in households where nobody was working and who were instead registered as having a disability or invalidity.<\/p><p>The analysis of what social welfare is for and what it can be used for - a cause dear to the Minister's heart - is important.  We must encourage people to save in addition to receiving the State pension.  One regrets that so many chose to save by buying bank shares.  Pensioners were destroyed by that system.<\/p><p>Like other Senators, I welcome, as always, the Minister to the House.  There is much to discuss and I wish her well.  I hope we do not put pensions on the long finger again and that we engage with the Minister in this discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500024#X00400","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1368622200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>The final speaker will be Senator Harte, who is to be preceded by Senator Brennan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500024#X00500","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1368622200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Word has come down to me that I may be the most appropriate person in the House to talk about pensions.  I was born in the early 1950s and married in the early 1970s.  The Minister may do the calculations in this regard.  When I was married, women gave up work to look after the house.   We had three children, one after another, and my wife ceased to work.  As far as I am concerned, nobody works harder than the housewife in any house.  Many retire from work to rear their families and many return to work in later years when their children have grown up.  Some never return to work, not even on a part-time basis.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned mandatory pension contributions in her speech.  I had to pay them, at a rate of 7% of my salary, when employed by a semi-State organisation.  Over the years, having had two or three children in university at the same time, I would have felt well off if I had the 7% I was paying mandatorily towards my pension.  It was a major struggle but we got through it.  Colleagues of mine were in the same position.  Mandatory contributions will be difficult.<\/p><p>My father died when he was 92 and started work at the age of 14.  He was paying a small amount of tax on his pension at 92, as was his father before him.  The Minister may not agree with my belief that a man or woman who works continuously for 50 years, from the age of 18 or perhaps 23 or 24 if educated, pays a significant amount of tax to the benefit of the economy and merits his or her entitlements.  When I think of the abuse of the social welfare system and the difficulty people encounter in trying to obtain entitlements after 50 years, I realise people are entitled to what they deserve at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500024#X00600","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1368622200,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I made a slight error in my time allocation.

The pension problem is one of the biggest issues facing this country.  I recall as a young man looking at the pension model when I started in the insurance business.  It showed that when one started earlier one was on a bicycle on a slope, but the longer one waited, the steeper the climb on the slope became.  Nobody realises how difficult it will be for this country to sustain the pensions of a population that is getting older and living longer.<\/p><p>The first pensions regime was set up by Otto von Bismarck in the late 19th century to stop German labourers going to America to earn money.  At that stage, however, average life expectancy was 50 to 55 years.  It was probably envisaged that people would not have to get a pension.  Things have moved on a great deal since then.  There is also the issue of public service pensions and private pensions.  They are very different.  People who were contributing to a private pension in the last few years have seen their funds slashed enormously.  In addition, many people in business cannot afford to set aside the &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,500 per month that they were putting into their pension previously and have stopped contributing.  Their fund could be growing or dropping by now.  It is a time bomb waiting to go off, even if it is a clich&eacute; to say that.<\/p><p>This country is in a slightly better position than other countries.  We have a younger population which might be able to sustain the pensions for some time, but in European countries, particularly in Germany, the population will become more weighted towards the older age groups and the younger age groups might not be able to sustain their pensions.  We must protect the pensions of people with private pension funds.  In a court case last year the banks tried to grab the pension fund of an individual because they were in massive debt.  Happily, the court ruled against that.  The banks would love to be able to call on people's pension funds so I am glad the decision went that way.  However, there is always the fear that they could try again and succeed.  The protection of the pension fund is critical for people in business and for people who wish to invest in a pension.<\/p><p>I do not believe we have really grasped the enormity of the problem there will be 25 or 30 years hence in terms who will fund the public pensions.  As has been said, there are people who, for their own reasons, have not worked and they will get the same pension as people who have contributed throughout their working lives.  It is only fair that the latter group be given preferential treatment, even if it was a small lump sum when they retire, as one gets with a private pension or public service pension.  The ordinary old age pension for many people is just a continuation of their earnings or, perhaps, a reduction.  Perhaps some type of incentive should be given for people in that position.<\/p><p>The other issue is that the pensions industry is keen that some of the pension fund could be released before pension age, depending on whether it is a company pension or a private pension.  At present, if one has a private pension and one reaches the age of 65 years, one can withdraw a quarter of the pension fund as a tax free lump sum.  We should consider some type of mechanism whereby five years before retirement age a part of the lump sum could be drawn down.  Many people could clear their mortgages.  It has been shown that many people in the 40 to 65 year age bracket are suffering more than we thought with mortgages that should never have been allowed to extend beyond the 65th birthday.  There are people who could use some of their lump sum towards ending their mortgages a few years earlier than retirement age.  I do not believe they would spend it on a yacht or holidays around the world.  It could be designed so that it could only be released for the purpose of clearing a stressed mortgage.  It would help the people concerned and give them an incentive to save in the meantime because there are generous tax allowances for pension contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500025#Y00800","speaker":"1144"},{"type":"speech","time":1368622800,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and I thank the Chair and other Senators for facilitating my contribution to the debate.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister's initiative in commissioning the OECD report on our pensions system.  When the report was released it received very little attention even though the issue it deals with is of huge importance not just for the Government but for society in general.  Pensions policy not only affects people in receipt of pensions but every person.  It has a huge bearing on our economy.  This report is a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate about pension reform.  One in ten pensioners live at risk of poverty and if the State pension was removed, 88% of pensioners would be living in poverty.  Only half of the current workforce is covered by private and occupational pensions, and many of these schemes, particularly defined benefit schemes, are in deficit.  Some of them are close to collapse.<\/p><p>The pensions protection system is almost non-existent, as we saw with the Waterford Crystal case.  While there is no simple solution to the collapse of a pension fund, the decision that was made to resist confronting the obligations of the Government under EU law was disappointing.  The regulation of the private pension industry is also a major problem.  Not only are the charges opaque, as has been mentioned, but they are often very expensive.  The high risk business of investing in private pension funds is in need of urgent regulation.  Currently, much of the policy surrounding pensions is based on tax breaks to incentivise people to invest in private schemes, yet the 2009 ESRI report on pension tax reliefs shows that this is highly questionable.  A total of 80% of the pension tax relief goes to the top 20% of earners, and everybody suggests that these savings would happen anyway.<\/p><p>The question is what we should do.  Obviously, radical pension reform is required but that will not happen overnight or with the wave of a magic wand.  It requires a great deal of calm, considered discussion and debate.  We should explore ideas such as increasing the State pension to 40% of average industrial earnings and universalising it to ensure that no pensioner lives in poverty.  We need a mandatory public pension system for all workers not in private schemes to ensure that people have a real chance to provide the additional savings required to give them some measure of comfort in their later years.  We must also examine the pension tax relief system.  There must be tighter regulation of private pension funds to limit the levels of risk involved.<\/p><p>I have two questions for the Minister.  When will the structural options of the OECD be costed and when will that analysis be carried out?  What timeframe does the Minister have in mind before she brings a response to the Government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500025#Y00900","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1368622800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their thoughtful and incisive contributions.  I wish to stress that the OECD report is quite positive about Ireland, in the sense that we have quite a good and strong universal retirement pension system through the State.  One of the features of it is that if somebody has made contributions, they qualify.  However, as Senator Moloney said, very often people have a short contribution history.  Many of them would be self-employed people coming into the system to pay contributions relatively late in their working lives, and the Social Insurance Fund shows that it is such people who get the highest contribution from the State pension.  The non-contributory, means-tested State pension was brought up to the same level as the contributory pension during the boom.<\/p><p>Many of the reforms which are under way at present were agreed by the troika in November 2010.<\/p> <p>We are, for example, raising the age of pension eligibility over a period of time in accordance with that agreement.  This partly reflects demographics, as well as the financial and economic situation in which the country finds itself.<\/p><p>In regard to the various options available, the OECD has indicated in its report that its first preference is a mandatory scheme because it would be simpler and cheaper to operate, with its second preference being automatic enrolment, whereby people would be automatically enrolled but could opt out.  My view is that the latter option which has worked very well in New Zealand might be more appropriate in our case.  As it was adopted in the United Kingdom in recent times, we do not yet have outcomes from that jurisdiction in terms of take-up.  The experience in other countries is that there tends to be a very high opt-in level under such schemes.<\/p><p>One of the difficulties is that we have critical groups of people, particularly women and middle-income and low-paid workers, who can find, at the end of their working life, that their pension entitlement is seriously inadequate.  Unless they are contributing to their pension fund over their entire working life, the chances are that their expectations of what they can look forward to in retirement will not be met.  This is especially the case for women who often move in and out of paid employment at different times to accommodate child-rearing duties.  In that sense, the State pension, through the PRSI and means-tested system, provides a minimum level of income in retirement.  That income will probably feel adequate to people who were previously on a low income or in receipt of social welfare benefit.  In fact, the State pension will provide for an increase in income for persons who are entirely dependent on social welfare prior to reaching retirement age.  For middle-income earners, however, it might come as a shock to have to survive on a pension of &euro;12,000, or up to &euro;14,000 if one includes the benefits package, in contrast to those who are looking at a pension in retirement of &euro;25,000 or so.<\/p><p>Several Senators referred to the cost of tax reliefs and urged that they be geared more to people on middle and low incomes.  Our position in this regard is reflected in the inclusion in the programme for Government of the undertaking to confine the subsidisation of pensions through tax reliefs to workers whose total fund will yield a pension of no more than &euro;60,000 per annum in retirement.  That is a very handsome pension for most.  Moreover, Members should note that the first efforts to impose restrictions on the pension pots of very wealthy individuals and a cap on the total permissible fund were initiated as recently as 2005.  I was party to that debate, having conducted a great deal of research.  It subsequently emerged that certain people had pension pots of &euro;20 million to &euro;30 million, which meant there was a very large allocation in tax relief in their direction.  The programme for Government and the associated commitment given by the Minister for Finance reflect our determination to address that issue.<\/p><p>A number of Senators referred to public versus private sector pensions.  It is important to bear in mind that public sector workers are subject to a levy contribution of 7% in respect of their pensions.  Senator Sean D. Barrett referred to the USC.  When the ESRI produced the original paper on that levy, it was described as a universal social &quot;contribution&quot;.  In the heat of the economic crisis, however, it morphed out of the arms of the Department of Finance as a universal social &quot;charge&quot;.  As we look towards automatic enrolment or a mandatory system in the future, as the economy recovers, there will be scope to earmark some of the levy for the purposes of a defined pension provision in subsequent years.  In this regard, we should be mindful of what happened to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, as referred to by Senator Paschal Mooney.  The purpose of the fund which had built up to a very significant level before the economic crisis was to provide for public service and social welfare pensions from 2025 onwards.  Whatever system we develop, whether it be automatic enrolment or a mandatory system, we must be able to provide future contributors with reassurance to a very high level that it will be in their name and that the Department of Finance will not dip into it at some future time, as happened with the reserve fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500025#Y01000","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368623400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>That is a very difficult commitment to fulfil in an economic downturn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500026#Z00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1368623400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Yes, but we must anticipate it as part of the architecture of the scheme.

T&aacute;imid ag druidim go tapaidh ar chom&oacute;radh 100 bliain na n-eachtra&iacute; a bhunaigh &aacute;r St&aacute;t.  Is &eacute; seo an bealach is fearr inar f&eacute;idir linn &oacute;m&oacute;s a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d a d'oibrigh ar son na saoirse - chun an daonlathas a choth&uacute; seachas &eacute; a ch&uacute;ng&uacute;.  Mar sin, ag teacht leis an stair agus ag breathn&uacute; ar an mBunreacht mar ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is bheo, t&aacute;imid ag moladh sa reachta&iacute;ocht seo Seanad &Eacute;ireann a athnuachan agus a chlaochl&uacute;.  With the introduction of the Seanad Bill 2013, Senator Quinn and I see this to be an important day in Irish history.  As we fast approach the many centenary anniversaries associated with the foundation of this State, the best way we can pay tribute to those who sacrificed so much for our freedom is to open up our democracy, rather than to close it.  In line with history and in viewing the Constitution as a living document, we are proposing in this Bill to renew and transform Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>The Seanad is an integral arm of the governance of this country as laid down in our Constitution.  Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann has served the Irish people well.  The abolition of the Seanad will disturb the essential democratic system of checks and balances on which our Constitution is founded and which, so far, has resolutely stood the test of time and change.  Everybody should be clear that getting rid of the Seanad will remove a number of significant safeguards.  This could have a negative impact on the Presidency, the independence of the Judiciary, the sovereignty of our Constitution in the context of EU law and the right of the people to be consulted on major decisions by means of a referendum or a general election.  It is sensible that the Seanad provides some checks and balances on the power of a D&aacute;il majority.  In particular, a second chamber is a critical safeguard against rushed legislation.  It is vital that Seanad &Eacute;ireann should continue to play a valuable democratic and constitutional role as a revising chamber.  The Seanad, with its inbuilt constitutional safeguards for the citizens and the State and its vital checks and balances, should not be abolished.  It should be transformed to meet the needs of a modern Ireland and a working democracy.<\/p><p>This legislation is not about retaining the existing Seanad - it is about a reformed Seanad, a Seanad nua, a Seanad an phobail.  The effectiveness of the Seanad has diminished because it is under-representative of the people and thereby does not serve the best interests of the people.  It does not serve the interests of the majority or the minorities.  The old Seanad is part of a system that did not stand in the way of an economic crisis that took away our sovereignty, our confidence and the jobs and prosperity of countless thousands.  We need to recover and strengthen the Seanad's function as a check and balance to the D&aacute;il and the work of the Executive.  This is not the time to cut the number of outside voices and expert views, to reduce the amount of scrutiny on the laws that affects the lives of our people or to give the Civil Service an even freer hand to rule without query.  That is what Seanad abolition would mean.  Instead, we need a transformed Seanad.<\/p><p>This Bill is born out of the &quot;Open it, Don 't Close it&quot; consultation document that was published in September 2012.  This document was the product of extensive consultation on the future of the Seanad.  The reform process in this Bill is significantly advanced by means of simple legislation to alter radically the way the Seanad is elected and who is elected, the powers it holds and the way it does its business.  I believe this will have the immense and positive effect of enhancing Irish democratic politics by further empowering citizens.  It will ensure politics is not a closed shop.  It will give a voice to ordinary people at the highest levels of policy and legislation implementation.  This Bill breaks new ground.  It sets out key principles that would underpin a new Seanad.  We are proposing a House where all of us get a vote, not just an elite; a House made up of half women and half men; a House where people in the North and those forced into emigration have a say; a House where new voices and new expertise can constructively and positively hold the policies and ideas of the Cabinet, the D&aacute;il, the parties and the regulators to greater account; and a House where EU and domestic legislation gets the scrutiny it deserves.  All of this can be done right now through legislation without need for a referendum.  Why should we delay?<\/p><p>In a departure from the current elitist approach, our Bill enunciates the principle that every person shall have a vote in a Seanad election.  Our Bill broadens the pool of graduates who may vote in the university constituency in a fair and equal manner.  By opening up the right to vote, we will necessarily democratise Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The Irish Women's Franchise League was founded by Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and Margaret Cousins in 1908, some 105 years ago.  These two remarkable women deserve an honoured place in our history.  One of the biggest gaps in Irish political life today is the under-representation of women in the Oireachtas.  It is up to our generation to finally set this right.  It has taken over a century.  The measures in section 7 of this Bill, which would provide for a chamber of our national Parliament made up of half women and half men, is long overdue and heralds a new era of progressive politics.<\/p><p>Fifty years ago this summer, President John F. Kennedy addressed a special joint sitting of D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  On that historic occasion, he spoke about the vast scale of Irish emigration to the United States.  He quoted James Joyce who, for this reason, described the Atlantic Ocean as a &quot;bitter bowl of tears&quot;.  In every generation, emigration has left a scar on our national life.  We are seeing its worst effects again today, as families are sundered by the forced emigration caused by our economic difficulties.  My family background is rooted in emigration from these shores.  I was born in Washington State to a mother whose people came from Virginia, County Cavan and Oldcastle, County Meath.  It is for this reason, among others, that I am especially proud of the measures in section 31 of this Bill which will give Irish emigrants a vote for the first time in our national Parliament.  In recent years, much has been made of the need to harness the talents and expertise of the Irish diaspora around the world.  We can begin by giving the Irish abroad a vote in at least one major election.<\/p><p>I would like to speak about the proposal to extend voting rights to people in Northern Ireland who are entitled to Irish citizenship.  Many people in Northern Ireland have a strong affinity with the Republic of Ireland.  It is incumbent upon us to facilitate people in Northern Ireland who wish to avail of the opportunity to participate in Seanad elections and feel they have some voice and some level of representation in the democratic structures of the Republic.  Wisely, this Bill does not specify that people in Northern Ireland who qualify for Irish citizenship have to take out such citizenship to vote in a Seanad election.  The Bill recognises a fundamental core principle of the Good Friday Agreement whereby it is the birth right of every individual in Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose.  In a post-conflict Ireland, we need to open up a new space to deepen co-operation, respect and understanding on this island.<\/p><p>This Bill seeks to confer for the first time a clear and defined role on the Seanad as envisaged by the Constitution.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann was never intended to be a mirror image of the D&aacute;il.  We do not need two Houses trying to fulfil the same role.  We have included in this Bill a set of new powers for the Seanad across a range of areas.  My colleague, Senator Quinn, will outline them is fuller detail.  We believe these new powers will supplement and revitalise the place and the role of the Seanad in the history of this State.  At the last election, the Irish people made clear their desire for political reform which would ensure our democratic structures are more representative, transparent, accountable and effective.  We believe the reform of the Seanad to be a central part of achieving that goal.  Indeed, we believe our model of reform provides the Irish people for the first time in our history with a Seanad an phobail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500027#AA00700","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1368624000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I really appreciate him coming here.  This is a very important Bill for this House and for the people of Ireland.  Last Sunday was the 97th anniversary of the execution of James Connolly and Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada.  They were the last of the leaders to be executed.  They were identified because they had signed the Proclamation, from which I would like to quote.  The Proclamation \"guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens\" and envisages a system of government \"representative of the whole people of Ireland and elected by the suffrages of all her men and women\".  It is something we have all aspired to over the years.  We have looked back on those wonderful words.  We have had a Government here since 1922.  We have been successful in making our way.<\/p> <p>I have 16 grandchildren and I would like to think that, in the years to come, they will be living in an Ireland built on similar foundations.  I would worry if I thought that, in the years ahead, they will be in an Ireland where part of the foundations we have built for them, that have been there since 1937, have been damaged in some form or other.  We should tamper with the existing three Houses - the Presidency, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad - with great care.<\/p><p>We should be very careful.  The abolition of the Seanad would remove one of the pillars of our system of government.  I believe this Seanad Bill will enshrine in our democracy a guarantee for the future of this nation.  This is not a time for political posturing.  It is a time for all of us who care deeply about Irish democracy to seriously reflect on what the closure of the Seanad would actually mean in our public life.  If this shocking eventuality comes to pass, it is highly unlikely that the people will ever again be given the opportunity to reverse that decision.  Some people beyond this Chamber might well ask, &quot;Why should we care?&quot;, but the lesson of the crisis in our public finances is that ill-considered measures and bad political choices can impinge on our national finances, affecting the prosperity and security of every family in our country, as we have seen.<\/p><p>Nobody is disputing the fact that our political system needs reform, but it has to be the right reform.  The Seanad is not perfect and I believe it needs to change, but it is not a credible argument to suggest that meaningful political reform amounts to consigning the Seanad to the dustbin of history while leaving all power in the hands of an unreformed D&aacute;il.  I mean this very seriously and I am worried about the loss of democracy we would have.  What is needed is real change in the way both Houses of the Oireachtas do their business, not the rash closure of either democratic forum.  This generation needs to be careful that we are not hoodwinked into getting rid of vital constitutional safeguards for which future generations may yet have a real democratic need.  I strongly believe that the universal demand for political reform in Ireland can be best delivered as part of a series of measures that include a comprehensively reformed Seanad.  This work could commence almost immediately by passing this Bill.<\/p><p>The Bill is about giving all Irish people a stake in the Seanad's future.  Its provisions arise from a long and detailed consultation process as well as the &ldquo;Open Seanad &Eacute;ireann, Don&rsquo;t Close it&rdquo; consultation paper that was published six months ago.  The Bill is informed by that process and the input and submissions of many people.  It recognises that a reformed Seanad can enhance our democracy and make a real contribution to the challenges facing our country.  Among the core democratic values which make up this Bill, and which will be reflected in the new Seanad, is that of &quot;one citizen, one vote&quot;, not &quot;two votes&quot;, as some have at the moment - some could even have more than two votes - as well as greater gender balance, a voice for Northern Ireland the diaspora, a space for new voices and a democratic safeguard protecting our EU interests.<\/p><p>This country needs enhanced democracy, not less democracy, and the recent economic collapse underlines this.  The abolition of the Seanad is not the solution.  This Bill fundamentally opens up our national Parliament and will make it more efficient, accountable, and, I believe, much more constructive.  This is a new foundation for the better type of politics that is now required, more than ever, to get our security back.<\/p><p>I would have liked to make many other points.  As Senator Zappone said, I was to give some description of the detail of the Bill but I am afraid I have wasted my time not giving the details.  However, the details of what we can do are in the Bill.  It is not just a question of voting but of giving the vote to others who do not have votes at present.  My parents came from Northern Ireland.  On the basis of our Bill, people in Northern Ireland will get a vote, no matter what their political allegiance is.  Those who left Ireland recently because of emigration and who have an Irish passport, anywhere around the world, will have a vote in the new Seanad.  I believe it will be much more effective and democratic.  It will be a Seanad we will be proud to look back on in later years.  In the Bill, we have also shown the extra work we can do in this House.  This House is capable of doing a huge amount more, whether it is to do with Europe, inquiries or otherwise.  I believe this Bill is worthy of support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500027#AA00800","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368624600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Seanad on the Seanad Bill 2013.  I recognise and acknowledge the work that has gone into the preparation and development of the Bill.  It is a comprehensive Bill and many of its proposals are innovative and deserving of detailed consideration in their own right.  I note that the Bill was preceded in September 2012 by the consultation paper, \"Radical Seanad Reform Through Legislative Change\", and that the Bill reflects proposals in that paper and submissions received during the subsequent consultation phase, as Senator Quinn said.<\/p><p>It has to be acknowledged also that the Government has set out its own stall on the Seanad in the programme for Government.  We promised in the programme for Government that the question of abolition of the Seanad would be put to the people by referendum and it is our intention to do so in the autumn of this year.  The Taoiseach confirmed this again in the Dail only days ago, when he indicated that the constitutional amendment Bill to decide the future of the Seanad would be brought forward in the current D&aacute;il session.  I can confirm that the Bill will be discussed by Government next Tuesday.<\/p><p>All sectors of Irish society will be heading into a period of more intense debate over the coming months on the future of the Seanad.  I am sure we can all agree that the debate should be well informed and respectful of all points of view.  Without prejudice to the outcome of the referendum, this Bill is to be welcomed as making an important contribution to the debate.  I would like to take the opportunity today to draw attention to some of the features of the Bill that have caught my eye and to make some initial comments on them.<\/p><p>Part 2 of the Bill sets out measures designed to achieve greater gender equality in any newly constituted Seanad.  It is fair to say that there is a growing consensus in recent years that strong measures need to be taken to encourage the greater participation of women in politics at all levels.  As the House will know, the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 set down ambitious targets in this respect.  At the next general election, political parties will have to select at least 30% women and 30% men candidates or face losing half their State funding.  Seven years from the general election where this provision first applies, this will rise to 40%.  Therefore, I welcome the objective in the Seanad Bill 2013 to promote gender equality.<\/p><p>However, I would have some concerns about the approach proposed.  The way I understand that it would operate will mean that some candidates who have a higher number of votes than others may find themselves not elected because of the need to meet the male-female quorum within a particular constituency.  I believe the decision should be left to the voter.<\/p><p>Part 3 of the Bill sets out in very clear terms the role envisaged for any future Seanad.  This role embraces existing functions and some new ones.  The need to repeat in primary legislation the roles that are already assigned to the Seanad in the Constitution seems to me to be unnecessary and would need to be considered further.  The additional functions proposed are wide-reaching and varied.  They include a role in the scrutiny of draft legislation from the institutions of the European Union and the scrutiny of statutory instruments.  A role is also envisaged in the area of public interest inquiries and the holding of debates on issues of national importance on foot of petitions signed by 1,000 people.  These are all significant proposals that will generate interest and debate.<\/p><p>That said, I feel that some aspects may need to be teased out further.  For example, I would have some concerns about the proposed role in regard to the scrutiny of statutory instruments.  Generally, most statutory instruments take immediate effect, subject to being rejected later by the Houses of the Oireachtas, so there is already a role for both Houses.  This facilitates meeting deadlines, often in regard to EU requirements.  I would be concerned, therefore, about putting in place procedures, however well intended, that might lead to delays or an excessive workload on the Seanad in meeting those deadlines.  In section 25 of the Bill, a role is proposed for the Seanad to inquire into the necessity for legislation, although I would have thought they already had this power.  In section 26, the Seanad will be enabled to react to a petition of 1,000 signatures, but who will be eligible to sign a petition and how will those signatures be verified?<\/p><p>On electoral reform measures, which make up Parts 4 to 8 of the Bill, there are also a number of interesting proposals, including the widening of the nomination process.  A scheme of popular nomination, in which the verified support of 500 persons will secure a nomination for a specified constituency, is proposed.  There is also the proposal to widen the electorate to include not alone all local government electors living in Ireland, but also people resident in Northern Ireland who qualify for Irish citizenship and Irish passport holders living abroad.  Of course, these proposals reflect the wider debate of extending the franchise to Irish people living abroad for the whole range of elections and referendums.  As the House knows, this has been the subject of much consideration and deliberation over the years, here in the Seanad, in the D&aacute;il and in other fora.<\/p><p>As politicians, we have a natural affinity for considering these issues and, for some, perhaps change has not come about quickly enough.<\/p> <p>We all know people whose family members have moved abroad and would like to maintain real contact with events in Ireland by having a say in elections.  This, however, has to be balanced against the need to ensure that any decisions for change are fully teased out.  In general, the extension of voting rights would require careful consideration of a range of complex matters.  There are issues of principle such as the extent of influence that voters who are not resident in Ireland should be allowed to exert.  Not everyone shares an opinion on this and possibilities would need to be explored in detail.  There would also be practical issues such as ensuring the integrity and security of the ballot and the cost of implementing any new arrangements for widening the electorate.<\/p><p>In my contribution in the Seanad last March on the Seanad Electoral Bill, proposed by Senator Crown, I outlined some of the general reforms that this Government has already introduced.  I will not go over these in detail again today but simply point to the ongoing work of the members of the Convention on the Constitution which in the coming months will consider the D&aacute;il electoral system and giving citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections at Irish embassies or otherwise.  It would be appropriate that their views too be taken into consideration as part of the debate on the issue of extending the right to vote to a wider population.<\/p><p>While the detail of the Bill is for another day, several aspects struck me that may need further clarification and consideration.  Section 31 of the Bill provides that all persons living in Northern Ireland who qualify for Irish citizenship may be part of the Seanad electorate, yet section 35(d) seems to add a further requirement that such a voter would also need to be registered to vote in Northern Irish elections before he or she could vote in the Seanad election.  Section 31 also provides that all persons holding a valid and current Irish passport and who reside outside the State may be part of the electorate.  Is it intended that these voters surrender their passport, as implied in section 36(c) of the Bill, in order to be included in the proposed register of electors?  Section 52 deals with Seanad election expenses but does not seem to address the expenses of those standing in the university constituencies.  Section 63 deals with casual vacancies but does not seem to address the situation where the person who would fill the vacancy is no longer available for whatever reason.<\/p><p>More generally, I would question the practicality of the provisions for the postal ballot.  Measures are proposed which are largely based on the existing model but if the electorate is widened would that model continue to work?  Section 50 provides for the issue of ballot papers on a particular day or on different days but the electorate involved will have increased enormously.  Some 156,000 people are registered to vote in Seanad elections.  The proposals in the Bill would see this initially increasing to over 3 million.  I say these things not to find fault with the Bill but to underline the fact that proposals, wherever they come from and whatever one's point of view, need to be fully teased out before making their way on to the Statute Book from the legal point of view and that of practical implementation and operability.<\/p><p>I take this opportunity to note the proposals on Seanad reform from Senators Zappone and Quinn.  I agree with what Senator Quinn said in his contribution regarding the need for political reform and in particular D&aacute;il reform, which will happen.  I hope that the Bill and the ideas in it continue to play a role in stimulating people to consider and debate the issues over the coming months.  Senator Crown's contribution with his recent legislation will play an equal role in generating debate.  This is an important opportunity for the Irish people to reflect on these matters in advance of deciding the future of this House in a referendum that will be held later this year.  The people ultimately will decide.  That is the spirit of tolerance behind the Government's decision to approve Second Stage of this Bill today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500028#BB00200","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368625200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and I compliment our colleagues, Senators Quinn and Zappone, on bringing forward this Bill.  I am somewhat taken aback at the benign attitude of the Minister which I presume reflects the Government's thinking.  It seems that on the one hand it welcomes all sorts of debate but on the other it will get rid of us if it can.  It was rather interesting that in his opening remarks the Minister referred to the fact that this Bill would help to stimulate debate.  He talks about a period of intense debate over the coming months.  It would have been more helpful if the Government had decided to have something other than a straight \"Yes\" or \"No\".  It wants either to abolish the Seanad or keep it.  That does not give people much room for intense debate whereas if the wording was more flexible and open it might.  The Government is giving people a very stark choice and that is one of the flaws in this proposal.<\/p><p>Already the storm clouds are gathering around the Taoiseach's proposals.  I mention the Taoiseach because he initiated this process.  Everything that has followed is of little relevance because he is driving it.  If a straw poll was taken of the Ministers in both parties the result would be rather interesting.  The result of a straw poll of the Government supporters in the House would be even more interesting.  That is the reality it faces.  I am glad that the media is not being codded by this somewhat clumsy attempt to suggest that there is real reform behind this initiative on the basis that getting rid of the Seanad will make for a more accountable democracy.  It is also throwing in the canard that this will save money.  It is time that claim was nailed.  I hope that those contributing to this debate who support retention and reform of the Seanad will continue to hammer home their views so that the general public will know that the Seanad costs approximately &euro;7 million out of a total Government budget of some &euro;56 billion.  Is the Government trying to suggest to the people that this will help heal the country&rsquo;s economic malaise or that it will put more food on their tables?  That &euro;7 million will not be saved because it has already been made clear that if the voters want to abolish the Seanad the money would be redistributed.  There would be no reduction in staff or services.<\/p><p>Now the little carrot of D&aacute;il reform is dangled before us.  This has crept into the debate only in the past few days.  There will never be D&aacute;il reform as long as there is centralised government with an Executive that uses the D&aacute;il as a rubber stamp.  With a majority of over 50 in the other House this Government can put through, and is putting through whatever it likes, whenever it likes, at whatever pace it likes.  Throwing the carrot of reform of the D&aacute;il to the people to persuade them to vote for the abolition of this House is an insult to the intelligence of the electorate.<\/p><p>I want to touch on a couple of aspects of this Bill.  I do not agree with the idea of expanding the nomination process.  For local authorities and 500 people to be part of the nomination process is unwieldy.  The existing nomination process is a good one particularly as it retains the professional bodies.  I am grateful to the Seanad office for confirming that there are 106 registered bodies on the electoral register all of whom have very substantial membership lists.  I cannot work out what the figures will be but I am sure somebody will.  Those bodies represent Irish society as a whole.  That is what the Seanad is supposed to be and has been, flawed as its election process may be.  When executing its business it has stuck rigidly to the original concept which was to represent vocational interests and Irish society.  It also stays true to its original concept of operating as a check and balance to what happens in the other House.  This is a more reflective and less adversarial House.  It gives more time to debate and legislation, all of which is reflected in the sentiments behind if not in the detail of this Bill.<\/p><p>I agree in principle with extending the franchise overseas and to Northern Ireland but I agree with the Minister that the proposals in the Bill are somewhat unwieldy.  I also share his inference that there are other issues involved in extending the franchise outside Ireland.  There are some 70 million people worldwide who claim to be Irish.  I recall Dick Spring saying that he would hate to be waiting for the results of the ballot box from Boston to decide the fifth seat in Kerry.  That is a real concern particularly as we operate under a PR system but we are capable of including the Irish diaspora at some level.  I agree, for example, with the concept of the passport holders having a vote but one could limit it to those who have been out of the country less than three years.  I would ensure that if we extend the franchise that one would have voluntarily to register one's interest at the local embassy or office of the charg&eacute; d'affaires.  If one wants to exercise the franchise in Irish elections one has to be proactive.<\/p><p>I agree with the Minister about the postal ballot.  This would not work in practice.  The electorate is huge.  Why not have the Seanad elections on the same day as the D&aacute;il elections?  That would cut the cost considerably and, depending on how the Seanad reform project was outlined, the people of Ireland who have shown themselves to be very mature when voting would be able to distinguish between what the two Houses do.<\/p> <p>Overall, I welcome what Senators Zappone and Quinn have done in this regard.  I would like to think it is the beginning of that intense debate about which the Minister spoke.  I hope the media will espouse this.  I wish well all of those who are on the side of retention and reform of this House - reform is the word, not abolition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500029#CC00200","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368625800,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of the Seanad Bill 2013 and compliment its proposers, as I complimented Senator Crown on the introduction of his Seanad Electoral Reform Bill last March.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss these proposals but, as the Minister stated, the Seanad referendum Bill will be before us in a matter of weeks and it will be the people who will decide whether this House continues or not.<\/p><p>The vast majority of the content of previous reports on Seanad reform dealt with how the Seanad should be elected.  There is no doubt in my mind that the entire electorate should have a say in the election of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This Bill has some suggestions on how that can be accomplished - Senator Crown's Bill had different proposals - but should the people decide to retain the Seanad, then the people must certainly also have a say in the election of the next Seanad.    <\/p><p>In the referendum people will be asked to vote for abolition, or against it.  The Bill before us provides a suite of proposals which can be considered by the electorate before they cast their vote in a referendum.  It confers a range of additional powers, including the examination of public appointments as well as the holding of inquiries.  It suggests that Seanad &Eacute;ireann should have a greater role in the scrutiny of draft legislation emanating from the institutions of the European Union.  I would certainly support such a move and the House will be aware that I advocated such a role but secretarial resources were denied to us at that time.  I have asked a sub-committee of the House to come together to draw up proposals for us to deal with the relevant items from the European Parliament's annual work programme, which can be staffed from within our own individual resources.  I certainly fully agree that Seanad &Eacute;ireann should have an enhanced role in considering draft legislation directly from EU institutions.<\/p><p>When speaking of resources, I note this Bill suggests setting up a number of Seanad committees.  We should be very careful about creating anything that would involve greater cost to the taxpayer.  I have my doubts too about the process of registering to vote at Seanad elections, opting for panels etc.  I believe this will involve greater costs also.  It seems a little cumbersome but the principle of the public electing the majority of Senators is one that I fully support.<\/p><p>I view this Bill and Senator Crown's Bill as discussion documents that will engage and inform the public, and show them that proposals are in place that can be tweaked, deleted or otherwise, but at the end of the day the Seanad will be reformed, especially in the manner it is elected and nature of the business with which we deal.<\/p><p>Checks and balances and the opportunity to have a second opinion have always been valued by the Irish electorate.   I believe that Seanad &Eacute;ireann, when scrutinising legislation, provides exactly what people are looking for in the careful and considered way we deal with legislation.  Many Ministers, current and past, are on record stating that they believe that legislation is greatly improved following the Seanad Stages and that is due to the quality of debate that takes place in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500030#DD00200","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1368625800,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500030#DD00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1368625800,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Often, because of the less confrontational and more deliberative nature of debate here, Ministers are prepared to accept amendments on the floor of the Seanad or agree to table Government amendments reflecting Opposition concerns at a later stage in the legislative process.  This is where the true value of the Seanad lies and I am very proud to be a part of a process that plays such a critical role in the proper governance of the State.<\/p><p>The Seanad has always been a champion of the lesser heard voice.  The protection of democracy, democratic institutions and the promotion of the well-being of citizens both here and abroad is a concern raised almost daily.  We are also fortunate that in our discussions with Ministers, there is great latitude to focus attention on matters that would otherwise not get a hearing.  Personally, I believe in the promotion and the protection of the institutions of the State which were under threat from subversives and withstood many challenges over the years.  Our Constitution belongs to the people.  The institutions of the State, including Seanad &Eacute;ireann, are part and parcel of that Constitution.  <\/p><p>It is for the people of Ireland, in the first instance, to decide whether Seanad &Eacute;ireann continues or not.  Should the people reject abolition, it would be unwise of any Government to proceed with another Seanad election without reforming how this House is elected and the nature of the business with which we deal.  This Bill and Senator Crown's Bill have provided a basis for reform and I have no doubt that the proposals contained in both can be used as the basis for that reform should it be needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500030#DD00400","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1368625800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  All political power will be concentrated in the hands of the Government, which Senator Quinn has told us will be the one and only party in the Oireachtas, and in a non-reformed D&aacute;il that will be a gloomy prospect for the future of our country.  As we heard other Senators discuss, if the D&aacute;il is reformed, it will be at the beck and call of the Government of the day, if it is the only House that sits in the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>It gave me great pleasure to sign the Bill before the House this evening last week as I feel it goes a long way to addressing many of the problems we have with the current Seanad.  First, I would like to acknowledge the work of Senators Zappone and Quinn and their colleagues from outside the Oireachtas in the preparation of this extensive Bill.  As I said in this Chamber a few months ago when discussing another Seanad reform Bill brought forward by Senator Crown, there was much talk and many opinions about the work and future of this Chamber, much of which was based on populist soundbites and little factual information.  Regrettably the biggest peddler of this false message is the Government symbolised by its firm position of only offering the people an option of abolition or retention and not a third option of reform.  I would respectfully say to the Leader that if the people decide to keep the Seanad and then we reform it afterwards, it is a little bit unfair to the citizens of the country because reform needs to be on the table now for discussion, not just the two options of abolition or retention.<\/p><p>In my opinion the biggest insult of all is the Government's claim that this is all about political reform.  I suspect that if a first year political science student offered up the Government's rationale for the abolition of the Seanad in an essay, he or she would fail the exercise and perhaps the tutor's comments would include a note to the effect of &quot;must try harder&quot;.<\/p><p>This Bill along with Senator Crown's Bill show what is possible with a little effort and imagination.  I do not think there is one Senator in this Chamber who feels that this House works well and is reflective of Irish society in its composition, electoral system and how its business is currently structured.  Nor do I believe that the majority of the Government Senators agree with the idea of abolishing the Seanad, something to which I hope they remain true in the coming months.  When preparing for this debate over the weekend I thought that what we might see is people voting against what they believe in because the powers that be told them to.  Thankfully, the Government's decision not to oppose the Bill means that will not happen on this occasion but it has occurred on endless other issues in this House in recent times.  This demonstrates clearly to me one of the biggest problems we face in this Chamber, namely the rigid Whip system which does not allow for independent thought.<\/p><p>While the Bill before us would not solve that problem entirely it would lessen the power and control of the political parties which currently exist in the Seanad.  This control can be traced back to the electoral system which sees the majority of Senators being elected by an electorate of approximately 2,000 county councillors who happen to be members of political parties and tend to vote in accordance with party headquarters' instructions.  This results in it being virtually impossible for an Independent to be elected on to one of the vocational panels. <\/p> <p>No disrespect to any of my wonderful colleagues but this narrow and restrictive system does not always allow for the election of the best candidates.  Under the Bill before the House, the electoral process would be taken out of the hands of the political parties and placed firmly in the hands of our citizens and the public, where it should be, through a vote for each citizen.  The fact that people could be nominated to contest the Seanad election in three ways also serves to open the House to the people and this must be welcomed.  For too long, words such as elitist and so on have been directed towards this House and, in my opinion, rightly so.  The Bill is designed to work within the confines of the Constitution and as a result the Taoiseach of the day will continue to have the right to appoint 11 Senators.  This is questionable if we truly want to have a strong independent Upper House but I can appreciate the reason for this remaining to be the case in this reform Bill.  I welcome the envisaged extension of the franchise to all third level graduates, something which is long overdue.  Another plus of this Bill is the proposed pay structure and pension entitlements of Senators as it is more suitable for the work being undertaken and, perhaps, more importantly it is more reflective of the world outside these four walls.  I am sure this is a gesture which the public will appreciate because, for too long, the political class has not shown serious leadership.  We have not been examples to the public and the pain they feel.  <\/p><p>I have some reservations around the proposed half and half gender balance in the Bill.  I am not in favour of a fixed 30-30 breakdown of males and females as proposed.  I can appreciate the logic and intention behind this provision but it goes too far and it is almost as if we are trying to artificially engineer democracy.  To my knowledge I am not aware of any parliament in the world where such a system operates.   I just want to put on the record my concerns around this provision which I feel needs more scrutiny on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>Where the Bill really excites me are the proposed changes around how we do our work in this Chamber.   As someone who comes from a business background, I have lost count of the number of times I have been dismayed at the way we do things in here.  There are a few areas that have merit, the scrutiny of EU legislation and the examination of public appointments as well as the holding of inquiries.  These three powers would greatly enhance the relevance and performance of the Seanad.  Finally, I note how this Bill envisages the establishment of a committee to structure and plan the business of the House chaired by a non-government Senator. <\/p><p>In conclusion, I repeat my call on the Government to at least allow the people have a choice around a reformed Seanad when it comes to the referendum day later this year.  I hope they will act in this manner if they are to be taken seriously around the area of political reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500030#DD00500","speaker":"1169","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368626400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and in the Visitors Gallery former Senator Mary Henry.

I welcome the fact that we are debating it this evening.  I am conscious that we have debated recently Senator John Crown's Bill also on Seanad reform.  The Leader has proposed that debate be concluded at the conclusion of this debate.  This is a difficult area in which to draft a Bill to achieve meaningful reform and yet stay within the terms of the Constitution.  They have done a particularly good job and both have spoken powerfully and eloquently in favour of the Bill.

I have spoken previously on the history of the Seanad and the fact that throughout its 90 plus years there have been endless calls for abolition and debates on retention and abolition.  In the 1930s there was extensive debate on the merits of bicameral as opposed to unicameral systems and yet the Seanad has survived all of those debates and has a strong history in a number of respects and particularly in terms of Committee Stage debates on legislation.  We have had strong and thoughtful debates on legislation.  A Bill which springs to mind is one the Minister introduced in this House, the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill where we had a strong debate and Senators on both sides can contribute without the need to be spokespersons on the entirety of the Bill as in the D&aacute;il committee system.<\/p><p>The Seanad has also a strong history of introducing Private Members' Bills.  I mentioned that the former Senator Mary Henry is in the Visitors Gallery.  She introduced important Private Members' legislation on assisted human reproduction and Senator Feargal Quinn introduced the Construction Contracts Bill.  We in the Labour Party group have introduced Private Members' Bills which have been supported.  Some Bills that I introduced as an Independent were subsequently supported by different governments and have become law.  Therefore, the Seanad has a strong history in that regard which is only now being mirrored in some of the D&aacute;il processes.<\/p><p>If the referendum is defeated in the autumn, the call for reform will become unarguable.  That is why it is important to have this Bill and Senator John Crown's Bill on the Order Paper of the Seanad so that people will see in the debate on the referendum that there is a third alternative whereby if the referendum is defeated there are workable proposals for reform present.  <\/p><p>I turn to the Bill and some of the specific points therein.  I am glad the Minister has welcomed it and that the Government is not opposing it.  Some important principles are incorporated in it.  Those on gender balance are commendable and I strongly support them.  The principle of opening up the Seanad to a wider electorate to enable every citizen to vote would be a major improvement.  As Senator Cummins has said, I wonder about the method that has been used in the Bill.  There are somewhat cumbersome divisions of the register.   Former Senator Mary O'Rourke's paper on Seanad reform, which had unanimous cross-party support prior to the 2007 general election, proposed a simpler structure whereby there were two registers, one for the university seats and one for the non-university seats.  It appears to me that is a simpler model to use and can be done without amending the Constitution.  It is welcome that all the university seats would be opened up to all the third level institutions.  That is permissible within the terms of the Constitution in accordance with the 1979 amendment.  A number of other positive changes are proposed in the Bill.  For example, some of the functions of a reformed Seanad would be to scrutinise EU legislation, scrutinise ministerial appointments to public bodies and to conduct public interest inquiries.  I strongly support the idea of votes for immigrants who vote currently for the university seats.  All of us six university Senators are elected, at least partially, by the votes of emigrants of Irish citizens living abroad.  The practical difficulties others have identified can easily be overcome.  In the Constitutional Convention in October we will look specifically at extending voting rights to emigrants in the presidential election where the difficulty Dick Spring would not arise.  <\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity to have this debate and commend the Independent Senators for putting the Bill to the House.  It should inform an important part of the debate leading up to the referendum in the autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500031#EE00800","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1368626400,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I too wish to welcome former Senator Mary Henry to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500031#EE00900","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1368626400,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I admire the Minister because I admire affrontery.

He said with regard to the Seanad and this Bill that any decision for change should be fully teased out.<\/p> <p>What a pity that the Minister and the Taoiseach did not tease out the consequences and their own squalid motivation in attempting to sacrifice the Seanad in exchange for the complete bags everyone in the other House made of the economy in defiance of the voices, including my own, raised in this House to warn them against what they were doing.

I ask him to reconsider.  He has suggested we be allowed to consider including voters from abroad but not, of course, reform of the Seanad or its abolition.  That makes a farce of the convention which we are treating with contempt.  That is why the Minister has a gall to come here and refer to it.  I will be there on Saturday and certainly hope his call which I will present to the convention for it to be considered will be taken up by it.  He then referred to the 156,000 people currently registered to vote whom he seems to promote in some way.

Despite the machinations of the Government and its attempts to cheat the people of a decent choice, from tonight the people will know - I hope it will go out as the message from this debate - that it is no longer a question of abolition or retention.  It is now vitally and significantly a question of reform or abolish.  We have the capacity to reform and will reform.  I do not entirely agree with some aspects of the Bill and look forward to having the opportunity on Committee Stage to indicating what they are.  We are presenting the people with an opportunity to make a real choice, not a choice between desecrating the Constitution and creating a very serious problem.  The Government has everything.

Section 6 sets out clearly that the cultural and educational constituency would have eight Members, the agricultural constituency, nine Members, the labour constituency, ten Members, the industrial and commercial constituency, in which I ran, eight Members and the administrative constituency, eight Members.  I have some minor reservations with these details and have concerns about how they were reached.  It would seem the industrial and commercial constituency should now have more Members and that the five vocational panels should have equality here, although I admit this is a minor detail and one which could be raised on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>The Bill also includes a six-seat constituency for the universities and other institutions of higher education in the State and includes the Taoiseach's right to nominate 11 Members, which is provided for in the Constitution in any case.  I am happy to see both of these provisions as I believe the current crop of Taoiseach's nominees has shown that nominees can contribute greatly to this Chamber and do not necessarily have to be party political appointments.  The Taoiseach does not get enough credit for his appointments in this regard.  The fact that one of the co-authors of the Bill is a Taoiseach's nominee is testament to this.  It is vitally important for the future of the Seanad that the franchise for voting for third level candidates is extended to all institutions and it is shameful this was not done in 1979.  <\/p><p>All political parties have played their part in reducing the effectiveness of the Seanad and it being treated as some place where one waits to go to the D&aacute;il or where one hangs out after one has been in the D&aacute;il.  All parties and the body politic general is responsible for that.<\/p><p>The key part in section 21 seeks to confer on the Seanad a new role in the scrutiny of draft legislation which emanates from the institutions of the European Union.  Our Chief Whip in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Kehoe, is on record as conceding that the scrutiny of EU legislation is not adequate.  Only one committee is charged with examining what is a large volume of proposals and that, in itself, is a failing.  It is clear this is an area that can be improved on.  As a solicitor and somebody with a great interest in European affairs, I believe this would be a great improvement in a reformed Seanad.  <\/p><p>This Bill is a very clear and precise piece of work and it goes a long way to rectify the inadequacies and it will legislate for a more impactful and more relevant Seanad.  I will finish with a quote from a former leader of Fine Gael, James Dillon, who said, let both Houses realise that both are necessary for the liberties of the country and let us join together to improve the efficiency of both Houses rather than joining in a trial of strength between the two Houses aimed at the destruction of one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500032#FF00900","speaker":"1153","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368627600,"counter":229,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ag tarl&uacute;.

Members of the public hold differing views, depending on which day of the week one speaks to them.  People keep changing their minds.  The Bill will, therefore, be discussed for a long time.<\/p><p>  On my first day in the House I quoted Cicero and recommended a book by Robert Harris entitled <i>Lustrum<\/i> in which he referred to Cicero introducing a Bill in Rome to keep Senators and politicians happy.  The Bill recommended that Senators curb their expenses while travelling around the Roman Empire.  Politics has not evolved much when it comes to the issue of Seanad reform.  The book was based on events purported to have taken place in 63 BC.<\/p><p>  On allowing people who live outside the country to vote, I would be concerned about the potential consequences.  Many millions of Irish passport holders move from America to Asia, South Africa and Europe.  If we were to allow every holder of an Irish passport to vote, those living in the Republic of Ireland would not have a say in anything, as potentially 20 or 30 million people could be eligible to vote.  Would the United States be a dedicated constituency?  Would its residents be able to vote in the constituencies of Donegal, Dublin or whatever else?  Let us presume there were 5 million voters.  Would they be able to demand equal representation and take all of the seats in a constituency?  They might claim that it was unfair that Donegal, with an electoral population of only 130,000, had five seats, when with 5 million voters, they only had one.  One way to have a Senator to represent the Diaspora would be for the Taoiseach to appoint one from either the USA, the United Kingdom or elsewhere in Europe, or simply someone from each continent.  Giving votes to every person who holds an Irish passport would be a charter for total confusion and would dilute the vote of a person living and paying taxes in this country.  The people who choose to stay are the ones faced with the challenges.  I, therefore, disagree with giving everyone a vote, just because they wave the Irish flag on St. Patrick's Day.  Most have not contributed to the country.  <\/p><p>  The Seanad Bill has many flaws, but it also has many good points.  The public is faced with a big debate and I hope it will engage in it but not like in the way it did on other issues and in other referendums.  It seems to oppose everything introduced by the Government.  I hope we can have a proper debate, but sometimes people get carried away.  I understand three referendums may be held on the same day, which would be unhelpful when the issues involved are so important. <\/p><p>  The Seanad forms one part of the Oireachtas with the D&aacute;il and the President, yet it is treated like it has a smaller role to play, but, under the Constitution, it holds the same status as the President and the D&aacute;il.  A debate will give a certain element of the public an opportunity to criticise politics and recommend getting rid of the Seanad.  If I were to go on Highland Radio in County Donegal tomorrow morning and suggest we get rid of county councils, 80% of its listeners would ring in to agree with my suggestion.  When dictators took over, they brought down democracy by gradually stripping it away.  Seanad reform is not such an exercise, but we must be careful.  A lot of money could be saved by getting rid of county councils, libraries and many of the groups throughout the country that do a lot of good work.  I, therefore, urge caution when it comes to getting rid of a part of our democracy that has served the country well, despite what many people say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500034#HH00100","speaker":"1144"},{"type":"speech","time":1368628200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I lend my support to the Bill and commend Senators Katherine Zappone and Feargal Quinn and their background staff for contributing to the debate.  I also thank Senators for their kind words on the other Bill on the Order Paper.  The legislation advances the call for a mature debate on the future of the Seanad before the referendum is held in October.  At least we will have theoretical constructs on the Order Paper.  As Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, the Bills are unlikely to get through the entire legislative process.  However, they will stimulate the discussion on the real options available to reform the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>Let us be blunt - my primary motive in advancing my Bill - I am sure the same applies to my colleagues - is not to save the Seanad for its own sake but to reform the Oireachtas.  I joined the House comparatively recently as an outsider.  It appears, with no disrespect to those who run the country and work extremely hard at public representation, that the two Chambers are dysfunctional and have failed, although they have given us a constitutional democracy in the face of threats from various sources over a long period.  On reflection, few countries have enjoyed such a continuous period of parliamentary democracy for as long as ours.  The number is relatively few and in Europe there have been very few.  In terms of where we are economically in the national crisis, it is plausible to blame it in part on the political structure in place.  I have long argued that two forces are represented in the Parliament - parochialism and localism, owing to the way we elect Members to the D&aacute;il, coupled with inexpertise.  There was a cadre of professional politicians who did not, in many cases, bring a substantial life skills set to the Houses of Parliament.   The original idea was to have a balanced Upper House that would introduce a different skills set.  I was going to say it was created by the founding fathers, but I think we all know who the founding father was.  Owing to the natural political evolutionary process and the way local councils are elected, the Seanad has become a mirror image of the other House.  I am respectful, however, of the opinion advanced that the Seanad is a bulwark of democracy that needs to be defended.  However, I am hard-pressed to think of a case, in the past two years, in which I have seen it act as a bulwark and a defender of democracy.  As I said, the main reason to reform the Seanad is not that it is doing something so critically important that we need to protect it but that it will show up the other House.  If we were to enact reforms, or a synthesised version of them outlined in the two Bills, there would be a Chamber in which the majority of the Members would be elected in national constituencies.  That would be hugely important and would remove the element of parochialism, although I do not mean to run down the importance of local politics.  The primary political motive of the good people in the other House and many in this House is to work out how to negotiate a local constituency organisation and a local constituency general electorate at the time of the next election.  <\/p><p>I have a few technical difficulties with the Bill being discussed.  In the event that it reaches Committee Stage - perhaps that is just fantasy - I shall table a number of amendments.  I am most troubled by the nominating process for Seanad &Eacute;ireann and its nominating bodies.  The notion behind them is that they act as a filter between the wishes of the people and the those who appear on the ballot paper.  In an absolute democracy, which is what I believe in, that filter should end.  There is a contradiction between the Bill and the other Bill we will move at the end of the debate.  I have been told that we have received the blessing of the Leader and the Government parties to do so, for which I am grateful.  We propose that any citizen should be able to run for the Seanad as long as he or she has the signatures of 1,000 of his or her fellow citizens on a nominating paper.  I shall not get into comparing and contrasting the two Bills.  However, I am troubled by the idea of having nominating bodies, including two lots of people who sell alcohol, written into the framework for deciding who can be nominated.  Why not let the tobacco industry also act as a nominating body?  What about the muddying of the Medell&iacute;n or Cali cartel?  It makes no sense to me whatsoever that we should allow for this.  We also have the banking federation.  We have two groups representing advertisers who have done rather well historically from the Oireachtas.  We also have the Road Haulage Association which I am sure will have an opinion when we debate legislation to decrease emissions.  <\/p><p>I am unambiguously voting for and supporting the Bill and I am delighted that it will be passed.  Let me be slightly light-hearted for one moment.  I noted the mention of North Korea.  I am delighted that, like North Korea, we, in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, have a dear Leader.<\/p> <p>I am delighted that the good offices of the Government parties have been used to foster democracy by allowing these two Bills to get to a nominal next Stage.  That will enable us to create a template for a vigorous constitutional debate before the people vote in a referendum in October.  That referendum is justified because it is what the Government indicated it would provide for before it ran for office.  We need to have that referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500034#HH00300","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368628800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am delighted to speak on the topic although not, perhaps, delighted that there is a proposal to abolish the Seanad.  The referendum on the Seanad is coming up and the decision will be left to the voter.  I add the caveat, however, that the decision must be left to an informed voter.  I congratulate Senators Zappone, Quinn and Crown for bringing forward their legislative proposals which will help to inform the voter about the process.  They have suggested one avenue, but what others will be presented to inform the voter on what the Seanad does?  When I was elected to the Seanad, the common question I was asked was \"what do you do in there?\".  Many people did not even have a notion that one scrutinises the legislation that is passed by the other House.  An information campaign is, therefore, needed.<\/p><p>We have had many reports on Seanad reform from every side of the House.  There have been 11 detailed reports, all of which have advocated the reform rather than the abolition of the Seanad.  Something is wrong somewhere if all reports recommend reform.  It will be up to the people but it must be an educated decision.  The practical framework for significant reform can be implemented.  The two Bills Senators have presented provide an open platform for informed decision-making on this issue.  The fundamental purpose of the Bill before us is to extend the franchise to a wider electorate.  Every Member has advocated that for many years.  I have only been a Member for two years, but I have heard that suggested when I was outside the House also.  If the electorate were broader, it would be good.  Without going into the detail of the Bill, I note the unwieldy administrative difficulties many Members have mentioned.  When Mary O'Rourke chaired the last sub-committee on Seanad reform, a great deal of improved information was provided to inform how voters should be selected.<\/p><p>Why do we need a bicameral system?  We are not looking to save our jobs in the Seanad.  It may be that none of us will be re-elected if the Seanad survives.  We are seeking to save the system rather than the person.  We need a bicameral parliament as international evidence has shown that bicameralism is not on the decline as some like to suggest.  The majority of the world's democratic states have bicameral systems.  Of 178 members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, 78 have a bicameral parliament.  Ireland is one of 13 EU member states with a bicameral system.  Of the population of the EU, five-sixths live in countries with bicameral parliaments.  If it is good for five-sixths of the EU's population, we should question why we are saying it should be otherwise here.  Studies have found that bicameralism has a positive effect on parliamentary democracy.  Many Members have mentioned democracy in terms of the representation and voice of the Seanad.  The process of legislative bargaining, the quality and oversight of legislation and the oversight of the Executive are improved by bicameralism.  Is the Executive always right?  It is not.  The non-advarsarial debates in the Seanad have been commented on as has their quality and the time given to scrutiny of legislation.  Many amendments have been tabled in the Seanad to D&aacute;il legislation.  Many Bills have been initiated in the Seanad.<\/p><p>Bicameralism affects policy and law making more significantly where one chamber has enough leverage to keep the other from acting unilaterally.  We do not have that power here, but the Bill opens the possibility up for discussion.  However, our system provides that the rules of one Chamber allow it to decide policy on its own after the other has had its say.  Bicameralism has the potential to protect minorities, which is something we must consider, in particular in the context of the methodology of election to ensure all voices are heard in the Seanad.  Minorities should be included in a reformed Seanad.  If the foundations of democracy continue to be weak, whatever we build on them will be weaker still.  That is why we need a stronger, reformed Seanad not its abolition.  Abolition will lead to less democracy and accountability.  We must restore the democratic value of the Seanad, which is at the heart of Irish society and this debate.  Someone mentioned extending the voting age, which the Constitutional Convention has agreed should be reduced to 16.  Someone also mentioned that the Constitutional Convention should examine the decision to abolish the Seanad.  I have heard that such consideration has been ruled out, but perhaps the convention has the right to include it on its agenda.  Issues have also been raised about EU functioning.<\/p><p>I compliment the Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins.  Since I entered the Seanad, he, more than any other Member, has tried to introduce change and to ensure the voice of the citizen is included in parliamentary democracy.  The Bill includes provisions in that regard.  It is necessary to extend a voice out there to the ordinary citizen.  Hopefully, the Leader will be successful in doing that before we end the session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500035#JJ00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1368628800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I commend the Independent Senators and the team supporting them on bringing forward an excellent Bill.  Within the confines of the Constitution, they have come up with extensive provisions which are worthy of support.  My party will fully support the Bill.  There are areas in which we would like the Bill to have gone much further, but we recognise that an attempt was made to introduce a Bill which would not require constitutional change.  While that imposed limits on what could be achieved, I welcome very much the proposals which have been put before the House in the Bill.<\/p><p>We have a very centralised system of governance in Ireland and we are having the wrong debate.  The reason we are having the wrong debate is that the Government has offered up the Seanad as a sacrificial lamb.  The Executive has far too much power.  The role of a backbench Deputy in government or opposition is not robust or what it is in most countries internationally.  It is a sad reflection on the institutions of democracy we have in the State.  We have very few checks and balances.  The Seanad was intended to be a check and a balance, but we must, if we are fair, agree that it has not performed that duty very well.  That has not been because those who have served here have been incapable of doing the job, it has been because the Seanad was not given the powers it needed to be the real check and balance it could and should be.  Checks and balances should be the starting point of any discussion on political reform.  If there is to be a second Chamber, it must have a clear purpose and cannot be a shadow or carbon copy of the other one.  It must offer something different and it must have real powers and functions.  The democratic principles of inclusiveness, sovereignty, the all-Ireland approach, the diaspora and equality should underpin any discussion about the future of the Seanad.<\/p><p>We must be clear and frank as to why we are in this situation and why the Seanad faces abolition.  The Seanad faces abolition because, when he was in opposition, the Taoiseach got a rush of blood to the head and decided on the back of an opinion poll to announce his preference for the abolition of the Seanad without consulting his own party.  Amazingly, very few people in his party said &quot;stop&quot; or indicated the need to examine properly the consequences of abolishing the Seanad.  They did not point out the need to allow for proper debate and scrutiny.  Instead of crying &quot;stop&quot;, members of the Taoiseach's party have supported him ever since.  We have now arrived at a point where a Bill and a referendum are imminent.  It is a bad way to do politics and to treat one arm of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>The same Taoiseach and Government established the Constitutional Convention to look at important constitutional change.<\/p> <p>The Constitutional Convention was established to examine the issue of constitutional change and it is in the process of having a number of important debates.  I have attended all sittings, bar one.  In the coming months it will discuss the issue of electoral reform.  It is made up of citizens and Members of the Oireachtas who are discussing important constitutional changes, the most important of which, the abolition of the Seanad, is not being discussed by it.  This is madness.  I, therefore, call on the Government to hold off on holding the referendum.  It should allow the convention to scrutinise properly the proposals the Minister has described as constructive, as good ideas that offer something to the debate.  If he is really interested in having a debate on the Seanad, why not allow the forum established to examine constitutional change to have a debate and a discussion on the issue?  The convention could then examine whether we need a second Chamber, what it should look like, what powers and functions it should have and how people should be elected to it.  I can be prescriptive, as I have my views and my party will launch its proposals.  The Independent Senators have launched their proposals through this Bill.  Fine Gael and Labour Party Senators opposed to abolition of the Seanad and people outside the Houses also have views.  People outside this Chamber have a view on whether a second Chamber is needed and the Constitutional Convention is the place in which to discuss the matter.  It will be a sad day for democracy if the Government ploughs ahead with the referendum without giving the people a real choice.  We are not giving them a real choice if we say it is a question of abolition or retention without bothering to examine the issue of reform.  If the option of reform is not put to the people, it will be a sign of failure on the part of the entire political establishment which has failed to properly reform the Seanad during the decades.  It had the opportunity to do so and all the reports it needed, but it failed to reform it.  Instead, the Government will opt for taking the populist route of abolition and sacrificing one of the arms of the Oireachtas because it does not want to have a real debate on genuine political reform.  It will be a sad day when the political reforms delivered by the Government for the people, after the crisis we have come through, are having fewer Deputies and councils, what was done to the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the abolition of the Seanad.  We will retain the D&aacute;il which is clearly not working, functional or fit for purpose, while the Executive will retain its powers and have further powers, if the Seanad is abolished.

Why have so many politicians talked about reform but failed to bring it about?  Perhaps it is because we are not capable of having a two House system.  Perhaps we can only deal with the comings and goings of Deputies and the public prefers the soundbite and shorter version of politics we get in the D&aacute;il because of the way it does its business.  Perhaps the public prefers the ping-pong nature of Leaders' Questions.  Does it think Senators are not up to the task of representing it?  Perhaps it has forgotten about people like Mrs. Mary Robinson, President Michael D. Higgins, Mr. Oliver St. John Gogarty, Mr. Henry Guinness, Mr. Douglas Hyde, Mr. Horace Plunkett, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, Mrs. Catherine McGuinness, Mr. John Horgan, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien and Mr. William Butler Yeats.  I also pay respect to former Senator Mary Henry who is with us today.  Have we forgotten the contribution they made or do people believe Senators are different and do not represent the public?  Perhaps we like our two-tier system to have a hierarchy, whereby the Upper House is, in fact, the Lower House and to be ignored.  The answer is very simple: the people do not vote for Senators; they feel they do not have a say in what we do and do not believe we are their representatives.  That is how the Seanad came about and we have not properly reformed the voting system.  The people feel it has nothing to do with them.  They have switched off, do not pay attention and do not understand.  When I have tried to explain the voting system, I cannot do it and others share my difficulty.  That tells everyone that we are somehow elitist.  We are not, but that is how we look.<\/p><p>Is it a good reason to abolish the Seanad because we have a byzantine voting system in which most people do not participate?  I do not believe it is.  It is a reform to take something away and it is attractive and easy, but I do not think it is the right thing to do.  The easiest route is not always the right route to take.  The very good reason to retain it is contained in the Bill &ndash; the importance of dealing with European legislation and the need for its scrutiny.  That is the main reason the Seanad should be retained and reformed.  It is irresponsible that so much legislation comes from the European Union and is not given the scrutiny it deserves, given that we signed up to the Lisbon treaty that gave additional responsibility to national parliaments to scrutinise legislation.  We have not properly addressed that responsibility and the Seanad offers us a perfect opportunity to do so.  It is not optional for me; it is essential.  While the Minister referred to the Bill and mentioned the European Union, he did not address the question of whether the Seanad could have a role to play in that regard.  He made an observation that dealing with statutory instruments might not work, but he did not make an observation about European legislation.  He may share the view that we do not scrutinise legislation, an observation the Chief Whip made.  When we talk about engaging citizens on the future of the Seanad, we could engage with them on the idea of it scrutinising European legislation.<\/p><p>We need to reform the voting system for the Seanad.  We are not an elite body, but we look like one.  Years ago the Committee on Procedure and Privileges talked about including under-represented and excluded groups in Irish society.  That should be the case.  Immigrants should also be included.  It is important that the Seanad become more representative and the voting system should reflect this.  In section 2 of the Bill I applaud the reference to the need for gender equality.  The Seanad does well on that front but not well enough.  I agree with Senator John Crown that this issue must be part of a vigorous debate in order that the public will know what the Seanad does when it comes to vote on the issue.  The people will decide, but, i part, it is up to us to ensure that, if Members forgive the alliteration, we are not Siberia but central to democracy, specifically European democracy.  That is why the Bill will play an important role in the debate and, therefore, I support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500036#KK00400","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1368629400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.

In my Father's house there are many rooms, but certainly in this House there will not be one left.<\/p><p>I served in both the D&aacute;il and Seanad and have a different perspective from most people present.  I served for a number of years in different Departments and brought legislation to this House.  I do not know whether the Minister will agree but it is much easier bringing legislation to the D&aacute;il than the Seanad.  At one point, the anteroom was used as the Seanad Chamber while the Chamber was being redeveloped owing to structural problems.  At that point, I brought forward legislation to remove the word &quot;illegitimacy&quot; from law.  Ms Mary Robinson was the lead Senator at the time and she was very active and effective.  My officials at the time were more concerned about the Seanad than anywhere else, and we were gearing up for the Seanad debate.  That is why I have tremendous respect for this House and why I am in favour of its retention.  The people have a respect for and love of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, the Constitution.  The Minister might as well rip it up.  Approximately 70 sections of this Bill will become redundant if the Government gets its way with the people.  Fianna F&aacute;il opposes the abolition of the Seanad because the Government has not gone ahead with reforms.  The Government proposed the removal of 20 TDs in its manifesto, yet it did not put this to the people.  It reduced the number by eight, which is within the Constitution.  The Government had not the courage of its convictions in that regard.  It has courage and conviction in regard to the removal of the Seanad.<\/p><p>It is absolutely clear in the Constitution that &quot;[t]he Oireachtas shall consist of the President and two Houses, viz.: a House of Representatives to be called D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and a Senate to be called Seanad &Eacute;ireann&quot;.  If the President is out of the country, the Cathaoirleach, the Ceann Comhairle and a Supreme Court judge are responsible for the signature of legislation.  That provision will be gone.  There are numerous sections in the Constitution that embed the Seanad in our system.  It would be more honest to opt for full redesign of the Constitution rather than the section in question.<\/p><p>The Leader has endeavoured to bring in the role of the Seanad under the Lisbon Treaty and the European Union Bill 2009.  I hope we will succeed in that regard.  The Leader has established a small committee to examine this matter.  It is important that legislation not being considered at present be considered.  There were many proposals for the reform of this House over the years.  It is unfortunate that the nettle was not grasped in that regard.  Former Senator Mary O'Rourke formed a committee that was very effective and which made proposals but governmental circumstances developed that did not allow for further progress in that regard.  The matter is quite academic at present.<\/p><p>The Bill before us is sound and has much merit.  Senator Crown has advocated other proposals.  If the people decide in October 2013, or in 2014, not to abolish the Seanad, this Bill, Senator Crown's Bill and other proposals will be considered by the Government.  I appeal to the Minister to put to the people three options, namely, one on abolition, one on retention and one on reform.  The people should be given a choice.  There is nothing in the Constitution that would prevent the asking of multiple questions.  That is a matter for the Minister.<\/p><p>There will be a concerted campaign against the Government on this matter.  It should bear in mind that it may lose.  It may be the beginning of the end for the Government.  I hope to God it loses and that every Fianna F&aacute;il supporter will vote against the abolition of the Seanad because it serves the people.  It serves democracy and prevents a dictatorial Government, with a majority never seen in the Houses before-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500037#LL00800","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1368630000,"counter":253,"content":"<p>The Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto stated otherwise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500037#LL00900","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1368630000,"counter":254,"content":"<p>The manifesto did not say the opposite.

I thank Senators Zappone, Quinn and Crown for their initiative.  I represent 55,000 people.  I do not feel the slightest bit undemocratic.  I represent them under the 1937 Constitution, and do so proudly.  The proposal to abolish the Seanad removes checks, balances and scrutiny.  What kind of Government does not like checks, balances and scrutiny?  I would like to know the charge sheet, rather than hear a statement that the proposal to abolish the Seanad is in the Government's manifesto.  What precisely does the Minister believe this House has done wrong?  If he listens to his ministerial colleagues, he will find out that they praise us for the amendments we have proposed.  Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly has amended the taxi legislation more than 80 times because of contributions made in this House.  The Sinn F&eacute;in contribution on personal insolvency resulted in a similar number of amendments by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.<\/p><p>I am a Member because this country was wrecked in 2008 by banks.  There were no Senators in Government buildings on the night in question.  Why is the Minister not trying to get rid of the bankers?  Why does he not look at the senior civil  servants who did not know what they were doing?  Why does he not tackle the bankers who are still walking around?  We are a bulwark against the destruction of this country and the Minister should cancel the referendum.  He has no right to say that people who stand up against what happened to this country should have their House of Parliament abolished.  There will not be an equal contest as the Minister will have the Government's money while we will be trying to raise a few shillings up and down the country.  The Government will have its advertising campaigns and so on.  The Government Senators who have played a noble role in this Seanad, which has 42 new Members, have, along with the other Senators, worked night and day to make this country better.  The Minister should ask the Leader, who has played a noble role.  We have brought in the MEPs and the Orange Order.  Interestingly, the Orange Order opposed the abolition of Grattan's Parliament.  When I visit Northern Ireland, I find that people hold this Seanad in esteem, particularly on the Unionist side.  The Minister is making enemies unnecessarily by tilting at a windmill that the Taoiseach made when his party was in opposition.<\/p><p>We need checks and balances.  The Executive has too much power.  The Whip system exerts too much pressure.  The lobby groups who walked off with &euro;64 billion - the figure will probably end up at &euro;90 billion - were unchecked.  Why is the Minister not moving against them?  There is a lack of expertise in the permanent Government service, as was pointed out in the Wright report.  We provide it here.<\/p><p>I became a Member in a bankrupt country.  We introduced three Bills, to the credit of this House and the Leader.  One was on fiscal responsibility, the second was on the reform of mortgages along the Danish line, and the third was on banking regulation to separate utility banking from casino banking.  We did that here; the Minister did not do so in the D&aacute;il.  I would not have been able to introduce the legislation had I been a member of the D&aacute;il.  This is a very well-run House and the Minister should examine the evidence to determine what we do here.<\/p><p>Why are we here?  I am delighted that a former Provost of Trinity College, Mr. John Henry Bernard, went to Arthur Griffith before the treaty negotiations in London and said people who would not be elected to the D&aacute;il will wish to make a valuable contribution to the new State.  Mr. Griffith wrote to Mr. &Eacute;amon de Valera, who agreed in writing - the civil war had not started - that we should have a senate.  We have never let people down.  What about Dr. Sheehy Skeffington coming here when beating children was the rule up and down the country?  He was not a member of any political party or the D&aacute;il.  Consider the reforms of Ms Mary Robinson.  Women were not allowed to sit on juries when she introduced her reform.  The work of Senators Norris and Zappone on behalf of the gay community should also be considered.  We have made an incredible contribution to this country.  For the Government to spend public money to abolish the Seanad without even telling us the reason is shameful.<\/p> <p>I hope that when the referendum Bill is before the House, the Government Senators will not support it.  We are being accused behind the scenes of playing too much golf and of too much horse racing.  That might have happened in the past but it has not happened under the current Cathaoirleach and Leader.  Why, then, can the Minister not tell us why he wants to abolish this House, dismember the Constitution and ignore the good work that happens here every day?  There should be no referendum.  This is very obvious to anybody who examines the matter dispassionately.  This House is essential to the good governance of the country.  The people who got us into the trouble are not being dealt with by the senior ranks of the Government.  I refer to the banks and the power of lobby groups.  I hear that legislation on lobby groups has not materialised.  The banks owe us &euro;64 billion.  No Senators were in Government Buildings on the night that the finances of this country collapsed.  We have done our best every day to remedy the problem.  That should be recognised by Members of the D&aacute;il.  It is recognised by the other Ministers who come here and the Minister present, Deputy Hogan, should recognise it also.  He should not waste public money on a referendum when there are so many reform proposals that would be much more creative.  The Minister will lose the referendum and discredit his Government.  What he proposes is seen as petty.  What is he afraid of?  Senators provide checks, balances and scrutiny; that is our job and we discharge that duty with pride.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500037#LL01500","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368630600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I have two very short points.

This places Government Senators in a particularly invidious and absolutely contradictory position because the Whip system insists that Government Senators support the Government.  If a Government Senator were to vote against the Government, he or she would lose the party Whip and, with that, his or her influence.  One could be accused of political cowardice for doing so.<\/p><p>I am a rapporteur on suicide prevention for the Joint Committee and Health and Children and I will be bringing my report to the committee.

To be honest, there are several times when I felt there were positions I could not support but, since I did not want to lose my influence regarding the very important work I felt I was doing on suicide prevention and in order to achieve other aims in other areas, I had to compromise and support a position I was not entirely happy with.  That is the complexity of this matter.  It goes both ways.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in have changed their positions with regard to this matter.  Senator Leyden denies this but I have in front of me information stating Fianna F&aacute;il will support the abolition of the Seanad.  This is clearly written in page 34 of its election manifesto.  Honesty must go both ways.  I have been honest with regard to my position, that of the Labour Party and of Government Senators.

As Cathal Mac Coille pointed out on Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta within the past hour during a programme in which I took part, the Taoiseach announced at a summer school some months before the abolition decision all the ways in which the Seanad could be given a real role.  Within a few months, however, there was a silly electioneering proposal to abolish the Seanad by referendum.  If the Government was sincere about a thinking approach, it would publish legislation on how the House could possibly be reformed.

I thank the esteemed members of the public who are and have been in the Visitors Gallery, many of whom have supported our work.

It contains detailed proposals on reform and the transformation of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

As he stated this evening, this Bill provides a suite of proposals that could be considered by the people before they cast their votes.  He acknowledged the proposals of reform tabled by Senator Crown in this Bill.  Together, both Bills can be used as a basis for reform.  That is important for people to have heard as part of our debate this evening.<\/p><p>I wish to respond to one or two of the issues raised by the Minister in his speech.  As we all said, this is not the time to tease out the detail of the Bill.  The Minister referred to gender equality.  Our principle in this Bill is exactly the same as that which underlies the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act.  It is the principle that shapes our proposals.  Gender quota mechanisms are offered as a way to correct the historic inequality between women and men in parliamentary democracies throughout the world.  We are offering them as a possibility for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We believe this is constitutionally compliant.  A similar mechanism is currently being used in our law in regard to inside and outside panels.<\/p> <p>We need to consider whether we should use the mechanism of gender quotas to correct the inequality of history, and our proposal is that we should.  It is worthy of debate.  We hope that Irish lawmakers, in the context of that debate, will choose an effective way to ensure gender equality.<\/p><p>The Minister and other Senators referred to the practicalities of opening up the vote to so many.  Yes, we must consider these issues and hopefully we will have the opportunity to do that when discussing amendments to the Bill.  The question for our lawmakers is the principle of whether we are in favour of opening the franchise to the diaspora.  Then we can examine the practical considerations.<\/p><p>The Minister also said that the Constitutional Convention is considering the D&aacute;il electoral system.  Other Senators mentioned the fact that, unfortunately, the Government has not allowed the issue of Seanad reform, retention or abolition to be part of the convention's work.  Senator Quinn and I and others have put forward a submission to the convention that it ought to consider the Seanad as part of its agenda.  The chair of the convention has said that he will put that proposal to the members the next time they meet.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their reflective words, criticisms and suggestions.

The main issue of contention, however, is one element of the plan under alignment, which is to transfer the funding from core programmes run by local development companies, LDCs, for example, Leader and the local and community development programmes, to socioeconomic committees set up under the control of local county councils.<\/p><p>Most people would say that over the last 21 years community bottom-up delivery of the local development programmes has served local and rural communities very well.  There is a real concern among community groups, especially those that deliver the programmes, that moving control of programme funding away from communities will do serious damage to the concept of community activism and volunteerism.  The local development model is managed by voluntary boards with strong community input.  It is committed to maintaining the bottom-up approach and to participatory development with a clear focus on addressing the identified needs and allocating resources to the most disadvantaged within communities.  It is flexible at local level to tailor local actions in line with local needs and priorities.  It has a capacity to leverage additional funding for agreed priorities and, most importantly, for every &euro;1 of core funding LDCs leverage an additional &euro;1.59 in funding into local communities.<\/p><p>Since the establishment of these groups in 1991, Ireland has developed the most effective and highly-regarded local development structures in Europe, with the strongest administrative capacity.  Ireland is the envy of Europe and is highly commended for delivery.  A study of the EU local development programmes undertaken by the Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy concluded that, in practice, local authorities rarely have exactly the same objective as local development groups and their leadership may hamper the commitment of other stakeholders, the quality of the innovative process and the success of the local strategy.  Indeed, the European economic and social committee said that this is a structure which effectively complements local authority remits and, at the same time, it is clear that Leader cannot be used as a means of making up for insufficient municipal revenues and financing public services at local level in the EU member states.<\/p><p>With such high praise and support for this model the proposal to transfer the funding for the core programmes could damage, as many of the LDCs believe, the bottom-up approach to local development and call into question the ongoing commitment of strong community and voluntary sector involvement on the boards of local development companies.  Has there been a cost-benefit analysis of whether it is more efficient to deliver local services and schemes through local development companies than to do so through local authorities?  I understand the Minister has set up an alignment working group involving key stakeholders which is charged with developing the terms of reference for the socioeconomic committees, SECs, over the coming months.  Is it correct that the Minister has identified ten front-runner pilot locations for SECs?  Finally, can the Minister confirm that no pilot SEC will be established until the terms of reference for the SECs have been agreed by the alignment working group?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500039#NN01100","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1368631200,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Reilly for the opportunity to clarify some the matters that have been in the ether, as it were, and providing a great deal of misinformation to communities.  I do not know by whom this has been done.<\/p><p>The proposals I am pursuing regarding enhanced alignment between local government and local development are part of the document, &quot;Putting People First - Action Programme for Effective Local Government&quot;.  All the concerns the Senator has raised are misinformed and untrue.  Local communities will continue to be involved in a bottom-up approach to local development, in conjunction with local authorities.  Otherwise, we will not qualify for funding from the European Union under its specific programmes.  Local authorities are more efficient than local communities, some of which are spending in excess of 30% on administration.  Second, the representation on the socioeconomic committees and the terms of reference of the SECs are the subject of discussion with a working group at present, which is composed of all stakeholders including the community groups.  It is making excellent progress and I hope it will be able to conclude the terms of reference at a meeting next week.<\/p><p>I established an expert alignment steering group to look at this area, and its recommendations aim to improve co-ordination of local publicly-funded programmes, improve their efficiency and effectiveness and improve the services for citizens and communities.<\/p> <p>These entities are not set up for the benefit of people who are employed, rather, they are set up for those who are unemployed and need services at local level.  The implementation of these proposals is happening in a collaborative manner.  An alignment working group has been established to assist in their implementation.  It has had representations from the Irish Local Development Network, which is the national representative body of Ireland's 50 local development companies, as well as the City and County Managers Association, Pobal and my Department.<\/p><p> The working group is focusing on the practical arrangements to give effect to the new local structures.  Pilot committees will initially be established in up to ten local authority areas, and across the remaining areas towards the end of 2013.  These committees will have responsibility for oversight and planning for a range of local and community development interventions at local level and will bring local actors together to work in strategic collaboration.  They will develop a more integrated approach to publicly funded programmes, and an enhanced focus on getting the right outcomes and matching resources to priorities. <\/p><p> I also intend that they should look at more sustainable programme administration costs and the use of shared services.  The ten areas for which pilot socio-economic committees are being considered are Dublin City Council; D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council; South Dublin County Council; Leitrim; Roscommon; Offaly; Mayo; Galway County Council; Limerick County Council, and Cork County Council.  Given the tightening of budgets, the collaboration that socio-economic committees will bring will be very important as we work to get the most from available funding.  Local authority and local development interests are all involved in the establishment of these pilot programmes.<\/p><p> My Department is also working with colleagues across Government to achieve a coherent, whole-of-government approach to the planning, management and delivery of programmes.  Like any change process, I appreciate that change is not easy - I am sure Senator Reilly is also getting representations - and the reforms present challenges for all concerned.  About 1,900 people are employed in local development companies, such as Leader, local community development groups, T&uacute;s and rural social schemes.  The current difficult financial model arises from the multiannual financial framework from the EU in respect of CAP, which provides money for the rural development programme.  It is under pressure, and employs 250 people.  The programme will continue, but the efforts to make sure we get the same level of funding as we did over the past seven years will be difficult, in light of what I said.  We have not achieved the same level of funding through the rural development programme under CAP as we did on the last occasion because from 2007 to 2013 the Governments of the day, with the money available in the country, gave a top-up of 5%.<\/p><p> The one thing we do know is that the <i>status quo<\/i>will not hold. The funding available, in particular for the administration of programmes, will remain constrained.  Therefore, we need a fresh approach based not on preserving structures for the sake of it, but on locally based co-operation, to get the most from our funding for the benefit of communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500039#NN01200","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368631800,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Will the establishment of the ten pilot programmes come before or after the publication of the terms of reference from the working group?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500040#OO00200","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1368631800,"counter":279,"content":"<p>It will come afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500040#OO00300","speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Services Provision","time":1368631800,"counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500040#OO00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1368631800,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I am very grateful to the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.

The provision of primary care centres and teams throughout the country will significantly increase health and social care in local communities, and will be achieved by redirecting services away from acute hospitals.<\/p><p>Primary care infrastructure is being delivered using three mechanisms, as the House will be aware, namely, direct build, the leasing initiative and the public private partnership initiative announced in July 2012.  The development of primary care centres, through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multi-disciplinary primary care and represents a tangible re-focusing of the health service to deliver care in the most appropriate and lowest cost setting.  The modernisation of our primary care accommodation and practice is vital to the successful delivery of services in the future.  In this regard, 27 primary care centres have opened since May 2011.<\/p><p>The primary care infrastructure model offers a good opportunity for private sector finance.  The HSE sought submissions from individuals and companies who were interested in developing health facilities which would accommodate the delivery of primary care services in conjunction with local GPs.  Ashbourne primary care centre is being delivered using the operational lease mechanism.  The 19,000 sq. ft. centre is located at Declan Street, Ashbourne.<\/p><p>Some three GPs and their practice staff have already commenced services in Ashbourne primary care centre.

The full commissioning of the building requires the transfer of some equipment from existing facilitates and the delivery of new equipment, which is ongoing.  <\/p><p>When fully opened, Ashbourne primary care centre will accommodate the following services: Ashbourne family practice; public health nursing; physiotherapy; occupational therapy; speech and language therapy; primary care social work; psychology; and a range of outreach consulting services.

No specific recruitment campaign will be required.<\/p><p>The development of Ashbourne primary care centre represents a step forward as regards the modernisation and updating of working practices, facilities and equipment and supporting ICT systems.

Yesterday, the long awaited Higgins report into the establishment of hospital groups in the State was published.  As the Minister of State knows, six groups will be established and there will be consolidation of smaller and larger hospitals with academic links to universities.  We can differ on whether the concept of groups or trusts is good or bad.  I want to raise the concerns of many people in Waterford and the south east regarding what is being proposed.<\/p> <p>Waterford Regional Hospital, it seems, will be renamed as Waterford university hospital and become a full teaching hospital.  That proposal has its merits and attractions.  As it stands, however, Waterford is serving five counties, namely, Waterford, Kilkenny, Carlow, Wexford and south Tipperary.  It provides specialist services and tertiary care in areas such as cancer, neurology, renal services, ear, nose and throat, ophthalmology and a range of other services.  Most of those specialties require a critical mass to justify their retention, which comes from the population base.  In that context, there is a real concern at the prospect of two hospitals in the same region, St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny and Wexford General Hospital, being assigned to an entirely different group or trust from the one to which Waterford Regional Hospital is assigned.<\/p><p>The Higgins report refers to a leakage of patients away from Waterford Regional Hospital to hospitals in Cork and Dublin.  In fact, in a briefing last night, Professor Higgins alluded to 10% of patients from Wexford travelling to Dublin.  In a situation where Waterford will be in one group with Cork, while Wexford and Kilkenny will be in an entirely different group, and those trusts will in time be competing for patients, how does the Government intend to secure the retention of existing services at Waterford?  If the leakage of patients from the region to hospitals in Dublin or Cork continues, then there is a genuine and rational concern that this could, at some point in the future, be used as justification for downgrading services at Waterford.  How can we guarantee that Waterford Regional Hospital, if it becomes a university hospital, will continue to function as a regional hospital and will retain all of the regional and tertiary services it currently provides?  What guarantee can the Minister give in regard to these services and how can he fulfil that guarantee in actions as well as words?<\/p><p>We were told prior to the publication of the Higgins report that Waterford would be providing cardiology services on a 24-7 basis.  This, in fact, was to be one of the carrots contained in the report.  However, what the report actually refers to is enhanced cardiology services.  Indeed, both the Minister and Professor Higgins were very clear when questioned last night that there is no commitment to the provision of that service at Waterford.  Will the Minister of State clarify this issue?  The current situation is that Waterford Regional Hospital is not providing a 24-7 cardiology service for the region as it should and must.  If the Minister of State is in a position to confirm that this service will be introduced, what timeframe is envisaged for its establishment?<\/p><p>Professor Higgins has indicated that the decision not to recommend the retention of the south east as a region was the lack of shared vision or cohesion among the facilities there.  Will the Minister of State indicate what shared vision there is between Mallow General Hospital, for example, and Waterford Regional Hospital?  What shared vision is there between Mullingar, Wexford and Kilkenny?  The argument regarding lack of cohesion is a red herring and I do not see how the Minister can justify these proposals on that basis.  I am asking these questions out of a genuine concern, which is shared by many people in the region, regarding the retention of services at Waterford Regional Hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500040#OO01000","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368632400,"counter":288,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, I thank the Senator for raising this matter, which provides an opportunity to discuss with the House the reports that were launched yesterday.  As the Minister has said, these proposals signal a fundamental modernisation of our health system organisation in line with best practice.  The objectives of the hospital groups are: to achieve the highest standard of quality and uniformity in hospital care across each group; deliver cost effective hospital care in a timely and sustainable manner; encourage and support clinical and managerial leaders; ensure high standards of governance, both clinical and corporate; and recruit and retain high-quality nurses, non-consultant hospital doctors, consultants, allied health professionals and administrators in all our hospitals.  The introduction of groups will provide for organisational change in the first instance, offering more autonomy to providers and better enabling the reorganisation of services in a well-planned manner.  Over time, this will help to improve services and deliver better outcomes for patients.<\/p><p>When it became clear in November 2012 that there might not be sufficient medical professional consensus and support for a stand-alone network or group in the south east, a further period of intensive discussions with the four acute hospitals took place.  As a result, there is now a broad acknowledgement within the consultant establishment in those hospitals that the future development and prosperity of all four facilities is best served by accepting the proposal outlined in the Higgins report which places Waterford Regional Hospital and South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel in the south-south-west hospital group and Kilkenny and Wexford hospitals in the Dublin east group.  Waterford will continue to be a cancer centre under the national cancer control programme.  It will, in addition, be the hub for the south-east renal service and a regional trauma centre.  It will also continue to provide invasive cardiology services for the population of the south east.<\/p><p>In addition, an undertaking was given that the Department and the Health Service Executive would work with University College Cork to enable Waterford hospital to become a university teaching hospital linked to UCC.  Discussions with the university have also taken place and agreement reached in principle on developing closer links, leading in due course to parity status with Cork University Hospital.  These discussions have been shared with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, which has a strategic interest in Waterford Regional Hospital as a major undergraduate teaching campus for its students.  In short, Waterford Regional Hospital is to become a fully recognised university teaching hospital linked to UCC, with all the privileges associated with that status.  In furthering this proposal, UCC is committed to putting in place academic clinical appointments on an incremental basis at professorial, senior lecturer and tutor levels, with associated administrative support.  Discussions within the new group's corporate governance structure and in turn with the HSE and the Department of Health will now commence to give effect to these changes.<\/p><p>The traditional practice of providing as many services as possible in every hospital is neither sustainable nor safe.  Experience in Ireland and beyond informs us that a co-ordinated system of care is clearly better for patients than a more sporadic approach from hospital to hospital.  I am confident that the formation of hospital groups will lead to safer, more effective and more efficient services for all patients.  We are all agreed that the focus in all of this must be on what is best for patients.  That is the starting point.  We do not start from an existing hospital - I am speaking generally here, not specifically about Waterford - and look outward in terms of seeing how we can maintain or preserve everything that has always been available at that particular location.  I appreciate that this is not the Senator's perspective, but it is important to state it.  We must begin by considering how best to serve the needs of patients and organise care at the optimum level for all citizens.  People are usually patients for a short period of time but they are citizens all the time.  The focus must be on building the best possible services around the interests of the patient.  From his contributions in the House, I know the Senator will share that perspective.<\/p><p>Several commentators, including the leader of the Senator's party in the other House, expressed concern yesterday about a lack of detail in the proposal.  Once the groups are established, it will be a matter for each of them to examine some of the outstanding issues that need to be addressed in terms of the best configuration of care across the group.  Those types of decisions will be left to the groups.<\/p><p>In terms of the specific issues the Senator raised, I have indicated that Waterford Regional Hospital will continue to be a cancer centre, a hub for the south-east renal service and a regional trauma centre.  I also referred to the enhancement of the status of the hospital through its links with UCC.  We would all agree that the teaching element of a modern hospital is vitally important.  In fact, there would be questions to answer if a hospital as advanced and important as Waterford were left without a teaching dimension to its work.<\/p> <p>That would be of concern to people, and that will not happen here.  There will be professorial and teaching positions in this hospital, which will give it great strength and endurance.  I have no doubt that Waterford Regional Hospital will endure to serve patients for a considerable period into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013051500041#PP00200","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1368633000,"counter":290,"content":"<p>Waterford Regional Hospital is a teaching hospital.

Following the establishment of these new groups, two hospitals in the region will be in a different group from the group of which Waterford Regional Hospital will be a part, which is the Cork group.  What will happen in a situation where those trusts or groups will compete against each other?
