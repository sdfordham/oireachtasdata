I ask people to bear with me as I am a new Deputy and new to the process of chairing a committee in this House.  Members are requested to ensure that for the duration of the meeting their mobile phones are completely turned off or switched to aeroplane, safe or flight mode, depending on their device.  It is not sufficient for members just to put their phones on silent mode as this maintains the level of interference with the broadcasting system.  That is the first time I have had to read it out so I will do it with my own phone anyway.  It is the first and most important request.<\/p> <p>  Members are aware that this committee is established pursuant to Standing Order 112 as a contingency measure, pending the establishment of the committee system of the Thirty-Second D&aacute;il.  This committee is established to enable the D&aacute;il to exercise its key role under the Lisbon treaty, in particular to assess the subsidiarity aspects of proposed EU legislation.  Today the committee has five EU proposals listed for consideration in that context.  Members should be aware that in accordance with the procedure, the committee will take its decisions on EU proposals in public session following initial consideration of the proposals in private session.

It is not the correct way to do business in the national Parliament.  We do not do private sessions in the Chamber.  Committees are meant to reflect what goes on in the Chamber but in a committee context.  There was no reason why what I heard in private session could not have been said in public.  It looks very bad if anyone who happens to tune in sees that we have discussed everything in private session and are now coming into public session just to rubber-stamp the position.  I do not know the protocol in this House but, D&aacute;il reform or no D&aacute;il reform, it is a bad practice and I do not think the Chairman's own instinct would be comfortable with having discussions in private session that should be in public session.<\/p> <p>  I have no issue with the matters under discussion.  However, we will be obliged to re-examine how we do our business in the future.  By and large, our business should be done in public session.  We are elected as public representatives.  I do not like the practice of private discussions.  There might be a very good reason for that to happen every now and again but we are going to have to revisit this, if not at this committee then as part of D&aacute;il reform.

However, my understanding from the discussion I had with the officials prior to the meeting is that the reason for private session is not in any way to hide or remove something that is being discussed but to enable a very full briefing to be supplied to members on each proposal and allowing for the various aspects of who has privilege.  As Members of the Oireachtas, obviously we enjoy such privilege.  There is no reason why anything that was said in private session cannot be restated in public session as a comment.  It is just a way of facilitating business.  If this committee would like to look at doing something differently, I would be open to that.  Initially, it was just a way of allowing the briefing we received on policy issues to be given to the committee directly.  It was for facilitation rather than any other purpose.
