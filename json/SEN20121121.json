All of us would be concerned that Mr. Halappanavar has said that he will not engage with the HSE investigation.  That must be taken on board by the Minister for Health.  We had a situation yesterday where three of the Galway medics were stood down.  I am not impugning their reputations in any way but I believe they should not have been selected.  The decision was made by the Minister to stand them down and that is fine.  However, this inquiry will not go any further and will not get to the nub of the matter without the co-operation of the family.<\/p><p>I will say nothing more on the issue now except to ask the Acting Leader to raise our grave concerns with the Minister.  A way forward must be found.  We agree that we need to get to the truth as quickly as possible but we need the co-operation of Mr. Halappanavar and Savita's family, who have lost a wife and daughter.  I ask the Acting Leader to raise our concerns with the Minister for Health directly.<\/p><p>On numerous occasions in this House over the last five weeks I have raised the issue of the home help cuts.  I have received no answer that is sufficient.  The only answer I have received to date asserts that both Government parties are committed to providing health care services to people in their homes.  If the Government was so committed it would not have cut 950,000 hours from the system.<\/p> <p>I am sure everyone on the other side of the House has received representations regarding the arbitrary cuts to the numbers of home help hours.  I have dealt with numerous such cases.  Two weeks ago in Swords I met 320 home help workers who did not know what was going on.  Cases are not being properly assessed before cuts are made across the board.  When I raise an issue, I am told an assessment will be carried out.  I previously described the example of an 88 year old double amputee who had had his hours cut.  When I raised his case with the HSE, I was told it would assess him, with the result that his hours were restored.  If savings are to be sought in this area, a proper assessment of clients is required.  This is happening all over the country.  Will the Acting Leader and her Labour Party colleagues give a commitment that there will be no further cuts to home help or home care packages in the forthcoming budget?  Will they also commit to ensuring the 450,000 hours cut at the end of August will be restored?  Assessments should be conducted on the basis of need rather than as an accounting exercise aimed at saving \u20ac8 million.  It makes no sense.  The more people who lose home help hours, the more will end up in hospitals where they neither want to be nor need to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100002#A00500","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353493800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>All of us share Senator Darragh O'Brien's view that a way forward needs to be found in the inquiry into Savita Halappanavar's death.  The trauma endured by her husband is compounded by the confusion surrounding the inquiry.  Mr. Halappanavar stated when he returned to India after Savita's death that there was complete silence on the part of the HSE.  He was not contacted by the hospital for a full two weeks.  That is surprising, given that hospitals are obliged to conduct internal inquiries by their own risk review groups in the event of sudden deaths of this kind.  Such a review should have commenced within hours of her untimely death and would surely have involved Mr. Halappanavar.  This practice is common to all institutions.  Were such incidents to happen in the Houses of the Oireachtas, an airport or a school, such an internal inquiry would be obligatory.  The resulting report would indicate whether guidelines were followed and could establish the paper trail and facts surrounding Savita's death.  I would like to know the status of the report of the review group and call on the Acting Leader to inquire of the Minister for Health as to its whereabouts.  Given that Savita Halappanavar died almost one month ago, on 28 October, the internal report should have been completed by now and I ask that it be released immediately.  If it has not been completed, why not?  Has the review actually been started?<\/p><p>An independent inquiry must also take place.  It cannot be organised or managed by the HSE because it has its own questions to answer.  The inquiry could extend beyond an internal review aimed at establishing the facts to take account of the complexity of the issues arising from Savita's tragic death, including the questions raised by Mr. Halappanavar.  I urge the Minister to bring the expert review group's report to the Cabinet as a matter of urgency and publish it immediately afterwards.  The Government is committed to reporting to the European Court of Human Rights by the end of November and, as a newly elected member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, a breach of that order would be extraordinary.<\/p><p>In regard to the situation in Gaza, I am sure we share enormous concern about the slowness of the emerging ceasefire.  I ask the Government to reconsider Israel's membership of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement, EuroMed, which allows it to engage in free trade with the European Union.  The agreement is based on respect for human rights and democratic principles.  Should we continue to allow Israel's inclusion in the agreement, given what has happened?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100003#B00200","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1353493800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Last week we had one of our best Seanad debates with the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Shane McEntee, on ash dieback disease.  I thank the Leader for arranging that debate and commend the Minister of State on his enthusiasm.  I was joined by a number of botanists at the David Webb centenary celebration on Friday.  There are several dangers in this area.  It emerged during last week's debate that the United Kingdom had largely given up and that it was up to us to protect our stock of ash trees.  This outbreak is likely to be ten times as devastating as Dutch elm disease.  On Friday botanists expressed their fear that the burning of saplings might spread the spores of the fungus and thereby make matters worse.  Concern was also expressed that the GAA, a strongly nationalist organisation, was importing 70% to 90% of its hurleys and thus bringing the disease into the country.  I would like to ask the Minister of State whether Ireland could become an island nursery for disease-free trees and whether he could address the fears expressed by botanists that the next wave of these diseases will affect oak trees.  The Seanad responded splendidly to a national problem by stressing the all-Ireland dimension.  If the UK mainland is not successful in avoiding this disease, the North-South dimension will be important.  By expanding the study of these matters in Irish universities, rather than allowing it to contract, we could develop an island nursery for native trees and thereby avoid the destruction by imported diseases of the landscape and the tourism and other amenities which depend on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100003#B00300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1353493800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Last week I raised the issue of third level grants and SUSI's operations.

Students who encounter problems with grant application approvals are sending documents to us in order that we can scan and forward them to SUSI while keeping a record of everything sent.  SUSI is no longer accepting scanned material and is instead asking us to post documents to P.O. Box 12210 in order that they can be scanned and forwarded for processing.

A new system intended to streamline the process has made it a thousand times worse.  The centralisation of the process has resulted in disaster for students and families under financial pressure, with students being forced by colleges to consider withdrawing from their courses.  The Acting Leader needs to arrange another debate on this issue with the Minister for Education and Skills because some students are uncertain whether they will be returning to college after Christmas.<\/p> <p> I would also like the Acting Leader to organise a debate on the creeping federalism of the European Union and the statement made recently by a Member of the European Parliament that there should be a European security concept - euro-speak for a European army - and that there was a political will for military operations, for which we would need an institution.  \"Institution\" in this context means a European army.  I ask the Acting Leader to organise a debate on this issue.<\/p><p>The acting leader for the Labour Party mentioned the EuroMed agreement and how Europe is acting collectively.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was asked about the issue of settlement goods being sent to Europe under the agreement.  As we know, the West Bank is outside the recognised State of Israel and should not be covered by the EuroMed agreement.  When asked what Ireland was going to do about this, the Minister said we were going to work with our European colleagues.<\/p><p>There was a time when Ireland had an independent foreign policy and in the event that a country such as Israel, or any other country, was abusing human rights, agreements would be suspended.  It is provided for in the EuroMed agreement that once human rights are abused, the agreement will be suspended and countries will no longer have preferential trade agreements with the European community.  We know, and it has been independently verified by the United Nations, that the rights of people in the West Bank are being violated on a daily basis.  Why then is the EuroMed agreement still in place?  Why is the Minister, Deputy Gilmore, not saying to our European colleagues, seeing as they cannot act or come to an agreement, that Ireland will act alone?<\/p><p>Tr\u00f3caire, an organisation we all recognise and respect, has launched a campaign to boycott goods coming from the settlements - not those from Israel, but those from the illegal settlements in the West Bank.  However, the Government has failed to act.  When Ronald Reagan was in power, there were 40,000 illegal settlements in the West Bank.  Today, the number is closer to 500,000.

Everywhere I turn in Galway, I am told by retailers and their employees that they are being financially devastated by the sale of counterfeit products in unregulated and unpoliced markets and fairs which roll into country towns on a weekly basis.  Meanwhile, hard-working retailers who pay rates and provide permanent employment to staff are routinely inspected to ensure they comply with the law of the land in terms of the sale of alcohol, cigarettes and fuel.  What is most unfair for these law-abiding retailers is that they must witness a situation in which there are few or no inspections, let alone prosecutions, for the illicit activities being carried out by some unscrupulous traders at markets and fairs, where, for example, DVDs sell for a few euro and 20 cigarettes sell for approximately \u20ac4.  This contrasts sharply with the retail prices of these items, which include various duties and VAT through which retailers make a real contribution to the Exchequer.  This is a scandal.

We want peace in Israel and Gaza, but we expect and only hear anti-Israeli comments.  It is time for balance on this and I would like to hear that balance expressed, not just here but in the media as well.<\/p><p>I would like to draw attention to an interesting survey entitled Love Irish Food, which was published this week.  When I shop, I like to buy on the basis of price, taste and value.  I also like to buy Irish-produced food.  I was surprised that the survey indicated that large numbers of people assume the products they buy are made in Ireland.  Many people are unaware of the fact that Lyons tea is not produced in Ireland - Barry's tea is - that HB ice cream is not produced in Ireland and that Batchelors beans are produced here while Heinz beans are not.  I do not suggest we should boycott these products, but knowing where the food is produced plays a part in the decisions we make.<\/p><p>I bring one bit of good news to the House.  I was delighted to discover that the Brighter Evenings Bill, a Private Members' Bill, is being introduced in the D\u00e1il this week.  I have had a hang-up for 20 years or more about the need for Ireland to align itself with Central European Time.  The good news is that Deputy Tommy Broughan has introduced this Bill in the D\u00e1il.  The Bill is based on what has happened in Britain recently, where there has been cross-party support for a Bill suggesting that a three-year test be carried out.  We should move to Central European Time for three years as a test, as was done back in the late 1960s.  This would give us brighter evenings the whole year round and the benefits of that would be immense.  I believe this will happen now because there has been an attitude change in Scotland and other parts of Britain.  They will probably accept this.  The sooner we get this Brighter Evenings Bill passed, so that we are in a situation to move at the same time as Britain, the better.  This would bring all sorts of benefits, including in the areas of tourism and energy.  It might also help reduce road accidents.  It is something we should undertake and I congratulate Deputy Tommy Broughan on the Bill's introduction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100004#C00300","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1353494400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I join Senator Darragh O'Brien in asking that the situation relating to the inquiry into the events that took place in Galway University Hospital when Savita Halappanavar lost her life to be reviewed in a calm manner.  It is obvious that the family of the deceased are unhappy with the situation, and it is desirable that this be taken on board.  I am aware this is a particularly delicate issue and that some people have expressed their unhappiness with the appointment of the chairman of the inquiry because of his past.  The issue needs to be reviewed.  I call on the Minister to sit down with the HSE as a matter of urgency and examine the review to see how it can best be structured to meet the needs of the family and bring a satisfactory conclusion to this issue as soon as possible.

I have raised this issue in the House on a number of occasions.  I am deeply concerned that many small businesses are struggling and may cease trading in the new year unless this issue is addressed as a matter of urgency.  The State is losing much-needed revenue that could fund some of the services mentioned this morning, such as home help.  We are losing up to \u20ac1 billion per annum as a result of illegal and criminal activity.  It is incumbent on the House, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Finance to take a keen interest in this matter.  If the State is losing revenue, we are all losers.  Many businesses are stretched to meet their daily commitments and must compete with people who are smuggling.  Significant revenue is lost, particularly in the cigarette trade.  The sale of these products in broad daylight at markets could be tackled easily.  I urge the Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure the Garda is keeping a particularly close eye on these activities which take place in many towns throughout the country, particularly at weekends.

The same call should be made this year.  It is important we have a constructive debate on the budgetary decisions that will be made.

Choices are open to the Government such as whether we cut child benefit or home helps or increase taxes on those who can afford to pay, and whether we go for a property tax on the family home which does not generate income or a wealth tax which does generate wealth.  We need a serious debate in the country on how we present budgets and the choices we make.<\/p><p>When it comes to cutting home helps, child benefit, other benefits or allowances for people with disabilities it can quite easily be done and we are then told by the well-paid politicians who make these decisions that must be done in the interests of the country.

They have been very quiet.<\/p><p>I support the views of Senator Darragh O'Brien on the inquiry into the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar, and the concerns of her husband, Praveen, must be taken into account in this regard.  It is a very serious situation and I fully concur with Senator O'Keeffe in her views.  She spoke very well and the Minister should listen to what she said about the first inquiry which should have been carried out by now as it happened over a month ago.<\/p><p>I am a former chairman of the Western Health Board, and people tend to forget that University College Hospital, Galway, has provided tremendous maternity services.  I know from personal experience it is one of the top maternity hospitals in Ireland.  This is a tragedy, which is why it grabbed the attention of the country.  There is another side to the coin with regard to what has been achieved in the hospital.  The quicker the inquiry is carried out, with the approval of the husband, the better.  The Government must go back to the drawing board and decide what action will be taken because the issue will not go away.  Senator Darragh O'Brien outlined what our view has been from the very start.  What happened in Galway has wide implications for every expectant mother and must be resolved.  Senator O'Keeffe should send her submission to the Minister immediately if she has not done so already.

The present debate will not bring about the necessary investigation.  In fairness to everyone, there must be compromise by all involved to ensure we establish a proper inquiry team.  The chairman appointed has a great deal of experience.  He was involved in the inquiry in Northwick Park Hospital where ten maternal deaths occurred in a short period of time.  Yesterday I spoke to someone in the UK, and there it is normal for such an inquiry to include local input to ensure the inquiry team is made fully aware of the practices and procedures normally followed in the hospital facility involved.  This is why the three people were initially included.<\/p><p>The Minister has agreed to review this and to bring in people other than the three from the hospital itself, which is welcome in view of the family's concerns.  However, it is important that a compromise is reached at the earliest possible stage so that as soon as possible the inquiry is held, the facts on what went wrong in the management of the patient are made available to the family, and we ensure it does not occur again.

A feature of this on which people often comment is a memorial on which the following text from Bible is inscribed: \"Pray for the peace of Jerusalem\".  I pray for the peace of Jerusalem and Gaza.  I was moved last night by the concerns expressed on television by two women, one a Jewish woman who has relatives in Israel and the other a Palestinian woman who has relatives in Gaza, for their relatives.  That is a balance of grief.  However, when it comes to the actual military situation on the ground, what is required is not only balance but proportionality.  On many occasions in the past I have spoken out on behalf of Israel, and I have condemned violations of human rights wherever they occurred.  I am not interested in Palestinian or Jewish rights, or gay or women's rights; rather, I am interested in human rights.  In terms of proportionality, what grieves me, as someone who loves and appreciates the whole Jewish culture and the State of Israel in its historic role, is the blasphemy against the fundamental ethos of Judaism in the killing of women and children.  I never thought I would live to see this day, and I regret that I have.<\/p><p>Account must also be taken of the evidence of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNWRA, with regard to the school that was attacked during the previous invasion and blitzkrieg, from which there was no escape as it was on the coastline of the Middle East.  For three and a half years the Israelis said there were gunmen or military targets there, but they have now admitted this was not true.  We need to bear this in mind.<\/p><p>I hope that the peace process works.  I wish it well and applaud the Egyptians for the role they are playing.  It is a question of human grief.  It is vulgar to view these matters as if they were a cricket score.  The lack of proportionality is extraordinary.  Yesterday, 100 Palestinians and three Israelis were killed.  I mourn and grieve for all of them, but the question of proportionality arises.<\/p><p>I take this opportunity to say that Hamas was inspired and provoked by the Israelis in order to undermine Arafat.  I recall when this was done.  However, it backfired on them, which I regret.  I have never been sympathetic to Hamas, but it won an election democratically.  That will never be accepted here.

There had been some doubt following the emergence of the Muslim Brotherhood, who are the ideological mentors of Hamas, that this might upset the balance within the region.  However, President Morsi is taking a pragmatic view, fortunately, and is obviously aware of the threat to the region posed by any shift in alliances.  The fact that Egypt is supporting the continuing bilateral discussions between Israel and Hamas is to be welcomed.  It is hoped there will be a resolution of the situation.  I believe everybody is agreed that the last thing that is needed is a ground invasion of the Gaza.  Israel has overwhelming military superiority but, as even its supporters will say, it always seems to inflict horrors of far greater proportion than needed.<\/p><p>I unreservedly condemn the brutality of Hamas, which killed seven people yesterday.

It is critical that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health intervene to ensure an outcome that is satisfactory to both sides, including for Savita's husband Praveen.

However, many of the laboratories to which I refer are involved in many more activities than just carrying out blood tests.  For example, they test other samples - a service farmers require in order to do their business - carry out post mortems on deceased animals in order to determine which diseases may be becoming more prevalent again and so on.

We all agree on one thing, which is that diplomacy is a very strong weapon.  Unfortunately, diplomacy is often under-used.  As we are aware in this country, that can be due to party political considerations, upcoming elections or the need for someone to prove himself or herself to be a strong leader.  It is unfortunate that when diplomacy is not used, it is generally replaced by terror.  When the latter comes into play, it exacerbates the position and moves the possibility of achieving a solution to one side.  Worse than that, the victims are generally innocent people.  I refer, in particular, to women and children.  The three innocent people in Israel who were killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip are not just a statistic, as they were deprived of the human right of life.  In addition, their surviving family members will be condemned to mourn them for the remainder of their lives.  Similarly, the slaughter of the innocents in Gaza cries out for a halt to hostilities and for justice.<\/p><p>We are all feeling frustrated and helpless.  At times, we are extremely disappointed by the very cosmetic press conferences we are obliged to watch on television.<\/p> <p>The bottom line is that unless we look after the Palestinian people in a just and right way, give them an identity of their own, allow their nation to function and stop the idea of power politics, quietly in the background, supporting Israel, we will condemn both sides to continuing episodes of terrorism as we are now seeing.  We have a proud record of standing up to be counted.  We saw that over the years when we stepped out of line with the other powers in order to do that.  I hope that we do not acquiesce in some way with what is now happening.  Let us stand up and say that the brutality which has been directed towards the Gaza Strip and the Palestinian people is not acceptable under any circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100007#F02100","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353496800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100008#G00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1353496800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>We want an urgent response to finding a lasting and just solution for all the people in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100008#G00300","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1353496800,"counter":66,"content":"<p>Senator Darragh O\u2019Brien and many other Senators, including Senator O\u2019Keeffe, Senator Mullins, Senator Colm Burke, Senator Healy Eames and Senator Walsh, raised their concerns about the recent case in Galway of Savita Halappanavar who, unfortunately, lost her life.  I will bring those concerns to the Minister and to the Leader.  It is imperative that we get the facts about exactly what happened.  Women attending University Hospital Galway and other hospitals around the country are concerned that procedures and processes are in place to ensure that something like that does not happen again.  As many Members have said, it is a very sensitive issue.  The Government is committed to establishing the facts.  Yesterday, the three medical experts from University Hospital Galway were removed in light of concerns expressed by Savita\u2019s husband and family about their involvement in the inquiry.  I will bring the concerns of Members about the chairman to the Government.  The chairman of the inquiry is an expert in the field.  He is internationally recognised as having expertise in investigating such situations.  That is why he was appointed to chair the investigation.<\/p><p>The Minister indicated that he intends to bring the report of the expert group on the A, B and C case to Cabinet next Tuesday, 27 November and to publish it afterwards.  I am sure we will have an opportunity to debate the long-awaited report.  We look forward to it.<\/p><p>On the issue of home help raised by Senator Darragh O\u2019Brien, the Minister has said continually that home help will be given on the basis of need.  If need is established then home help will be provided.  Like other Members on both sides of the House I have brought particular cases to the attention of the local HSE office when there is concern that the home help allocation to a family or individual has been reduced unnecessarily.  The hours will be allocated on the basis of need.  Senator O'Brien asked me to give an assurance that there will be no cuts in that regard in the budget.  I cannot give it.  Nobody knows the content of the budget.  The allocation to the HSE as a whole will be provided in the budget.  We will await the details on budget day and we will have an opportunity to debate the contents of the Budget Statement in the House.<\/p><p>A number of Senators raised the issue of Gaza \u2013 Senator O\u2019Keeffe, Senator Daly, Senator Norris, Senator Quinn, Senator Mooney and Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa.  The situation there is tense.  Residents on both sides have experienced casualties; in the Gaza Strip and on the Israeli side.  I accept that we must support a diplomatic solution to the conflict.  I acknowledge the important role Egypt is playing.  It will be key to finding a solution.  I hope the efforts of the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban, who was in the area yesterday and the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who is there today, will bring about a ceasefire.  While none of us knows exactly what is going on I welcome the role Egypt is playing.  We hope there will be a ceasefire in the immediate future.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett spoke about ash dieback.  We had an important debate last week on the issue.  I will bring his point to the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, about this country becoming a nursery for disease-free trees.  I do not know whether oak trees are next.  A serious situation could arise.  The Senator\u2019s point is interesting.  We are an island and when foot and mouth disease broke out that was an important element in containing the spread of the disease.<\/p><p>Senator Kelly referred to SUSI.  Through the Leader, I will bring his concerns to the Minister and ask for an update on a regular basis on the level of grants that have been approved and the number of them that have been paid, which is the most important issue.  There is much concern, in particular at this time of year.  Students and their families need grants so they can move on to the next term.  The payment of grants is an issue of concern to them and we will ensure there is feedback on the progress in the area.<\/p><p>Senators Higgins, Mullins and Conway were concerned about counterfeit goods, the black market and the black economy.  Requests were made to bring the issue to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality and that he would ensure the Garda is vigilant and alert.  The issue must be highlighted on a regular basis.  We share the concerns.  I will bring them to the attention of the Minister, through the Leader.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn referred to the Love Irish Food Survey.  I read the article to which he referred with interest.  The Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation previously received a submission from Guaranteed Irish, which is a very important authentication.  Not every product can qualify.  Perhaps we should have a debate on the issue.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, was present in the House yesterday for a debate on job creation.  The retail area is suffering and the more we can highlight the necessity for people to buy Irish goods the better.  Like Senator Quinn, I welcome the Brighter Evenings Bill.  I look forward to progress in the area, in particular given that the United Kingdom is making changes, which was always an obstacle to change in this country previously.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane called for a debate on alternative budget proposals.  Last week we had a debate on the economy in which a total of 11 Senators participated.  We previously had a debate on 8 November on public sector reform and public expenditure to which 12 Senators contributed.  We will have an opportunity in the coming weeks to debate financial proposals and we will have a chance to discuss alternative budget proposals also.  He also called for a specific discussion on wealth tax.  In last year\u2019s budget a number of taxes were increased.  Capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and deposit interest retention tax were all increased, the former to 30%.  They could be considered a tax on wealth.  We can look forward to finally hearing details on the proposed property tax, which could also be considered a wealth tax.<\/p><p>I am aware of the Waterford Gives a Shirt campaign and today\u2019s demonstration, which Senator Landy raised.  I will bring his comments to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.<\/p> <p>The Minister intends his proposals to ensure greater efficiency and better service for the people.  I will convey the Senator's comments to him.<\/p><p>Senators Terry Leyden and Colm Burke commented on the Savita Halappanavar case.  I will make the Minister aware of the concerns of the House in this regard.<\/p><p>Senator Jimmy Harte also commented on the issue of a wealth tax, while Senator Paschal Mooney stressed the importance of consumers purchasing Irish-made goods.  <\/p><p>Senators Fidelma Healy Eames and Martin Conway spoke about the Galway issue.  They are also concerned that a consultant who has hepatitis C is working in a hospital.  I am not sure of the details of that case or the procedures involved, but I will bring their concerns to the attention of the Leader.  I am sure there will be a response from the HSE on the matter.  <\/p><p>In reply to Senator Marc MacSharry, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is a regular visitor to the House.  He intends to come again in the near future when the Senator's concerns can be raised directly with him.  I suggest the Senator submit an Adjournment matter and he may receive a direct response which may be of assistance.  <\/p><p>Senator Jim Walsh spoke about the inquiry into the case in Galway.  It is hoped there will be a speedy resolution and that answers will emerge.  It is important that the Government move forward on the issue.  I will bring the concerns of Senators to the attention of the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100008#G00400","speaker":"1114","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353497400,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Transport (C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann and Subsidiary Companies Borrowings) Bill 2012: Order for Second Stage","time":1353497400,"counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100009#H00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353497400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Bill entitled an Act to amend the provisions of the Transport Act 1950, the Transport (Re-Organisation of C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann) Act 1986 and the Transport Act 1987 in so far as they relate to the borrowing powers of C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann, Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann - Irish Rail, Bus \u00c9ireann - Irish Bus and Bus \u00c1tha Cliath - Dublin Bus, to amend Schedule 2 to the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 and to provide for connected matters.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1353497400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I move: \"That Second Stage be taken now.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100009#H00500","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353497400,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Transport (C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann and Subsidiary Companies Borrowings) Bill 2012: Second Stage","time":1353497400,"counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100009#H00700"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353497400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1353497400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I am pleased to introduce this legislation which deals with CIE's borrowing powers for non-capital purposes.  Strengthening CIE's capacity to raise credit on a sustainable basis is a key element of a wider set of measures designed to place its finances in a healthier state for the future.<\/p><p>The CIE group has had to confront a very difficult financial situation.  As in most business sectors in the State, the current economic environment is very challenging for public transport providers.  The cause of the problem is primarily the recession which has caused a drop of over 20% in passenger numbers from the peak in 2007.  This has been partly offset by fare increases, but revenue is down by over 11% from the 2008 level.  The public service obligation, PSO, subvention has reduced by 21% between 2008 and 2012 and is due to fall by another 14% in the next two years.  The removal of the fuel rebate is estimated to have cost the group around \u20ac22 million, at a time when it has had to absorb higher fuel prices.  In 2006 and 2007, as a result of the CIE operating companies expanding their network of services and growth in the economy, CIE experienced an increase in passenger volumes and revenues.  However, the impact of the economic downturn which started in 2008 resulted in decreases in passenger numbers in each year from 2008 to 2011.  Once the expected increase in demand did not materialise as a result of the economic downturn, CIE was faced with an expanded network of services and reduced revenues which resulted in each of the operating companies incurring deficits in each of the years 2008 to 2011, with the exception of Bus \u00c9ireann which generated a small surplus in 2011.  While the CIE group reported surpluses in each of the years from 2006 to 2008, 2007 was the only year in the period 2006 to 2011 in which the group generated a surplus when the gains from the disposal of fixed assets were excluded.  In the past three years, 2009 to 2011, CIE suffered a total loss of over \u20ac137 million after exceptional items.  Clearly, this level of losses cannot be sustained and must be addressed.<\/p><p>Since income began to fall in 2008, there has been a succession of measures to deal with the underlying problem, including cost reductions, fare increases, service efficiencies such as the network direct programme in Dublin Bus and similar rationalisations in Bus \u00c9ireann, and measures to make public transport more attractive such as the Leap card, real time passenger information, the provision of Wi-Fi, on vehicles and trains, for example.  The operating companies cost recovery programmes were commenced in 2009 in an effort to eliminate these deficits.  These efforts have been undermined by continuing falls in passenger numbers, reductions in the operating subvention and increases in costs such as fuel outside the control of CIE.  While progress has been made in reducing costs and headcount to date, these reductions have not been sufficient to eliminate the deficits in the operating companies.<\/p><p>The 2011 annual report and financial statements for CIE and those of the three subsidiary companies were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas last week.  <\/p><p>An unqualified audit report was issued by the group's auditors on CIE's 2011 financial statements.  However, the auditors have included a heading, &quot;Emphasis of Matter&quot;, regarding the group's ability to continue as a going concern.  They note that funding and trading difficulties give rise to uncertainty for the business and challenge the group's ability to continue to trade as a going concern.  The board of CIE expects these uncertainties to be addressed through a range of measures, including the realisation of non-core assets; a reduction of the cost base, including payroll reductions; multi-annual fare increases and the curtailment of the own-funded capital programme.  The CIE companies have been endeavouring to deliver savings which will not have an adverse an impact on services.  However, it will be a struggle every year to meet the reduction in the PSO budget while maintaining services.<\/p><p>Both the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and I have engaged in consultations with the CIE companies.  We have stressed the need to respond to the PSO subvention funding challenges through further cost savings in their activities.<\/p> <p>A recovery in passenger numbers and further increases in fares could soften the impact of PSO subvention.  All concerned in my Department and in the NTA must focus on identifying key public transport priorities in our cities and across the country.  In turn, the PSO service providers will have to achieve greater efficiency and cost effectiveness in the years ahead based on a realistic assessment of the scope and level of contracted services.<\/p><p>Each year funding is provided for socially necessary but financially unviable public transport services.  Funding for such services is made available under the Vote for my Department by way of a payment to the NTA for PSO services.  Subvention paid to public transport providers is relatively low compared to the norm in other European countries.  In many other countries the average subsidy-fare box ratio is about 50%, whereas in Ireland fare box revenue for our bus companies is over 60%.  In recent years the total subvention paid to the three CIE subsidiaries has been reduced from a high of \u20ac308 million in 2008 to the \u20ac242 million originally earmarked for 2012.  On 24 July last, the Government decided to provide additional funding of \u20ac36 million to CIE to ensure the companies could continue to operate for the rest of 2012.  This brings the total subvention for this year to \u20ac278 million, higher than the subvention for 2010 and the fifth highest level of subvention ever.<\/p><p>At this difficult time for the public finances it was not easy to find a large amount of additional funding.  It involved difficult decisions to divert funding from other worthwhile and important projects and initiatives while imposing sacrifices on others.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, and I met regularly with the four chairs and senior executives of the CIE companies, as well as with union representatives.  While facilitating a range of measures to address the problems, we have stressed that significant progress needs to be made in the development of a realistic, sustainable and robust business plan by CIE to deal with the current economic realities, cost reductions with the CIE group and employee support for same, the sale of non-core assets and the securing of new credit facilities.  These various avenues are being explored.  The additional funding for this year only provides a short breathing space to CIE.  It is essential that management and staff in the CIE companies use this time productively to discuss and implement proposals to cut costs that can help address the serious financial position in which the CIE group finds itself.  In this regard, I am anxious that the current negotiations between management and unions at the two bus companies be concluded as soon as possible.  In view of the difficult financial situation of CIE and the need to finalise its business planning for 2013, it is imperative that these discussions result in a positive outcome in the next few weeks.<\/p><p>CIE is progressing the preparation of a revised five-year business plan with aggressive targets that will support the reporting of trading improvements in 2013.  It is intended that the business plan will address the underlying financial challenges facing CIE so that its public transport services can be provided efficiently and cost-effectively over the plan's period.  The decisions taken so far by the Government and the financial provisions made for CIE were fundamental in creating a better operational environment for the organisation.  There is, however, no room for complacency.  CIE's future must be one of efficiency and effectiveness with due regard to what the Exchequer can afford to bear.  The measures that have been taken and are planned are in the longer term interest of CIE and its employees.  The resolution of CIE's financial position will involve increased borrowing facilities for non-capital purposes.  CIE's current borrowing limit is set at \u20ac107 million and it has facilities in place with banks to that limit which expire during 2013.  The purpose of the increased limit of \u20ac300 million is to give CIE maximum flexibility to ensure access to long-term working capital and short-term funding facilities.  In no way is the proposed limit to be taken as an indication that CIE will be exposed to a massive increase in its debt position.<\/p><p>While it is expected that the debt position will increase beyond the existing facility of \u20ac107 million in 2013, CIE is undertaking an aggressive business planning process with the aim of returning to a break-even position and achieving a sustainable debt position in subsequent years.  It will be judging carefully the range of credit facilities necessary, including both longer-term facilities and overdraft-type facilities, to enable it to effectively manage its cashflow and day-to-day working capital requirements.<\/p><p>Recent experience has necessitated a strengthening of financial management systems, and there is a need to ensure the corporate governance arrangements of the boards of CIE and its subsidiary companies are enhanced.  A detailed review of the group's financial systems and treasury management arrangements has been undertaken and measures put in place to strengthen those areas in the holding company and subsidiaries.<\/p><p>The existing total borrowing limits for CIE for non-capital purposes are set out in the provisions of section 28 of the Transport Act 1950 and section 3 of the Transport Act 1987, which provide for borrowing up to limits of \u20ac50 million and \u20ac57 million, respectively.  It is now proposed to amend the 1950 Act to provide for an increase in the borrowing ceiling to a level of \u20ac300 million and to streamline CIE borrowing powers into a single enabling provision for all forms of borrowing undertaken by CIE for non-capital purposes.  Separately, section 130 of the Railway Safety Act 2005 already provides for a ceiling of \u20ac600 million for capital borrowing by CIE.<\/p><p>Section 1 substitutes a new section 28 into the Transport Act 1950.  Section 1(1) allows the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to give consent to CIE to raise or borrow money for non-capital purposes, while section 1(2) sets a ceiling of \u20ac300 million on such borrowing.  Section 1(3) enables property to be used as security for borrowings.<\/p><p>Section 2 provides for a consequential amendment of section 20 of the Transport (Re-Organisation of C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann) Act 1986 to allow the board of CIE to lend money to the subsidiary companies and for the subsidiary companies to borrow money with the consent of the board of CIE, subject to the total ceiling for all borrowings of \u20ac300 million.  It should be noted that the giving of security for borrowings will be subject to the requirements of section 67 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010.  This requirement arises from the provisions of our EU and bilateral loan agreements and aims to ensure our lenders under these agreements are given equal priority on any secured borrowings undertaken by general government.  While CIE is not included in general government borrowing, Irish Rail is.  The proposed amended section 28(3) of the Transport Act 1950 and the amended section 20(3) of the Transport (Re-Organisation of C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann) Act 1986 refers to compliance with the requirements of section 67 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 by the board and subsidiaries.<\/p><p>Section 3 repeals sections 30 and 31 of the Transport Act 1950, which provided for a State guarantee of temporary borrowings and the laying of particulars of guarantees before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It also repeals sections 3 and 4 of the Transport Act 1987, which also previously dealt with CIE borrowing powers and State guarantees of borrowings by CIE.<\/p><p>I intend to propose an amendment on Committee Stage to delete section 2 of the Transport Act 1955, which provided for an amendment of section 28 of the Transport Act 1950.  This is no longer appropriate as borrowing for capital purposes is dealt with separately.  The goal for public transport is to provide safe, accessible and integrated services that contribute to sustainable economic and regional development in an efficient manner.  Despite our economic problems and the reduced sums available for capital and current expenditure, the Government will continue to prioritise the role of public transport.<\/p><p>The Government recognises that continued investment in transport infrastructure will play a key role in facilitating a return to economic growth in the coming years.  The Department's overall strategy is to provide for the maintenance and upgrading of the transport network and ensure the delivery of public transport services with particular regard to economic competitiveness, social needs, and sustainability and safety objectives.  The Department's aim is, within available resources, to maintain the capacity, quality, safety, sustainability and integration of Ireland's public transport network and public transport services and, where possible, implement improvements.<\/p><p>The capital programme for the next five years is determined in Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework, which was published by the Government in November 2011.  Under the plan, a total of \u20ac1,363 million will be allocated toward improving public transport infrastructure between 2012 and 2016.  The programme for the funding of capital projects to 2016 is also set out in the plan.  Due to the overall reduction in funding for transport infrastructure, the priority to 2016 is to protect investment made to date, extract maximum value from existing assets and maintain safety standards.  The limited funding available over and above this priority will be provided only for projects that are affordable, have strong business cases, meet overall transport objectives and deliver the best return in terms of economic recovery and job creation.<\/p> <p>Moreover, the ability to operate profitably and without the need for a subsidy would also be a key consideration for any new rail project or extension.  Funding is, therefore, prioritised to ensure the maintenance of existing infrastructure and advance a small number of important projects which can add value to the existing network.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding the reduction in the levels of funding, CIE, in particular larnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann, is still receiving a significant level of funding.  A total of &#8364;513 million is being provided under the third railway safety programme, 2009-13.  In addition to safety related works, larnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann is developing ticketing and associated equipment, as well as working to make the railways more competitive and attractive to passengers.  The Dublin city centre re-signalling project, at a projected cost of &#8364;290 million, is a central element of the upgrading of commuter rail services for the greater Dublin area and is being delivered on a phased basis.  This is a key project which is aimed at unlocking the major bottleneck in the city centre and which will have positive spin-off effects for DART, commuter and intercity passengers.  It will provide for further capacity enhancement by upgrading signalling to accommodate an additional five train paths per direction per hour, from 12 to 17, in the critical city centre area.  Work on phase 1, Howth to East Wall, is almost complete and commissioning is expected to take place this month.  Design work is continuing on the next phase, Connolly to Grand Canal Dock, and due to be completed shortly.<\/p><p> Funding is also being provided in the 2012 to 2016 period for the purchase of replacement buses.  They include 80 new buses being funded this year by the National Transport Authority as replacement buses for Dublin Bus, representing an investment of &#8364;26 million in its fleet replacement programme.  All vehicles are low floor, wheelchair accessible and will ensure Dublin Bus will have a fully accessible fleet by the end of 2012, which is very welcome.  The new buses also have a number of attractive features, including free Wi-Fi, additional CCTV cameras and centre doors to enable passengers to board and alight more efficiently.  In 2011, 60 new buses were delivered to Bus \u00c9ireann at a cost to the Exchequer of &#8364;19 million.  Funding approval in 2012 for Bus \u00c9ireann will total &#8364;2.5 million for fleet refurbishment, the provision of safety improvements at Capwell depot in Cork and its bus shelter programme.  Funding is also being made available by my Department to the National Transport Authority for grants to local authorities for sustainable traffic management measures such as quality bus corridors, bus stop facilities, cycling and safety measures both in the greater Dublin area and the regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.<\/p><p> In support of the investment in public transport infrastructure the Government has committed significant funding to improve the attractiveness of public transport, including the development of the Leap card system which was launched late in 2011, the provision of real time passenger information, RTPI, and a national journey planner.  The National Transport Authority has also developed the Transport for Ireland website, <i><i>Transportforlreland.ie<\/i><\/i>, as a one-stop-shop for up to the minute travelling and commuting information.  From one's own desk, home or smartphone it is now possible to easily access door to door journey plans, real time information on bus arrival times or details on one's Leap card such as the credit remaining and details of recent trips.  I encourage all Senators to visit the website and give their opinions on it.  It is an excellent site.<\/p><p> The development of the Leap card system which was launched in late 2011 on the services of Dublin Bus, Luas and Irish Rail DART and commuter rail services is significant.  Additional functionality is being introduced on an ongoing basis and the launch of the student travel card in September has added to significant growth in the number of Leap cards issued.  Bus \u00c9ireann commenced pilot operations in September on its eastern regional services in the greater Dublin area.  Two private bus operators, Wexford Bus and Matthews Coaches, are running pilot projects using the Leap card.  Additional private bus operators will also be integrated into the scheme in the coming months.  In early 2013 annual and monthly passes will be issued on the Leap card as cardholders renew passes and additional products such as multi-journey tickets will be rolled out by Dublin Bus.  The scheme continues to function well, with almost 150,000 cards issued to date and 8.5 million journeys undertaken using Leap cards.  In comparison with similar schemes launched in other parts of the world, the Leap card scheme is ahead of schedule.  On a previous visit to this House I asked Senators to conduct a survey of how many of them had a Leap card and was using it.  I would be delighted if someone updated me in that regard.<\/p><p> The RTPI project is being rolled out in the greater Dublin area and the four regional cities.  In the greater Dublin area the project involves the installation of up to 500 on-street information signs capable of displaying the arrival times of buses.  These RTPI displays are being located at selected bus stops or interchange points in the greater Dublin area.  The first phase of sign deployments is now 98% complete in Dublin and Cork, with over 411 signs in place in Dublin and 45 in Cork.  Much of the preparatory civil engineering works have commenced in Limerick and Waterford and Galway City Council is in the process of appointing a contractor to install 20 displays.  Bus passengers across Dublin and Cork can check actual bus arrival times using the aforementioned Transport for Ireland website, the SMS text service or the Dublin Bus or Bus \u00c9ireann smartphone applications.  The provision of this information transforms public transport and encourages more people to use public transport.  The real time information has been available for a number of months and we are now seeing its benefits.<\/p><p> The Government will maintain its policy of targeted investment in and support of public transport.  This must be complemented by CIE contributing to greater financial health in its operations.  The Government, in charting the future for CIE, recognises the challenges facing CIE and its workforce.  Through the business planning process, measures are being planned and put in place and financial targets set to turn the situation around.  These targets will be demanding but are essential to restore CIE to a sustainable financial path.  It is now up to management and the workforce to ensure the future success of the organisation.<\/p><p> In summary, I have outlined for the House the difficulties facing CIE in recent years and touched on the efforts that must be made to enhance its financial sustainability.  I reiterate the commitment of the Government to continue to invest significant scarce resources in public transport.  I have explained the background to the Bill and its provisions.  While recognising that there are still many challenges facing the CIE and its subsidiaries, I am confident that these can be overcome.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100009#H00900","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353498600,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his very comprehensive outline of the Government's strategy for public transport in the context of the Bill which Fianna F\u00e1il will be supporting, given its importance.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State outlined, CIE is in a very dark place.

During the summer the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport announced that he would allocate a sum of \u20ac36 million to help the company to get over its immediate financial difficulties, but that was later withdrawn.  Perhaps the Minister of State might indicate the current status of that allocation of \u20ac36 million.  Will it be allocated to CIE?  In the context of the latitude being given to CIE under the Bill, I am curious about that sum, as it seemed to be needed as a stop-gap to ensure the continued viability of the services of the company.<\/p><p>The main stakeholders in the transport sector appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, of which I am a member, a number of weeks ago.  While I accept that the Bill is concerned with CIE and its borrowing requirements, I am a little disappointed that the Minister of State did not make any reference to the private sector.  Private sector transport services are growing and I would like to know what is the Government's policy on competitive tendering for routes.  The previous Government was under pressure from the European Commission to deregulate transport services to a greater degree.  I am a firm supporter of public transport and CIE.  Its workforce and the unions have shown commendable restraint since 2008, when the company last made a profit.  There have been major job losses and significant changes in work practices in a company that was traditionally deemed to be inflexible in the context of management and trade union relations.  I commend the unions on rising to the challenge in recent years.  However, there are areas of the country in which CIE is reducing services and a case could be made for private operators to tender for routes.  Private operators would be more flexible in the type of transport services they could provide.<\/p> <p>I refer to my own part of the country, which has been severely impacted by the financial troubles in CIE and Bus \u00c9ireann.<\/p><p>Controversy has arisen in recent weeks about the closure of bus stops along expressway routes in certain parts of the country.  This has happened on the route between Ballina and Dublin and although some stops were restored on that route after lobbying, the problems on the N4 Sligo-Dublin expressway have not been resolved.  Two villages along the N4, Dromod and Roosky, were bypassed in recent years.  Dromod is not as badly affected as Roosky simply because it has a train station that is serviced by five trains each way between Dublin and Sligo.  However, most of the people in Roosky who have used the expressway service were either pensioners or completely reliant on public transport.  When Bus \u00c9ireann announced its intention to close these stops it did not refer to the fact that it was losing business.  It conceded that people were using the service but it argues that it will provide greater efficiency.  It appears to suggest that people in Sligo should be given priority over those in Leitrim when it claims that the service will be faster.  Time measurements of the stop in Roosky indicates that little time would be saved, however.  A large number of people from the area came to Dublin to lobby on this issue last week and they may have met the Minister of State.<\/p><p>It is important that CIE be given the borrowing rights set out in the Bill.  I hope it will lead to greater stability in the company.  Fianna F\u00e1il asks the Government to develop its policy platform of an integrated network of public transport to all citizens of this State.  As the Minister of State comes from a constituency that comprises a mixture of rural and urban areas, he understood perfectly what this involves.  A service which he was identified as providing became controversial because certain commentators suggested it was not commercially viable but, irrespective of whether he was involved in the decision behind it, this service was essential to the continuing viability of rural Ireland.<\/p><p>Similar questions have been asked about the western rail corridor, which is already being attacked by Dublin economists who argue it should never have been built in light of the numbers using it.  I will not name anybody.  If we are to maintain regional and spatial balance, continued investment in public transport is the only way forward.  The economic cycle will turn and it would be horrendous if we did not put a proper bus and rail infrastructure in place.  In 1958 the Government of the day insisted that CIE had to balance its books.  History is repeating itself in this regard.  The result of the 1958 decision was that Todd Andrews, who was the then chairman of CIE, abolished rural Ireland literally at a stroke.  He was only a tool of Government policy but he was singled out as the man who took these decisions.  My town and county suffered as a result, as did every area of the country.  A rail infrastructure that had been but in place from the 1840s was abolished overnight.<\/p><p>Several years ago a former chairman of CIE, John Lynch, outlined the sequel to this story while he was visiting my own town of Drumshanbo.  In 1963, the then Government reversed the policy of making CIE pay its way because it realised that public transport is a governmental responsibility.  Anybody who suggests that public transport must pay its way under all circumstances is living in cloud cuckoo land.  It will never pay its way simply because it is a public service.  This is why most governments in developed economies are held responsible for providing public transport services.  They can, of course, exist alongside the private sector and this is why I am curious about the Minister of State's views on the future of the private sector.  Are there areas in which we are slow to open routes to private competition?  Bus \u00c9ireann has a monopoly on the Sligo-Dublin route, for example, which is not right given the circumstances I have outlined.<\/p><p>The programme for Government refers to the need to re-balance transport policy to favour public transport.  Irrespective of the Minister of State's assurances, I am not convinced this commitment has been taken to heart.  However, the latter part of his speech reveals the extraordinary developments that have taken place in the area of public transport over the past 15 years.  I get the sense he shares my hope that, irrespective of the pressures on financial resources, the Government will continue to invest in public transport.  It would be a national scandal if we repeated the mistakes of the past.  In 1951, the economists of the day said the future lay in road transport and as a result the country's tramlines were abolished, only for us to bring them back 50 years later.  We should not repeat the mistakes of the past.  I wish the Minister of State fair wind in continuing to invest in public transport.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100011#K00200","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353499200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>On behalf of Fine Gael I welcome the Minister of State to the Upper House.  I have a Leap card, although it may need a top-up.  The Minister of State asked whether Senators use them.  All of us should carry Leap cards because they are part of a great system.  In regard to the transport for Ireland website, I have seen people use smart phone applications to find out when their buses were departing.<\/p><p>I was surprised to find that the Bill increases the amount of money CIE is allowed to borrow to fund its day-to-day operations, as opposed to invest in other areas, until I realised that the current borrowing limit was set in 1987.  The Bill will increase the borrowing limit for non-capital purposes from \u20ac107 million to \u20ac300 million and remove the possibility of a State guarantee for such borrowings, in line with EU competition rules.  The main effect of this change will be to allow CIE to borrow additional funds to provide cashflow in its day-to-day operations.  I presume the additional funds will be used to meet the current shortfall in its operational budget.<\/p><p>This is a challenging time for CIE and its subsidiaries in that they face rising fuel costs alongside reductions in Exchequer funding.  A major enterprise like CIE will face difficulties when circumstances change rapidly.  Smaller companies can be more flexible and have the capacity to react to changing circumstances rapidly.  To use a metaphor, small companies are like speedboats whereas large State transport companies are like oil tankers.  They are difficult to manoeuvre in response to changes in circumstances.  Under the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, I believe they can be moved in the right direction.  They can be cumbersome in comparison to small private companies but while we must recognise the scale of the challenges faced by CIE, the company must also realise the need to change.<\/p><p>While the current economic difficulties mean the State cannot provide the same subventions as it did in the past, they also offer an opportunity for public transport companies to promote themselves as a less expensive and hassle free alternative to cars.  In recent years, however, the number of passengers using CIE services has declined according to figures from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In 2008, 43.3 million passengers used Irish Rail but this figure had declined by 13% one year later and further declined by 2% in each of the following two years to 37.4 million passengers in 2011.  Similarly, the number of passengers using Dublin Bus was 143.5 million in 2008 but declined by 11% in 2009, 7% in 2012 and 2% in 2011 to 116.9 million passengers.  Bus \u00c9ireann carried 48.9 million passengers in 2008 but experienced declines of 16% in 2009, 12% in 2010 and 3% in 2011.<\/p> <p>The scale of these decreases is staggering.  There was a significant drop in passengers right across CIE companies in 2009, with an overall loss of 26.3 million passengers.  That would be a major loss to any company.  Economic circumstances caused much of that, but it also must have to do with bus routes and services provided.<\/p><p>When you consider that the company has posted losses since 2008 and the management expects the losses to continue until 2014, CIE and it subsidiary companies face challenging times over the next number of years.  Alarmingly, this has led the group's auditors to indicate a material uncertainty in the group's annual accounts in 2011 regarding its ability to continue as a going concern.  Much of these losses are attributed to the cost of restructuring, that is, redundancy payment and other restructuring costs.  These amounted to \u20ac113 million over the three-year period from 2008 to 2011.  This restructuring reduced the number of employed by 557 and reduced payroll by \u20ac25.2 million.  Another major effect on these losses is the cost of fuel, which has increased by 25% in three years.  As the Minister outlined, CIE estimates that this costs an extra \u20ac22 million.  This is despite a reduction in the amount of fuel used.<\/p><p>Public transport in Ireland can be viable but the culture must be one that looks outwards to the needs of customers and potential customers.  It can be easy for large companies in receipt of State funding to get caught in a bubble and to lose focus.  Mr. Michael O'Leary, the CEO of Ryanair, often states that the best companies start during a recession when the challenges to be lean and flexible are greatest.  This is an opportunity the Minister has with public transport.  Tough economic times can provide the impetus for much needed reforms and culture changes.  There is an opportunity for our much valued public transport companies to respond to current challenges in a way that will secure their viability far in the future.  No doubt the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, are the right ones to help guide these companies towards a better future.<\/p><p>While on the subject of public transport, I will raise a matter with the Minister.  I have a concern about the methodology used when determining the amount of free travel provided to those who qualify.  I understand that two annual surveys of users take place to determine an average usage of the particular mode of transport.  This is the model for public and private transportation.  From the taxpayers' point of view, this is an unsatisfactory approach.  It means that money is allocated based on what is, in essence, a guesstimate.  Obviously, a system such as a swipe-card system would be expensive and complex; however, in the interests of transparency and prudent use of public moneys, such an approach is essential.<\/p><p>The aim of the Bill is to allow CIE and its subsidiaries to borrow additional funds in order to help it get over its current financial difficulties.  Some degree of restructuring, such as making staff redundant, means large up-front costs with savings in the future.  The additional borrowings would ease cashflow difficulties.  However, interest on the additional borrowings must be paid.  With proper restructuring, I hope that CIE can get back to profitability.<\/p><p>We have made important progress with the Leap card, thanks to the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly's, drive and determination.  For many years, the project was dragging on with no end in sight under the previous Administration.  We need to build on these technological advances, such as, as the Minister of State mentioned, the transport website and the smart phone apps.  A spirit of reform, modernisation, transparency and prudent expenditure must pervade all aspects of policy.  We must be willing to think outside the box and not accept answers when we are told something is difficult, which, I understand, can be the standard mantra within Departments.  We must seize the window of opportunity that the current economic situation presents.<\/p><p>I would agree with Senator Mooney that CIE is a public transport company and public transport is for all the public.  I would hope, when we privatise routes or put them out to tender, that companies will not be allowed to cherry-pick because rural areas need to be supported with public transport as well.  I note the Minister of State will look after that.<\/p><p>It was great to hear Senator Mooney admit that Fianna F\u00e1il made a mistake in 1951.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100012#L00200","speaker":"1125","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353499800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>We do not mention Senators in their absence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100013#M00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1353499800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>It is Fianna F\u00e1il admitting a mistake 60 years later.<\/p><p>I hope that the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly will pursue the matters I raised and I wish him continued success in his work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100013#M00300","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1353499800,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.<\/p><p>What we are faced with is that CIE is simply not a competitive company, and Senator O'Neill spoke well on it.  We have been bailing it out, one way or the other, since 1932.  We have spent 80 years trying to control its competition.  Once there were 70 bus companies in Dublin and many up and down the country.  Most of them were eliminated to create this monopoly and then there was a pattern of subsidies.  That all continues.<\/p><p>According to the CIE annual report for 2011, the subsidy was \u20ac542.422 million.  The PSO grants amounted to \u20ac163 million for Irish Rail, \u20ac73 million for Dublin Bus and \u20ac43 million for Bus \u00c9ireann.  Other Exchequer grants under the national development plan amounted to \u20ac243.660 million.  A subsidy of \u20ac0.5 billion plus is massive.  As the Minister of State said, the group still ran out of money in the middle of this year and needed \u20ac36 million urgently.  I worry about how the Minister did not know what was happening earlier in the year.  Indeed, there were concerns here in this House that the emergency requirement for money arose after the D\u00e1il and Seanad adjourned for the vacation.<\/p><p>The traffic data is falling, as the Minister of State said.  As a person who is with young people all the time, I can see that.  Since the motorways have been built, the competing independent unsubsidised bus companies offer, as far as young people are concerned, a much better product.  They introduced WiFi first.  Bus \u00c9ireann is looking for money to catch up in that regard.  Aircoach, Kavanagh, and Matthews, between Dublin and Dundalk, question why we need to keep subsidising CIE to the degree that we do.  The Department, in the Public Transport (Regulation) Act 2009, showed a blatant bias - I would say, discrimination - against competition.  They gave the entire network to one company without any competitive tendering under a direct award contract, including all of the investment grants.  One in the private sector is trying to compete with Bus \u00c9ireann and it can have a double-deck bus, worth \u20ac400,000, free and one can still win on price.  This is the kind of entrepreneurship that the economy needs.  It is a kind of competitive pressure under which CIE deserves to be put.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister's emphasis on it being a business.  It is there to satisfy consumers.  The consumers are deserting and the company must respond to that.  One need only look at some of the problems in the past, for example, that the airport was served by a monopoly bus company which decided that Bus\u00e1ras was the centre of the world and Aircoach really showed up that model.  The folklore in the Department was that one could not persuade car owners to leave their cars at home and go by bus, and the success of Aircoach proved the Department wrong.  The licence was won by Mr. John O'Sullivan, who used work in CIE, and maybe there is entrepreneurship there that should be allowed out.<\/p><p>I note also that two senior assistant secretaries in the Department, Mr. John Lumsden and Mr. Pat Mangan, wrote about the lack of any counter-culture or devil's advocacy within the Department.  It seems to be so wedded to a monopoly, so weak is it on investment appraisal.  Transport 21 proposed spending of \u20ac34.4 billion.  I was at the launch in Dublin Castle in 2005 and there was not a ha'penny worth of economics unveiled with it.  It has been engineer-dominated.  That world has changed and the motorway system has allowed competing bus companies to attract most of the young people.<\/p><p>Rail travel between Galway and Dublin has declined from 1.6 million to 1 million.  There are 45 buses a day by different companies which do not require investment grants from the Department and do not require operating subsidies.  The Department must look at the alternatives, particularly at a time - there was the legislation yesterday - of fiscal responsibility.<\/p><p>What did we get for the \u20ac542 million in 2011 that was given by the Department to the CIE companies?  Clich\u00e9s, such as this or that was a success, are no longer enough.  I passed by, on the Navan Road, a 1,200 space car park at Pace, the M3 Parkway and I have never seen more than 100 cars in it.  That constituted a massive investment yielding no return of any kind that I can see, and that is the tradition.<\/p> <p>I worry about the weak capital investment appraisal tradition in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The new Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and, indeed, the Department of Finance will have to take a stricter line on that.  I also worry about borrowing for non-capital purposes.  We have to get some return on this.  I worry about not seeking value for money for the subsidy and ruling out, in such a blanket way, the fact that necessary public transport - as other Senators have said - can be provided by anybody except the State's own company.  There must be some distance between the State owning a company and regulating the market.  Nonetheless, that distance is transgressed overall on the wrong side.  The bias against alternative ways of providing transport in this country should not really survive for much longer, given the overall difficulties of the national finances.  There are alternative people there. <\/p><p>The Department's dedication and devotion to Aer Lingus as a monopoly access transport provider held this country back for years.  Eventually, that was changed by a revolt in parliament and fares went down while volumes went up.  Where we have opened up routes like the Dublin-Galway one, where there used to be one bus per day in a monopoly situation, there are now about 45 and the fares are lower.  The fares also fell on the Dublin-Cork route when it ceased to be a monopoly.<\/p><p>The Department must develop a focus of getting better value for the taxpayer and the consumer.  If that requires radical change within CIE, then that is right.  It is there to satisfy the needs of a wider public, not to lobby always for huge investment grants and subsidies, including subsidies for non-capital expenditure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100013#M00400","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353500400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State back to this House.  I congratulate him on the work he is doing in the public transport system.  I note with particular alarm a section from his speech that 2007 was the only year in the 2006-11 period in which CIE generated a surplus.  He said that the total losses of \u20ac137 million certainly cannot be sustained and we would all agree with that.  It cannot continue, so I commend the Minister of State's endeavours to deal with this financial hole in CIE's accounts.  The Bill will go some way towards achieving that.<\/p><p>Part of the deficit is explained by lower passenger numbers, as the Minister of State said.  The statistics have already been quoted by other speakers, so I will not go over them again.  It is quite stark to see the 13% fall from 2008 in Irish Rail's passenger numbers and they continued to fall in 2010 and 2011.  If that projection continues, I presume that trend will continue this year also.  I will not go through all the numbers as they have been put on the record by previous speakers.  <\/p><p>The improved road network has made it far easier to travel by car.  The country has become even smaller due to the road network.  I imagine that increased competition with private operators also has something to do with the fall in passenger numbers.  As a public service, it is expected that Bus \u00c9ireann routes will serve every town and village along a route.  That public service obligation sometimes hinders CIE.  For example, if one is travelling from Wexford to Dublin on a private bus, there are one or two stops before one arrives in the city centre.  With Bus \u00c9ireann, however, one can travel all the winding roads in and out of towns and villages.  Perhaps pick-up points could be examined with a view to changing routes to make them more efficient.  <\/p><p>There have been fantastic developments, as the Minister of State mentioned in his speech.  We have seen the introduction of the Leap card, free Wi-Fi and real-time passenger information for major cities, which is welcome.  Public transport in cities and other major urban centres seems to be working quite well.  It is when one travels longer distances by public transport that there seems to be an issue.  I am speaking about bus services.  It is something that I cannot explain.  Often, when I am waiting at a bus stop for a Bus \u00c9ireann service I wonder if I have missed it.  There is an issue with timetabling.  Are the timetables realistic?  Perhaps they should be reviewed.  On the last occasion, the bus was 40 minutes late, which is unacceptable for a public transport service.  I spoke to people queueing for the same bus and they said: &quot;It is always the same; that bus is always late.&quot;  People can almost guess that the bus will be late and allow for that time, but why not make the timetables more realistic?  That may be one of the reasons people are deciding to use alternative routes run by private operators.  <\/p><p>I congratulate the Minister of State again on bringing forward this Bill which is welcome.  Every time the Minister of State attends this House he seems to attract cross-party support for all his initiatives.  That, in itself, is an endorsement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100014#N00200","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"speech","time":1353500400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>That is the power of consultation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100014#N00300","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1353500400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100014#N00400","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"speech","time":1353500400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I also welcome the Minister of State back to the Seanad.

I travel to Dublin every week by train and I use the bus networks extensively.  I would like to see more of my colleagues doing the same.  We cannot preach about increasing passenger numbers if we do not use public transport ourselves.  Each Member of the Oireachtas should, if possible even once a month, take the train to Dublin.

I should add that one can also get the daily newspaper on the train, so things have improved.  The elephant in the room, however, is that it is losing a substantial amount of money, so it has to become competitive.  Some areas have improved, and well done to them, but there are significant areas where substantial improvement is required.  We will start with the basics.  Rail and bus stations throughout the country could have many more services available than at present.  There is no reason each railway station with more than six or seven daily services should not have some form of coffee shop.  There are plenty of people who would take a realistic lease to run a caf\u00e9 in a railway station.  There is no reason one should not be able to buy a newspaper at each station, as well as having other ancillary services to generate much needed revenue.  Heuston and Connolly stations are classic examples, as is Kent station in Cork, of where good services are available.  There is room for improvement in many others, however, which should be considered in formulating any business plan.  Magazines, newspapers, confectionery and other products should be more widely available on board trains.<\/p> <p>I understand the catering service has been contracted out.  Perhaps Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann might consider providing this service, although I understand it had bad experiences in this regard.  Ryanair is making significant money from its on-board catering facilities.  One way of increasing revenue is to encourage use of the service.  One wonders sometimes if the policy of having an airport in every county augurs well for rail and bus services.  There are airports in counties Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Clare, Kerry, Cork and Waterford, among others.  It is unfortunate that all Governments and parties did not have a coherent focused policy on international and domestic travel.  What also does not help is that it is possible to get from Galway to Dublin quicker by car than by train.  Perhaps speed restrictions, where safety issues are not of concern, might be examined in the context of assisting transport services to complete journeys to Dublin quicker.  The more stops one has to make the slower the service.  The 5 p.m. service from Dublin to Cork only stops at Limerick Junction, Charleville and Cork, while a number of other services stop at myriad stations which, ultimately, slows down journey times.  People are in a hurry and want to get places quickly.  We need to respond to this need.<\/p><p>In terms of bus services, integrated timetables and so on were mentioned.  If on a Thursday I were to take the 3.25 p.m. train service from Dublin to Ennis, I would not arrive in Ennis until 6.45 p.m., which means I would miss the bus service to Ennistymon, where I live, by ten minutes.  These are issues that could and I am sure will be looked at.  Perhaps there is a good reason the bus leaves ten minutes before the train arrives.<\/p><p>Approximately six weeks ago I decided to travel to Dublin by train which was half an hour late leaving Ennis station and travelled to Dublin via County Galway.  However, when we reached Athenry, we had to be taken by bus to Athlone because the decision was taken that the Galway to Dublin train service could not wait seven minutes for the late train service from Ennis.  This resulted in the additional cost of providing two buses to ferry passengers to Athlone to catch another train.  I accept that there are crises and emergencies.  However, decisions made at local level must be cost conscious.  I telephoned Mr. Barry Kenny and told him what had happened did not make sense.  The likelihood is that the Galway to Dublin train service would have made up lost time on the way to Heuston Station.  Everybody, from senior management down to station masters, area supervisors and managers, must be conscious of the consequences of decisions made on the spur of the moment.  While they may have the authority to make such decisions, they must be conscious that they are spending taxpayers' money.  <\/p><p>Many of the company's management structures can be improved.  Senator Sean D. Barrett is a professor of transport economics.  As such, much of what he says should be taken on board.

However, they are two young and enthusiastic Ministers who have embraced information technology and, in turn, will drive Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann and CIE to ensure the service they provide is efficient and more cost effective than in the past.

Reference was made to Bus \u00c9ireann's commercial services, including Expressway and so on.  This is an operational matter for the company which has difficult decisions to make.  I am aware of the cases referred to, which have been raised previously with me by another Member of the House.  It is a difficult scenario.  The Bus \u00c9ireann brand is trusted across rural Ireland and the service is much appreciated by the many people who use it.  Bus \u00c9ireann is operating in a commercial environment in competition with private operators.  It must strive to be competitive and in this regard needs to bring its scheduled journey times into line with those of private operators which may not have the same overheads or commitments in servicing different towns.  We cannot, on the one hand, say Bus \u00c9ireann should be more commercial and able to balance its books and, on the other, that it should be able to service this, that or other town.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100015#O00300","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1353501000,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100015#O00400","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1353501000,"counter":96,"content":"<p>It is impossible for it to do both.

Collectively, these are all qualitative measures which improve one's experience on public transport.  By and large, I have been obliged to deal with most of them in the Department and I am of the view that the enhancements which have been introduced in the past 18 months are fabulous.  Once someone returns to public transport and begins to avail of these enhancements, he or she will come to the view that public transport is both much more comfortable and reliable.  He or she will also be able to manage his or her time much better.<\/p><p>The Senator also inquired about free travel and the analysis contained in the double-year surveys.  A working group is currently examining the position with regard to free travel.  This matter comes under the remit of the Department of Social Protection but my Department does have a representative on the working group.  The issue raised by the Senator is being analysed at present.  The outcome of the group's work will be a matter with which the Minister for Social Protection will be obliged to deal.  It is clear, however, that there is a need to analyse the position from the point of view of volume, etc., in order to ensure that the data we are receiving is accurate.<\/p><p>Senator Heffernan referred to the operation of timetables.  This is a matter to which consideration must be given.  I have asked the NTA to provide integrated timetables across the country.  In view of the issues raised by a number of Senators in respect of the changes introduced by Bus \u00c9ireann in recent times - similar changes will continue to be introduced - it is imperative that we should be in a position to obtain the full picture of the services available, from an integrated point of view, throughout the State.  In other words, it should not just be a case of stating that Bus \u00c9ireann offers particular services.  Information on the services provided by Bus \u00c9ireann, Irish Rail and private bus operators in respect of specific areas and towns should be made available.  This would illustrate for members of the public - in a complementary way - the volume of services being made available by a range of providers.  I am glad the Senator raised this issue because I wanted to outline the position in clear terms.<\/p><p>The NTA has a responsibility to monitor the position regarding timetables and the provision of contracted services in order to ensure that private operators are providing services in accordance with their contracts.  I have received a number of complaints - I have actually witnessed this myself - in respect of a number of buses parking in various towns in the midlands, the mid-west, etc., at the same time when the schedules show that they should not be there.  Something has to be happening in this regard in the context of some operators - be they public or private - positioning themselves to be able to pick up passengers before their competitors.  If this is the case, it means that the public is not being provided with a fully integrated service.  I have challenged the NTA to investigate the position in respect of this matter.  Obviously, that will be difficult but it must be done.<\/p><p>I appreciate the comments made by Senator Conway.  Dare I say it, but there is probably no one in this House who uses public transport more than the Senator.  In that context, his comments are very much appreciated.

CIE owns a considerable volume of land and assets which are strategically quite well placed on the edge or in the centre of our cities and major towns.  The properties to which I refer are fantastic but there must be a way to examine how they might be utilised to a greater degree.  Senator Conway referred to the opening of retail facilities in various train stations and I completely agree with him in that regard.  This matter is going to have to be considered, particularly as it could give rise to CIE obtaining further income.  In addition, it could lead to services being provided in areas in which there is not currently a wide range of services available.  We will also need to consider how the land banks attaching to the train stations in question might be used more productively for various other activities.  I am aware that this is already happening in certain areas.<\/p><p>I have good news for the House on the issue of speed.

There is an ongoing debate on the public service obligation, the subsidy paid to CIE and getting the balance right.  The issue of the percentage of the bus market - the position with regard to the rail market is more realistic - that should be open to liberalisation and privatisation in order to impact on costs also comes into the equation.  We are in the middle of a sensitive period in this regard, particularly as the position of the bus market is currently being considered by the Government.  I do not, therefore, wish to comment in any great detail on this matter.  I will, however, make a couple of points.<\/p><p>Ireland has one of the lowest public transport subsidies in Europe.  That is a fact which is often forgotten.  In light of the economic situation, the subsidy is going to change.  As outlined earlier, we were obliged to invest a considerable amount of additional funding this year.  CIE is far more dependent on fares to generate the income it requires than are its competitors in other countries.  The company was obliged to cope with a perfect storm in recent years.  As a result of the economic situation and the fact that many people either became unemployed or were obliged to emigrate in search of work, it lost many of its customers.  It was also obliged to cope with the decrease in the subvention.  The process in this regard began a number of years ago under a previous Administration.  CIE has also been obliged to cope with fluctuations in fuel prices.  Furthermore, the previous Administration also introduced changes to the fuel rebate and this had a net impact of over \u20ac20 million on the company's finances.  A combination of the factors to which I refer pushed CIE into a particular position and that is why this Bill was brought forward.<\/p><p>In the context of liberalising the market, the experience from an international perspective is quite mixed.  The initial results in some countries where this has happened - to a large, medium or small degree - show that the state can obtain some savings in certain circumstances.  However, in some countries privatisation has led to monopolisation, or a variation thereof, over a number of years and this has led to an increase in the costs incurred by the state.  This happens in some instances but not in others.  There is no such thing as best practice in respect of these matters in Ireland.  We can only learn from other countries.<\/p> <p>An analysis would show that various countries had dealt with the matter in different ways with mixed results.  We must ensure that whatever we decide for this country, we take into account the permutations involved and understand the circumstances here are different.<\/p><p>We had a number of reports in recent years on bus companies.  To be fair to them, the Deloitte report was complimentary to them on the way they handled their affairs.  In many cases, they offer a public service obligation service and demonstrate a social conscience in many of their operations.  We hear figures being bandied about for costs of certain or potential private operators.  I compliment some of the private operators which provide an excellent service and do not denigrate them in any way.  However, in some cases, the overheads of private operators are significantly lower than those of Bus \u00c9ireann and Dublin Bus.  These intangible costs are not often brought forward but must be considered in decisions taken on the merits or demerits of liberalising bus markets.  A wider discussion of the liberalisation and privatisation agenda is required.  Liberalisation is not the panacea that would solve all of our problems.  In fact, that would not be the case.<\/p><p>The Government is examining public transport options to ensure better provision in rural areas in the future.  I have spoken in the House previously on integrated transport services.  An issue on which I did not go into detail at the time is that we must examine the integration of school and public transport services.  I have been involved in considerable discussions on the issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar\u00e1n Cannon, in the Department of Education and Skills.  Bus operators contracted by Bus \u00c9ireann do a good job.  Bus \u00c9ireann also does a good job in providing school transport, but I am concerned that the issue was not examined previously.  In many cases, buses travel around the country and to and from schools, which is necessary.  We are supportive of this and see it as a social requirement, but they also travel make the return journey in both directions with nobody on board.  If these buses were made available for public transport services, a service would be provided immediately across the country.  This is an initiative that is seriously being considered by the Government.  I hope to progress it in the near future with the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar\u00e1n Cannon, because it is something that would be most welcome.  <\/p><p>I thank Senators for their contributions and welcome their support for the Bill which I commend to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100016#P00700","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353502200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1353502200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100017#Q00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1353502200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100017#Q00400","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353502200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 27 November 2012.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353502200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 2.05 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Personal Insolvency Bill 2012: Second Stage","time":1353502500,"counter":112,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100018#R00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353502500,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1353502500,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100018#R00450","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1353502500,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I am pleased to present to the House the Personal lnsolvency Bill 2012, a very significant Bill which provides for comprehensive reform of insolvency law and practice.  It provides for new, more flexible options to address the circumstances of insolvent debtors.  It will provide for alternatives to and a reform of judicial bankruptcy.  It addresses the obligations of debtors and the rights of creditors in a proportionate and balanced way, having regard to the financial reality of individual circumstances.<\/p><p>  The development of modern insolvency law is a key commitment in the programme for Government.  It was also required by the terms of the EU-IMF-ECB programme of financial support for Ireland.  I refer to a significant contribution made by the Law Reform Commission in its report of December 2010 on personal debt management and debt enforcement.  This report and earlier work were of considerable assistance in the formulation of the Bill.  The reform has regard to the recommendation made in the October 2011 report of the interdepartmental working group on mortgage arrears, known as the Keane report.<\/p><p>  The Government published the general scheme of the Bill for consultation on 25 January.  Several important submissions, in particular, the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, were received in response and taken into account in the finalisation of the Bill.  I thank all those persons and organisations that provided my Department with valuable comments and insights.  While the primary architecture of the Bill remains the same, considerable development of the legal and technical detail of individual provisions has taken place.<\/p><p>  The Bill provides for the comprehensive reform of personal insolvency law and the introduction of three new non-judicial debt resolution processes.  The debt relief notice will allow for the write-off of qualifying unsecured debt up to &#8364;20,000, subject to a three year supervision period.  The debt settlement arrangement provides for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt, with no limit involved, normally over five years.  The personal insolvency arrangement will enable the agreed settlement of secured debt up to &#8364;3 million, although this cap may be increased with the consent of all secured creditors, and unsecured debt without limit, normally over six years.<\/p><p>  To protect the constitutional rights of all parties concerned and prevent potential actions for judicial review, the Bill makes provision for enhanced oversight by the Circuit Court or the High Court of the three new debt resolution processes where the debts concerned are in excess of &#8364;2.5 million.  The Circuit Court will receive the debtor's case file from the insolvency service with an application for a debt relief notice or a protective certificate in the case of a debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement.  The court's consideration or hearing will take place on an <i>ex-parte <\/i>basis.  Neither debtor nor creditor will be required to be present and thus, no time delays or costs are incurred.  This efficient procedural approach is repeated at the conclusion of the three year supervision period for the debt relief notice or on the conclusion by the parties concerned of a successful debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement proposal, prior to its formal registration.  I expect this proposed scenario will allay any fear that persons would become tied up in expensive and time-consuming court hearings.  That should not be so.  However, a court hearing could be necessary where a creditor objected on one of the grounds specified in the legislation.  This approach is consistent with that recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  This enhancement of court involvement in the new debt resolution processes will have the significant benefit to the debtor of providing protection from enforcement actions by creditors, either during the negotiation period when a protective certificate will be in place or during the lifetime of an arrangement.  It is likely that a number of debtors would be the subject of judgments obtained by creditors.  Such protection from enforcement action could not be provided by a non-judicial agency alone.  In addition, the involvement of the court also ensures the new processes will be capable of meeting the criteria in the European Union insolvency regulations. This is a matter of some importance where cross-border debts are involved.<\/p><p>  The Bill will continue the reform of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 which I began in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.  The critical new provision is the introduction of automatic discharge from bankruptcy after three years, subject to certain conditions, in place of the current 12 year arrangement.<\/p> <p> The insolvency service of Ireland is in the process of being established to operate the new insolvency processes and to provide a focal point for the future development of insolvency policy.  Organisational planning for the new service is well under way in my Department.  The director-designate of the service, Mr. Lorcan O'Connor, was appointed last month.  However, as the service will administer a completely new approach to insolvency in the State with innovative and complex legal provisions, it will require time to become operationally ready.  I expect that the service will be in a position to commence operation in the first quarter of 2013.  While I recognise the concerns of those who want an immediate introduction, I must ensure that all necessary procedures are in place for the service to commence operations.  I expect a significant number of persons to seek to avail of the new or reformed insolvency processes.<\/p><p>It is difficult to be precise as it will very much depend on individual circumstances and the nature and extent of the debts involved.  However, for broad planning purposes for the first full year of operation of the new law and systems, our tentative estimate, based on a rough extrapolation from the comparable UK and Northern Ireland circumstances, is as follows - 15,000 applications for the two main non-judicial debt resolution processes - the debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements; 3,000 to 4,000 applications for debt relief notices; and 3,000 bankruptcy applications.  There were approximately 30 bankruptcy adjudications in 2011.  This number gives an insight into the contrasting increase in work that will arise on the implementation of this Bill.  Senators will appreciate that these estimates for debtors seeking to avail of the new arrangements are tentative.  Not all insolvencies will require to be dealt with under the new statutory debt resolution processes or bankruptcy.  I expect that the certainty brought to the future legal landscape by this Bill will encourage debtors and creditors to agree bilaterally on alternative solutions.  These solutions could involve settlement of mortgage debt under the mortgage arrears resolution process operated by mortgage lenders under the supervision of the Central Bank or otherwise.<\/p><p>The provisions of this Bill will require careful consideration by all potentially concerned therewith.  However, individual circumstances vary and the solutions found within the context of the debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangement processes will also vary.  I must continue to emphasise that the Bill makes it clear that those persons experiencing difficulties in regard to debt should primarily engage with their lenders to negotiate an appropriate settlement or engage with their creditors generally.  Lenders must engage properly with customers.  In this context, we are talking about financial institutions.<\/p><p>Now that the architecture of our new insolvency legislation is settled I have made it clear that I expect financial institutions to better engage with debtors.  Financial institutions, in most cases, I believe, have been reluctant to date to engage in a definitive or realistic manner with borrowers who may be overwhelmed by unsustainable debt and unable to discharge their monthly outgoings.  This realistic engagement will have to include, where circumstances warrant, some debt forgiveness.  Undoubtedly, over the past two to three years, there has been substantial debt forbearance but the issue of debt forgiveness seriously needs to be addressed in circumstances in which it is appropriate and practically the only solution.  If our financial institutions refuse to engage, then we will in the future have to refine our approach to debt resolution.  I realise that banks must have regard to commercial considerations but they must behave with greater flexibility and insight and apply a broader range of common-sense options based on financial reality.<\/p><p>The new debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangement processes described in this Bill facilitate a voluntary deal between a debtor and a specified majority of his or her creditors.  A common-sense rather than a coercive approach will be taken, as expressed in the creditor voting process provided for in the Bill.  It is also an approach designed to avoid, in so far as is possible within constitutional constraints, the necessity for contentious court hearings and adjudications together with the substantial delay and inevitable legal costs inherent in such process.  It is important to delimit expenditure incurred in legal costs in so far as possible in order that the funds available can be better used in contributing to the discharge of moneys due to creditors.  The approval process for the debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements is consistent with practices in comparable jurisdictions.  For example, under the individual voluntary arrangement procedure in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the approval of more than 75%, in value terms, of creditors voting at the creditors' meeting is required.  Similarly, in Australia and Canada, there are debt settlement processes that involve majority approval by creditors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100018#R00500","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353502800,"counter":117,"content":"<p>On a point of order, the Minister's script is 20 pages long.

Many persons or companies may be both debtors and creditors.  While I can understand the somewhat visceral feelings towards financial institutions and their contribution to our current economic difficulties and the economic disaster that hit this country, we must not lose sight of our current objective, which is to introduce reformed, workable and balanced insolvency legislation.  Such legislation is a required feature of a properly functioning economy.  It will assist not only debtors and financial institutions, but also corner shops, tradespersons, local co-operatives, credit unions etc.  All debtors and creditors are concerned by this reform.  For their sake and the sake of the wider economy, all must be treated fairly.  Many individuals are currently in personal financial difficulty because of the failure of other individuals to pay for work properly completed or goods or services supplied to them.  This approach, which seeks balance and fairness, has been criticised by some commentators as suggesting that creditors, particularly mortgage creditors, will exercise a veto.  Such a contention is based on an incorrect view of how normal commercial contractual issues are resolved.  Where one borrows, one must repay where one can.  If, for example, an individual carries out electrical work at one's home or retail outlet or does essential plumbing repairs, that individual is entitled to be paid.  If the debtor is genuinely unable to pay, negotiation with creditors may resolve the difficult, and this Bill provides the new framework for sensible negotiation.<\/p><p>The approach in the proposed debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements is that the insolvent debtor will, with the assistance of a personal insolvency practitioner, put forward what the debtor considers to be a realistic offer to his creditors that will restore the debtor to solvency within a reasonable period while, at the same time, giving creditors a better financial outcome than the alternatives of debt enforcement or bankruptcy.  The creditors will need to consider carefully the debtor's offer, conscious that if they refuse, the debtor has another option - the standard debt discharge procedure available under the reformed bankruptcy laws.  Bankruptcy may be considered the ultimate appeal mechanism of the debtor.  However, in that eventuality which I still believe is best avoided, control is effectively lost by both sides.  It would make sense for the debtor and creditor, especially where there is only one main creditor, to seek to conclude a bilateral agreement.<\/p> <p>The reform I am introducing will, in addition to providing new legal remedies, provide a significant incentive for financial institutions to develop and implement realistic agreements to resolve debt issues with their customers.<\/p><p>The Bill's provisions relating to a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement are specifically designed, as far as is practicable, to facilitate a debtor's continued ownership and occupation of his or her principal private residence, unless the debtor does not wish to do so.  The personal insolvency practitioner, in preparing a personal insolvency arrangement, shall not, in so far as is practicable, include a proposal that the debtor dispose of an interest in or cease to occupy their principal private residence and is required to consider any appropriate alternatives with regard to addressing an individual's level of indebtedness.  The personal insolvency practitioner must have regard to a variety of matters in this context including the likely costs to the debtor of remaining in occupation of a principal private residence, whether such costs would be disproportionately large and the overall background financial circumstances.  Consideration must also be given to the reasonable accommodation needs of a debtor, and his or her dependants, and to the cost of alternative accommodation.  It may be appropriate in particular circumstances having regard to the value of a family home that it be sold and a proportion of the funds realised used to fully or partial discharge debt.<\/p><p>An application for a debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement must be made by a debtor through a personal insolvency practitioner, PIP.  The debtor is entitled to appoint a licensed PIP of his or her choosing.  The development of an appropriate architecture for the regulation of persons to act as PIPs in the debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement processes has been ongoing since publication of the Bill.  It has now been decided by the Government that the insolvency service will be the organisation to provide direct regulation of PIPs with any necessary technical assistance provided by the Central Bank.  This approach will provide a unified focus on the insolvency area.<\/p><p>These provisions are being drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel and I hope to be in a position to introduce the necessary amendments here on Committee Stage.  However, the Bill, as it currently stands in Part 5, essentially provides for an enabling section in regard to the regulation of PIPs.  I expect those persons who come forward to seek regulation as insolvency practitioners will likely be drawn from the legal and accountancy professions.  However, applications will also be welcome from other suitably qualified persons in the broad financial advisory sector who are not members of those professions.  Neither, my Department nor the proposed insolvency service will be involved in the recruiting of practitioners.<\/p><p>The Bill requires the terms of the proposed arrangement make provision for the fees and outlays of the PIP, as well as specifying the manner in which they will be paid.  Those terms are subject to the approval of both the debtor and the requisite majority of creditors.  Generally speaking, the costs of personal insolvency practitioners involved in the management of any form of insolvency are met by the product of that insolvency.  There are no provisions under the Bill for the State to pay the fees of personal insolvency practitioners.<\/p><p>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, will continue its valuable role of assisting and advising people with debt problems.  In that regard, MABS has agreed to operate as an approved intermediary in regard to processing applications for debt relief notices where it is likely to be the primary such intermediary.  Other organisations have also indicated an interest in becoming involved in the processing of debt relief notice applications.  These would most likely be non-profit organisations rather than personal insolvency practitioners.  Determination of appropriate guidelines with regard to the reasonable expenses that may be allowed to or negotiated by debtors in an insolvency process will require further consideration.  There are no such guidelines readily available or agreed at this point.  Different organisations, both public and private, will have their own views and proposals in this context.  This is an area of work with which MABS is particularly familiar in the context of its current operations.  The issue of reasonable living expenses is of particular importance in the qualifying criteria for the debt relief notices.<\/p><p>The completion of the prescribed financial statement in the case of each debt relief notice, debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement will assess in detail the lifestyle expenditures of the debtor.  The approved intermediary, or the PIP, as the case may be, will take account of the obvious basic necessities of living, for example, food, heat and light, etc.  However, he or she will question the continuation by the debtor of certain other lifestyle expenditures.  Persons who are insolvent cannot realistically expect either creditors or the taxpayer to fund a lifestyle that has been based on credit.  This approach is not intended to be ungenerous but we must be realistic to prevent possible misuse.<\/p><p>It is my hope the provisions contained in the Bill will act as a catalyst for honest, open and constructive engagement between both unsecured and secured creditors and those in genuine substantial financial difficulty.  The Bill provides concrete options for those genuinely unable to discharge their financial obligations as opposed to those who can but will not do so.<\/p><p>Our shared objective must be to assist the greatest possible number of borrowers who are experiencing genuine debt problems, in particular with mortgage arrears, to be restored to sustainability.  For this to occur, financial institutions will have to provide a larger and more imaginative range of financial debt resolution options to address individual customers' financial reality and deploy staff with the expertise to properly engage with customers labouring under the weight of unsustainable debt.  If the financial institutions fail to do so, they will unnecessarily drive indebted customers into bankruptcy to the detriment of the financial institutions which may ultimately recover less of the debt owed than could be recovered under a personal insolvency arrangement.<\/p><p>While my focus today must be on outlining to the House the provisions contained in the Bill, it is important to reiterate what is not in it.  The Bill does not provide for the automatic writing-off of debt, either secured or unsecured, in the debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement processes.  An agreement that is reasonable and workable for all parties must be concluded on a case-by-case basis.  Where a debtor is not insolvent and can meet obligations to service his or her mortgage or other debt obligations, he or she must continue to do so.  Neither does the Bill provide for any process whereby negative equity can be automatically written off for solvent debtors able to meet their repayment obligations.  Such a phenomenon is a reflection of the current market value of the asset concerned.  It does not exclusively relate to residential property.  It could affect all forms of property, for example, shares and investments or art.  Negative equity is not an issue of insolvency for the purposes of the Bill.  Of course, where an individual's debts are unsustainable, negative equity may form part of his or her overall financial burden.  It is important to emphasise the Bill does not relieve solvent debtors of their responsibility to meet their contractual obligations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100019#S01500","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353503400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Without any discourtesy to the Minister, if I might raise what I believe is a point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100020#T00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1353503400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>It must be a point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100020#T00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1353503400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I notice there are several discrepancies between what the Minister said and what is in the provided script.

Part 2, containing sections 7 to 22, inclusive, provides for several standard provisions in the establishment of a new insolvency service to operate the new non-judicial debt resolution processes.  It sets out the functions and power of the new service and its governance arrangements.  The insolvency service will have the structures, functions and powers consistent with an effective, independent body.  Section 23 restricts the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts to records relating to the general administration of the insolvency service, thereby protecting the sensitive personal information held on the financial affairs of debtors.  The new service will have a role in certifying applications for a debt relief notice or a debt settlement arrangement and a personal insolvency arrangement and, thereafter, referring the relevant documentation to the Circuit Court or the High Court in the context of arrangements relating to assets which exceed a value of \u20ac2.5 million.  The insolvency service will have no role in the negotiation and agreement of the terms of either a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement.<\/p> <p>Part 3 is the central core of the Bill.  It provides, in six chapters, for the three new non-judicial debt resolution processes, the appointment of personal insolvency practitioners, offences and some miscellaneous provisions.<\/p><p> Chapter 1 provides for the issue of a debt relief notice.  This will permit the write-off of qualifying debts totalling not more than &#8364;20,000 for persons with no income and no assets, who are insolvent and who have no realistic prospect of being able to pay their debts within the next three years.  The process is akin to bankruptcy in its broad approach, including a three-year supervision period, but provides for a low-cost insolvency option, having regard to the quantum of debt involved.<\/p><p> Section 24 provides that an application for a debt relief notice will be subject to certain eligibility criteria.  The debtor must have qualifying debts of &#8364;20,000 or less.  Debts qualifying for inclusion in a debt relief notice are most likely to be unsecured debt such as credit cards, personal loans or catalogue payments.  However, debts that do not qualify for a debt relief notice include taxes, court fines and family maintenance payments.  A debtor will not be eligible to apply for a debt relief notice where 25% or more of the qualifying debts were incurred in the six months preceding the application.  A debtor will only be eligible to apply for a debt relief notice if he or she has a net monthly disposable income of &#8364;60 or less, after making provision for reasonable living expenses and payments in respect of excluded debts, holds assets - whether individually or jointly with another person - to a value of &#8364;400 or less and owns only one motor vehicle, which must be of a value of &#8364;1,200 or less.  These provisions are similar to those of the debt relief order process in operation in England and Wales since 2009 and in Northern Ireland since 2011.  However, the Bill goes further in that there are additional exemptions of &#8364;6,000 for essential household appliances, tools or equipment required for the employment or business of the debtor or materials necessary for the education of the debtor's children at primary and secondary level.  These latter provisions are significant exemptions in regard to the qualifying criteria.  I should emphasise that the qualifying criteria for a debt relief notice are exactly that - qualifying criteria for the process.  These criteria of themselves do not guarantee a debt write-off for a debtor or protect him or her from enforcement action by creditors outside the process.  This basic fact has often been overlooked in the debates on this process.  Only one debt relief notice per lifetime will be permitted.  Also, a notice cannot be applied for within five years of the completion of a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement.  <\/p><p> Section 25 sets out how the debt relief notice process is initiated by the debtor.  An application for a debt relief notice must be submitted on behalf of the debtor by an approved intermediary.  The approved intermediary will advise the debtor on his or her options and the qualifying requirements and will assist him or her in preparing the necessary prescribed financial statement, which must be verified by means of a statutory declaration, and any other required documentation.  A debtor who participates in the debt relief notice process is at all times under an obligation to act in good faith and to co-operate fully in the process.  If the qualifying criteria for the debt relief notice are met, the authorised intermediary will transmit the debtor's application, under section 26, to the Insolvency Service of Ireland.<\/p><p> Section 27 provides that on receipt of a completed application for a debt relief notice the Insolvency Service of Ireland must consider it and make such inquiries as it considers appropriate to verify the information, including inquiries with the Department of Social Protection, the Revenue Commissioners and local authorities.  The service will be entitled to presume that the eligibility criteria for the debt relief notice have been met if it has no reason to believe the information is incomplete or inaccurate.  Section 28 provides that if the Insolvency Service of Ireland is satisfied that the application is in order, it will issue a certificate to that effect and furnish that certificate and supporting documentation to the appropriate court.  The court will consider the application and, if satisfied, issue the debt relief notice and notify the service.  Section 30 requires the lnsolvency Service of Ireland to notify the approved intermediary and the creditors of the issue of the debt relief notice and register it in the register of debt relief notices.  Under section 31, with the issue of a debt relief notice, the debtor is subject to a supervision period of three years from the date of issue, unless the court has ordered it to be terminated before then.  During that period, section 32 provides that creditors may not initiate or prosecute legal proceedings or seek to recover payment for a debt or recover goods or contact the debtor.<\/p><p> Section 33 requires the debtor to inform the approved intermediary and the lnsolvency Service of Ireland of any material change in financial circumstances.  So as not to reduce the incentive to seek and obtain employment following approval of a debt relief notice, there is provision for debtors to repay a portion of the debts in circumstances in which their financial position improves.  These circumstances include the receipt of gifts or windfalls of more than &#8364;500 or where the debtor's net income has increased by more than &#8364;400 per month.  There is a restriction on the debtor applying for credit of more than &#8364;650 during the debt relief notice supervision period without informing the creditor of his or her status.<\/p><p> Section 34 provides that should a debtor make repayments totalling 50% of the original debt, the debtor will be deemed to have satisfied the debts in full.  In such a case, the debt relief notice will cease to have effect, the debtor will be removed from the register and all of the debts concerned will be discharged.  Under section 35, any funds transmitted by the debtor to the lnsolvency Service of Ireland are to be paid on a <i>pari passu <\/i>or proportionate basis to the specified creditors.  After the three-year supervision period has come to an end, section 43 provides that the qualifying debts will be discharged and the debtor will be removed from the register of debt relief notices.<\/p><p> Chapter 2 of Part 3 makes provision for the appointment of personal insolvency practitioners for the purpose of applying for a debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement.  Sections 45 to 50, inclusive, provide for a range of practical matters in regard to the appointment of a personal insolvency practitioner, the duties of and obligations on such a practitioner and the documents to be prepared for an application for a debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement.  A key requirement provided for in section 47 is the completion of the prescribed financial statement by the debtor with the assistance of the personal insolvency practitioner.  The prescribed financial statement, which must be verified by means of a statutory declaration, is the critical element in an application for a debt resolution process.  The details required to be included in the prescribed financial statement may be prescribed by ministerial regulation under section 131.<\/p><p> Chapter 3 of Part 3 provides for a system of debt settlement arrangements between a debtor and one or more creditors to repay an amount of unsecured debt over a period of up to five years, with a possible agreed extension to six years.  The debt settlement arrangement would assist persons who have such income, assets and debts that they would fall outside the eligibility criteria for a debt relief notice.  Sections 51 to 84, inclusive, provide for all aspects of the eligibility, application, determination, duties and obligations arising, court approval, objection by creditors and discharge from qualifying debts under the debt settlement arrangement process.<\/p><p> Section 51 provides that the application for a debt settlement arrangement must be made through a personal insolvency practitioner appointed by the debtor.  The personal insolvency practitioner must advise the debtor as to his or her options in regard to insolvency processes.  The practitioner will assist the debtor in the preparation of the necessary prescribed financial statement, which must be verified by means of a statutory declaration, and any other required documentation.  A joint application by two or more debtors is permitted where the particular circumstances may warrant such an approach.<\/p><p> Section 52 provides that only one application for a debt settlement arrangement in a lifetime is permitted.  Section 53 sets out the eligibility criteria for a debt settlement arrangement.  The debtor must normally be resident in the State or have a close connection with the State.  Section 54 provides that if the debtor satisfies the eligibility criteria, the personal insolvency practitioner will apply to the lnsolvency Service of Ireland for a protective certificate in respect of the preparation of a debt settlement arrangement.<\/p><p> Under section 55, if the lnsolvency Service of Ireland is satisfied that an application for a debt settlement arrangement is in order, it must issue a certificate to that effect and furnish the certificate and supporting documentation to the appropriate court.  The court will consider the application and, subject to the creditor's right to appeal, if satisfied, issue the protective certificate and notify the lnsolvency Service of Ireland.  In considering the application, the court will be entitled to treat the lnsolvency Service of Ireland certificate as evidence of the matters certified in the application.  The lnsolvency Service of Ireland will register the protective certificate in the register of protective certificates, and the personal insolvency practitioner will inform the creditors of the issue of the protective certificate.  When the protective certificate is issued, a &quot;standstill&quot; period of 70 days will apply to permit the personal insolvency practitioner to propose a debt settlement arrangement to listed creditors.  That period, on application to the court, may be extended for not more than 40 days.<\/p> <p>Section 57 provides that the effect of the issue of the protective certificate is that creditors may not initiate or prosecute legal proceedings or seek to recover payment for a debt or recover goods or contact the debtor.  The rights of secured creditors are unaffected.<\/p><p> Section 60 provides that certain debts are excluded from a debt settlement arrangement, including court fines in respect of criminal offences.  Certain other debts are also excluded, such as family maintenance payments, taxes, local authority charges and arrears of service charges owed to apartment management companies.  While there is provision for a wide range of repayment options, the default posit on under section 61, unless otherwise agreed, is that creditors be paid on a <i>pari passu<\/i>or proportionate basis.  Under section 62 any debt that would have a preferential status in bankruptcy will also have a preferential status in a debt settlement arrangement.  Under section 64, a debt settlement arrangement proposal will generally not require the debtor to dispose of or cease to occupy his or her principal private residence unless the debtor does not wish to continue to occupy it or the costs of the debtor continuing to reside in it are disproportionately large.<\/p><p> Section 68 provides that if the debt settlement arrangement proposal is accepted by 65% in value of the creditors present and voting at the creditors' meeting, it will be binding on all creditors.  Under section 70 the personal insolvency practitioner must inform the insolvency service of the approval of a proposed debt settlement arrangement.  The service will then transmit the arrangement in accordance with section 71 to the appropriate court for approval.<\/p><p> Section 73 provides that if the court is satisfied with the proposed arrangement and if no objection is received by it within ten days, the court shall approve the debt settlement arrangement and notify the insolvency service.  The arrangement will come into effect when it is registered by the insolvency service in the register of debt settlement arrangements.  The personal insolvency practitioner will then administer the debt settlement arrangement for its duration.<\/p><p> There is provision for an annual review of the financial circumstances of the debtor under section 75.  Section 76 sets out the conditions that attach to the conduct of the debtor during the debt settlement arrangement.  The arrangement can, if necessary, be varied under section 77 or terminated under sections 78, 79 or 80.  On the termination or failure of the debt settlement arrangement, section 82 provides that a debtor could risk an application for adjudication in bankruptcy.  Section 83 provides that at the satisfactory conclusion of the debt settlement arrangement all debts covered by it are discharged.<\/p><p> Chapter 4 of Part 3 provides for a system of personal insolvency arrangements between a debtor and one or more creditors to repay an amount of both secured and unsecured debt over a period of six years, with a possible agreed extension to 11 years.  The personal insolvency arrangement will assist those persons who have difficulty in the repayment of both secured debt, such as mortgage arrears, and unsecured debt.  Sections 85 to 120, inclusive, provide for all aspects of the eligibility, application, determination, duties and obligations arising, court approval, objection by creditors and discharge from qualifying debts under the personal insolvency arrangement process.<\/p><p> Section 86 provides that the application for a personal insolvency arrangement must be made through a personal insolvency practitioner appointed by the debtor.  The personal insolvency practitioner must advise the debtor as to his or her options in regard to insolvency processes.  A joint application by two or more debtors or an interlocking personal insolvency arrangement is permitted where the particular circumstances might warrant such an approach.  Section 87 provides that only one application for a personal insolvency arrangement in a lifetime will be permitted.<\/p><p> Under section 88, a debtor may propose a personal insolvency arrangement only if he or she is cashflow insolvent, meaning that the debtor is unable to pay his or her debts in full as they fall due, and there is no likelihood within a period of five years that the debtor will become solvent.  The personal insolvency practitioner will assist the debtor in the preparation of the necessary prescribed financial statement, which must be verified by means of a statutory declaration, and any other required documentation.  The eligibility criteria for a personal insolvency arrangement under section 88 include co-operation with the secured creditor in respect of the debtor's principal private residence under a mortgage arrears process approved or required by the Central Bank.  The debtor must be normally resident in the State or have a close connection with it.  If the debtor satisfies the eligibility criteria, the personal insolvency practitioner may apply to the insolvency service under section 89 for a protective certificate in respect of the preparation of a personal insolvency arrangement.<\/p><p> Section 91 provides that if the insolvency service is satisfied as to the application, it must issue a certificate to that effect and furnish the certificate and supporting documentation to the appropriate court.  The court will consider the application and, subject to the creditor's right to appeal, if satisfied, issue the protective certificate and notify the insolvency service.  The insolvency service will register the protective certificate in the register of protective certificates.  When the protective certificate is issued a standstill period of 70 days will apply to permit the personal insolvency practitioner to propose a personal insolvency arrangement to the listed creditors.  That period, on application to the court, may be extended for not more than 40 days.  The personal insolvency practitioner will inform the creditors of the issue of the protective certificate.<\/p><p> Under section 92, the effect of the issue of the certificate is that the creditors may not initiate or prosecute legal proceedings or seek to recover payment for a debt or recover goods, enforce security or contact the debtor.  Section 95 provides that certain debts are excluded from the personal insolvency arrangement, including court fines in respect of criminal offences.  In addition, certain other debts are excluded, such as family maintenance payments, taxes, local authority charges and service charges, unless the relevant creditor agrees otherwise.  Under section 97 any debt that would have a preferential status in bankruptcy also will have a preferential status in a personal insolvency arrangement.<\/p><p> There are certain specific protections for secured creditors under sections 98 and 99, including a claw back in the event of a subsequent sale of a mortgaged property where the mortgage has been written down.  Under section 100, a personal insolvency arrangement proposal shall in so far as is reasonably practicable be formulated in such a way as will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in or cease to occupy his or her principal private residence.  However, this significant protection is necessarily tempered to take into account the possibility that the debtor may not wish to continue to occupy the house or the costs of the debtor continuing to reside therein maybe disproportionately large.  This provision offers important assistance to those with unsustainable debt in concluding realistic and common sense arrangements that facilitate the debtor continuing to reside in his or her family home.<\/p><p> Under section 106 a personal insolvency arrangement must be supported in the first instance by a majority of creditors representing at least 65% in value of the total of both secured and unsecured debt due to the creditors voting at the meeting, second, by creditors representing more than 50% of the value of the secured debts due to creditors and, third, by creditors representing more than 50% of the value of the unsecured debts due to creditors.  If the personal insolvency arrangement proposal is accepted at the creditors' meeting and approved by the court, it is binding on all creditors.<\/p><p> Under section 108, the personal insolvency practitioner must inform the insolvency service of the approval of the proposed arrangement by the creditors' meeting.  The service will then transmit the arrangement in accordance with section 109 to the appropriate court for approval.  Section 111 provides that if the court is satisfied with the proposed arrangement and if no objection is received by it within ten days, the court shall approve the personal insolvency arrangement and notify the insolvency service.  The arrangement will come into effect when it is registered by the service in the register of personal insolvency arrangements.  The personal insolvency practitioner will then administer the personal insolvency arrangement for its duration.  There is provision for an annual review of the financial circumstances of the debtor under section 113.  Section 114 sets out the conditions that attach to the conduct of the debtor during the personal insolvency arrangement.  The arrangement can, if necessary, be varied under section 115 or terminated under sections 117 or 118.<\/p><p> Section 120 provides that at the satisfactory conclusion of the personal insolvency arrangement, all unsecured debts covered by it are discharged.  Secured debts are only discharged at the conclusion of the personal insolvency arrangement if, and to the extent, specified in the arrangement.<\/p><p> Chapter 5 of Part 3 provides for offences relating to all of the non-judicial debt resolution processes.  Sections 121 to 126, inclusive, provide for offences including false representations, falsification of documents and fraudulent disposal of property.  The offences may be prosecuted either summarily or on indictment.  Section 127 provides for penalties, following conviction on indictment, of fines of up to &#8364;100,000 or imprisonment for up to five years or both.<\/p><p> Chapter 6 of Part 3 contains provisions that apply generally to Part 3.  Among other things, it provides in section 128 for the creation and maintenance by the insolvency service of the insolvency registers to record details of persons concerned with the various debt resolution processes.  <\/p> <p>The registers will be in electronic form and members of the public may inspect and take copies of or extracts from entries in a register.  <\/p><p>Part 4 provides for a number of amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1988 to provide for a more enlightened and modern approach to bankruptcy.  These amendments will continue the reform of bankruptcy law begun in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.  I will now outline the main new provisions.  <\/p><p>Section 135 provides that the minimum amount for a petition for bankruptcy by a creditor or combined non-partner creditors will be increased to \u20ac20,000.  The current limits are \u20ac1,900 for a creditor and \u20ac1,300 for combined non-partner creditors.  In addition, there will be a new requirement for 14 days notice of the petition to be provided.  This is to ensure a bankruptcy summons is not brought prematurely by a creditor so as to allow the debtor to consider other options such as a debt settlement or personal insolvency arrangement.<\/p><p>Section 136 provides that in presenting a petition for bankruptcy the creditor will be required to prove, for a debt of more than \u20ac20,000, a significant increase from the current limit of \u20ac1,900.  Where a debtor presents a petition for bankruptcy, he or she must swear an affidavit that he or she has made reasonable efforts to make use of alternatives to bankruptcy such as a debt settlement or personal insolvency arrangement.  The debtor must also present a statement of affairs which must disclose that his or her debts exceed his or her assets by more than \u20ac20,000.<\/p><p>Section 138 will require the court, when considering a petition from a creditor for the debtor's bankruptcy, to consider whether the matter might be more appropriately dealt with by a debt settlement or personal insolvency arrangement.  In the adjudication of a debtor's petition for bankruptcy under section 139, the court will be required to consider the assets and liabilities of the debtor and assess whether it should adjourn proceedings to allow the debtor to attempt to enter into a debt settlement or personal insolvency arrangement.  <\/p><p>A bankrupt is permitted to retain certain excepted articles such as household furniture or tools or equipment required for a trade or occupation.  Section 141 increases the maximum value of these excepted articles from the current level of \u20ac3,100 to \u20ac6,000.  <\/p><p>In regard to the avoidance of fraudulent preferences and certain transactions designed to frustrate the legitimate interests of creditors made before adjudication in bankruptcy, the current time period of one year is extended to three years in sections 142 and 143.  The time periods in regard to the avoidance of certain voluntary settlements of property made before adjudication in bankruptcy are extended from two to three years in section 144.<\/p><p>Section 146 contains extensive new provisions regarding discharge from bankruptcy.  First, provision is made for the automatic discharge from bankruptcy after three years from the date of adjudication, which is reduced from the current 12 years.  Second, bankruptcies existing for three years or more at the time of commencement of the Bill will be automatically discharged after a further six months have elapsed.  This latter time is to allow for a possible creditor objection.  Third, the bankrupt's unrealised property will remain vested in the official assignee in bankruptcy after discharge from bankruptcy.  The discharged bankrupt will be under a duty to co-operate with the official assignee in the realisation and distribution of such of his or her property as is vested in the official assignee.  Fourth, the official assignee or a creditor will be permitted to apply to the court to object to the discharge of a person from bankruptcy.  The grounds for such an objection are that the debtor has failed to co-operate with the official assignee or has hidden or failed to disclose income or assets.  The court may suspend the discharge pending further investigation or extend the period before discharge of the bankrupt to a date not later than the eighth anniversary of the making of the adjudication order.  Fifth, the court may order a bankrupt to make payments from his or her income or other assets to the official assignee or the trustee in bankruptcy for the benefit of his or her creditors.  In making such an order the court must have regard to the reasonable living expenses of the bankrupt and his or her family.  The court may vary a bankruptcy payment order where there has been a material change in the circumstances of the discharged bankrupt.  Such an order must be applied for before the discharge from bankruptcy and may operate for no more than five years.<\/p><p>Part 5 of the Bill contains an enabling provision in regard to the regulation of personal insolvency practitioners.  As I mentioned, it is my intention to bring forward comprehensive proposals on this matter on Committee Stage.  There will be a new Part 5 to replace the current Part 5, which will provide extensive provisions for the regulation by the lnsolvency Service of the new personal insolvency practitioners and provisions on regulatory and oversight procedures and to ensure there are indemnities to guarantee that funds being dealt with by personal insolvency practitioners are protected.  Many of the likely regulatory mechanisms I will be proposing are already in place in other contexts.  It is a question of adapting them to the insolvency legislation.  A substantial amount of work has been done already and should be completed very shortly.<\/p><p>No one should underestimate the complex legal issues involved in this very large-scale reform of Ireland's personal insolvency law and practice.  The consequences and implications of new debt resolution processes have been and continue to be very carefully assessed.  There is a delicate balance to be struck between the various legal rights and obligations of the parties involved.  The outcome must be fair and workable for creditors and debtors.  The development of new laws, particularly those which are without legal precedent in any other jurisdiction, such as the personal insolvency arrangement required very careful legal drafting.  My Department has worked closely with the Office of the Attorney General, the Parliamentary Counsel, the Department of Finance and other Departments and organisations to develop the Bill, the provisions in which will change the relationship between insolvent borrowers and their lenders.  It will give a greater balance to the rights of both and incentivise both parties to come to an agreed solution.  The new legislation will carefully distinguish between individuals who cannot pay as opposed to those who will not pay.   It offers no suggestion that borrowers can easily leave outstanding debts behind them.  This will be achieved through the necessity for borrowers to declare, honestly and openly, their financial affairs, the strict eligibility criteria and the anti-abuse provisions resulting in criminal prosecution.  <\/p><p>This new legislation will allow individuals who are insolvent without any reasonable prospect of being able to repay their debts to rehabilitate their unsustainable financial situation over a defined period.  It should serve to support greater stability in the financial sector as it will incentivise banks to reach an agreed solution with individual borrowers in resolving mortgage arrears cases.  These non-judicial mechanisms are premised on both debtors and creditors obtaining a better outcome than under the reformed bankruptcy regime.  I know the provisions of the Bill will receive careful consideration by all potentially affected by it.  However, I stress that individual circumstances vary and that the solutions found within the context of the debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangement processes will also vary depending on individual circumstances and the nature of indebtedness.  The Bill is a major milestone on the road to the development of a modern insolvency process in Ireland.  It is a long over-due step.  <\/p><p>Much remains to be done, but the journey to real legislative reform of benefit to citizens is well under way and I expect to complete it before the end of the year.<\/p><p>As I noted, I will be bringing forward extensive amendments to the Bill on Committee and Report Stages.  These will include the regulation of personal insolvency practitioners, provisions in regard to the courts and a range of other amendments, all necessary for the operation of the new debt resolution processes provided for in the Bill which I commend to the House.  I hope it will have the general support of all Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100020#T01000","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353505200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>On the comment I made earlier to which the Minister took offence, it was directed at the procedures of the House rather than him, in terms of the allocation of one hour to him and only ten minutes to the main Opposition spokespersons, which is unsatisfactory, particularly on such an important Bill.  The debate is to be guillotined in that it must conclude at 5 p.m., in respect of which a proposal has been dealt with by the House.  Already one third of the time allocated has been taken up by the Government, which is completely unsatisfactory.<\/p><p>Fianna F\u00e1il welcomes the introduction of the Bill as a small step towards alleviating the financial pressure on individuals who are unable to make ends meet.  However, we have serious concerns around the veto power wielded by the banks in respect of any settlement deal and the regulation of personal insolvency practitioners.  I note the Minister's remarks in that regard.  Bolder measures are needed to resolve the issue of household debt.  However, the Minister has challenged our main criticism of the Bill which relates to the veto power of financial institutions over arrangements to be made under it.  In this regard, he referred to normal commercial contractual issues.  Unfortunately, the justification of anything on the basis of freedom of contract or normal commercial contractual issues has a chequered past.<\/p> <p>It was used in courts in America and across the globe in order to stop the reform of child labour and fair employment laws.  The Minister is using that justification to allow the banks to retain a veto over the arrangements covered in the legislation.  The debts incurred by Irish people in this instance do not relate to normal commercial agreements.  They were not entered into in the normal commercial way.  Many individuals were put upon by financial institutions and there was a generalised attack on the property market.  I know the Minister will respond to what I am saying but these were not normal commercial arrangements.  In such circumstances, it is not fair for him to justify the approach he is taking - which gives the banks and other financial institutions a veto - on the basis that normal contracts are at issue.<\/p><p> There is another aspect of the Minister's contribution which gives rise to serious concern.  He said:<blockquote>The approved intermediary or the personal insolvency practitioner, as the case may be, will take account of the obvious basic necessities of living, for example, food, heat and light, etc.  However, he or she will question the continuation by the debtor of certain other lifestyle expenditures. <\/blockquote>Who came up with that statement?  What kind of ivory tower do the Minister and his officials occupy, who see food, heat and light as being the necessities of living?  The Minister and his officials are only too well aware of the other necessities of living.  Those necessities can be provided for in homeless shelters.  Is it to such shelters that the Minister wants the people who will benefit from the legislation to go?  What is outlined in this regard is completely unrealistic in the context of what constitutes reasonable living expenses.  Even if we give our support to this legislation, I wish to place on record the fact that I and my party do not associate reasonable living expenses with &quot;food, heat and light&quot;.  There is so much more to an ordinary life than those three things.  I wish the Minister to place on record - in the context of the future interpretation of the statute - that reasonable living expenses contemplate much more than mere &quot;food, heat and light, etc.&quot;<\/p><p> The Bill makes provision in respect of debt relief notices, debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements.  It also reforms the period relating to bankruptcy.  The latter is probably the only lever available to borrowers.  However, it is a difficult one to pull because a period of three years will still apply.   It is not going to provide the comfort that indebted persons will require.  Under the terms of the Bill, 65% of the creditors involved will be obliged to agree to a personal insolvency arrangement.  In practice, this is probably going to mean that one bank will have to agree to the arrangement.  This is exactly where the veto for banks and the other financial institutions to which I refer will come into play.  The Minister has denied there is such a veto but the facts say otherwise.  In addition, there is no scope for appeal and this strengthens the banks' veto further.<\/p><p> There is a major imbalance of power between vulnerable debtors and the creditor banks which pursued them for business during the boom and which are now effectively in the same position as those debtors.  There does not appear to be any justice or a rebalancing of the scales in this instance.  The Bill my party put forward in the D\u00e1il made provision for an independent authority to provide binding solutions in situations where citizens in serious debt are unable to reach agreement with his or her creditors or where the latter choose not to reach such an agreement.  There is a glaring omission in the legislation before the House in this regard.<\/p><p> There are some other issues I would like the Minister to address.  In the context of the famous judgment handed down by Ms Justice Elizabeth Dunne, does he propose to amend the position, either by means of this Bill or through the introduction of legislation relating to land conveyancing, to enable the banks to repossess properties more quickly?  I understand the banks have been in contact with the Government in respect of this judgment, which may be under appeal.  I am seeking to discover the legislative proposals that are being brought forward in respect of this matter.<\/p><p> We look forward to the amendments the Minister intends to introduce.  These may lead to the Bill being changed significantly.  They may also address some of our concerns in respect of personal insolvency practitioners.  It is essential that if the legislation is to be changed in a dramatic fashion on either Committee Stage or Report Stage, then this should not be done following a mere one or two-hour debate.  That would be both totally wrong and completely unjustified.  We will require at least a week of debate if this legislation is to be changed dramatically.<\/p><p> My party has put forward a range of measures in respect of the mortgage crisis.  These include the Family Home Bill 2011, which Senator MacSharry and I drafted, the Regulation of Debt Management Advisors Bill 2011 and the Personal Insolvency Bill which was introduced on Private Members' time in the D\u00e1il.  Some of these measures were accepted by the Government, while others were rejected.  We are normally accused of unconstitutionality in this regard.  It is funny that we are accused in this way by the Government on a regular basis but when it is accused of unconstitutionality by those who have the power to make such accusations, it rejects what is stated out of hand.<\/p><p> Our legislation in respect of this matter should have been the subject of closer consideration by the Government.  The Bill in question advocated the establishment of an independent debt settlement and mortgage resolution office which would provide an independent and non-judicial debt settlement system for people.  That would be very different to the system outlined in the Bill before the House, under which the banks will effectively have a right of veto.  While we are supporting the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 as a step on the road towards progress, I really do not hold out much hope for it in the context of how it deals with people.  Individuals are already approaching Members in order to discuss what will be its impact.  It is difficult to see how it will work and how it will benefit those people in practice.<\/p><p> The Minister and his colleagues in government need to give urgent consideration to the code of conduct relating to mortgage arrears and how this is operating, particularly in view of the fact that the banks have their mortgage arrears resolution procedures up and running.  The latter has given rise to a significant change in the context of how the banks interact with customers.  It is not always to customers' benefit that banks are working more efficiently.  The banks were quite inefficient in this regard in recent years.  This meant that there was a delay in the process and that was of benefit to homeowners.  However, this is no longer the case.  I urge the Government to examine how the code of conduct is operating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100023#W00200","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353505800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I listened with interest to his contribution on this substantial item of legislation.<\/p><p>Regardless of the nature of the legislation that comes before the House, we would generally wish for more time to debate it.  I accept, however, that time is not an endless resource in this instance.  Of all the legislation dealt with by this and the Lower House in recent years, none has received more of an airing than that which is before the House.  I am sure the Senators opposite who are members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will be aware that once the heads of the Bill were made available, a very substantial debate took place and that meetings were held with all of the interested parties.  The Bill was then the subject of a Second Stage debate in the D\u00e1il.  Following that, and uniquely from a parliamentary perspective, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality held further hearings in advance of Committee Stage in order to allow more people to have an input.  I am obliged, therefore, to give the Minister credit for his wide-ranging engagement to date on this legislation.  He has indicated that substantive amendments will be introduced and we will try to ensure that the maximum possible time will be made available in order that we might discuss these.  I do not believe that any Oireachtas has ever passed the perfect item of legislation.  This is the case because, alas, the necessary time, resources and expertise were never available.  In political terms, what is perfect can often be the enemy of good.  I am of the view that the Bill before us is a good measure.  When the Minister returns with Committee Stage amendments, we will then be veering closer to perfection.  However, I do not believe we will ever achieve the latter.<\/p><p>The Minister referred to the genesis of the legislation.  He also referred to the political pressure that was exerted two years ago by the IMF and the EU.  Political scholars in the future will be asked the question as to what the latter ever did for Ireland.  The answers they will give will list both the pluses and the minuses.  Forcing the Government to face up to and put in place a mechanism to try to alleviate personal debt will be a plus as far as the IMF and the EU are concerned.  We could have kicked the can further down the road and stated that we would deal with this matter next year.  However, political pressure was brought to bear on the previous Administration in the dying days of its term of office at the end of 2010.  Similar pressure was exerted on the current Government in its early days in order to encourage it to respond to the issue of personal indebtedness.  The Bill before the House is part of the solution in this regard and I welcome it.<\/p><p>There is an understanding among the citizens of this country that, in the context of our broken economy and the society to which it has given rise, indebtedness is a major problem.<\/p> <p>Indebtedness is a considerable problem across all strata of society.  There was a political response to the crisis faced by the bankers and therefore one that impacted on taxpayers.  The famous Government bailout of the banks was paid for by the taxpayer.  NAMA was created in order to bring a degree of certainty to the situation involving developers.  The missing link in the chain is the private citizen.  The Bill is part of the solution to fill in the jigsaw and put in place a reasonable, fair and balanced solution for the thousands of people across the country who through no fault of their own but as a result of the breakdown of the economy, find themselves facing unsustainable debt.  It is something that is difficult to resolve.<\/p><p>The issue must be approached with common sense and a certain sensitivity is also involved.  One can have a situation where people living side by side with the same jobs, income and level of indebtedness could approach their financial problems differently.  One might have a mature, reasonable and realistic approach to paying his or her debts but a different approach could be taken by the person next door.  We must have a balance to ensure that the solution which is underpinned by the taxpayer is applied in a fair and balanced way.  The strategy underpinning the legislation and the three different offerings available are a positive step to resolve the problem in a fair and balanced fashion.  The Bill does not claim to solve all of the problems but it attempts to do so in a reasonable, fair and balanced fashion.<\/p><p>Most of the public debate has focused on bankruptcy, which is a difficult, emotive and frightening word for most people.  On this part of the island and under the previous regulations and legislation, once bankruptcy was applied it literally ended not just a person\u2019s financial prospects for the future but had a negative connotation and pigeonholed the person concerned into the future.  Our aspiration must be that in coming to the aid of people who are suffering financially and are in debt, we apply firm but fair rules but that we do offer light at the end of the tunnel.  It is important that people can see a future in which they will again contribute to society rather than be seen as taking from it.  The new legislation to provide a three-year rule for bankruptcy is a reasonable and fair solution.<\/p><p>The Minister was in the House previously to talk about bankruptcy, perhaps in response to an initiative proposed by the Fianna F\u00e1il Party.  He pointed out that we must be careful about reducing the bankruptcy rules from 12 years downwards because of the knock-on effects.  One must take into account a person who is declared bankrupt who owes moneys to a building supplies company or a service provider down the line.  It is okay for such a person to have his or her debts written off over a reasonable period but there is also the person to whom he or she owed money.  One could ask what happens to that person and the next one down the line.  The issue is not as simple as it would sometimes seem.  Obviously Britain has a different regulation.  We are aware of some high profile cases where people have taken advantage of the slightly more lax rules in Britain and are moving to that jurisdiction to resolve their financial difficulties.  We are now moving from a 12-year limit to a three-year limit.  That is probably as fair, reasonable and balanced as it can be.<\/p><p>The Minister addressed much of what I intended to say about Part 5 and personal insolvency practitioners.  We have received much representation on who and what those people should be.  Arguments range over whether the qualifications should be the more traditional accountancy and legal skills or whether there is scope for others such as those with expertise in the property sector.  I am pleased the Minister will come back to the House next week on Committee Stage with proposals in that regard.  We must try to be as broad as possible in defining who can hold such positions.  Personal insolvency practitioners will have a responsible role.  The Minister attended committee meetings where he heard discussions on the issue and people expressed the view that practitioners should not be confined to the legal and accountancy areas.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister will say next week in that regard.<\/p><p>I commented briefly on the bankruptcy provision.  We will have much to say on debt relief notices, debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements once we get to Committee Stage.  The Minister is striking the right note in terms of fairness and what is realistic and doable.   We will discuss those issues in detail next week.  I welcome the Bill.  It would be impossible for any Minister to introduce the perfect legislation.  This is a good effort.  It will make a genuine difference to many, which is as much as we can expect from most legislation passed by this House.  It will help the economy to recover and to get people back to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100024#X00200","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353506400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome the long-awaited legislation which is desirable for many reasons, some of which the Minister outlined in his speech to us, but in particular as protection of the principal, primary residence in the various new schemes.<\/p><p>There is still room for significant improvement in the Bill.  The Minister indicated that was the case, in particular in order that the many people who are over-indebted and in need of relief can get their lives back on track.  This is a key opportunity.  No doubt the Minister believes that is the case as well.  Senator Bradford referred to the potential of the Bill to boost an economy that is gripped by unsustainable debt and also its tangible and positive implications for the many ordinary families, house owners and individuals who have been crippled by personal debt.<\/p><p>The first of the many issues I wish to raise relates to essential income and reasonable expenditure.  The Minister referred to it in his speech to some extent.  One of the positive aspects of the Bill is its reference to the fact that the new insolvency service will draft guidelines on reasonable expenditure and essential income for debtors to which non-judicial debt settlements must refer and to which the courts must also refer in bankruptcy situations.  That will help considerably to having regard to the financial reality of individual circumstances, as the Minister identified in his opening remarks.<\/p><p>I have raised in this House in the past the excellent work of the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice in the past 12 years to develop and implement a robust methodology to determine a minimum essential standard of living for various household types.  More recently, it developed a tool to assist policy makers and others to do that.  It is a methodology that has taken into account practice in various EU states.  Its work on minimum income standards in this country could be used as a benchmark by the insolvency service when drafting guidelines.  However, it would be preferable that such standards would be encompassed in primary legislation.<\/p> <p>The question of the minimum income which a household is entitled to retain before payments are made to creditors, is not a matter that can be left to administrative discretion alone.  Practitioners will need detailed guidelines and evidence-based tools, which are now available, in order to properly formulate proposals.  <\/p><p>I wish to address the issue of qualifying thresholds.  These are outlined in each of the new arrangements.  Some of them may appear to lack an evidence-based understanding of the needs of individuals for whom debt relief arrangements are essential.  As the Minister identified, section 24 sets a maximum limit of \u20ac20,000 for qualifying debts before a debt relief notice may be granted.  FLAC works with many clients of MABS.  It has estimated that only 15% of these clients would qualify for a debt relief notice under this threshold.  FLAC calls for the Bill to raise the qualifying amount to \u20ac30,000.  Similarly, the legislation should differentiate between essential household equipment and appliances and items of personal property when determining the asset limitation currently set at \u20ac400.  It may also be helpful to include assessment guidelines in this regard.  The qualifying threshold of no more than \u20ac60 net disposable income per month, is problematic, as it leaves little margin for non-household-based expenses and payments.  This is particularly significant, given the recent survey by the Irish League of Credit Unions which recorded that up to 47% of Irish adults live on less than \u20ac100 a month after the bills are paid.  The qualifying thresholds set out in the debt relief notice contrast sharply with the threshold of \u20ac3 million in the personal insolvency arrangements.  The high threshold has drawn criticism from many areas, including the troika which advocated a threshold of \u20ac1 million in order to rebuild what it describes as a viable banking system.  The ostensible purpose of this section is to protect families in financial distress and to ensure they do not lose their incomes.  However, with the average mortgage being in the region of \u20ac350,000, this threshold is particularly high.  I ask how those thresholds have been determined.  <\/p><p>The definition of insolvency may also warrant some amendment, should a person be deemed not to be insolvent and unworthy of a debt relief notice strictly according to the limits on income, debt, property and timeframe to pay back debt, as outlined in the Bill.  People may not be able to repay their debts in full as they fall due.  They may need more time to pay these debts.  Inability to pay in full is over-indebtedness which with the rescheduling of payments, may work itself out over time, but which may fall short of insolvency.  For a practitioner to have to certify that there is no likelihood of the debtor becoming solvent within five years of the date of declaration, also seems to involve a forecast of certainty that would appear neither necessary nor desirable.  Perhaps a more flexible definition of insolvency could be drafted, such as, the debtor being clearly unable to pay his or her debts as they fall due and it is unlikely that he or she will do so for the duration of the repayment plan as certified by the personal insolvency practitioner.<\/p><p>The Minister and other colleagues have referred to the issue of veto.  It seems that in all three new arrangements, creditors may object immediately to the inclusion of debts owed to them in the debt relief agreement, in the case of a debt relief notice through the Circuit Court, in the case of debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements.  In all three cases, creditors may initially agree but then raise objections during the period of the arrangement.  There is no provision for an independent arbiter to assist individuals and banks to reach agreement, nor is there an independent appeals system, to which Senator Byrne has referred, for when a proposal is rejected.  Therefore, individuals are left with no option but to resort to bankruptcy in many cases. <\/p><p>The Bill relies far too heavily on a hypothetical and unrealistic assumption that credit institutions will behave rationally and with due care for the well-being of society when involving themselves in credit negotiations with over-indebted clients.  There is little evidence at present that they would act in the interest of the taxpayer, the economy and even their shareholders and stakeholders, in acknowledging that in many instances, much personal debt is now substantially irrevocable.<\/p><p>I wish to speak briefly about the resourcing of MABS.  As the Minister indicated in this contribution, MABS is intended as one of the main approved intermediaries for advising, assessing and assisting individuals who wish to apply for a debt relief notice.  There are considerable training and resource implications for MABS as a result of this role.  The staff of MABS will also have an important role in the referral of clients to personal insolvency practitioners and in liaising on behalf of those clients.  This comes at a time when MABS is under significant pressure - as the Minister is aware - with an increasing and diverse range of referrals.  It is imperative that its new functions are carried out without a consequent reduction in its existing services.  The work of assisting people who are over-indebted and need to renegotiate payments but who are not fundamentally insolvent, must also continue.  It is, therefore, only logical that MABS will require additional resources to meet these challenges and sufficient additional resources should be available to MABS to ensure that existing crucial money advice and budgeting services continue and can take on this extra role. <\/p><p>I understand that no regulatory impact assessment of the consequences of this new insolvency architecture has been published.  Could we expect a publication of this assessment before the Bill reaches Final Stages?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100025#Y00200","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353507000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome this Bill which, as the Minister said, is long overdue as a reform of personal insolvency law.  As he also said, it is a complex Bill.  I thank him for his very comprehensive outline of the detailed provisions of the Bill which is very helpful to have on the record of the House.  It is also helpful to have the history of the Bill on the record of the House.  It is required under the terms of the EU-IMF-ECB programme and it is also a key commitment in the programme for Government.  I refer also the report of the Law Reform Commission on personal debt management and debt enforcement.  It has long been accepted that our bankruptcy laws were due for an overhaul.  The Bill reflects this desire and also deals with much more general arrangements other than bankruptcy for dealing with the very great problem of personal indebtedness.  We are all cognisant of the serious problem and the great heartbreak and distress that this problem is causing to individuals, to families and to households in all parts of the country.  This Bill is part of the package of measures required to deal with this serious social and personal problem.<\/p><p>As part of the history of the Bill and the detailed process involved in its drafting, the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, held hearings last February.  We produced a report which the Minister has taken into account in the drafting of the Bill.  I am pleased to note that some issues are reflected in the Bill, although I note some issues are not.  FLAC included those issues in its recent and very helpful comments on the Bill.  The concerns expressed by FLAC are framed in a constructive manner in that it welcomes the Bill but it expresses some concern.  I will return to those concerns shortly.<\/p><p>It was helpful that the Minister set out that there will be a three-tier, non-judicial debt resolution process beginning with the debt relief notices for the more minor debts - albeit still significant sums involved of up to \u20ac20,000.  The debt settlement arrangements will deal with unsecured debt over a five-year period.  The personal insolvency arrangement will enable the agreed settlement of secured debt up to \u20ac3 million.  I wish to make a point about the levels of debt under each of those three tiers and which were dealt with in the joint committee report.  We heard from various groups, in particular, from groups representing debtors, that the thresholds provided were generally too low.  We recommended that the limit of \u20ac20,000 for debt relief certificates might be raised to \u20ac50,000 and that the limit for the personal insolvency arrangement should be raised to \u20ac10 million.  I note that FLAC in its recent report has suggested an increase in the threshold of the debt relief notices to \u20ac30,000.  I ask if the Minister envisages any change in those thresholds.  I say this in the knowledge that since the joint committee issued its report, there has been quite a strong critique made of raising the limit for the personal insolvency arrangement, that a sum currently allowed for of \u20ac3 million is sufficiently high.<\/p> <p>I was quite persuaded by that, even though it is at odds with what we recommended as a joint committee.  However, the point was made forcefully that the \u20ac3 million limit more than covers the vast majority of people with personal debt arising from a mortgage on a family home and to raise the threshold for the personal insolvency arrangements any higher would mean dealing with people who had borrowed large amounts to take out loans on investment property.  That should not be the purpose of this legislation.  As the Minister said, it should not be about rewarding irresponsible lending or borrowing and we also made this point in our submission.  I accept, therefore, a fine balance must be struck in this regard.  I am satisfied now with the threshold for the personal insolvency arrangements, despite the submissions made to the joint committee.<\/p><p>However, I wonder about the threshold of \u20ac20,000 for debt relief notices.  That is low, given people have run up significant debts on credit cards and so on for their households and this could be acknowledged.  The joint committee raised a critical issue in any debate on insolvency, which is that the family home should be handled separately from investment properties or holiday homes and should be protected in an insolvency arrangement.  Irresponsible lending should not undermine the reality that people are devastated at the prospect of losing their homes and that is causing distress.  We emphasised this point in the justice committee report.<\/p><p>We also emphasised the appeals issue raised in the FLAC submission.  I acknowledge the Minister stated bankruptcy is the ultimate appeal mechanism for debtors and we all accept that but concerns were raised with us by groups such as FLAC and New Beginning that there were insufficient mechanisms in the Bill to deal with creditors resistant to making arrangements.  I am glad the Minister stated the legislation will have to be refined if the financial institutions refuse to co-operate or engage with these mechanisms.  The Bill requires lenders to engage properly with customers.  The architecture of the legislation will place more pressure on them, which is welcome.  Everyone commenting on it has welcomed that but, as the Minister acknowledged, the approach to debt resolution will have to be refined if financial institutions refuse to engage.<\/p><p>I am glad personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, will be regulated by the new insolvency service and new proposals will be brought forward on Committee Stage to provide for this.  They have a key role in ensuring the legislation operates effectively.  A new Part V will contain provisions for regulatory and oversight procedures.  What mechanisms will be used to ensure regulation of these practitioners?  FLAC is concerned that the current proposed structure will fail to attract sufficiently qualified PIPs and, therefore, may make the cost of arrangements prohibitive.  This is interesting because I did not think there would be a difficulty attracting PIPs.  Has the Minister a view on that?<\/p><p>He stated the personal insolvency arrangement is without precedent but there are precedents that resemble it.  We heard about the models in Norway, Greece and elsewhere at the joint committee hearings but we are adopting a different model and whether it is effective depends in large measure on the mechanisms in place such as PIPs, which is why the regulatory and oversight provisions are critical.<\/p><p>It is helpful that the Minister has given us an estimate of the numbers who may apply for debt relief notices and debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements.  Clearly, at this stage we cannot be sure how many people are likely to apply but there were only 30 bankruptcy adjudications in 2011, partly because of the hugely cumbersome procedure currently in place.  During the joint committee hearings, we heard a great deal about bankruptcy tourism, about which the Minister is conscious, where people travel to other jurisdictions to avail of more lenient bankruptcy regimes.  We had a comprehensive debate in the House on the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011 on the bankruptcy law and I recall Senator Quinn making a forceful point about not making bankruptcy laws too lenient.  The one-year timeframe in Britain, for example, may be too low a threshold.  Three years may well strike the correct balance.  The joint committee expressed concern that the timeframe in the Bill was too long, given an additional period is envisaged beyond the three years prescribed.  We suggested the overall effective period should be five years rather than the current proposal of eight years. <\/p><p>I am concerned that FLAC is suggesting the three-tier procedure will be overly cumbersome.  I am not sure, as I am hopeful that a better perspective on it is it is more targeted at different levels and type of debt.  As the Minister said, there are many individual scenarios and a one-size-fits-all approach may not work.  We all very much welcome the Bill and the new models for dealing with the huge problem of personal indebtedness.  I look forward to working with the Minister to improve the legislation as it progresses through the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100026#Z00200","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353507600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister who has the zeal of a reformer, which is always welcome, and I commend him on his attempt to improve the unsatisfactory regime in place for people with difficulties in their personal finances.  With goodwill, good legislation will emerge, which will generally improve the climate.  There is a cultural backdrop to what is going on.  Our society historically did not like to see itself incurring large debts.  We frown on this culturally and deep in their core people did not like going heavily into debt.  We generally took out one large loan in our lifetimes to buy a house in accordance with prudent guidelines, which had been passed on to us and articulated to us by the debt professionals with whom we dealt.  Thankfully we have somebody who has the will and the parliamentary muscle to effect reform but he is faced with a colossal problem, which is that we are witnessing insolvency on a scale that ten or 15 years ago people would have not dreamt remotely possible in our country.  Some people become insolvent because of personal irresponsibility in making bad decisions but they are a minority.  Some people become insolvent because they were unwise.  Wisdom is easy to define in retrospect and people whom we would not necessarily thought of as particularly foolish made decisions in the context of the advice they received at the time that did not seem foolish but they now seem catastrophically bad.<\/p><p>We can never let this get off the radar screen when we consider legislation such as this, which tries to strike a delicate balance between the needs and responsibilities of those who took out loans they cannot service and those who gave them, that there is a specific reason for the high insolvency rate in Ireland, which is that highly self-interested banks, brokers and debt sellers of all strips pushed debt onto people in varying degrees of knowledge that they would be unable to sustain it.  These professionals, who historically had been characterised by prudence, responsibility, conservatism and wisdom - they were often stereotyped as dullards who said &quot;No&quot; on every occasion - replaced these traits with highly bonus-incentivised, irresponsible actions.<\/p> <p>Instead what we have are people who were routinely told that those old rules had changed.  They were not financial experts; they may have been teachers, nurses, lawyers, skilled workers or taxi drivers.  People who were not particularly attuned to macro-economics and the world of finance were told, \"No, don't worry about that.  It's important to get on the property ladder at all costs.\"  At the time, rather few of them understood when they were stepping onto that ladder, that the advice they were taking was being provided by people who had a dog in the fight - people who were deliberately giving them unwise advice because they were making money from that advice being acted upon.<\/p><p>For that reason, it is critically important in looking at this that the default position should be to acknowledge the fact that on one side of this equation were people who generally acted perhaps naively.  On the other side of the equation, the other people who we are seeking to protect - and I understand they need their protections - in many cases acted deliberately irresponsibly and did it for profit.  This needs to be borne in mind in assessing the matter. <\/p><p>I have just noticed, on a constitutional crisis point, that the Acting Chairman nodded when I said something.  She is supposed to be tremendously impartial.  I may well have to report her to the Supreme Court for that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100027#AA00200","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353508200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I am listening, not agreeing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100028#BB00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1353508200,"counter":155,"content":"<p>During my brief contribution, I have made a couple of points that are probably not germane to the legislation, although I will be making a few editorial comments on it.  As regards those who find themselves facing catastrophic, unsustainable, house-losing, bankruptcy-threatening debt, but who have money locked in pension funds that they cannot touch for many years until they are retired, long after the damage is done, and they have lost their homes and been forced into bankruptcy, one wonders if there is not some way they could be enabled to access that money to try to discharge their debt and restart their lives.  I know that is not something the Minister can legislate for here, although I have mentioned it on a number of occasions to his Cabinet colleagues with financial responsibility.<\/p><p>Similarly, the Minister will be aware that in some jurisdictions they have non-recourse mortgages.  The deal basically is that a person buys a house which is collateral, and if the person cannot service the debt they throw the keys at the bank and it is the bank's house.  The bank thought that this house was sufficient collateral for the loan.  While I understand that it is retrospectively hard to impose something like that on people who have entered into contracts, one wonders if the enforced prudence that that kind of restriction would place on people who sell debt in future might not be a wise strategy.<\/p><p>In addition, is there any way, even within the confines of the current Bill, to look at that aliquot of the money owed, which represents the amount borrowed in excess of what would have been prudent guidelines, namely, in excess of 2.5 times the salary or in excess of 80% of the value of the house, so that there could be some consideration of a degree of non-recourse for people who find themselves in that situation?  <\/p><p>I will now get on to some of the more specific, technical amendments.  In the interests of fairness, I must acknowledge my friend and colleague from the Lower House, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, who provided invaluable assistance to me in trying to come to grips with some aspects of this complex and very necessary Bill.  As regards the issue of referring to the bankruptcy payment orders, one section of the Bill seems to allow that after the three years of bankruptcy protection has passed, the banks can still - in response to changed circumstances perhaps - come after people for up to five years following completion of the bankruptcy date.  In truth, this goes against the spirit of what the Minister is trying to do with this Bill, which is to limit the period of bankruptcy liability.  Perhaps the Minister could reconsider that.  <\/p><p>It has been brought to my attention that there are people in various jobs in the country, many of whom work for multinationals we are so desperately trying to incentivise to come here.  Some of them work in different parts of our public service and they are prospectively barred from taking employment if they are engaged with any part of the legal insolvency process.  As regards those who are not in the bankruptcy phase, but in the protection phases early on - who are going through the insolvency arrangements with or without the personal insolvency professionals - can we have a specification in the Bill that those persons could not be in any sense handicapped in their attempts to get employment of this type?  <\/p><p>There are a few other practical issues.  Over the years, nearly Dickensian strictures were applied to those who could not face their debts.  When we got rid of debtors' prisons and brought in bankruptcy laws, the issue arose concerning people who lost many of what were then considered to be the luxuries of financial services, like credit cards and bank accounts.  It is essentially impossible to live in our modern society without access to financial instruments such as bank cards and credit cards.  Should we state that in bankruptcy cases it would not be permissible to deny people access to a bank account, although perhaps not to an overdraft, as well as ensuring they can have a debit card, if not a credit card?  In the absence of such facilities, it is difficult if not impossible to pay some bills and meet some current ongoing household exposure. <\/p><p>Another rather more complicated issue is at stake which concerns those in the insolvency protection process who are making payments to people who are not bankrupted.  It appears that it is entirely possible for some individuals in the low or middle income groups, who are going through rescheduling as part of this process and who are having mandatory transfers made to their banks, to end up having less than 20% of their income available to them as disposable income when one factors in tax plus the bank transfer.  <\/p><p>For many of the most important, productive and socially worthwhile sectors of our employment economy, including nurses, teachers, social workers and business people - in many cases, disproportionately, women who also have child care responsibilities - it begins to approach a stage where there is an actual disincentive to work if that little of one's income is retained for one's own use.  It is in no one's interest if these people decide that it is better for them not to work.  It is not in the bank's interest, their own interest or society's interest. <\/p><p>I agree with some of the concerns that have been raised by my colleagues on the Fianna F\u00e1il benches.  I hope we will have ample opportunity to tease through a number of amendments we will be proposing on Committee Stage.  I thank the Minister for his attention.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100028#BB00300","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1353508200,"counter":156,"content":"<p>That concludes contributions by group spokespersons.

I am grateful that he and the Government are grasping this nettle because we know there has been a lot of fallout from personal indebtedness as a result of the crisis that has befallen our country.  What struck me hard recently is that while our public debt is at a ratio of 120% debt to GDP, our personal and household debt is at 130%.  That really shows the scale of the problem.  Taking all the figures together, one in five mortgages were in difficulty at the end of June, which involves 20% of our people.  We still have no Central Bank figures on unsecured loans at this point.  The available figures only represent mortgage debt, which involves 168,000 householders, not including personal or credit card loans.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill but as Minister Bradford said-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100028#BB00500","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1353508200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>We live in a state of hope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100028#BB00600","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1353508200,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  The Senator did say that it was not a perfect life, nor can it be a perfect Bill.  Between now and next week when the Bill returns to the House, however, there is one group I would like the Minister to think about.  They are a unique group of mortgage holders who are not being taken into account by anybody.  They are people who are making their repayments but it is costing them a large amount of their net income.  They are paying more than 35% of net income on their mortgages, while struggling to meet overall commitments.  They should not be overlooked.<\/p><p>In the course of campaigning for the children's referendum, I met three families that are paying up to 70% of their net income on household mortgages.  When electricity, food and school bills are added in, how long more can they sustain that?  I want to emphasise that these people are paying their mortgages.  In page 4 of his speech, the Minister said that some debt forgiveness should be examined.  I believe that some debt forgiveness should be considered for these people.  They are paying their mortgages and if they were freed up a little bit it would be good for the domestic economy.<\/p><p>In America, legislation has been passed so that only up to 37% of a person's net income can be spent on a mortgage.  I contacted the Central Bank about this. <\/p> <p>It has no figures since 2007, which is incredible, regarding what proportion of people's income goes on paying off their mortgage.  How can it plan for the problem we face at present and how can it advise us?  What does the Minister believe is available for these people?  They are not really interested in a split mortgage or in giving back some equity in their house.  These are people who are prioritising the home.<\/p><p>Overall, I welcome the Bill as it is critical that we respond to personal indebtedness.  However, I wish to examine some of its elements.  Who will pay the personal insolvency person?  Will it be the debtor and how much are they likely to cost?  With regard to the range of judicial and non-judicial solutions in the Bill, I understood that the debt relief notice and the debt settlement arrangement mechanisms were to be non-judicial arrangements.  If that is the case, why is it necessary to go to the Circuit Court to apply for that?  Will the Circuit Court be a public setting?  If so, will that not make it even more difficult for people to apply?  It is bad enough to have these levels of debt, although some of them could be quite small, but will it be a public forum that can be reported on in the media?<\/p><p>I also have concerns about there being no right of appeal.  With regard to the debt settlement arrangement and the personal insolvency arrangement, is there a right of appeal for debtors if the creditors veto the proposal put forward by the personal insolvency professional?  The application and negotiation could be a long and expensive process which could be shut down by a rejection at the end.  What recourse, therefore, is there for the debtor if this happens?  Most people will not have more than one creditor for any single debt.  Will each debt be considered separately or, for the purposes of the voting mechanism, are all debts of a single debtor considered together?  If there are three creditors and two vote &quot;Yes&quot; and one votes &quot;No&quot;, is the third creditor forced to go into the deal?<\/p><p>With the Bill providing for a basic discharge period of three years, while it is just 12 months in Northern Ireland and Britain, what incentive is there for people to declare bankruptcy here rather than move their residency to the North?  I know of people living in Galway who have done this.  How will we manage that?<\/p><p>I beg the Chair's indulgence, but this is an important Bill.  With regard to the split mortgages, I understand there is a disagreement between Bank of Ireland and AIB on whether the mortgage holder should pay some interest on the warehoused portion.  My proposal is that it should be, at worst, a nominal amount of, perhaps, 0.25% of simple interest on the warehoused portion so it does not become a bad debt on the bank's books. <\/p><p>I look forward to the Minister's answers to my questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100028#BB00700","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353508800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>As my colleague, Senator Byrne, said earlier, we support this Bill.  I acknowledge the complexity of the situation and there was no way that the Minister, with the best will in the world, could have drafted legislation that would have been a silver bullet for everybody's debt issues.  It does not cover everything and I am disappointed with some areas in it, but I believe the Oireachtas can work on it to get to a stage where we will have something meaningful.  That is not to say that the Bill and what the Minister is proposing to do are not meaningful.  They are meaningful.<\/p><p>I endorse much of what Senator Healy Eames said.  I will not go over old ground but we cannot talk about this personal insolvency legislation without considering the people who are just about surviving, the mortgage resolution measures that have been submitted to the Central Bank - I accept the Minister is not the Minister for Finance - and trying to move our lenders to a situation where they ease the debt burden on people.  I am not necessarily referring to debt write-down but to proposals that I and others have suggested here previously.  One is zeroisation of interest.  What is the point of charging people penalty interest when they already cannot pay the mortgage?  It makes the situation far worse.  There is also the option of extending the mortgage term.<\/p><p>The Government brought forward initial measures through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to deal with housing and, for example, buy-to-let mortgages.  I do not like the idea of handing over a house to a local authority but that is the position.  The Government passed the measure with broad support, but most local authorities will not operate it.  I realise this is not within the Minister's jurisdiction but I simply offer it as an example.  Should this legislation be passed, the issue is what oversight the Minister will have.  When it is passed in whatever guise, a very hands-on approach will be required from the Government.<\/p><p>I echo the comments on what we thought would be non-judicial arrangements being required to go to the Circuit Court.  Will the Minister clarify why somebody with a debt relief notice for unsecured debt of up to \u20ac20,000 might have to go to court to get that notice?  We could work on improving that.  Will it be in public?  That question was asked previously.  I have grave concerns about the creditor's veto.  The Minister has stated previously that he might be open in the future to considering an independent appeals mechanism.  I suggest, and we will table an amendment in this regard on Committee Stage, that there should be an independent appeals mechanism.  Even if the Minister states now that he will do that but it does not form part of this legislation, that will be fine.  The reason is the 70% veto of creditors.  The only person who can appeal is a creditor.  A debtor cannot appeal under the Bill.  If more than 70% of the creditors do not agree, that is the end.  The next step is bankruptcy.  The Minister has stated that this is the stick one would hold over the financial institutions.  However, bankruptcy is the nuclear option and most people do not wish to reach that stage.  It is striking, nevertheless, that the only person who can appeal is the creditor where it does not agree.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that.<\/p><p>The regulation of personal insolvency practitioners has already been mentioned.  I worked in the financial services sector before I became a Member of the Oireachtas in 2007.  Regulation is crucial with regard to independent financial advice.  Will the practitioners be insurance brokers, accountants and solicitors and will they be regulated by the Central Bank?  We must also remember that if it is a mortgage broker, for example, it will probably be the same individual who organised the mortgage in the first instance.  There is work to be done in this area as regards potential conflicts of interest where an independent broker, who might have been one of the best performers for a mortgage company, is now trying to cut a deal with the same mortgage holder for whom it wrote the mortgage in the first instance.  We will have to consider providing that a personal insolvency practitioner cannot be the same person who introduced the loan in the first place.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that as well.<\/p><p>I have examined the debt relief notices and the limits set for subsistence in so far as what disposable income somebody can have at the end of the month.  The sum of \u20ac60 is far too low.  The asset amount of \u20ac1,200 as the maximum value of the debtor's vehicle in order to qualify is also too low.  I have no wish to see somebody driving around in a BMW X5 jeep but one would be hard pressed to find somebody who has a vehicle that is worth less than \u20ac1,200.  There must be flexibility in that regard.<\/p><p>This Bill is welcome and is a step in the right direction.  The independent appeals mechanism must be a part of personal insolvency legislation, although perhaps not at this stage.  However, if the Minister would give a clear indication that if the banks are not playing ball he would have no difficulty with bringing forward an independent mechanism or independent debt settlement office by way of arbitration, that would send a signal.  We will have to watch this very carefully into the future.  The appeals mechanism is the crux issue in respect of the creditors' veto.<\/p> <p>If the institutions do not play ball, well-meaning legislation such as this may not have the impact the Government wants.  I ask the Minister to encourage the banks to expedite mortgage resolution measures.  The more we can do for people who are not yet in a grave financial situation, through getting banks to be reasonable, to extend mortgage terms and to introduce the zeroisation of interest rates and split mortgages, the better.  We need to see it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100029#CC00200","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353509400,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister and the Government for moving to put measures in place to alleviate the debt burden the Irish people have been drowning in over the past number of years.  The Celtic tiger situation was most regrettable in that some people were engaged in an orgy of spending, which was encouraged by aggressive marketing by banks and light touch regulation.  Times have now changed and the Government is now bringing the country and its people back from the brink, which must be welcomed.  We find ourselves in an era in sharp contrast to the boom years and many people are concerned about debt management.<\/p><p>The introduction of this legislation will radically reform our insolvency legislation and must be welcomed.  Three non-judicial debt resolution systems have been introduced to deal with unsustainable secured and unsecured debt.  To avail of any one of these processes, an individual must be insolvent.  Each proposal for dealing with an indebted situation must be done through a personal insolvency practitioner and one can only apply for relief under either procedure once in a lifetime.  A debt relief notice will allow the write-off of qualifying debt up to \u20ac20,000.  I join Senator Bacik in suggesting the amount should be increased.  The provisions relating to debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements have been addressed by the Minister in his speech.  I do not propose to deal with it again.  The absence of any real and direct involvement of the courts in these procedures is most welcome, as people who are indebted will not have to face the ignominy of having their private finances thrashed out in open court.  It is a welcome new support for those genuinely experiencing severe financial difficulties.<\/p><p>However, those facing bankruptcy will get some considerable reprieve from the former legislation, where previously they were severely curtailed for a 12-year period.  The Bill provides for a number of amendments to the Bankruptcy Act to include a new minimum amount for a creditor to petition for bankruptcy, \u20ac20,000, and the automatic discharge from bankruptcy three years from the date of adjudication.  While I have no truck with individuals who recklessly borrowed and whose only pursuit was greed during the Celtic tiger era, it is important that some people get a second chance in life.  It would be wrong for us as a country to give a message to some of the brightest and best entrepreneurs that they cannot realistically reinvent themselves in the country of their birth.  I want to see these people encouraged back and to see their entrepreneurial spark and verve relit.  I am glad the legislation goes no small way to supporting it.  Through this encouragement, Irish entrepreneurs, particularly those living in rural Ireland, will help to create jobs in the country.  Ultimately, the Exchequer tills will start to ring again.<\/p><p>While I warmly welcome the provisions in the Bill and the effort made by the Government to alleviate the debt burden some people are immersed in, it would be remiss of me not to mention the financial brokers who contacted me about their feelings of displacement from the marketplace.  I refer to the appointment of members of the accountancy profession, who will now provide advisory services to mortgage holders in difficulty.  There is a strong feeling that the service should be open to those operating as mortgage brokers, along with accountants, as they already undertake the role and are familiar with issues relating to personal debt.  They have the qualifications, experience, professional indemnity insurance and independence to do so.  In the interest of fairness and equity, it is important for the market to dictate the involvement of professions in this advisory capacity.  An urgent review needs to be considered.  I also request that we ensure a similar situation does not arise in respect of the appointment of personal insolvency practitioners under the Personal Insolvency Bill.<\/p><p>Further questions about the legislation remain.  There is continued concern about the balance of power between creditors and debtors.  This revolves specifically around the question of veto and whether the creditors retain a veto.  The views on this are mixed and some argue that the existence of the personal insolvency process means banks will be more likely to reach informal agreements with debtors at an earlier stage than when they are engaged with the personal insolvency practitioner.  They will be wary of triggering bankruptcy at that point.  This, it is argued, strengthens the hand of debtors and addresses the concern of creditors that some, who will not pay, could freeload on those who genuinely cannot pay.  However, FLAC, SIPTU and other business leaders continue to express concern that the banks have an effective veto because of the thresholds, at 60% and 50%, and the lack of a legal obligation on the banks to accept the personal insolvency practitioner's recommendation and the certificates of the court.  Perhaps the Minister can address these concerns and provide a rationale for the thresholds.<\/p><p>I refer to the concerns expressed about the fees and costs and the residency requirement.  That might affect emigrants with unsustainable debt in Ireland.  What are the proposals for merging or keeping separate the mortgage information and advice service and MABS?  Perhaps the Minister can shine some light on the topic.  I thank the Minister for listening to the debate on the Bill and I look forward to the Bill becoming law so that those in financial difficulty can avail of its measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100030#DD00200","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1353509400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and I appreciate the detailed explanation in his speech.  There has not been enough recognition of entrepreneurship in Ireland.  Senator Lorraine Higgins touched on that point.  If Lord Alan Sugar lived in Ireland, he would not have been able to get out of bankruptcy.  F.W. Woolworth went bankrupt three times before he built up his huge empire.  There is a need for entrepreneurship and to recognise that, on occasion, people fail.  We must get a balance between the two.<\/p><p>  There are some improvements that could be made to the Bill.  I am concerned about the lack of an independent arbitrator.  Let us suppose a homeowner and a bank cannot come to agreement.  Should they simply have the choice between the bank's will and bankruptcy?  We must find a balance somewhere along the line.  The Bill allows banks to reapply, through the courts, to add an extra five years to the initial three year bankruptcy term.  That will mean an effective eight year term, which is far too long.  It is only 12 months across the Border.  We must bring this in line.  Others have made the important point that people in businesses are closing down and moving across the Border, which is bizarre.  The issue of resolving the mortgage crisis is not addressed fully in the Bill.  We must find a way to get over the problem.<\/p><p>  The problem of mortgage arrears must be resolved.  Unsustainable mortgages must be addressed through loan modification, bankruptcy or non-judicial debt resolution.  Debt settlement arrangements will be of little use to many families in trouble.  Mr. Eoin Collins, writing in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>, stated  &quot;a major flaw in the new legislation is that it will make it harder for people to go bankrupt because debtors will have to prove to the court that they've been engaged in a six month personal insolvency arrangement process with the bank before declaring bankruptcy&quot;.  Can the Minister comment on that point?<\/p><p>  Senator Crown raised an interesting point about bank accounts.  One possible improvement which has been overlooked is to guarantee the right to operate a bank account.  Surprisingly, this is a difficulty for many undischarged bankruptcies in the Republic, unlike in Britain and in the North.  Life without a bank account in the modern world goes beyond mere inconvenience.  One wonders at the public policy logic for compelling people, known to be in financial difficulty, to operate on a cash only basis.  Senator Crown referred to having a debit card, if not a credit card.  There must be some logical improvement in the Bill on that basis and I suggest the Bill be amended on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>  There are many other areas we could cover.  For instance, the Minister referred to Australia's bankruptcy system during the debate in the other House.  There are concerns in Australia that the system is sometimes used by those who enter into agreements without proper consideration.  They turn around and ask for relief.  Can the Minister comment on the protection we have against such cases?  I hope the legislation can make a real difference to businesses and individuals.<\/p> <p>It is evident that we need to stem the tide of people crossing the Border to the United Kingdom to avail of a bankruptcy system.  <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>reported that confidential figures from the Bank of Ireland showed the harsh lifestyles it expected from home owners in return for leniency on their mortgage repayments.  For instance, private health insurance is permitted, although the maximum budget is &#8364;166 a month.  That would not even cover the cost of even VHI's most basic plan for families.  How are the banks still calling the shots?  How do they have a veto in this vital area?<\/p><p> The Bill provides that distressed borrowers should be left with enough to provide for a reasonable living.  That seems to be a vague definition.  Surely, it should be decided by an independent body.  In Greece individuals have to prove in court that their income is not sufficient to continue paying their debts.  Setting aside living expenses, equal repayments are made to both secured and unsecured creditors from remaining funds for several years.  The Minister has seen what is happening in other countries and taken on board some ideas.  However, he is coming up with an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  The Bill can be improved in several areas on Committee Stage.  The Minister has put his heart and soul into this legislation and I know he wants it to last a long time, to prove itself worthy and, when looking back, to have solved a problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100030#DD00300","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353510000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  This legislation is a significant step forward in dealing with the financial difficulties of many thousands of people.  The programme for Government set out clearly that this issue needed to be addressed through legislative measures to ensure a fair and realistic deal could be procured on behalf of persons in financial difficulties, many of them have been suffering physically, emotionally and mentally.  Their quality of life has been affected.  Little did the country think seven years ago that ordinary decent people would find themselves at the mercy of banks and financial institutions.  Few people ever set out in life to end up bordering on being insolvent.<\/p><p>The legislation is timely.  While we were concerned and frustrated at the delay in its introduction, it was necessary to ensure the Department and stakeholders could come up with a Bill that would result in the maximum benefit to as many people as possible.  While I welcome the Bill as a genuine effort to get it right, I caution that we may need to do more.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I was delighted to have an input at the consultation stage of the legislation.  Many groups gave evidence to the committee on the legislation which was condensed into a report.  The Minister used some of the report's recommendations and suggestions when framing the legislation.<\/p><p>The Bill will provide a chart of resolution for many people in financial difficulties.  I hope it will be cost effective and not involve expensive legal costs.  It will ensure those at the end of their tether over financial difficulties will be able to see a future in their homes, as well as having some financial freedom.  The Bill is realistic in its measures in that people who can afford to pay will have to pay.  For those who cannot afford to pay, at least there will be a structure into which they will be able to buy.  The State, of which we are so proud and for which our forefathers fought to create a republic, will stand with them shoulder to shoulder.<\/p><p>Although the legislation has not been tested, we will see people going to personal insolvency agencies, engaging with financial institutions and ensuring they create a future for themselves.  I hope all parties, particularly financial institutions, will engage with this process in the same spirit in which the Minster has.  It needs all stakeholders to buy into it to ensure it will not become bogged down.  If it is necessary to amend the legislation to pin down problems that emerge in its application, the House will be amenable to doing so.<\/p><p>The Bill is a genuine effort to cover as many bases as possible.  The time delay was necessary to ensure the appropriate consultations took place with as many stakeholders as possible and loopholes were closed off for the sake of the thousands who find themselves in financial difficulties.  What happened in this country was not the fault of the thousands who took advice to purchase houses at a certain time.  The majority want to pay their debts and engage in a process in which they consider they are addressing their financial difficulties.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister well in the passage of the legislation and thank him for listening to the debate.  Many suggestions have been made so far and I am sure many more will be as the Bill goes through its various Stages.  It is a positive start and I look forward to the legislation being implemented in full by the middle of next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100031#EE00200","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1353510000,"counter":167,"content":"<p>T\u00e1 c\u00e9ad f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire, mar is Bille iontach t\u00e1bhachtach \u00e9 seo agus is m\u00f3r agam deis a fh\u00e1il labhairt air, mar go bhfuil an oiread daoine sin ins an bpobal at\u00e1 faoi chruach\u00e1s airgeadais de bharr an m\u00e9id a tharla sa t\u00edr le roinnt blianta anuas.<\/p><p>The publication of the Bill was much anticipated both by legislators and the public at large.  I have come across quite a number of people struggling with distressed mortgages who were anxious about what this legislation would contain.  In my time in the House I can recall few other examples of legislation which attracted as much interest.  The Bill has attracted such interest naturally because it could materially affect so very many people.  There are tens of thousands struggling with distressed mortgages and the situation is likely to remain serious for several years.  Many people extended themselves and borrowed more than they could afford for houses which were extravagantly overpriced out of the fear that if they did not, they would never get on the property ladder.  Many of them are now on lower incomes because of job losses and wage cuts and paying off a mortgage on a house which is only worth a fraction of its original price.  People are being brought to the brink.<\/p><p>The legislation will, however, come as a disappointment to many of those who were eagerly awaiting it and the primary reason is simple.  The Bill provides for the banks having complete power over personal insolvency arrangements.<\/p> <p>Regrettably, I fear that when the bank has the whip hand, resolutions which might have worked otherwise will now not be contemplated.  However, we will not be voting against the legislation.  Sinn F\u00e9in welcomed its publication and the need for some action to be taken in this area is long overdue.  While we believe it is deficient, we welcome its publication as a starting point but, in itself, it does not achieve what the debtors of Ireland need it to.  Anyway, we will be supporting the legislation and submitting amendments on Committee Stage, just as my colleague, Deputy P\u00e1draig Mac Lochlainn, did in the D\u00e1il to try to remedy the deficiencies as we see them.<\/p><p>We have engaged with this legislation constructively from the outset.  We warned against the banks having a veto.  When the scheme was published we stated that it was essential for the proposed insolvency service to be independent, that a more humane approach to bankruptcy was needed and that the banks would have to compromise as well.  I regret that this has not been taken on board and that the Bill provides for the banks to have complete power in respect of personal insolvency arrangements.  We will table amendments to remove the bank veto capacity.  While the debt settlement proposals will help some, they will not help large numbers of families who are struggling with high levels of personal debt.  We will also table an amendment to reduce the amount in the eligibility criteria for a personal insolvency arrangement from \u20ac3 million to \u20ac1 million.  The Bill should not cater for those who were reckless commercial buy-to-let landlords or those who took excessive risks; it should protect those who are struggling with debts with regard to the family home.  We have called for an independent agency to be empowered to enforce legally binding settlements on debtor and creditor.  The only other option open to people in serious arrears is bankruptcy.  There are changes in this regard and it is welcome that the bankruptcy term has been shortened from 12 years to three years.  Given the drastic effect it can have on people's lives, bankruptcy should be the last resort.  Anyone entering bankruptcy stands to lose all of his or her assets, including the home, and we must do what we can to prevent people from being forced into that situation unnecessarily.  People should be helped to remain in their homes and the independent agency should examine how to make mortgage debt sustainable on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p>Other speakers have alluded to the three new forms of voluntary debt settlement arrangement that will be brought about by the Bill.  Debt relief notices are aimed at debtors who possess almost no income or assets.  They aim to provide a low-cost alternative to bankruptcy and would involve the eventual write-off of debt after a three-year moratorium.  Debt settlement arrangements are aimed at those who do not fall within the strict eligibility criteria of the debt relief notices but cover only unsecured debt.  A debt settlement arrangement is proposed by a personal insolvency practitioner and voted on at a creditors' meeting.  It involves the periodic distribution of payments to creditors and a write-off of the remaining debt after a maximum period of five years.  The personal insolvency arrangements are related to the debt settlement arrangements, but these allow for the inclusion of secured debt.  Once there is agreement from a majority of both secured and unsecured creditors the arrangement is capped at \u20ac3 million unless otherwise agreed by the secured creditors.<\/p><p>These new formulae are positive and we hope they can assist families who are under pressure.  Like the Free Legal Advice Centres, we share concerns that the five-year period for review of personal insolvency arrangements is too long and we are inclined to agree that there is a need for an annual review.  At any rate, the primary difficulty of the bank veto remains.  The reality is that there will be no legal obligation upon the banks to accept reasonable applications from customers in arrears, nor will there be a legal obligation upon any bank to accept an application for one of these resolution options for customers in arrears.  Further, there will be no right to appeal a bank's decision, potentially leaving a debtor with no option but to apply for bankruptcy.<\/p><p>It is those who stand to lose their homes whom we need to protect most.  We are not in the business of facilitating buy-to-let landlords who made foolish investments.  We believe that an independent body, properly appointed and set up, would be in a position to distinguish in this regard and could make it a priority to ensure that the backs of ordinary homeowners are not broken in trying to repay mortgages that were never fair or realistic in the first place and were in any case merely a function of the banks' reckless lending and of the property boom.  The Government is in control of several of the banks but it has failed to put them in their place.  There is no recognition that it should be the creditors rather the banks who call the shots on these issues.  We believe there should be an independent body which can deal with mortgage arrears and debt resolution and we call on the Government to recognise this.<\/p><p>Sin r\u00e1ite, t\u00e1imid ag f\u00e1ilti\u00fa roimh an m\u00e9id at\u00e1 d\u00e9anta go dt\u00ed seo.

I hope the Bill will simplify and destigmatise many aspects of debt settlement, result in practical solutions for the personal and mortgage debt problems that many people face and allow many to become active participants in the economy and the recovery of the country.  The Bill addresses the sad reality that there are people who have reached unmanageable levels of debt.  Many of these people are on low incomes, have relatively small amounts of debt, do not own any assets and have no real prospect of repaying their debts.  The Bill addresses all levels of debt, reflecting the fact that what may be a worrying debt for one person may represent small change for another.<\/p><p>I welcome the regard for the family home expressed as part of the ethos of the Bill.  Consideration will be given to debtors' continued ownership and occupation of their principal private residences.  No doubt these provisions will be welcomed by many people.  Further relief may be drawn from the prominence of non-judicial procedures in the Bill, because court costs often simply become another financial burden to people.<\/p><p>Often, stigma attaches to individuals who have become insolvent or require debt settlement arrangements.  Some of these individuals may have genuinely found themselves unable to make repayments on outstanding debts due to non-payment of goods or services, or due to difficult trading conditions which have propelled them into debt that might previously have been avoidable.  These people have a genuine need and may be restored to solvency and become vital contributors to the Exchequer again or go on to develop new businesses.  We cannot simply write people off, leaving them to struggle with repayments that they could never realistically make.<\/p><p>I welcome the reform of the bankruptcy legislation and the reduction of automatic discharge from debt from the current 12 years to three years.  However, I acknowledge the balance contained in the Bill, which provides flexible options for debtors while addressing the rights of creditors.  The Bill does not seek to allow solvent debtors to relinquish their responsibilities to creditors.  I hope the range of measures will encourage those in financial difficulties to engage more readily and at an earlier opportunity with creditors to put in place debt management solutions.  The issue of debt has isolated many individuals.  This legislation and the debt management process to be introduced subsequent to the enactment of the Bill will assist those in genuine difficulties to find workable solutions.  They will be given options to work their way out of debt.  The aim of the Bill is not to benefit those who simply wish to avoid their obligations.

The first thing I have to say following my compliment is that it is complex, as the Minister has noted, and this is why he has dealt with it in considerable and helpful detail.  It is cumbersome and it is also astonishingly incomplete.  The Minister stated:<blockquote><br \/>Determination of appropriate guidelines with regard to the reasonable expenses that may be allowed to or negotiated by debtors in an insolvency process will require further consideration.  There are no such guidelines readily available or agreed at this point. ... This is an area of work with which MABS is particularly familiar in the context of its current operations.<\/blockquote>That is one lacuna in the legislation.  The Minister also stated:<blockquote>[I]t is my intention to bring forward comprehensive proposals on this matter on Committee Stage.  There will be a new Part 5 to replace the current Part 5 ...<\/blockquote><\/p> <p>Although he does say that a substantial amount of work has been done on it - and I accept that - it is very curious to bring a Bill before the Seanad, particularly after it has passed through the D\u00e1il, which is so substantially incomplete.  The Minister speaks of introducing amendments on Committee and Report Stages.  I hope that some of those may be amendments that have been suggested during discussion of the Bill in this House.  Again, however, I maintain that Report Stage is very late and if we disagree with the Minister all we can do, instead of amending his legislation on Report Stage, is accept or reject amendments.  The Bill is cumbersome, complex and incomplete in the sense that there is a considerable number of lacunae in it.<\/p><p> I have some concerns regarding the personal insolvency measures and the inclusion in the Bill of personnel who will assist and advise people.  These will be professionals who will be licensed and so forth but I wonder if there will be enough of such people.  I wonder also if provision is being made in the courts because the courts are part of this whole process.  The debtor first goes through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, then the Insolvency Service of Ireland and then the courts.  It is a tripartite system, like Gaul - <i>Omnia Gallia in tres partes divisa est<\/i>.  Everything is done in triplicate which seems extraordinarily bureaucratic.  In Sweden they go straight for the money.  They go straight into the State assistance service and I wonder if that approach was considered by the Minister.  <\/p><p> I raised this whole issue, in a general sense, in this House about four years ago.  At that time I suggested the development of a department of home security - not, I must stress, homeland security - so that the citizens of this State could be secure in their homes.   This Bill may go some way towards this but I point out to the Minister that in very recent times one of the large UK banks has exited this country and sold its portfolio of mortgages at a 90% haircut.  Why, in the name of God, was no mechanism provided whereby the bank could sell those homes to the people who are endangered by their mortgages?  That seems to me to have been a logical thing to do.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister to explain to the House why the supervisory period is three years here, when it is one year in the United Kingdom.  While I would think that even though there would be a lesser incentive for Irish people to obtain residency in the United Kingdom now that the period has been so reduced, a difference still exists.  I have some difficulties and problems with the Bill.  The Minister and I had a little joust about the fact that he said the Bill does not provide for any process whereby negative equity can be &quot;automatically&quot; written off.  There is a substantial difference, in my opinion, perhaps not in the Bill but in the Minister's speech, between being written off, full stop and being written off automatically.  If the negative equity is written off automatically it does not leave any room for manoeuvre.  <\/p><p> As much information as possible should be provided on how the personal insolvency practitioner will work, on the funding available to make the process manageable and on whether there will be sufficient personnel in the courts.  There has been no regulatory impact assessment provided by the Minister.  I respectfully request such an assessment, which is a statutory requirement, because without it the debate is incomplete.  <\/p><p> I am concerned that upfront fees must be paid by debtors before they submit an application and receive a judgment.  If they are in financial difficulties already, presumably the fees paid to the personal insolvency practitioner will make that situation considerably worse, particularly if the debtor is not eventually granted a debt relief notice.  The limit of &#8364;20,000 means that only 15% of the clients of MABS would qualify and in that context I suggest, in line with the recommendations of the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, that the limit be raised to &#8364;30,000 to make it more realistic.  The question of the net disposable income limit of &#8364;60 or less and the items that are excluded from that, also worries me.  Reference is made to household items and equipment necessary for work but such items are not listed and the provision is very vague.  We do not know categorically what can be excluded.  We must examine that section of the Bill closely and ask the Minister to provide a list of the items concerned, which he has not done to date.  The asset limitation of &#8364;400 needs to be increased because it is very miserly.  The value of a debtor's motor car is set at &#8364;1,200 which seems extraordinarily low.  My own car might just qualify but I am hoping not to become insolvent just yet.  The Bill provides that if a car - or other goods - is part of a hire purchase agreement, it is affected by the application for debt relief.  The treatment of hire purchase agreements should be flexible enough to allow MABS to apply to the Insolvency Service of Ireland to have the hire purchase agreement continued, notwithstanding the application for a debt relief notice.  Under the legislation as drafted, the hire purchase agreement must be terminated and in that case, the debtor would then be without a car.  <\/p><p> There are many aspects of this complicated legislation that require a good deal of teasing out.  I do not always agree with my colleague, Senator Byrne, who, like myself sometimes has an abrasive manner but I agree with him that this is a very significant Bill.  I have not had time to put anything like the degree of reservations or questions I have on it to the Minister.  I look forward to further discussion of the legislation and I hope the Minister will be open to suggestions from all side of the House in terms of amending the Bill.  I have put forward some of my reservations and I welcome the fact the Minister has stayed in the House for this discussion.  I hope this House will be used to fill the lacunae that the Minister has acknowledged exist in the legislation.  The Minister can make use of the Senate as a place where valuable ideas can be obtained and incorporated into the Bill to the benefit of everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100032#FF00500","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353511200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending and particularly for staying for the entire debate, given that he could have nominated someone in his place and have his officials take notes.<\/p><p>There are two sentences in the Minister's speech which sum it all up for me.  The first is: &quot;Lenders must engage properly with customers.&quot;.  The second is: &quot;If our financial institutions refuse to engage, then we will in the future, have to refine our approach to debt resolution&quot;.  That says it all.  The financial institutions have been given the opportunity to come to the table and make an agreement with parties.  There has been much comment on the issue of a bank veto but there is no bank veto here.  A veto cannot operate if an agreement has been made.  If the financial institutions do not agree, we may have to revisit this legislation.  If they are not prepared to work with the relevant parties to try to ensure that debtors are given the opportunity to come out of their insolvency, then our approach may change.  <\/p><p>I will not go back over issues that have been raised already but I am concerned about the personal insolvency practitioners.  Many of the people who are in a financial black hole and who could potentially benefit from this legislation are there because of unwise financial decisions.  In that context, I am concerned that the legislation does not spell out who the personal insolvency practitioners will be.  I know there is an insolvency group in the State but it is primarily made up of lawyers.  I understand that the Minister is trying to be flexible within the legislation so that personal insolvency practitioners are not pigeonholed but there is a gap that may allow people to set themselves up as practitioners, with knowledge, experience and ability, to advance a deal or arrangement with banks on behalf of their clients.  <\/p> <p>This is something we should consider.  I do not know if there is a minimum requirement or the position internationally but I am concerned that people may be hoodwinked by individuals who set themselves up as insolvency practitioners.  I do not think the issue has been addressed thus far in this debate, although it may have been addressed in the other House.<\/p><p>I am loth to say so, but I agree with Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh regarding homeowners.

While I am not old enough to remember the last boom and bust cycle of the 1970s and 1980s, I know that interest rates were very high during that period.  The banks did not find it difficult then to write down compound interest but they have always found it difficult to remove capital.  I am concerned they will be slow to come to an agreement on capital in the context of the current low interest rates.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for remaining in the Chamber.

They are now being given a veto over whether an individual or business should qualify for a personal insolvency arrangement.  These same institutions encouraged borrowers to take out 100% loans.  Most of the businesspeople I know want to negotiate with their banks in order to pay whatever is possible and reasonable but the Bill gives the banks the casting vote on whether a deal can be agreed.  Debtors can threaten bankruptcy but most people do not want to go down this route.  They want to rebuild their lives and dreams but is this Bill sufficiently balanced to provide equality of outcomes?<\/p><p>The regeneration of small and medium enterprises will aid in the recovery of our economy.  I am confident that the Minister will encourage the entrepreneurial spirit of our people.  When people have lost everything they need hope.

This is a complex piece of legislation that seeks to achieve a balance between the difficulties of debtors and the rights of creditors.  It seeks to ensure that assistance is provided to people who are truly insolvent and genuinely cannot pay their debts while not allowing those who can pay a mechanism to either defraud creditors or evade payment.  It also has to achieve a balance in a broad range of other areas.<\/p><p>Some Senators were rightly critical of the conduct of financial institutions during the boom years, when they were throwing money at people like confetti at a wedding without undertaking sensible due diligence or assessments of individuals' capacity to pay.  They were frequently conflicted in their interests.  Some of the financial institutions were throwing large sums of money at mortgage applicants to purchase homes or properties for investment and rental purposes while also funding the developers who were constructing the homes and apartments for which the mortgages were being created.  There was never a declaration of interest on the part of financial institutions in those circumstances.  They never explained to the individuals who were making decisions to purchase that they had a vested interest in, for example, the sale of a block of flats in order to recoup from developers the funds they lent for the acquisition of the land and the cost of construction.  During the boom nothing was a flat and everything was an apartment, regardless of how minuscule the property may have been.  However, many people also borrowed money on the assumption that property values always increase.  They borrowed sums which they did not have a realistic capacity to repay in monthly payments because they hoped to make a capital killing.  Those who bought early and sold early were successful.  Those who bought wisely and carefully, and stayed away from boom prices, may also have been successful.  A great many others are now in financial difficulties.<\/p><p>I listened to Senators who spoke generally.  The legislation has, rightly, specific provisions aimed at protecting those who are in financial difficulties in their family homes by use of the personal insolvency arrangement.  A provision allows for a debt settlement arrangement to be agreed with the assistance of a personal insolvency practitioner to allow individuals, either on their own or with families, to retain reasonably sized homes, be they apartments or family homes for themselves and their spouses or partners and children.  The Bill also envisages that where a home is of substantial value or particularly expensive to run and where there are creditors, the arrangements entered into would ultimately provide for the sale of the home and some of the money would be used for discharge of creditors.<\/p> <p>Where there are creditors, the arrangements that are entered into will provide for the ultimate sale of the home and for some of the money involved to be used to discharge debts relating to those creditors.<\/p><p>A question was posed about what would be the benefit of a personal insolvency arrangement and the suggestion was made that banks and financial institutions have some sort of veto.  The benefit of the arrangement to a debtor who is truly insolvent is that instead of going into bankruptcy, he or she will have the opportunity to retain his or her home.  It also provides light at the end of the tunnel and the possibility, over a period of years, that the individual involved can work through a portion of his or her indebtedness and that some of this will ultimately be written off.  In such circumstances, the person will emerge from the arrangement after five or six years with his or her home still intact.  Furthermore, these arrangements will provide people with protection by preventing the financial institutions to which they are indebted from obtaining orders for repossession before the courts and forcing the sale of homes.  They also allow people to avoid the necessity of bankruptcy.  These are particular, unique and direct arrangements which are designed to provide protection for the possibly many thousands of people throughout the country who are truly insolvent and experiencing real difficulties but who have an income stream and who, if arrangements are entered into with their creditors, have real hope for the future, without their families being unduly disrupted.  Those are the benefits of the mechanism in question.<\/p><p>The banks do not have a veto.  Senators must bear in mind the context of this.  Both creditors and debtors have rights.  Financial institutions are not singly and solely the only creditors in this instance.  Most individuals who are in difficulty with their mortgages - some of whom are in negative equity and genuinely cannot meet their debts - are not in a position to make their repayments, but they may also be indebted to a variety of other creditors.  There must be balance and fairness.  As I explained in the context of the PIA, a weighted majority vote can take place among creditors in order to agree to a debt realignment or rearrangement.  A financial institution or institutions must have the right to vote in those circumstances.  Where someone's position may become viable after a period of years, thereby creating the possibility of some of their debts being repaid, not only would it be to their advantage to retain their home, it would also be an advantage to the financial institution involved.  On entering an accommodation, a financial institution will have the advantage of not being obliged to deal with a bankruptcy situation or of not being obliged to watch the property involved being sold at a very low price.  In addition, there will be a possibility that it will be able to recoup, over a period of years, a greater proportion of the loan than would otherwise be the case.  If an individual exits a PIA in circumstances in which he or she is more financially sound and retains his or her home, mortgage repayments may go on for a considerable number of years.  Those of us who have had mortgages have paid them over similar periods.<\/p><p>The key to all of this is that where people are genuinely insolvent and cannot make repayments, where they are in negative equity and where there is a substantial capital loan on a property, the value of which is significantly greater than that of the property and the person's other assets, banks will be obliged to put clear arrangements in place.  The banks will finally have to accept that there are individuals in respect of whom there must be capital write-off of a portion of their loans.<\/p><p>One of the aspects we tend not to notice when debating this matter is that despite the fact that many people throughout the State are in financial difficulties and that any family confronted by a court order for repossession is a family in distress, extraordinarily few repossessions have taken place in the four years of the current crisis.  There have been in region of 200 to 300 repossessions each year.  If we examine the figures from the United States in proportionate terms, it is clear there have been many thousands of repossessions over the same period.  The one thing the financial institutions in Ireland have done is to enter into debt forbearance and other arrangements with tens of thousands of people in order to try to keep them in their homes and to give them space to come to terms with rearranging their financial circumstances.  One cannot permanently kick the can up the road.  There will be arrangements under the PIA process which will involve debt forbearance.  Arrangements involving debt forgiveness or some level thereof will also have to be put in place in respect of certain individuals because such arrangements will offer the only way to bring about change.<\/p><p>The financial institutions must realise that if they do not deal with this matter in a reasonable and considered way, some individuals may choose bankruptcy in order that they might exit all of their debts after three years.  A question was asked with regard to why an appeals system is not being put in place.  There is a good reason for that.  In effect, what we are concerned with here are non-judicial debt settlement arrangements.  What is the nature of such an arrangement?  It is an agreed arrangement between debtors and creditors.  There are constitutional constraints in the context of simply writing off debt arbitrarily.  What we are trying to do is to create a mechanism that will not result in thousands of unnecessary court hearings which will give rise to the possibility of debtors and creditors spending tens of thousands of euro on legal representation in their pursuit of some form of court-ordered resolution.  The mechanism we are putting in place is designed to provide an agreed arrangement.  Such an arrangement will be brought about with the assistance of an intermediary, namely, the personal insolvency practitioner.  It has been suggested that those who will act as personal insolvency practitioners will be drawn from the ranks of accountants and solicitors only.  Clearly, there will be accountants and solicitors who will engage in this sort of work.  However, a broad range of financial intermediaries have the skills to work in this area.  There are people who work in mediation who would also possess such skills.  I am loath to say it for fear of creating undue excitement but there are probably some retired bank managers who could move from being poachers to being gamekeepers in this regard.  Having a knowledge of what they are dealing with could allow the latter to operate skilfully in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100034#HH00300","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353512400,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Should that be allowed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100035#JJ00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1353512400,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Senator Norris said the Bill was not complete.  I have always been of the view that both this House and the D\u00e1il are engaged in a legislative process.  The Bill has undergone a complex developmental stage.  When they were published, the heads of the Bill were submitted to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  When the Bill was introduced, it was the subject of a Second Stage debate in the D\u00e1il before being referred to the joint committee for further hearings.  As we have proceeded, it has been developed further.  With regard to personal insolvency practitioners, substantial regulatory provisions will be put in place.  We have been engaged in a wide-ranging consultation process in respect of the different modalities which obtain.  The amendments relating to that matter will - out of respect for it - be dealt with in this House.  The Seanad is well equipped to deal with those amendments.  When we have dealt with them, that part of the Bill to which they refer will have to be referred back to the D\u00e1il.<\/p><p>A question was posed as to why the courts are involved.  The courts are only tangentially involved.  If, for example, a personal insolvency practitioner secures agreement among the proportionate number of creditors and the debtor and if the insolvency agency has checked all the paperwork and found everything to be in order, the matter will then go before the courts, which will have sign-off in respect of whether it is a debt relief notice, debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement.  These arrangements will have the authority of the courts and this will ensure that those who enter into them will not - in the years during which they are a party to them - be capable of being sued for any outstanding debts.  These arrangements give debtors that protection.  This will ensure that when the new regulatory framework is put in place in the European Union, the insolvency resolution process in Ireland will be a recognised court resolution process.  In so far as it provides protection, a debtor will never need to appeal to the courts in the context of one of these new resolutions because he or she will have agreed to it.  Protection will be provided for creditors who may have been excluded from or not notified of the process.  A creditor who believes a debtor has concealed all sorts of financial assets and resources may go before the courts.  By and large, the majority of these applications will be dealt with relatively speedily within the courts system and a protective mechanism will be provided.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn referred to a particular issue in the context of bankruptcy and I want to respond to this because it also involves the courts.  This is the possibility that after three years, a person could have a further five years imposed on him or her.  The legislation involves recognising that people make bad business decisions on occasion, that they get things wrong and that they get themselves into debt.  When I became Minister, a person could be bankrupt for the remainder of his or her lifetime.  In the 2011 Act, the term of bankruptcy was reduced to 12 years.<\/p> <p>It is now coming down to three years.  It is to give people an opportunity, because if one is an entrepreneur and one gets it wrong, one can eventually get one's life back on track again.  There are very discrete circumstances in which bankruptcy can be extended for an extra five years.  It is probably the only section to which I will have time to refer, namely, section 146, which inserts a new section 85A into the Bankruptcy Act.  The circumstances in which that will happen is where an individual who has been made bankrupt either failed to co-operate with the official assignee on bankruptcy in the realisation of assets or hid from or failed to disclose to the official assignee income or assets which could be realised for the benefit of creditors.  That is where it can be extended.  It cannot be generally extended simply on a whim or discretion.<\/p><p>I am conscious that I have not had an opportunity to deal with a myriad of issues that have been raised.  I apologise to Senators for not getting to some of them.  I have no doubt that we will get an opportunity to address many of them as we take Committee Stage of the Bill and I would be very happy to do that.<\/p><p>I will conclude in a single sentence.  This is complex legislation.  It deals not simply with home mortgages and difficulties in that area but with insolvency generally.  It is designed to bring our insolvency architecture into the 21st century.  It is designed to give real hope to people who are currently mired in debt, that there is a structure through which they can work to resolve their indebtedness issues.  It is designed to provide a mechanism to bring debtors and creditors together in circumstances where frequently they would normally be at arm\u2019s length and many of them would end doing battle in the courts with each other.  It is designed to do it in circumstances in which the costs are kept to a minimum.<\/p><p>The final point to be made, because it answers a question raised by a number of Senators, is that personal insolvency practitioners will not be paid simply by the person who is indebted.  The personal insolvency practitioners may not get paid at all, unless they succeed in bringing about a debt resolution.  Their payment will basically be appropriate fees for work done, as agreed by the debtor and creditor, because if there is a debt resolution, be it a debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement, their fees will come out of the pool of money from which creditors themselves hope to benefit in recovering some of the debt due to them.  There is going to be not just a debtor who has an interest in ensuring that fees are reasonable, there is going to be a creditor or perhaps a series of them, who are anxious to ensure they are kept reasonable.  There is a similar procedure in place in the United Kingdom for our equivalent of the debt settlement arrangement.  They do not have a personal insolvency arrangement equivalent in the United Kingdom.  In the UK where they have been working this and now also in Northern Ireland the fees have reached a level that is reasonable and appropriate because basically they are under the microscope every time there is a meeting between debtors and creditors.  It will find its own level but there will be some regulation and oversight.  As Members will see when we get to Committee Stage there will be a substantial additional Part to be put into the Bill to deal specifically with the regulation of personal insolvency practitioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100035#JJ00300","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353513000,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1353513000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100036#KK00300","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1353513000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100036#KK00400","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Employment Equality (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012: Second Stage","time":1353513300,"counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100037#LL00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1353513300,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

Over the past 40 years, the Oireachtas has introduced many progressive legislative measures to ensure that people in the workplace are not discriminated against on grounds of gender, race or sexual orientation.  We all welcomed those measures but for some reason we have turned a blind eye to a far more prevalent form of discrimination in the workplace, namely, discrimination based on age - accurately described as old age.<\/p><p>Before I say why I believe this Bill is a good idea, I will explain what it does not propose.  This is not a Bill that seeks to enable people in old age who no longer have the capacity to carry out certain employment functions to remain working and carrying out those functions.  Accordingly, it is not a Bill that seeks to ensure that 80 year-old pilots with fading eyesight can remain in their jobs.  As with all such important jobs, people should only be permitted to carry out those jobs if they have the physical and mental capacity to do so.  This Bill seeks to achieve fairness and equality in the workplace.  Why should able-bodied people, who have full mental capacity, be required to face compulsory retirement at 65 years of age?  If a proposal were to be advanced prohibiting any person from being a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas if over 65 years of age, it would be rejected by both Houses.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100037#LL00400","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1353513300,"counter":189,"content":"<p>It may not be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100037#LL00500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1353513300,"counter":190,"content":"<p>If so, a few of the Minister's colleagues would have to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100037#LL00600","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1353513300,"counter":192,"content":"<p>It would not simply be rejected on grounds of fairness but also because some of the most effective politicians are people of maturity.  Age is an advantage, not simply in politics but also in employment generally.  I hope they will forgive me for doing so but I will cite Senators Quinn and \u00d3 Murch\u00fa as proof of the point I wish to make.<\/p><p>People should be afforded choice and flexibility in respect of when they should retire.  Many people will, no doubt, continue to wish to retire at 65 years of age.  However, many people in both the public and private sectors who reach the age of 65 are desperately anxious to continue in work.  We all know the heartbreak and trauma experienced by those who have to go over the cliff edge of compulsory retirement at age 65.  <\/p><p>The law should facilitate those people by prohibiting discrimination based on age.  This is not only a fair proposal but also a proposal that makes economic sense.  It is apparent that public sector pension expenditure is very significant.  If some public sector workers choose to stay on after 65 years of age, there would be no extra cost to the Exchequer if they work additional years.  One of the arguments against this proposal may be that it will prevent younger people from gaining employment.  I reject that argument and I believe it is unfounded.  <\/p><p>First, the right to remain in a job after 65 years of age is not simply a right for those who have reached that age but it is also a right for all younger people who will reach that age in the future.  Second, it is not an argument for the promotion of employment for young people to say that certain other workers should be forced out of the employment sector.  A similar argument was made in the 1930s when the marriage ban for women was introduced.  Married women were told they could no longer work because they would be taking jobs from men.  It was a nonsense argument then and it is nonsense now.  Self-employed people, politicians and members of the Judiciary, do not face mandatory retirement at 65 years of age.  Why should people working in the public sector be forced to go at 65 years of age if they want to continue working and if they have both physical and mental capacity to do so?  Why should employers in the private sector be entitled to dictate to an employee that he or she must cease work at a certain age?  People are living longer and their health is improving.  People in their late 60s and 70s are now well able to continue working.  I believe the compulsory retirement age has a negative effect on the status of older people in Irish society.  People over the age of 65 years should be allowed to continue working if they wish to do so.  They should not be put out to pasture once they reach a certain age.  Their employers should not be entitled to say that their service is no longer required.  That is neither fair nor progressive.  It is a brain-drain from public and private organisations of experience, judgment and expertise. <\/p><p>I ask Members of the House to support the legislation which will constitute a significant step to ensuring full equality in the workplace for all Irish citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100037#LL00800","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1353513300,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I have great pleasure in seconding this visionary proposal by Senator White.  I hope it will be agreed to by the House and, if not, that it will spark a far-reaching debate.  I refer to members of the Cabinet who will be in their 65th year if this Government runs it course.  Some of them will be 65 years while others will be in their 65th year.  For instance, if they were working in the health service they would have received their first letter notifying them that they were in their last year of work.  The list of those in the category includes, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who has already reached that great milestone.  I am being ungallant by mentioning the age of the ladies but the list also includes Deputy Joan Burton, Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Alan Shatter, Minister for Justice and Equality, and Defence.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn, has already reached that landmark age.  Uachtar\u00e1n na h\u00c9ireann, Michael D. Higgins, is in his eighth decade.  The Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se\u00e1n Barrett, has also passed the age of mandatory retirement.<\/p><p>I contrast these names with that of Professor Niall O'Higgins.  His name will be known to many Members because he is involved in the report which is examining the reorganisation of hospital structures.     <\/p> <p>Whether one agrees or disagrees with him, he has shown himself to be an energetic, capable, mentally acute and skilful person.  I recall the sad day several years ago in St. Vincent's University Hospital when Professor Higgins who one minute was doing six or eight operations a day, running a vibrant research programme, receiving the accolades he deserved as the founder of modern breast cancer surgery in Ireland, teaching students and acting as a great role model for young doctors in training and those interested in health policy and the next was told he was dependent on the State and had no say in the matter.  He had to go because he had reached his 65th birthday and had to become a burden on the State.  Six months later I had occasion to attend a conference at the world famous Dana-Farber Cancer Institute of Harvard Medical School.  During one of the down moments I was wandering around trying to find a quiet place to make some telephone calls and somebody said I could use a nearby office because the gentleman who used it had just retired that week.  I wandered into the office which was full of cardboard boxes filled with his memorabilia which were awaiting collection.  There were lovely photographs on the desk and the wall of an elderly gentleman with his family and a number of plaques.  My little medical heart went all a flutter when I saw that the gentleman's name was Baruj Benacerraf who had won the Noble Prize.  He was an extraordinary man.  I am sorry but we doctors can get a little nerdy about stuff like this.  Being in a Nobel Prize winner's office was a special moment.  I found out that he was retiring at the age of 89 years and that he had been publishing papers, conducting research and was still actively engaged, although I am not sure whether he was seeing patients.  I visited my former mentor, Dr. Jim Holland, one of the founders of American oncology, in New York a few months ago.  He is still seeing patients four days a week and planning what research he will conduct next year.<\/p><p>Outside the world of science and medicine internationally, last night I saw Shimon Peres, the Israeli President, aged 89 years, being interviewed.  We were all taken by the incredibly sprightly and energetic Queen Elizabeth II who went skipping through the English Market in Cork, bounced up the stairs in the National Convention Centre and looked longingly at that lovely pint of Guinness in the brewery and she is 85 years old.  The time has come to examine mandatory retirement in the public service.  It is inequitable.  It is unfair that somebody who is still contributing and has not reached a milestone of infirmity or failed a test of ability is denied the right to work.  As Senator Mary White said, this right will be denied to people entering the service at younger ages.  It is incredibly irrational.  Everybody understands in the context of demographics that an awful time bomb is brewing throughout the western world.  Fewer people are paying taxes and insurance premiums than previously to support those who are &quot;dependent&quot; on the system.  Having moved from a ratio of five or six taxpayers per dependant, we are rapidly approaching parity and in countries with low birth rates, coupled with longer life expectancy and early retirement ages, it is unsustainable.<\/p><p>Perhaps the best argument is the pure, mind numbing, anachronistic quality to this issue.  What is the origin of retirement ages?  The person generally credited as being the original auteur of social democracy, although he is remembered for other aspects of his curriculum vitae, is Count Otto van Bismarck in Germany.  To pre-empt what he perceived as the increasing threat of Marxism in Europe, he introduced a wide range of social reforms.  One of the jewels in that crown was retirement.  People could retire at 65 years having paid throughout their lives into a pension fund.  The reality was the average age of death was 48 years in Germany at the time.  That was accounted for by a high rate of child mortality, maternal mortality, a topic which, sadly, has become a major issue for us again, and people dying younger from diseases such as tuberculosis.  They also died from poor nutrition and in wars.  If they were still alive at 65 years and reached retirement, on average, they lived for another three years.  The average person who retires in Ireland today is likely to live for between 20 and 25 more years.  The proportion of one's life that one spends as a contributor as opposed to a withdrawer from the social welfare system has been incredibly and vastly distorted.<\/p><p>This is critically important legislation which presents us with an opportunity to light a light in other parts of the world.  As Senator Mary White said, no one will deny the right to retirement.  People should have that right and I suspect many will exercise it, while others will not.  It should not, therefore, be imposed on them.  I urge support all round for this forward-thinking legislation.  I commend my young colleague, Senator Mary White, for advancing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100037#LL00900","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353513900,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Mary White for bringing forward the Bill and her kind remarks.  I also thank Senator John Crown for his contribution and assure him I have been in age denial for at least 20 years.  I do not care what he says; as far as  I am concerned, I am still 39 and intend to retain this mental approach.  I have a great deal of sympathy on this issue and would like to emphasise my continued commitment and that of the Government to promoting good employment and equality practices by all employers in Ireland.  I appreciate Senator Mary White's initiative and intentions in bringing forward the Bill for discussion in this important debate and share her concern that we facilitate the active participation of older workers in the labour market in a manner that benefits society as a whole.  It is right on an individual level.  We live in a different era in which we have a healthier society, as Senator John Crown correctly said, and people enjoy greater longevity.  Many in their 60s and 70s have the alacrity and mental capacity to make a continuing and substantial contribution to their lives and those of others and to remain in the workforce and be innovative.   We must address these issues.  I am not sure what Senator Mary White has against 80 year old pilots, but I came across someone in the United States who, in his 83rd year, was still piloting a private aeroplane.  He does it for his own enjoyment but with great aplomb and expertise.  He could not be remotely described as frail.<\/p><p>I have listened carefully to the points made.  It is clear to us all that this is a complex issue which involves many aspects of the employment relationship and the relationships between workers and employers with the State.  What is not clear, however, is how this is solely an issue of age discrimination.  As Minister, my specific remit in this issue is promoting equality of opportunity and combating discrimination against individuals in employment on the grounds of age.  Much of this debate, however, rightly revolves around sustainable pensions policy and policies on access to work and retirement.  Senator Mary White correctly made reference to both the public and private sectors.  Individuals in the public sector welcome the fact that they have reached retirement age because it gives them the opportunity to engage actively in the private sector with the security of the pension they have earned as a financial backdrop.  In the private sector people often enter into contractual relationships in their employment which specify a particular age by which they must retire.  We have to be legally careful about how we deal with those in circumstances where there are contractual arrangements with which the State cannot arbitrarily interfere.<\/p><p>In addition to the anti-discrimination legislation Senator Mary White has highlighted in her Bill, the matter of encouraging and facilitating longer working lives also involves fundamental aspects of pensions policy and State pension reform, public sector employment and pensions, workplace relations, workforce activation and lifelong learning and national active ageing policy.<\/p> <p>This debate is not one limited to these shores; it is a live issue in every state in the European Union.  Senators will be aware of the EU Commission's White Paper on pensions, published last February under the title An Agenda for Adequate, Safe and Sustainable Pensions.  A stated goal under this agenda is the support of longer working lives.  The Commission also proposes to consult the social partners at EU level in regard to the general issue of mandatory retirement ages in collective agreements.<\/p><p>Ensuring the effective right of citizens, free from discrimination, to contribute to the economic, social and cultural life of the nation is high on the Government's agenda.  We have set challenging targets in this area but are preparing to meet them head on.  The Oireachtas has already ensured that there are substantial protections in law for older workers that can be enforced.  It is important to emphasise that.  The Equality Act 2004 removed the original upper age limit of 65 years for bringing complaints of age discrimination under the Employment Equality Act 1998.<\/p><p>In general, the employment rights legislation administered by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation does not contain an upper age limit.  In particular, there is no legislation in place imposing a particular retirement age in the private sector.  As I stated, this is frequently a contractual position of individuals in employment but it is not required by legislation.  The upper age limit for bringing claims under the unfair dismissals Acts of 1977 to 2007 was removed by a provision in the Equality Act 2004.  The effect of that amendment was that a person aged over 66, when dismissed, may now take a case under the unfair dismissals Acts unless he or she has already reached the &quot;normal retiring age for employees of the same employer in similar employment&quot;, if one exists.  Of course, apart from being included in a contract of employment between an employer and employee, the &quot;normal&quot; retirement age may be a matter of custom and practice that has developed in a particular sector or workplace.  <\/p><p>I have concerns about the concept of a &quot;normal retiring age&quot;.  It is a very amorphous concept in the context of employment.  What might have become by custom a normal retiring age in a particular area of employment and what might have been normal 20 years ago may justifiably be regarded as abnormal today in the context of the substantial improvements to people's health and a broad range of other reasons.  I refer not only to the assistance provided through our health service and the health checks that so many people get which offset potential health difficulties, but also to the increased standard of living that a great many people enjoy, even in a time of austerity.<\/p><p>The upper age limit of 66 years for receipt of statutory redundancy payments was removed by the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Act 2007, which is very recent legislation.  There is now a range of mechanisms and protections for older people if an employer simply decides to terminate the employment of an individual on grounds of age.  The difficulty arises where there are contractual arrangements and public service regulatory provisions that apply and which specify retirement age limits.<\/p><p>The Government is also ensuring that access to and enforcement of the rights I have described is made easier.  As Senators will be aware, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, is engaged in streamlining what is currently a very complex infrastructure for asserting employment rights and for seeking redress in cases of discrimination, to form a coherent and customer-focused workplace relations service.<\/p><p>A key component of the programme for Government in regard to older people is the reform of the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage and better risk sharing, and to provide for greater flexibility for those who wish to retire on a phased basis.  Work in this area is being led by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  Her Department has convened an interdepartmental working and retirement group to examine the issues related to longer working and the cross-departmental policies to support it.  This group will shortly be consulting with stakeholders to enable the representatives of the various Departments, social partners and other interest groups to engage and consider the issues involved.<\/p><p>It is my view and that of my colleagues in Government that this complex area requires a coherent and co-ordinated approach and that legislating for piecemeal change in one area, as proposed in this Bill, is ill-advised.  For that reason alone, I consider the Bill premature.  However, I regard this debate to be of great value and importance.  I thank Senator White for introducing the Bill.<\/p><p>I have a few brief comments concerning the specific provisions of the Bill.  Two amendments are proposed to the employment equality Acts, the first relating to retirement provisions for over-65s and the second abolishing any upper age limit on recruitment.  On the first point, the existing protections under the Acts for employees against arbitrary or discriminatory dismissal on reaching a set mandatory retirement age are, in fact, stronger than Senator White's Bill would suggest.  The Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2011 give effect in national law to the framework employment directive, Directive No. 2000\/78\/EC, which prohibits work-related discrimination on various grounds, including age.  The European Court of Justice may provide guidance on the approach to be adopted by national courts in considering national and EU legislation.  It has done so in its rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning this directive, and clarified that mandatory retirement ages must be set down within the context of national law and be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim, with the means of achieving that aim being both appropriate and necessary.  The court has considered ensuring the dignity of older workers and the promotion of inter-generational fairness to be among the legitimate aims of such measures.<\/p><p>In circumstances where ambiguity arises, the Equality Tribunal, Labour Court and courts are obliged, where possible, to construe national legislation in the light of the obligation under applicable EU law, which includes judgments delivered by the Court of Justice of the European Union.<\/p><p>It is clear from recent decisions of the Equality Tribunal and of the courts that they have experienced no difficulty to date in applying the guidance provided by the Court of Justice of the European Union in its rulings to the Irish cases before them concerning retirement age.  For example, in a 2008 decision in the Donnellan case, the High Court considered the justifications for and overall aim of the compulsory retirement age for assistant commissioners within An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  In that case, the applicant or plaintiff was unsuccessful but he was not unsuccessful simply by virtue of the fact that he reached a particular age.  The judgment considered the background justifications and why it was considered appropriate to have a specific retirement age within the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na in the context of the evidence heard.  These decisions indicate that Irish employers, while they may set a retirement age for their workers, must be prepared to justify their choice to the objective standard set by the Court of Justice of the European Union.  This is not an unusual set of circumstances in a common-law jurisdiction such as ours, where the applicable law is sourced not only in the text of legislation but also in the precedents created by previous court decisions.<\/p><p>Senator White proposes to eliminate completely the right of employers, whether in the private sector or in the public sector, to set an upper age limit for the recruitment of workers.  While I understand her concern that older people should not face barriers to employment which are not shared by younger jobseekers.  I must highlight that this specific amendment has other, quite serious and unwelcome consequences.<\/p><p>The Court of Justice of the European Union has considered the appropriateness of upper age limits in recruitment in a number of cases and determined that, in principle, such limits are capable of being justified.  Senator White gave an example of an 80-year-old pilot.  Upper age limits on recruitment are operationally necessary in some instances.  For example, in essential and physically demanding emergency services, such as fire fighting and policing, professions which require significant investment in training, such provisions allow for flexibility in recruitment so as to ensure a reasonable period of effective service from workers before retirement, and the long-term viability of the service.  The employment equality Acts already set very strict bounds on the situations to which such age limits apply.  Further detailed consideration of the matter is required before making a case for further safeguards for the employment of older workers, such as removing the upper limit on recruitment.  As I explained, the issues involved in encouraging longer working lives raised by this Bill are among those to be considered by the interdepartmental working and retirement group convened by the Minister for Social Protection.  Advocating at this point any particular remedial measure, such as proposed in this Bill, is premature.  For this reason, the Government cannot support the Bill.  However, this is a genuinely important issue.  It affects thousands of people throughout the country and it will affect many more.<\/p> <p>Indeed, I should offer a declaration of interest based on Senator Crown's contribution and point out that, at some stage in the future, it could affect me.  All of us hope to benefit from the longevity which would result in this being relevant to our lives.<\/p><p>This is a very useful and valuable debate.  I want to apologise to the Senator because, due to other commitments, I cannot stay for the entirety of the debate.  However, I will certainly follow the transcript with interest and, as I noted, my colleagues in government are undertaking work in this area and will be very interested in what is said in the House this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100038#MM00200","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353515100,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for staying for part of the Bill and for delivering his speech.

I was very impressed with my speech but, afterwards, P\u00e1draig Faulkner, who was a very senior Fianna F\u00e1il politician, came down to me and said, \"That is not Fianna F\u00e1il policy\".

Of course, Senator White's proposal speaks for itself and it has to be seriously considered into the future.<\/p><p>The statue of Charles Stewart Parnell in O'Connell Street quotes him as saying no man should put a halt to the march of a nation.  What right do any of us have, politically speaking, to put a halt to the working life of a man or a woman who wants to work beyond the age of 65?  Society has evolved so much, and work-life balance has changed so much, that we must respond in a meaningful fashion.  We have all heard the very sad stories of people whose lives, physically as well as mentally, almost end when they reach so-called pension age, when a person goes from being a valuable contributor to society to being simply described as a pensioner.<\/p><p>Senator White mentioned the inconvenient fact that we, the politicians, have no retirement age - across the globe, one can point to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl or Ronald Reagan.  Those three gentlemen, among others, were working to rid the world of the scourge of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union when they were all of pension age or beyond.  What is good enough for politicians, sports stars and television personalities may just be good enough for the so-called ordinary man and woman.<\/p> <p>We must keep our minds open to this type of proposal.  The trade unions must also be open to thinking afresh and realise it is not the aspiration of every worker to reach 65 years of age and claim old age and work pensions.  Many see possibilities beyond that deadline.  I hope we will find, from a parliamentary perspective, a facility to keep this item on the agenda because as a society we have changed so much, including in term of life expectancy.  Fortunately, everything is changing in a favourable way and we must think along these lines.<\/p><p>An argument being made about jobs  - in fairness, not by the Minister - is that the old person must resign or retire in order that a young person can get the job.  That is the politics and economics of musical chairs.  The argument is that there can be only so many jobs and the economy can only be so large; therefore, one person must go in order that another can take the job.  I am not trying to get rid of the Minister just yet.  Let us think a little beyond that towards a society where we can aspire to create the extra job for the young person without the older person being pushed out the door.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Mary White for bringing this interesting and thought-provoking Bill before the Seanad.  She has heard what the Minister said and probably knows what will happen to the Bill now from a parliamentary perspective.  Like her colleague, Senator Terry Leyden, I hope she will park the matter today.  I certainly would feel very embarrassed if I had to vote against her proposal.  This goes back to the notion of new and old politics.  What a joke it is that we have to vote &quot;No&quot; to a proposal to which we want to vote &quot;Yes&quot;.  I ask Senator Mary White not to include me in that regard.  I hope we will keep the issue actively on the agenda, in conjunction with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  I also hope we will reach a stage in society where we will not call a halt to the march of 65 year old men and women who have an enormous amount to offer our society and the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100040#OO01600","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353515700,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I congratulate Senator Mary White who has opened a discussion of the kind we do not have as often as we should.  When I first came to the House, almost 20 years ago, within a few weeks the then Minister, Mrs. Mary O'Rourke, had introduced an unfair dismissals Bill.  For a number of months beforehand she had raised the subject with trade unions and employers to discover what they would regard as an unfair dismissal.  They provided a number of instances, for example, that it would be unfair to dismiss a person because he or she was a Traveller or had a particular sexual orientation.  I tabled an amendment to the Bill proposing that age be regarded as such a ground.  At the time I was not thinking of the age of 65 years.  However, I knew of a hotel where one of the board members had said to the manager, \"Would you get rid of that aul wan in Reception and put a bright young attractive woman behind the counter?\"  The manager pointed out that the woman in question was very good but was told by the board member that he wanted to walk in and see a bright attractive young woman.  I do not know what age the woman was, but the manager refused to act against her.  That was the reason I introduced the amendment which the Minister was able to accept because in her view the issue was very easy to define.  If one is born on a certain day, one has a birth certificate to that effect.<\/p><p>Our policy in Superquinn was to say &quot;goodbye&quot; when staff reached 65 years, congratulate and tell them we would love to think they would return, even if it was not every day or for the entire working day.  We told them we did not want to lose their experience and talent or the example they could set for new, younger staff.  That was always our policy, of which many did not avail but many did.  I think of one person, Betty O'Reilly, whom I meet regularly and whose 80th birthday celebration I attended five years ago.   She works a few days a week in the bakery in our Sutton branch and just loves coming to work.  She is energetic and sets an example for younger staff.  I was delighted to be in Superquinn in Blackrock last Friday.  There has been a major renovation project and I had not visited the store for some time.  The first man I met was John Hammond, a butcher, who told me that when he had reached at the age of 65 years, I had shaken hands with him and presented him with a token in recognition of the years he had worked with us.  He is now 76 years old and still comes to work.  I do not think he comes every day, but he comes on a regular basis, which he values.  Every year he asks the manager if he is still wanted and told that he is because of his energy, enthusiasm, effort and the example he sets for others.  I offer these stories because the benefit is not only to the employee but also to the employer.  The State will lose a great deal if we continue with the policy of compulsory retirement at the age of 65 years.  It would be a real error and I would hate that to happen.<\/p><p>Having mentioned two Superquinn employees, I will mention Aidan Brogan who works in our Sutton branch and tells me he is 78 years old.  It is a joy to see people like him still working.  I am enthusiastic about the concept and also about what Senator Mary White has proposed.  If there is a danger the Government might turn it down, I hope the debate will be adjourned without a vote.  What Senator Paul Bradford observed is correct.  A great number of Members are not only sympathetic to the motion, they also actively recognise the benefit of taking such steps.  I would like to think this would happen and I am confident that something of this nature will happen in the very near future when we recognise that we should not be obliged to dismiss people.<\/p><p>I have found many examples throughout the world.  A couple of years ago my wife and I missed a flight in Pittsburgh.  We went to a restaurant for something to eat.  As I was hungry, I cleaned my plate.  The lady who had served us said, &quot;I see you are part of the clean plate brigade.&quot;  I asked her what that meant and she asked me if I remembered that during the war children were told to clean their plate because people were starving in Europe.  She was talking about the Second World War; she was more than 80 years of age and running the restaurant.  It is that talent, skill and ability we must not lose.  I would hate to think we are merely helping people to work.  We are also helping employers and the younger employees who learn from them.  It would be a shame to lose all of these benefits and I hope we will not.<\/p><p>Last year we lost my mother-in-law in her 102nd year.  When President McAleese attended the House about three years ago, I told her that we were coming up to my mother-in-law's 100th birthday and that she was looking forward to receiving a letter from her.  The President asked me if I knew what she would receive.  I do not know if the Members present know how much a person receives on his or her 100th birthday.  The President had spoken to the Minister of the day in 2000 and pointed out that the tradition of giving \u00a3100 had been followed since the time of Queen Victoria.  I believe it was Bismarck who introduced the old age pension in 1904.  The President asked the then Minister who I understand was Charlie McCreevy if he would consider raising the amount.  She had intended to suggest a figure of \u00a3500, but decided to aim for \u00a31,000.  He made the sum \u00a32,000.  Therefore, my mother-in-law received a cheque for \u20ac2,540.  I say this in praise of President McAleese.  On my mother-in-law's 101st birthday, she received another letter and a token - a shield or a medal.  I received a letter halfway through last year asking how my mother-in-law was, but I had to reply that she had died in her 102nd year.  President McAleese recognised the value of age, with the result that recipients - I believe I am the oldest Member of the House - will continue to receive a letter every year after their 100th birthday.  <\/p><p>I realise I am not on-topic, for which I apologise.  There is huge value in appreciating the skills, ability and talent of older people, as well as in the way they can pass on these qualities to the next generation.  It is a win not only for the person who has reached the age of 65 years but also for the employer, be it the State or an entrepreneurial business.  I congratulate Senator Mary White on introducing the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100041#PP00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1353516300,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  As a young person I would like to be part of the debate.  I join others in saying, &quot;well done&quot; to Senator Mary White for bringing the matter to the House.  As Senator Bradford has said it is not a matter of politics, our age affects all of us.  As Senator Quinn has said we all had a birthday, we all have a birth certificate and we know where it is heading.  The generosity of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, is something we can embrace and we all understand this is a debate to which we are contributing.  The spirit of the Bill is welcome.  We are talking about the right to retire, the right age at which to retire, the growing aging population and that the considerable number of people who have already expressed an interest or a desire to work beyond the retirement age of 65 is quite high.   It remains to be seen how many people on reaching the age of 65 years might still hold that view.   Obviously there is much for us to discuss in this area.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the work being done by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, with the interdepartmental working in retirement group.  She is looking across all the Departments that are intertwined, Departments of Social Protection, Health, Jobs. Enterprise and Innovation, Public Expenditure and Reform, Justice and Equality and Education and Skills.  The coming together of so many Departments is evidence of the complexity of the issue.  The group is set to consult with all the relative stakeholders and all those who have a say in the matter.  On the face of it, it may appear relatively easy to legislate and change the rules.  I like the sound of that.  It appears as if we are doing something, that we are responding and ironing out rules we have inherited from an earlier time; I had not realised it was from Bismarck which is a long time ago.  In essence, we must not be fooled by the sound of it.  As legislators we are heading for the substance with the interdepartmental group.   As we are engaged with it I hope we will wait for the interdepartmental group to report.  However, the Minister has said he will take on board the contributions made in the House.  <\/p><p>  I have three notes of caution to sound in this area.  When we start to change the retirement age, it will inevitably change our culture and our attitude to work in general.  We know, for example, that the American work ethic is a very powerful one and the people there tend to work more days and longer days than in Europe.  It is part of the culture to work hard.  If we go down this route and push out the retirement age to 67 or 68, will people feel obliged to work?  It will change the culture and that is something we need to think about.  Ill health is a rising issue with increased age.  The 2005 CSO figures show that more than 51% of people over the age of 65 years reported a chronic illness or disability.  Senator White made the point that she hopes people who are in ill health will not continue to work.   However, some people may feel the pressure to work in a changed culture.  If their chronic illness is at a particular stage it may exacerbate their health in the longer term and that is not acceptable.  Some of those people who have said they want to stay on until they are 65 years of age may be the knowledge workers for whom their career and their job is one that interests and stimulates them.  For those for whom work is more of a chore or is physically difficult would they share that same view about retiring at a later age?  <\/p><p>  Senator Bradford and others mentioned the issue of jobs for younger people.  Youth unemployment is a very serious concern across not just Ireland but Europe, the US and the world.  Therefore, any discussion about changing the retirement age here would have to take that into account.  The European Court of Justice referred to this particular point in Torsten Hornfeldt <i>v <\/i> Posten Meddelande AB in July and stated specifically that encouragement of recruitment undoubtedly constitutes a legitimate aim of member states' social and employment policy in particular when the promotion of access of young people to a profession is involved.  The court said that the retirement age must be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim.  The Bill does not quite strike the balance that is at stake in respect of young people and the labour market.  In time that can and will be teased out in debates in this and the other House and with the interdepartmental group.<\/p><p>  The third reason is that from much research we know that the disadvantaged who live on a low income have a shorter life expectancy.  The HSE said in 2008 that despite the rise in prosperity and overall improvements in the health of the Irish population, rates of mortality and morbidity are consistently higher for lower socioeconomic groups.  Barnardos said the link between poverty and ill health was clear.  The Institute of Public Health research estimates that around 6,000 premature deaths are due to poverty and inequality in Ireland.  The reason that is relevant is that every increase in the pension age essentially redistributes money from poor pensioners with a shorter life expectancy to those from professional backgrounds who live longer.  If one retires later and lives only to 75 years, one has less time to live on one's pension.  I do not think that is an intended consequence of the Senator's Bill.  We must ensure in the legislation that cannot be an unintended consequence.  We already know from the UK that the average age for those who die earlier is 79 years and an additional 17 years is estimated for those who have a relatively healthy life and who have had a higher income.  That is a considerable number of years. <\/p><p>  We  will have a broad and reasonable discussion on the issue.  I welcome the Minister's intervention on the matter and I look forward to being part of the discussion because it will affect all of us at some point or another. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100042#QQ00100","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1353516300,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I congratulate Senator White on bringing the Bill forward.  From what we know of the Senator, she has a habit of doing things like this.  She finds an issue that is logical and credible but which has remained dormant and she brings it forward for debate and, suddenly, we are all energised about it because we see the significance of what she is trying to achieve.  In her case, it has been in gestation for some time.  It is not a knee-jerk reaction.  She has done much research on the subject and has published a report on ageism, therefore I see this as an extension of work she has already done.  I am sure from the research and analysis she has done that she sees a particular glitch that needs to be examined.  It was evident from the Minister's response that the issue was not far from his attention and that he could see the need for it.  This is in the context of a simple human right, where a particular restrictive code is put on one section of society but there could be several other areas where the same restrictions were not applied.  It was evident that the Minister could see that.  He was right in saying that it is a very complex area.  The complexity of the issue has to be dealt with in the context of a partnership between the young and those who are not so young.<\/p><p>When people of a certain age speak, there is a vested interest if one is reaching a certain age.  For those who have not reached that age yet, it is interesting that when one does reach it and people are discussing ageism, one looks around and wonders about whom they are speaking, because it does not hit one in that way.  We should bear that in mind.  It has to be a partnership between young people and older people.  It is interesting to note that people of an older age always encourage young people to do things, whether in organisations or communities.  How often does somebody stand up and say a young person is needed?  We must hear that from the other side as well.  It is not the fault of young people, they have not reached that particular attitude as yet but it would be helpful to the debate if we expanded into that area where young people also see the aspect of wisdom and so on.<\/p> <p>In the past in Germany, grandparents were close to the family unit and many lived with their children and grandchildren.  This began to disappear, however, when people put grandparents into care homes.  After several generations, research showed grandchildren had lost out in the important experience of growing up with a grandparent, gaining wisdom and so on.  We must keep this in mind when we consider this legislation.<\/p><p>One problem with this type of legislation is that we start weighing up its effects.  For example, if this happens, then people say X number more young people will not get jobs.  As has been pointed out already, when the marriage bar for women in the Civil Service was removed, a similar effect did not occur.  Years ago, we would not believe people with a physical handicap could be in a normal workplace.  Now, there is no issue with it.  It took someone to pioneer this and it is now seen as a plus rather than a minus.  It does not automatically follow that if one allows people to stay at work after 65, then everyone will do so.  A friend of mine who worked in the public service as a nurse was due for retirement.  On the day he was retiring, he telephoned me at various points to say, \u201cTwo hours to go\u201d, \u201cOne hour to go\u201d and finally, \u201cI am free\u201d.  In his case, he wanted to be with his grandchildren.  However, in the case of those who want to remain on in work, it might follow their experience and wisdom might create jobs rather than the opposite.<\/p><p>The expertise that is leaving the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na is a matter of concern.  Senior people are leaving the force when we are challenged by crime.  The only way this can be handled is by allowing people to continue in work after 65.  We should also remember that there is an attitude of mind.  I remember the story of the television crew interviewing a man about his lifestyle.  The man used two sticks, his back was bent over, his voice shaky and he was hard of hearing.  The interviewer explained they just wanted to ask a few questions as to how the man attributed his age to what happened in the past.  When asked did he drink whiskey, the man replied he did, even for breakfast.  When asked did he smoke, he replied he always smoked.  When asked did he diet, he said he ate anything that came his way.  Finally, when asked what age he was, he replied he was 29.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100042#QQ00200","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353516900,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Young in mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100043#RR00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1353516900,"counter":219,"content":"<p>The attitude that goes with age can be like that.

She has done the Seanad a great service by doing so and has stimulated an interesting debate on the subject.  I was encouraged by the Minister's response to the legislation.  While he will not accept it in its current format, he gave the indication that he is open to looking favourably on it in the future when further debate had taken place.  I was impressed with the case made by Senator Crown regarding the contribution that could be made by prominent medics after they reach 65 rather than the loss of their experience to the health services due to compulsory retirement.<\/p><p>Many are delighted to retire when they reach 65.  Others would like the option to stay on in work which is what Senator White is trying to achieve.  This legislation is also opening up a greater debate on the retirement age.  There are varying ages at which people can retire across the public service.  For example, a garda can retire at 57.  Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa raised the matter of the loss of experience in the Garda.  I have been informed that in one of the major Garda divisions in Dublin, the officer with the most experience has only seven years' service.  It is crazy, particularly considering our public finances, that we allow people to retire at such an early age.  I recall the Minister had to bring the retirement age to 62 in the case of the current Commissioner.  I cannot see why he cannot continue on in his role until he reaches 65 or even beyond.  Psychiatric nurses can also retire when they reach 57 on pretty good pensions.  In my opinion, they could contribute positively to the health services for many more years.  As well as allowing people to work beyond 65, we need to look at those who can retire at an earlier age.<\/p><p>Doctors can work in the GMS up to the age of 70 and can continue in private practice up to 80, provided they have a fitness to practise certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100043#RR00400","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1353516900,"counter":221,"content":"<p>They cannot treat public patients, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100043#RR00500","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1353516900,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Yes, it is another anomaly in the retirement rules.  Many people will want to work beyond the age of 65 because of the significant deficit in public and private pensions.  The whole loss of experience in the public and private sector makes the case for allowing people to work beyond 65.  Another reason to allow it is because people are living longer.  It has been pointed out that many people want to pursue other activities when they retire.  Many of them make fantastic contributions to business, local communities and charitable causes.<\/p> <p>Many of them decide to go overseas and work with some of the NGOs.  Against what Senator White is trying to achieve is the whole issue of opening up opportunities for our young people.  Some may agree and some may disagree.  A poll was carried out by <i>Journal.ie<\/i>on Senator White's proposal.  Some 49% were against it, 25% were for it and 24% were in the &quot;don't know&quot; category.  The jury is out on it but the whole pensions area and the issue of retirement age require further discussion.  Following our deliberations this evening, I hope the Bill will remain on the books and that there will be further opportunities to tease out the matter.  I welcome the work of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, with the interdepartmental group.  This is the way to go and all Departments should be involved.  I hope that in years to come people will be able to work beyond the age of 65 if they so wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100043#RR00600","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353517500,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and the spirit in which the House has approached it.  This is when the Seanad is at its best.  One wonders what the view will be when the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, is next discussing with Niall O'Dowd what it would have been like in Ireland if Ian Paisley had retired at 65.  We only saw the best of him afterwards when there was peace on the island.  The later retirement age for the Reverend Ian Paisley was of great benefit to everyone on the island and great credit is due to everyone who facilitated that process.  I would hate to think what he would have been like if he had retired at 65 with the work undone.<\/p><p>I recall Frank O'Reilly and Mr. Justice Henry Barron adjudicating on student cases in Trinity College Dublin.  Both were 75 years of age when they visited the college but no one ever said they had lost the run of themselves.  The very old and the very young have a good deal in common: the enemy group in the middle.  The old and young get on well together and it can be a stimulating relationship.  The current target is for 70% of people to go on to third level education, and if they live until 80 years of age instead of three score and ten, there will be a considerable cost.  Part of this can be alleviated by allowing those who wish to stay on to do so, so that they can continue to contribute.  Part of the IMF programme here is to raise the retirement age.  The retired bankers are certainly convinced that the Government would be \u20ac64 billion better off if they were still running the banks.  After they were compulsorily retired, a far lesser breed took over and bankrupted themselves and the country.  I recall some people coming to Trinity College in their 90s, including A. A. Luce.  Alfred Kahn, the leading airline deregulator in the Unites States, was still fulminating against airline cartels when he was 88 years of age.  Lawyers mature with age, as do general practitioners and people working in shops.<\/p><p>There will be a different job for human resource departments to do in future, but that is a good thing.  It is about time human resources departments did something useful in all aspects instead of waffling, which is what I usually identify them as doing.  The culture of work could change and we could see it as a joint effort between generations.<\/p><p>The Minister for Justice and Equality referred to the Donnellan case.  I thought that was a bizarre judgment on policing.  There are young policemen running around after criminals, using all of the intelligence available.  As per normal, I presume the judge who gave the judgment for early retirement was older than the policeman in question.<\/p><p>Would such a provision interfere with the rights of employers?  Yes, it probably would, but we have been doing that anyway.  One cannot sent children down coalmines or up chimneys or tell married women to retire.  I do not mind at all if we interfere with the rights of employers.  They should cultivate better relationships with their employees and, as Senator Quinn noted, appreciate the good ones.<\/p><p>The Court of Justice of the European Union may provide guidance on the approach to be adopted by national courts in considering national and EU legislation.  The alternative is for judges to tell us to legislate.  Everyone in the House will do so when this Bill gets going but we can also tell the judges how we want policy to be.  It seems the whole drift of this discussion is towards inclusiveness, a goal of the President, and a more flexible labour market for those who want to work.<\/p><p>I have seen people almost disintegrate upon their so-called retirement.  Unintentionally, one may have wished Tom all the best in his few remaining years and only then did poor Tom begin to shake because he realised that he was about to be put on the scrap heap.   We must ensure we do not do this to people.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, and the Minister for Justice and Equality.

I support the broad thrust of the Bill and I commend her constructive contribution to the House.  It goes to show the value of this House and I hope this will be taken on board by everyone.  I have read Senator White's policy paper, into which she put a great deal of work and research, and I commend her on it.  She has introduced this Bill with her homework done.<\/p><p>  We meet people every day who are affected by this and we come across cases of inequality.  I know of one man who was in great shape.  He was healthy, happy, active, intelligent and a valued colleague in the workplace.  He was happily working away until one week before his 65th birthday, when he was called in by the boss and told that he would be finishing the following week.  It came to him as a bolt out of the blue.  He never foresaw it and it affected him in the long term.  When he retired he no longer felt he was making a contribution and he went into a state of depression.  Early retirement may not be good for some people's health; it may have the opposite effect.  On the flip side, I know a man in Killarney, now in his 70s, whose wife is begging him to give up work, but he blankly refuses to do so because he loves his work.  This is stressing her out.  There is a flip side to everything.  However, I believe choice was taken away from the man to whom I referred earlier.  Choice is a fundamental right, but it was taken from him.  He did not have the choice to continue working.<\/p><p>  Let us consider the quality of our public representatives.  I believe they are of the highest standard.  Many of them have worked and been elected well beyond their 66th birthdays.  We need only consider our President, Michael D. Higgins.  Those who have been in the Houses for some time will remember another great man, the late Michael Moynihan, from my constituency, Kerry South.  He was one of the best and most decent politicians that ever stepped over the threshold of Leinster House.  He worked well into his golden years and made a great contribution to Kerry South and to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I wonder how these men would have felt had they been told they could not come here because they were over 65.  It would have come as a terrible blow to them.  Thankfully, that did not happen and they made a great contribution here.<\/p><p>  This debate brings to mind the words of a song.  I am unsure whether those here know it, but it is about a Belfast mill as it was closing down:<blockquote>I'm too old to work and I'm too young to die,<br \/>Tell me where will I go, my family and I.<\/blockquote>Senator White is here to try to change the words of that song to the effect that one is never too old to work.  I admire the work Senator White has put in.  It is terrible to be considered to be on the employment scrap heap at 65 years of age despite one's ability, experience and what one still has to offer society.<\/p> <p>I am glad that this Bill has been brought forward.  A similar inequality happened long ago with the marriage bar.  Women were denied a career, a livelihood and a responsible job simply because they got married.  How unjust was that?  This came back to bite them in the last budget when those women who went back to work after they had reared their families and had qualifying contributions could not get their full pension entitlements because of the gap in their employment.  Those women are now on a reduced pension but they should be awarded home-maker credits for the time spent at home because they were barred from working.  They wanted to work but were prevented from doing so.  I have written to the Equality Authority on this matter and will continue to pursue it.  It is also incumbent on the Government to engage on this issue.  <\/p><p> In the last budget the transitional State pension was abolished which means that people under contract to finish work at the age of 65 will be left without an income.  It is incumbent on us to put legislation in place which protects those people.  They should not be left without an income just because the Government moved the goalposts.  I am sure there are young graduates tuning in today to hear what we have to say who are thinking that if these people retire then they will get jobs but they must bear in mind that some day they may be faced with the same dilemma.  They will be old one day too.  Young people always think that these issues are way down the road but old age has a habit of creeping up on one.  I urge them to consider what older people have to offer society.  I wonder has any evaluation been done on the age profile of those who voted in the <i>Journal.ie <\/i>poll.  I suspect a lot of them were young people who are looking for jobs and I am pretty sure that those on the wrong side of 50 would have voted differently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100044#SS00300","speaker":"1132","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353518100,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I thank Senator White for bringing forward this important Bill which we will support, with some conditions.

This legislation also relates to choice and I wish to lay out the Sinn F\u00e9in position clearly, lest Government Ministers or parties misrepresent or misunderstand it.  I will set out our position so that there is absolute clarity about it and no misunderstanding whatsoever.<\/p><p>  I welcome the debate that is happening as a consequence of this Bill and I commend Senator White for introducing it.  Equality must be enshrined in our employment laws and that includes outlawing discrimination against older workers.  There are a number of issues that require further examination, however.  Older workers, like all workers, need protection and in no way should we tolerate the exploitation of older workers, including pressurising them to work beyond the accepted retirement age.  Workers who decide to work beyond the normal pension age should do so entirely voluntarily.  That is where the issue of choice comes in.  Some professions are more physically demanding than others and this should be taken into account.  Workers doing any job must be physically capable.  There is also a danger that by allowing some workers to work longer, the pension system becomes more skewed and other workers find themselves under pressure to worker longer to maintain the status <i>quo vis-\u00e0-vis<\/i>  their pension rights, which would not be a tolerable position.  Provided those issues can be resolved through proper maintenance and crucially, the provision of a sound pension scheme, there can be no objection to workers who choose to do so working beyond the normal retirement age, as a point of equality.  <\/p><p>  However, it is unacceptable to Sinn F\u00e9in to see an increase in the age eligibility for the State pension.  This is due to rise to 66 in 2014 under the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 and to rise further, incrementally, over time.  Workers who have put in the best part of a lifetime at work will find themselves having to work a year more than planned to receive a pension, which is unfair.  Workers struggled long and hard to get what rights they have and they should resist attempts to backtrack on those rights.  In addition, in raising the pension age to 66, this Government is potentially freezing out up to 10,000 young people from the labour market, at a time when youth unemployment is running at 30%.  This makes no sense.  The right to a pension has been a long-standing Irish Republican principle and even the Minister can claim it as part of his roots because it goes back to the Democratic Programme of 1919.  That promised to provide for &quot;the care of the Nation's aged and infirm, who shall not be regarded as a burden, but rather entitled to the Nation's gratitude and consideration.&quot;.  <\/p><p>  The change to the State pension age will have a worse effect on low-income people who have no occupational or private pensions or savings and who will have no choice but to continue working until a later age.  Wealthier people will still have the option to retire on their own private savings or pensions.  Lower income workers tend to be in more manual or blue-collar employment as we know, which takes a greater toll on the body, particularly in later life.  Some people's contracts are scheduled to conclude at the age of 65 but it is madness to expect these people to go on jobseeker's benefit at that stage in their lives.  That will happen and every politician will be lobbied on this issue when it happens.  Forcing older people to remain in employment means that there will be fewer jobs for young people and for those who are forced to emigrate.  It is not possible to make 50 year predictions on the ratio of pensioners to workers in terms of the State pension affordability.  There are simply too many volatile factors to consider, including levels of employment, migration, birth trends and economic growth.  The change to the pension eligibility age is utterly opposed by lobby groups for the elderly such as the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament, Older and Bolder, Age Action and also by trade unions, most notably, SIPTU.  According to the document &quot;Measured or Missed? Poverty and Deprivation among Older People in a Changing Ireland&quot; published by Older and Bolder in October last year, 84% of older people, aged 65 to 74, are in relative poverty before social transfers, that is, the State pension and associated benefits, are factored in.   <\/p><p>  I reiterate - so there is no misunderstanding of my party's position - that we are not in favour of increasing the retirement age from 65 to 66 or higher because it is not just but in situations where people do want to work longer and their decision is entirely voluntary, then of course that option should be open to them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100045#TT00600","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1353518100,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire go dt\u00ed an Teach.

He worked in a semi-State company for 33 years and he got a good offer.  He plans to continue working but he wanted to retire from his current job.  His departure will make room for a younger person to take over his job.  There are people who want to retire before they reach the age of 65 or 66 but others want to continue working.  Last Sunday I met a man who was 83 years of age and had just purchased a new car.  I asked him why he did not wait until the new year but he could not wait to get a car.  I suggested that it would be his last car but he pointed out that he hoped to go on a lot longer.  He asked me if there was an age limit beyond which one cannot get married and I told him I could not answer that question for him.  He has aspirations to get married and purchase another car.  One's age is simply an attitude of mind.<\/p><p>I hope Senator White perseveres with this Bill.  Age is honourable and I hope everyone who was here for this debate will reach the age of 100 and that whoever is President at that time will be presenting cheques for \u20ac4,000.

As someone who is driven more by policy than by anything else, she has done a lot of good in this and other areas.  It is timely that we are debating this Bill.  When the economic crisis first occurred there was a rush to increase the age of retirement in the public service.  Recent advances in medicine suggest that one in two girls born now will live to the age of 100.  It is also suggested that the girl who will live to the age of 150 has already been born.  We cannot identify the specific individual, of course, but longevity is increasing.  This change gives rise to a number of economic, social and health challenges.  Advances in medical science, and particularly in the area of DNA, will allow interventions at an early stage to anticipate serious medical issues that might arise in later years.<\/p><p>When people reach the age of 65 or more, they should have accumulated extensive experience and wisdom, although the latter does not always apply.  They are assets that should be put to use to benefit society as well as the individuals concerned. <\/p><p>We are debating this Bill in the context of the biggest economic downturn any of us has seen in our lifetimes.  It has affected everybody but the major casualties are in the 18 to 24 age bracket.  Across Europe, one third or more of young people are unemployed.  This is an affliction for the individuals concerned, their societies and the global economy.  We need to find ways of managing this challenge.  When people reach the age of 65, their energy levels are not what they were at the age of 30 and their productivity might have decreased.  One must consider issues relating to productivity as well as health.  Fundamentally, however, Senator White's Bill is correct in principle in terms of enabling individuals who have energy and vision to continue working.  The idea that one should work full-time until the age of 65 and then retire completely is not sensible.<\/p><p>This country has a tremendous record of volunteerism.  People across the country give up their time on a voluntary basis to enhance the opportunities and quality of life for others.  This area should be developed further so that people can be channelled into these organisations.  Women seem to be more adept than men at finding useful occupations and activities in later life.  In this regard I applaud the initiative by Senator McAleese and the GAA in regard to the conference they held on this issue several years ago.  The GAA has become actively involved in encouraging elderly men in communities across the country to interact with each other and become involved in social activities.  There are mental health benefits from such initiatives.<\/p><p>The Bill raises an interesting and important topic and I commend Senator White on introducing it.  I hope the Government will continue to develop this area so that we can provide opportunities to our citizens and utilise the talents and experience of people who still have an enormous contribution to make as their age increases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100046#UU00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1353518700,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I commend Senator White on bringing forward this Private Members' Bill, which allows us to debate the topic.

This was by no means an arbitrary choice because Bismarck new, as a result of the statistical evidence, that most people in his time died before reaching the age of 65 and, therefore, the state would be obliged to pay out very little money.

Most of those states have not, however, adopted either a more gradual or a more voluntary approach to retirement, particularly in respect of the public sector.  Many people who retire from the public sector proceed to play very active roles in the private sector.  This shows that they are quite capable of continuing to work.  As Senator Walsh stated, perhaps the Minister might consider adopting a gradual approach to retirement.  Many of those who retire from the private and public sectors find that they have too much time on their hands and this can give rise to their developing mental health issues.  The latter is due to the fact that for many people, their work is their life.  As the saying goes, those who enjoy their work never work a day in their lives.<\/p><p>We must consider taking a more modern approach to how people work and to retirement, particularly as arbitrary retirement can lead to serious problems for particular individuals.  There is also the huge loss of corporate knowledge to consider.  If a retiree is willing to work for a few days a week and give of his or her time, he or she could show the ropes to new employees such as newly-qualified graduates or whomever.  While this is done in some cultures and corporations, there is certainly no formal structure in place.  Such a structure should be introduced by the Government, which should lead by example.<\/p><p>As Senator White pointed out, there is a proud history of volunteerism and active citizenship in this country.  The cohort of those who are heading towards retirement must be encouraged to be active volunteers and to continue to contribute to their places of retirement when they have retired.<\/p><p>These are the possibilities which are contemplated within the Bill before the House.  If it so wishes, the Government could introduce amendments in order that a more modern approach to retirement might be taken in Ireland.  As Senator White has done, the Government could consider best practice in other European states to assist it in this regard.  The arbitrary approach to retirement first introduced by the Germans now goes unquestioned because everyone is used to it and that must change.  Senator White's previous policy documents on ageing highlighted many of the difficulties that arise when people are not given the opportunity to make decisions for themselves and are forced into retirement.<\/p><p>I commend Senator White and all other colleagues who contributed to the debate.  Regardless of whether the Minister accepts it, retirement is an issue for every one of us.

I look forward to hearing his comments on the plight of a constituent of mine in Dundalk.  The lady in question obtained a third level qualification in 2000.  Unfortunately, after working for several years she was made redundant and has been on jobseeker's allowance since then.  Commendably, she decided that rather than sit at home and do nothing she would go back to college to pursue a further education course.  She applied for a course but was refused the back to education allowance because the qualification she holds at present is higher than the course for which she had applied in Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT, in September.  I understand the reasons for the decision and that is not in question.  However, she was also refused the student grant from SUSI.  The decision is under appeal at the moment.  As a result, the lady concerned has had to leave the course she started in September with high hopes.  She has been forced to leave the course and return to the dole queue as she has no other income.  I commend the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, on the work she is doing with JobBridge in the area but I also understand the situation the person in question is in at present.  She wishes to improve her education and increase her job prospects but the system does not seem to allow for that.<\/p><p>Currently, people are thankfully more aware of mental health issues.  It is important that we take the mental health issues of such people into consideration.  This lady wants to work.  She wants to improve her education and is totally despondent at having no other option but to go back on the dole.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State could pass on my concerns to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, and ask for a review in situations such as this to ensure that people wishing to return to education, even if the qualification is lower than the one they already hold, are entitled to supports to ensure that they can improve their education.  This lady is being penalised for being too highly qualified in the first place.  If she had no third level qualification she would have qualified for the back to education allowance.  I understand that if the qualification one holds is higher than the current course then one does not qualify for the allowance, but the system should provide for assistance in such cases because of the many people in a similar situation to the case I have outlined who want to come off the dole queue and improve themselves in order to get a job.  I accept there are systems in place but we must examine the situation outlined whereby this person applied for a course and began to attend a college but was forced to leave it and go back on the dole queue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100048#XX00200","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1353519900,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Moran for raising this issue.  The Department of Social Protection has estimated expenditure of more than \u20ac960 million on employment supports in 2012.  This substantial expenditure, which is against a backdrop of significant fiscal consolidation, underlines the Government's commitment to enhancing support for activation and assisting people return to employment.  As outlined in Pathways to Work, the Department will offer job placements, work experience, training and education initiatives to 85,650 people in 2012.<\/p><p>Included in the supports available is the back to education allowance, BTEA, scheme which is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education.  A person wishing to pursue BTEA will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full-time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others.  The BTEA scheme covers a large range of full-time courses of education in approved colleges spanning basic foundation courses to third level courses across all disciplines.<\/p><p>As the Senator outlined, the Department received an application for the back to education allowance from the person in question.  The application was refused on the grounds that the course did not lead to a higher qualification on the national framework of qualifications than that already held.  The person concerned was notified in writing of the reason that she did not so qualify.  The BTEA guidelines are in the main in line with the mechanisms in place for student support-type schemes administered by the Department of Education and Skills.  Progression in education is a condition which is not unique to BTEA, indeed State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one.  That is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur, in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level.<\/p><p>Resources allocated and numbers supported via BTEA have increased steadily in recent years.  It is estimated that more than \u20ac200 million will be spent on BTEA in 2012, compared with the position in 2008, for example, when just over \u20ac77 million was spent on the scheme.  Some 25,700 participants were supported in the 2011-12 academic year which represents a significant 120% increase compared to the 2008-09 academic year.  It is expected that numbers availing of the scheme for the current academic year will be similar to last year.<\/p><p>If a person wishes to pursue a part-time education course they may be able to do so while retaining their jobseeker's payment under the part-time education option, PTEO, of the back to education programme.  An example of courses that may be pursued under the PTEO are the 6,000 part-time higher education places for unemployed people made available under the Springboard initiative announced earlier this year by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn.  In addition, the Department also supports the provision of a wide variety of training through networks of private sector companies, in a range of sectors and regions, supported by Skillnets Limited via the PTEO.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that F\u00c1S, as the national training authority, anticipates the needs of, and responds to, a constantly changing labour market.  It strives to do this through the provision of tailored training programmes that suit various needs and access to many training programmes is not determined by a person's welfare status.  The Department is currently reviewing a wide range of activation supports available to DSP customers, including BTEA, and it is the intention to canvass the views of stakeholders as part of the implementation process resulting from the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100048#XX00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1353519900,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I am afraid that the response does not progress the query I have any further.

The current appeal process for SUSI, which I accept relates to a different Department, has meant she has had to drop out of college.  We should be trying to help people.

As the Senator is aware, a new medical card scheme for persons aged 70 years or over was introduced with effect from 1 January 2009.  Under this scheme, a person who is ordinarily resident in the State qualifies for a medical card so long as his or her gross income does not exceed the means test income limit.  The income limit for a single person is \u20ac700 per week.  The relevant income limit for a couple is \u20ac1,400 per week.<\/p><p>Under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, as amended, determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE.  The HSE has produced national assessment guidelines to provide a clear framework to assist the making of reasonable, consistent and equitable decisions when assessing an applicant.  These guidelines are publicly available and can be downloaded from the HSE's medical card website.<\/p><p>The standard procedure for the review of medical cards for persons aged 66 years or older is that their medical card will be reviewed every four years.  For persons under the age of 66 years, the period of validity of a medical card is three years.<\/p><p>In the interest of fairness between medical cardholders, it is important that all people aged 70 or over are treated in like manner by the HSE.  The HSE recently carried out an examination of its national medical card database.  It found that some medical cards have expiry periods of more than four years and, in some cases, ten years or more.  On foot of this examination, the HSE has identified about 7,000 medical cardholders throughout the country who have not been reviewed for ten years or more.  Consequently, the HSE has started to contact these individuals.  The HSE has sent review forms to approximately 1,500 people so far.  While this is part of a nationwide exercise, the HSE has indicated that the majority of the people to whom it has written thus far, live in the HSE's north-west region, which includes County Donegal.  The HSE will write to the remaining individuals over the coming weeks.  Those individuals who have not been reviewed for ten years are being asked to complete a full review.  However, the medical cards that they currently hold will not expire before January 2013 in order to give sufficient time for the forms to be completed.<\/p><p>Any medical cardholder undergoing a review for a renewed medical card, who genuinely engages with the HSE in that review, will not have his or her entitlement withdrawn before the review is complete, regardless of the expiry date shown on the medical card.  In cases where a decision is made not to grant a medical card, the applicant will be informed of the decision and notified of his or her right to appeal this decision.  Contact details for the appeals office are provided to the applicant with that decision.  Where a person submits an appeal to a decision not to renew a medical card within 21 days of that decision, he or she will retain the medical card until the appeal is decided.  In conclusion, all efforts are being made to deal with the individuals properly, fairly and impartially.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100049#YY00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1353520500,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the explanation.  I ask him to revert to me regarding the medical cards with the date of 2035 and the number of such cards which have been issued.  Were they issued as a result of a glitch in the system?  I know of a person with a medical card dated 2035.  The person concerned is eligible for a medical card.  I ask if the Minister of State's Department could issue a local notice about this matter in County Donegal or the north-west region.  The perception in Donegal was that the county was being targeted as this problem did not arise in other areas.  For example, people in Sligo did not have this problem.  I ask if the Minister of State could give some good news to people in Donegal before the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100049#YY00300","speaker":"1144"},{"type":"speech","time":1353520500,"counter":267,"content":"<p>It may be as much related to the assiduous manner in which the Senator conducts his business in respect of contacts being made in Donegal that these issues have been brought to our attention.  I will pursue the issue by way of supplementary inquiries.  I was not aware - and I do not think it was reflected in the Senator's original question although he makes the point now  - that some cards have been issued with that long period of validity and an expiry date of 2035.  I will make inquiries because I would like to know the details of how the system works and how cards are dated with such a long expiry date.  I emphasise the importance of the advice which the Senator gave to his constituents that individuals should co-operate by supplying the information sought.  I would expect they would be treated in Donegal or in any part of the country, sensitively, properly and fairly.  The Senator knows he can contact me if I can be of any further assistance in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112100049#YY00400","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353520500,"counter":268,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 7.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 22 November 2012.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
