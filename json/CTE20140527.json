The Irish Venture Capital Association, IVCA, is the representative organisation for venture capital, VC, firms in Ireland.  These VC firms have specialist domain knowledge and invest primarily in fast-growing, high-tech companies operating in the information and communications technology, ICT, and life sciences, chiefly medical technology, sectors.  The companies are developing deep technologies, addressing global markets and creating thousands of high-calibre jobs.<br \/>Venture capital refers to the provision of equity capital to fund the start-up, growth and expansion of innovative small to medium-sized enterprises which are high-risk and high-potential but are unable to access credit markets because their underlying assets are typically based on intellectual property.  Venture capital firms bridge that five to ten-year funding gap between the small amounts of money raised from friends and family and the funding from bank debt that comes at a much later stage.  While banks do not lend to these companies, they support them by investing in venture capital funds, particularly at the seed and start-up stage.<br \/>A particular feature of the VC model is that funds are precluded from taking on debt.  Instead, they usually invest equity in return for a minority shareholding.  Leverage is not an issue and, therefore, venture capital activity does not pose any systemic risk.  Venture capital teams usually have a technology background - scientists, engineers, researchers and so on - or a business background with deep industry experience.  A core skill is the ability to identify novel technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage.  Normally, the interests of the VC fund and entrepreneurs are aligned, with both having a common interest in building a business and exiting it through an initial public offering, IPO, or trade sale over time.<br \/>The VC fund is normally structured as a limited partnership with a fixed ten-year life.  Capital is provided by long-term private and public investment funds, such as pension funds, life insurance companies, endowment funds, foundations, sovereign wealth funds and state bodies.  VC fund managers also invest alongside other investors.  The capital is only drawn down as the fund makes its investments; VC funds do not hold cash.  The investment period for the fund is generally five years, after which the focus is on managing and making follow-on investments in an existing portfolio.  After an initial investment is made in a portfolio company, additional capital is reserved to fund further development but is only drawn down from investors as it is required.  Investments are sold through an IPO or trade sale, the cash is returned to the investors and the fund is closed.  In effect, the fund is self-liquidating.  After the five-year investment period, the VC firm raises capital for a new fund.  VC companies in this State are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland under the alternative investment fund manager, AIFM, directive.<br \/><b><\/b>The venture capital industry in Ireland is performing very well.  While the level of VC investment activity worldwide has been adversely affected by the credit crunch, with no growth and significant volatility in recent years, there was strong investment in Ireland throughout the recession.  In 2013 alone, &euro;285 million was raised by Irish SMEs.  The focus of venture capital activity is on investment in high-tech, early-stage companies in the ICT and the med tech sectors.  More than 350 of these companies have been supported by Irish VCs in the past ten years and, consequently, Ireland is recognised as a major force in technology development.<br \/>In the past decade, &euro;1 billion in capital has been imported by Irish VCs through syndication with United States and European-based venture funds.  On average, every one euro invested by an Irish VC is matched by one euro from an international VC.  Irish VCs add significant value to portfolio companies by syndicating with tier one international VC funds and corporate investors, introducing international business partners, customers and acquirers, recruiting senior management, introducing corporate governance, and endorsing the business and management team to the sector in which it operates.  Since 1997, the number of VC funds operating in Ireland has more than doubled and their average size has increased from &euro;20 million to &euro;75 million.  In addition, in response to increasing demand from SMEs, the market is now segmented, with both seed and start-up and early and-or expansion-stage funds present.  Irish VCs have invested in a wide range of deal types from research and development commercialisation to start-up and early-stage technology companies and companies requiring later-stage growth equity and development capital.  Many of the VC firms are entering their fourth investment cycle and have specialist domain knowledge in the sectors in which they invest.<br \/>The venture ecosystem in Ireland is well developed, with spin-outs coming from publicly funded research centres.  With the emergence of incubation centres and accelerator programmes, these start-up companies are now better prepared in terms of investor readiness than ever before.  Almost all of the leading American ICT and pharma, med tech and biotechnology companies have located their European headquarters in Ireland.  These enterprises draw talent and are breeding grounds for the entrepreneurs of tomorrow.  Most exits in Ireland are through trade sales, mainly to the multinationals, thus further expanding the presence of the multinational industry in Ireland.  On a note of caution in this regard, Ireland's tax regime has lost significant competitiveness compared with the United Kingdom.  There is a misalignment between the Government's tax policy in regard to entrepreneurship and the key objectives in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.  The IVCA is lobbying the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Finance to redress this disadvantage.<br \/>Returns are poised for a major recovery, because the quantity and quality of the pipeline of investment opportunities has increased greatly.  The commercial acumen, international experience and focus of SME management teams is impressive and relevant to what is required for success in world markets.  Early-stage valuations are stable after dropping significantly with the onset of the global financial crisis, while exit valuations are growing.  Companies are focused on addressing global markets and are scaling faster and building value earlier.  Tier one multinational companies have billions of dollars reserved for acquiring technology companies.  In addition, mergers and acquisitions activity is strong, leading to attractive exit opportunities for VC investors.<br \/>Investment by the State has been key to the success of Irish VC funds in raising capital from the private sector.  Since 1997, the Irish venture capital industry has been developed and nurtured by the Government through investment of &euro;348 million via the Enterprise Ireland seed and venture capital programme over three investment rounds.  VC firms have leveraged this commitment by raising additional private sector investment both for the fund itself and subsequently through syndicated deals for the individual companies.  As a result, nearly &euro;4 billion has been raised by Irish SMEs in this period.  The State's commitment has been leveraged upwards by a factor of ten.  In fact, payroll taxes of approximately &euro;600 million paid by VC-backed companies over the period 2003 to 2012 have made the programme self-financing from tax revenues alone.<br \/>International studies indicate that venture capital stimulates growth, innovation, research and development, new business and entrepreneurialism.  In Ireland, VC funding as a percentage of GDP trebled from 0.06% in 2003 to 0.18% in 2012.  This is the second highest level in Europe after Finland.  Throughout this period, the number of new innovative companies raising seed capital increased fourfold.  Irish technology companies have spawned a significant number of new companies and created a new generation of serial entrepreneurs who are now dominant in the early-stage sectors.  Three technology companies alone have spawned a further 146 companies.<br \/>Irish venture capitalists have driven growth in sectors such as software semiconductors, clean tech and med tech.<\/p> <p>Many of the multinationals operating in these sectors have located here and, consequently, Irish VCs have developed specialist sectoral clusters of innovative activities, including medical devices, telecommunications, laser optics, electronic switching devices, business software and gaming.<\/p><p> The IVCA commissioned the Centre for Entrepreneurial Studies in UCD to conduct an in-depth study of the economic impact of venture capital on the Irish economy and data have been gathered on venture-backed companies over the past decade to 2012.  The analysis shows that venture-backed companies create more high calibre jobs.  Employment is up 11% per annum since 2003.  In the past ten years, these companies created 16,400 high calibre jobs.  It is estimated that these companies support up to three additional indirect downstream jobs.  Hence the true number of direct and indirect jobs generated as a result of venture capital investment in innovative SMEs is approximately 66,000.  An additional survey indicated that since 2005, companies originally backed by venture capital and subsequently sold to multinationals went on to increase employment by another 38%.  <\/p><p> These venture backed companies are export-led.  Exports increased by 12% per annum since 2003 and in the high-tech sector, exports represented 80% of revenues.  These companies grow faster and their revenues are up 17% per annum since 2003.  They are knowledge based and graduates represent 75% of the workforce.  The research and development spend by venture-backed companies represents 30% of all Irish SMEs share of total spend on BERD.<\/p><p> Growing Ireland&rsquo;s indigenous export orientated SME sector is becoming a national imperative as these companies provide 50% of the jobs in the economy and generate 10% of exports.  A strong and well-financed venture capital industry is vital to this growth.  The IVCA estimates that over the next five years - 2014 to 2019 - up to 40 start-up companies will be supported every year by the seed funds and start-up funds and 110 existing early stage companies will receive additional expansion capital from the mainstream venture capital funds.  Within ten years, these companies could provide up to 21,000 new direct jobs and, based upon a 3:1 multiple, 63,000 additional indirect jobs.  They could pay up to &euro;300 million per annum in direct payroll taxes, and over ten years that could exceed &euro;2 billion.  They could export in excess of &euro;1 billion per year and spend up to &euro;300 million per annum on research and development.<\/p><p> The investment activity associated with the venture capital funds supported by the last seed and venture capital programme, 2007 to 2012, peaked during 2010 and available funds for new investment has now begun to decline.  Investment activity by the seed funds will also see a decline by the end of 2014.  Consequently, the number of new investments has started to fall off, bringing about a funding gap for indigenous companies.  The IVCA estimates that the capital required over the next five years to fund the growth and expansion of innovative Irish SMEs is &euro;1.65 billion.  In response to this, the venture capital industry is in the process of raising new funds to fill this gap.<\/p><p> The economic characteristics of venture-backed companies as outlined above have encouraged and influenced policy-makers to recognise the importance of venture capital activity and, consequently, innovation and venture capital are at the centre of Ireland&rsquo;s economic policy.  The evidence for this is funding initiatives from Enterprise Ireland at the seed stage and in the growth capital space; the establishment of a later stage expansion fund by the National Pensions Reserve Fund; and the commitment by Enterprise Ireland of up to &euro;175 million as a cornerstone investor to venture capital funds under the new seed and venture capital scheme 2013 to 2018.  Some &euro;99.5 million of this has been committed to early stage expansion funds.  The IVCA believes that the balance of &euro;75.5 million should be committed to regenerate the seed and start-up funds to finance entrepreneurship and to maintain a pipeline of high calibre start-ups.  <\/p><p> Irish venture capital funds are currently marketing the Irish opportunity and plan to raise funds from international investors, including the European Investment Fund, international corporate investors and foundations, fund of funds and private investors.  In recent weeks, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund unveiled its plans to invest a &euro;6.8 billion fund in Ireland and indicated that venture capital has a central role to play in growing the Irish economy.  However, funds invested by ISIF must be matched by commitments from the private sector but support from the private sector in Ireland is limited.  This is because there is a distinct absence in Ireland of certain classes of institutional investors that have historically supported US VCs, such as private equity funds of funds, university endowments, foundations and family offices.  Most life insurance companies operating in here are foreign-owned and are managed from abroad, with little influence on decisions to invest in the Irish venture capital asset class.  There is a limited pool of Irish pension funds of sufficient scale and with the management resources that have been willing to invest in Irish venture capital.  They are largely semi-State or public sector defined benefit schemes.  Many of these defined benefit funds are in deficit and have been actively seeking to reduce their risk profile.  <\/p><p> The pension industry manages the largest pool of private capital in Ireland.  Notwithstanding strong recent returns from Irish venture capital funds, Irish pension funds are not investing.  This is because there are regulatory constraints on equity investments in general for pension funds and, in particular, there are regulatory constraints on liquidity issues within defined contribution schemes.  Many defined benefit schemes are closing or are converting to defined contribution schemes.  There is negative sentiment arising from the pensions levy.<\/p><p> This is inhibiting the development of the Irish venture capital industry and, with it, Ireland&rsquo;s high-tech SMEs.  If pension funds cannot be persuaded to invest in Ireland, it will also greatly impede the ability of the ISIF to invest in Ireland, as it will be unable to access the required matching private sector funding.  Initiatives to free up private sector capital should be considered and could include discussions with the pensions industry around the levy and an alternative could be to set up a national pooled mechanism funded by a 1% investment by all private and public pension funds which have received tax relief on contributions.  This could create a &euro;700 million to &euro;800 million fund to invest alongside the ISIF; and a Government or an EU initiative to underwrite a liquidity mechanism which allows defined contribution schemes to invest in selected Irish focused investments like venture capital.  <\/p><p> I hope these remarks have given some understanding of how the venture capital industry operates, in particular, in regard to its impact on funding innovative SMEs.  I thank members for their attention and my colleagues and I look forward to their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014052700004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Regina Breheny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401198300,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Breheny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014052700005#D00200","speaker":"1023"},{"type":"speech","time":1401198300,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Breheny for that explanation.

We are dealing with a fairly mobile workforce, so it breaks down into the two key categories of income tax and capital gains tax.  If one takes the two major economies which would be leaders and competitors of ours - the US and the UK - in both income tax and capital gains tax, we would be inferior.<\/p> <p>The two major economies that compete with us are the United States and the United Kingdom.  Our income tax and capital gains tax rates are less attractive than theirs.<\/p><p> Our 52% rate of income tax compares with 47% in the UK and 40% in the US.  Attracting talent into companies becomes an issue in respect of livelihood.  If we take a cut in salary, our net take home pay is lower but we can compensate for that with additional options in companies to help employees and founders own a piece of the company.<\/p><p> Capital gains tax in Ireland is 33%, but in the UK there is tapered relief for entrepreneurs at 10%.  Our rate is a major disincentive when we compete against employees in the UK and against people who want to invest in companies where there is less dilution of their ownership because employees can make more out of smaller stakes in their companies.  In the US, capital gains tax is approximately 23%.  Many of the share option schemes are subjected to income tax in Ireland.  We are lobbying to tackle those two tax features to attract the best people into the start-ups which is the key component of building a successful enterprise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014052700005#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401198900,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Is the Irish Venture Capital Association being listened to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014052700006#E00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401198900,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Yes.

At the other end of the spectrum, companies funded on various rounds at the growth equity stage - series B and C and more mature investments - the ratio of failure is quite low.

With the Chairman's permission I intend to take it as read and draw out some of the key messages from the paper for the purposes of my introductory remarks.<br \/>Most members are aware of the role of Forf&aacute;s.  It is the national policy advisory board on enterprise, trade, science, technology and innovation.  We work closely with our sister agencies, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, and undertake evidence-based research and analysis to advise the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Invitation and the Government on a range of policy areas connected to enterprise.  Forf&aacute;s, together with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, also developed the Governments Action Plan for Jobs and is responsible for implementing some of the actions therein.<br \/>With regard to the interest of the committee in access to finance for SMEs, in the past two years Forf&aacute;s has published two reports of direct relevance.  <i>The Irish Enterprise Funding Environment<\/i>was published in April 2012 and <i>A Review of the Equity Investment Landscape in Ireland<\/i>was published in January last year.  Both reports have been circulated to members with my briefing note.<br \/>The paper I have circulated clearly shows a number of issues including the importance of SMEs to the Irish economy.  SMEs dominate our economy.  They account for 99.8% of active enterprises in Ireland and employ seven out of every ten people employed.  Young, small and medium-sized enterprises in particular contribute more to employment creation and are therefore extremely important in the context of achieving the targets set out in the Action Plan for Jobs.  It is not easy to disentangle the impact of the supply and demand effects on access to finance and there is a range of issues on both sides.  On the supply side the availability of credit has declined as has the number of banks.  The cost of credit has increased and those banks which remain are concentrating on growing profitability.  The banks have reduced resources, particularly with regard to the number of staff and staff with the skills required to assess new lending opportunities.  Some of these resources have been diverted to deal with non-performing loans.<br \/>Access to finance is broader than just access to banking finance and the committee has already heard today about equity investment through venture capital.  There are also other products which are not as well developed in Ireland with regard to equity investment.<br \/>On the demand side, issues for some SMEs relate to poor cash flow and low profitability based on a continued weakness in consumer demand, particularly for those reliant on the domestic economy.  Over-indebtedness is an issue in some cases.  Credit institutions which are risk averse to certain types of businesses or certain sectors are also an issue and there is a lack of wherewithal in some SMEs to develop a business plan or make a business case.<br \/>Businesses in Ireland have traditionally been over-reliant on bank debt financing, and other models of financing have not received as much attention.  Even before the financial crisis emerged a number of long-standing issues were evident in the market for funding in Ireland.  Innovative exporting small and medium-sized enterprises traditionally had trouble in accessing external credit finance.  The reasons may be that newer technology and business models might not neatly fit into existing lending criteria of financial institutions, a lack of collateral or a lack of track record.<br \/>With regard to current performance, based on the ECB's most recent survey published in April we can see the financial performance of Irish SMEs is starting to show signs of improvement when compared to recent years and other European countries.  In aggregate terms turnover is growing and indebtedness is falling, although in net terms SMEs are not yet reporting increased profits.  It is important to acknowledge many SMEs have had a very difficult number of years.  Many have suffered from flat consumer demand in Ireland, challenging export markets and some managers are struggling with significant debt overhang.  The ECB data also suggests that while a high share of Irish SMEs regard access to finance as a pressing issue, demand for bank funding is relatively weak.  Demand is also more focused on short-term finance, for example overdrafts for working capital, rather than on longer-term capital for productive investment.  Of those Irish SMEs which apply for bank funding, 38% reported they had received the full amount for which they had applied as opposed to 66% of euro area SMEs.  The ECB survey finds a relatively high share of SMEs in Ireland, 19%, still face significant financing difficulties versus an EU average of 12%.<br \/>Examining the Irish data highlights that over the course of the past six months credit advanced to the enterprise sector has declined at an annual average rate of 5.1% to the end of January 2014.  The decline in credit advanced to SMEs was most evident in certain sectors, with hotels, restaurants, business and administrative services and the manufacturing sector having the greatest decline.  Irish data also confirms the demand for credit remains relatively weak.  The latest data also indicates a higher percentage of businesses believe banks are open for business and bank refusal rates for loans are falling.<br \/>The cost of finance continues to be an issue for Irish enterprises.  Cost competitiveness may weaken further as the banks need to rebuild profitability and competition has reduced.  While demand may be weak the extent to which the financial system can provide adequate funding for firms once aggregate demand recovers and the economy grows may be a challenge.  Research highlights that credit constraints affect between 4% and 11% of small and medium-sized enterprises.<br \/>As I stated earlier, while banking finance is important it is just one source.  Since 2008 we have seen strong growth in the use of share and other equity and the use of accounts receivable.  The initiatives on bank lending are now being complemented by greater focus on non-bank sources of finance to increase funding options and ensure SMEs have necessary equity to get bank credit.<br \/>I draw members attention to figure No. 2 on page 7 of the presentation circulated to them which demonstrates the supports available at various stages of development of business.  The committee has already heard a presentation today on some of these elements.  Different types of finance support different types of enterprises at different stages of development.<br \/>The State has put in place a number of new schemes and initiatives in recent years to address specific issues, such as the credit guarantee scheme introduced in October 2012 and the microfinance loan fund which was also introduced in 2012.  Enterprise Ireland has committed &euro;99.5 million to a new &euro;175 million seed and venture capital scheme which was launched in May last year.  The remit of the Credit Review Office was extended in budget 2014 to increase the threshold by which small and medium enterprises can appeal a refusal from &euro;500,000 to &euro;3 million.<br \/>The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 sets out a range of additional actions for implementation before the end of the year.  These include collating more detailed data from the banks on lending, particularly new lending; increasing participation in Government-sponsored access to finance initiatives for SMEs, including enhancing the credit guarantee scheme and the micro-enterprise loan fund; raising the level of awareness among SMEs and entrepreneurs on the full suite of Government supports available; and developing new sources of finance for SMEs including European sources.<\/p> <p>Given the depth of the financial crisis and its legacy impacts on the enterprise sector, the banks and the broader economy, it can be expected that it will be some time before debt levels and funding flows return to what might be regarded as normal levels.  As I noted earlier, it should also be remembers that during the good times small innovative export-oriented businesses had difficulties in accessing the appropriate funding.  <\/p><p> From the perspective of Forf&aacute;s, some of the key challenges that face Ireland in this regard includes the continuing need to ensure that the efficacy of measures put in place to improve credit flows through recapitalisation, deleveraging and restructuring of the banks can be assessed and further action taken if required.  In this regard, there is a need to continue to monitor bank lending carefully at a detailed level.  This is particularly important as the economy returns to growth and demand for funding increases.<\/p><p> The State needs to continue to work to ensure that the banking system is aligned with the strategic economic growth targets of the economy.  In this regard, a move towards a banking system with a deeper understanding of innovative sectors is required such as software, telecoms, digital content, medtech and life sciences.  Also, a proactive overseas banking network is required in the medium term.<\/p><p> More immediately there needs to be a focus on supporting internationally trading businesses in terms of both the provision of credit and banking facilities and products.  The scaling back of the domestic bank sector and the withdrawal of many foreign banks highlights issues over the levels of competition in the banking sector as the business banking market has become more highly concentrated.  A particular challenge exists for SMEs who rely on the banks that are withdrawing from Ireland. <\/p><p> The programme for Government contained a commitment to establish a strategic investment bank.  Since I submitted my presentation last week the Government has announced the establishment of the strategic banking corporation of Ireland.  The corporation will make &euro;500 million in credit available to SMEs.  It will be important that this mechanism and other mechanisms put in place address the challenges that I have outlined here.  <\/p><p> Encouraging equity investment represents a mechanism to help some over-indebted but viable businesses to rebalance their balance sheets.  Equity begins from the earliest stage of the business life cycle with friends, family and founders investing at the pre-seed stage to business angels, and venture capitalists investing in the seed and start-up phase right up to the latter stages, through mechanisms such as trade sales and initial public offerings.  Members will already have heard quite a bit about this matter so I will not go into it again in detail.<\/p><p> The Department of Finance is carrying out a review of the employment and investment incentive scheme and seed capital scheme.  The aim is to ensure it delivers on its potential to support the funding needs of growing enterprises so the outcome of the review will be important.  The State can also support other forms of funding and recently the committee heard from peer-to-peer lenders and businesses that it has supported.  There is strong potential for the State to provide a supportive environment for alternative sources of finance such as these.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting Forf&aacute;s here today.

At the moment one of the issues is that we do not know enough about what the banks are doing in terms of lending, to whom they are lending and in what types of lending in which they are engaged.

For instance, if innovative companies in new sectors are not able to access this funding then making more funding available may not be the answer.  It may be educating those involved in the lending process within those banks.  It may be increasing the level of understanding of both the sectors and cash-flow lending, particularly where there is not a significant amount of collateral available against the credit being sought.  A detailed understanding of what type of lending is taking place is important.

Members will recall that, at our meeting on 13 May, it was agreed to scrutinise it further.<br \/>I welcome Mr. Cullen to the meeting.

First, we addressed the issue of the legal basis chosen by the Commission and the question as to whether the EU is competent to act on the basis of Article 153 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  We point out that the Government does not have any objection to the use of Article 153(2) as the legal basis for the establishment of this platform.  This legal basis is also viewed by the Council legal service and by a large majority of the member states to be an appropriate legal basis for this proposal.<\/p><p>  Second, we looked at whether the kind of action proposed is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity.  We would point out that the objective of the proposed platform is to facilitate, promote, encourage and support co-operation among the member states rather than the introduction of any specific binding agreements or harmonisation of laws.  We are satisfied that all operational aspects of the measures that might be taken to combat undeclared work would remain exclusively within the competence of the member states involved and we have noted that the committee's counterpart scrutiny committees within the legislatures of Sweden and Poland, which are not without their picky approach to these matters on occasions, have already concluded that the proposal does not infringe the principle of subsidiarity.<\/p> <p> Third, we considered whether the action proposed is proportionate to the objectives the draft decision seeks to achieve.  We are satisfied that the proposed platform does not go beyond the range of activities, all of which are undertaken by member states on a voluntary basis, set out in the instrument and that any measures adopted would exclude harmonisation of laws and regulations of member states.  Fourth, we considered whether the action proposed could adversely affect national competence in the fields of social protection and taxation, and we have concluded that the proposed instrument would not impinge on national competence in the fields of social security, taxation policy or operational practice in that regard.  Finally, we looked at the transnational dimension to tackling undeclared work.  We note that the emphasis the European Parliament and the International Labour Organization have placed on promoting enhanced co-operation at EU level, especially through transnational exchanges of information and mutual learning between enforcement authorities in a bid to fight undeclared work.<\/p><p> The Irish experience of multi-agency co-operation and data sharing between different state authorities and the mechanisms established for them to work together with other labour market actors has already attracted a high level of interest especially among eastern European member states, as did the fact that the co-operation here extends across the Border through a cross-Border operational forum.<\/p><p> Counteracting undeclared work can create a better level playing field for businesses and improve the quality of employment.  We consider that in the light of the complexity and the heterogeneity of informal or undeclared work and the diversity of circumstances within the member states that there can be simple solution to tackling this problem.  The traditional mechanisms and resources employed by the enforcement authorities are best suited to tackling, mainly, domestic aspects of undeclared work.  The international dimension of undeclared is, however, a reality.  As a consequence of the free movement of services and workers, the effects of non-compliance with national legislation can influence businesses, societies and governments beyond a single country's borders.<\/p><p> We welcome the development of common concepts, measurement tools and the promotion of joint comparative analysis.  We are concerned that the World Bank estimates used by the Commission, along with many other sources, in its impact assessment seriously overstates the problem in Ireland.  The results for Ireland from the Eurobarometer direct survey undertaken last year of the general population's personal experiences of undeclared work are useful as a counterbalance to some of the problematic indirect methods used by the World Bank in this instance to estimate the size of the black economy.  It is interesting to note from the survey last year that Irish respondents were half as likely as the EU average to say that they had undertaken undeclared paid work in the previous 12 months.  Ireland had one of the highest proportion of respondents, 47%, who thought that people who worked without declaring their income ran a fairly high risk of tax or social security institutions finding them out and issuing supplementary tax bills or fines.  In our view, action at EU level is justified in order to enhance co-operation between the responsible national authorities such as labour inspectorates, social security and tax authorities, in particular, enabling them to exchange information and best practices, analyse common problems and so on in the effort to deter undeclared work.<\/p><p> The Irish Government considers that a European platform on the lines proposed would be an appropriate vehicle for practical voluntarily agreed activities and shared studies undertaken on the basis of co-operation between the Commission and member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014052700011#K01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Cullen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401202200,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Paul Cullen.

Is fearr i bhfad f&oacute;cas a chur ar an sc&eacute;im agus aidhm amh&aacute;in a bhaint amach i mbliain amh&aacute;in agus aidhm eile sa dara bhliain agus mar sin de.  Ansin, ba ch&oacute;ir review a dh&eacute;anamh ar an sc&eacute;im gach bliain.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach seo a dh&eacute;anamh agus ceisteanna a chur.

To do that, we must ensure the shemes are focused.<\/p><p> I thank all of the witnesses who have attended this meeting.

Mar shampla chuaigh muid tr&iacute;d gach ceann de sna tionscadal at&aacute; faoin &aacute;r gc&uacute;raim i l&aacute;thair na huaire agus bh&iacute; muid i mbun pl&eacute; leis na ceanneagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; agus leis na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; eile maidir leo sin a aistri&uacute;.

Ach go h&aacute;irithe i gcomhth&eacute;acs iomarca&iacute;ocht agus eile.  Le roinnt mhaith blianta anuas t&aacute;imid ceangailte le leibh&eacute;al na st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;se nuair a thagann s&eacute; go dt&iacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; tuarastail bhuel ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an rud ceanainn c&eacute;anna i gceist mar sin m&aacute; t&aacute; an st&aacute;t ag iarraidh gearradh siar ar an mhaoini&uacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il agus t&aacute; siad ag iarraidh go bun&uacute;sach daoine ag dul a chur amach agus s&iacute;lim gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh ar a laghad na scoruithe c&eacute;anna ann &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; iomarca&iacute;ochta .  So go mbeadh siad ag aithint agus go mbeadh siad ag tabhairt c&uacute;itimh chu&iacute; do na fostaithe nach bhfuil ag lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh.  Agus an rud a luaigh an Seanad&oacute;ir ansin freisin an tuiscint a bh&iacute; againn chomh maith ag dul isteach sa ch&oacute;ras maoinithe nua n&aacute; go mbeadh deiseanna breise ann &oacute; thaobh an r&eacute;imse oibre at&aacute;imid le bheith i gceannas air amach anseo.  Ach ag breathn&uacute; ar na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; agus na ruda&iacute; a bh&iacute; luaite ag Foras na Gaeilge ar maidin, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh cine&aacute;il mearbhail ort &oacute; thaobh na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; de ach caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; bh&iacute; thart ar 73 duine fostaithe ag an 15 eagra&iacute;ocht sin a ghlacann le raidi&oacute; agus nach t&eacute;ann iad ach san &aacute;ireamh.

N&iacute;l cuma ar an sc&eacute;al go mbeidh na deiseanna sin ann so mholfainn dul leis an moladh at&aacute; agaibh le cruinni&uacute; speisialta leis an gc&aacute;s sin a phl&eacute;.  <\/p><p> Maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; sc&eacute;imeanna agus eile agus s&iacute;lim go raibh freagra cuimsitheach ansin ag Kevin so b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir just go nd&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; tagairt don Bhreatain Bheag an rud a luaigh an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh ansin freisin.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn foghlaim &oacute; muintir na Breataine Bige agus t&aacute; siadsan tar &eacute;is c&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna a chaitheamh amach agus c&oacute;ras caighde&aacute;n a chur isteach agus s&iacute;lim go bhfuil an c&oacute;ras sin d&eacute;anann s&eacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; c&eacute;ile agus b&aacute; ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn dul len a leithead.  Ach caithfear breathn&uacute; ar c&eacute;n sl&iacute; a thugann siadsan faoin post an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga mar shampla at&aacute; siad tar &eacute;is a chur ar bun sa Bhreatain Bheag.  T&aacute; siad tar &eacute;is i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; de chumhacht a thabhairt don Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga sa Bhreatain Bheag mar go n-aithn&iacute;onn siad an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann leis an bpost.  T&aacute; muid anseo ag iarraidh l&aacute;idri&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar Acht go bhfuil an Roinn ag iarraidh a lag&uacute; t&aacute; siad san tar &eacute;is cur leis an m&eacute;id gur f&eacute;idir d&eacute;anamh &oacute; thaobh na Breatainise  de ann.  Sampla amh&aacute;in de sin n&aacute; mar shampla n&aacute; an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga sa Bhreatain Bheag is f&eacute;idir leo comhairle a chur ar f&aacute;il  do gach Aire sa Bhreatain Bheag maidir le haon reachta&iacute;ocht at&aacute; siad ag cur le ch&eacute;ile agus is g&aacute; do p&eacute; Aire aird a thabhairt ar an gcomhairle sin ag teacht &oacute;n gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  So aithn&iacute;onn siad san go bhfuil r&oacute;l trasna an bhoird ag an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga ansin.  An r&oacute;l at&aacute; ann in &Eacute;irinn t&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith teoranta agus t&aacute; iarracht ar si&uacute;l chun &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh n&iacute;os laige f&oacute;s.  Agus an rud deireanach a dheirinse faoin 900 duine at&aacute; faoi threan&aacute;il faoi l&aacute;thair ceann de na fadhbanna is m&oacute; a bhaineann le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; trean&aacute;la agus daoine a oilli&uacute;int le Gaeilge, n&iacute;l aon dualgas orthu an Ghaeilge sin a &uacute;s&aacute;id ina gcuid postanna ina dhiaidh sin chun seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il don phobal.  So ar mbealach &aacute;irithe is deas &eacute; go bhfuil siad ag cur c&uacute;rsa&iacute; trean&aacute;la ar f&aacute;il ach mbun a bhfuil s&eacute; ceangailte le breis seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; n&iacute; fi&uacute; &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.

Now caithfidh m&eacute; fainic a chur oraibh d&aacute; mbeadh an Bille seo foilsithe mar Bhille pl&eacute;ite sa dara ch&eacute;im sa D&aacute;il agus muid ag cur na molta&iacute; at&aacute; sibhse ag cur chun cinn ar aghaidh ag C&eacute;im an Choiste mar shampla r&iacute;al&oacute;fa&iacute; gach aon cheann beagnach de na molta&iacute; at&aacute; d&eacute;anta as ord ar an mbun&uacute;s go gcuirfid&iacute;s costas ar an st&aacute;t.

Agus is d&oacute;igh liom go narda&iacute;onn s&eacute; seo an cheist an gceapann sibhse go mba cheart don Choiste seo iarraidh ar an Aire an Bille seo a tharraingt siar go hioml&aacute;n agus teacht ar ais le dr&eacute;acht sc&eacute;im eile a thabharfadh aird ar na molta&iacute; a rinneadh agus a bheadh cun tairbhe na Gaeilge n&oacute; an fi&uacute; ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il an laincis agus mar deireann an tAire n&iacute;l m&eacute; ag du lag glacadh le fi&uacute; aon chuid de na molta&iacute; at&aacute; d&eacute;anta agaibh.  An bhfuil an tairbhe n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; an dochair ar dhul ar aghaidh leis an mBille seo? N&oacute; an mb&rsquo;fhearr d&uacute;inn a r&aacute; &eacute;ist leis ar fad is fearr an <i>status quo<\/i>n&aacute; an m&eacute;id at&aacute; &aacute; mholadh anse.<br \/>T&aacute; an mheicn&iacute;ocht a bhaineann leis seo thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach.  Caithfidh mise a r&aacute;, nach bhfeicimse aon rud m&oacute;r&aacute;n chun tairbhe sa mBille mar de r&eacute;ir mar a thuigim s&eacute; an f&aacute;th go bhfuil an Bille seo ann ar chor ar bith n&aacute; maol&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la.  Sin an t-&uacute;dar a chuireadh an athbhreithni&uacute; ar bun.  Fair play do eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; na Gaeilge agus do phobal na Gaeilge nuair a th&aacute;inig an c&oacute;ras comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in d&rsquo;fhan na B&eacute;arl&oacute;ir&iacute; a bh&iacute; ag gearr&aacute;n ina dtost agus th&aacute;inig sibh ar ais le molta&iacute; foirfe.  <br \/>Ach ba &eacute; an bun-fheidhm an athbhreithnithe n&aacute; lag&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an Acht  fi&uacute; is go n-ord&oacute;inn f&eacute;in nach bhfuil s&eacute; bainte amach na ruda&iacute; ar mhaith liomsa is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go bhfuil s&eacute; ann ach d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh cinnte t&aacute; go leor foghlamtha againn &oacute; th&aacute;inig s&eacute; isteach agus mar at&aacute; luaite anseo.  Bhreannaigh muid ar obair Cheanada ag an am agus bhreannaigh muid ar obair na Breataine Bige.  Th&oacute;g muid an Coimisin&eacute;ir &oacute; Cheanada agus d&eacute;arfainn nach bhfuil duine ar bith sa t&iacute;r a d&eacute;arfadh narbh l&aacute; maith oibre &eacute; sin.  Ba i gceist an-foirfe a dh&eacute;anamh ar cheist na sc&eacute;imeanna  ach mar t&aacute; sib hag cur i bhfeidhm n&iacute;l siad ag feidhmi&uacute; mar n&iacute;l an toil ann.  <br \/>Now just c&uacute;pla ceist, d&eacute;arfainn sibh go mba cheart go mbeadh gach seirbh&iacute;s ar f&aacute;il do phobal na Gaeltachta tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Now baineann pobal na Gaeltachta &uacute;s&aacute;id as gach seirbh&iacute;s sa t&iacute;r agus t&aacute; ar n&oacute;s 400 eagra&iacute;ocht st&aacute;it ann agus ar nd&oacute;igh d&aacute; mbeadh s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il do phobal na Gaeltachta tuige nach mbeadh s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il do phobal na Gaeilge mar t&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; Gaeilgeoir&iacute; i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath n&aacute; mar at&aacute; i go leor leor de na Gaeltachta&iacute; ach go praitici&uacute;il c&eacute;n chaoi a chuirf&iacute; rud mar sin i bhfeidhm?<\/p> <p>Mar is d&oacute;igh liomsa go gcaithfimid a bheith c&uacute;ramach gan ruda&iacute; a mholadh nach bhfuil praitici&uacute;il mar n&iacute; tharl&oacute;idh siad.  <\/p><p> Now an dara ceist at&aacute; agam n&aacute; cuireann sibh an-bh&eacute;im ar 30% den fhosta&iacute;ocht nua a bheith inni&uacute;il ar an d&aacute;theanga.  M&aacute; chuirtear ar an mbealach sin, an bhfuil an seans ann go gcuirfear neart duine Gaeilge sc&eacute;al amach go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh go mbeidh 30% laistigh de 10 mbliana den st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s agus den seirbh&iacute;s poibl&iacute; obair a dh&eacute;anamh i nGaeigle agus i mB&eacute;arla.  Agus mar sin &oacute; thaobh na huimhr&iacute;ochta de agus s&eacute; an toradh c&eacute;anna &eacute;, de r&eacute;ir mar thuigim thabharfadh 30% suas le 10% duit faoi cheann 10 mbliana.  An bhfuil s&eacute; sin f&iacute;or? An mbeadh muid n&iacute;os fearr a bheith ag r&aacute; go mba cheart go mbeadh 10% de sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute;gh poibl&iacute; inni&uacute;il ar an seirbh&iacute;s a chur ar f&aacute;il sa d&aacute;theanga faoi cheann 10 mbliana seachas an figi&uacute;ir eile mar feicim cont&uacute;irt ann nua agus thiocfaidh m&eacute; aige i gceann soicind.  Ba mhaith liom bhur dtuairim ar sin mar t&aacute; cur i l&aacute;thair f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach mar n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in go bhfuil t&uacute; ag caint ar phobal na Gaeilge, caithfidh t&uacute; cuimhneamh is treise i bhfad an pobal eile.

Members will be aware that the European Commission, on behalf of the member states, is negotiating a trade and investment agreement with the United States of America.  The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement, known to everyone as TTIP, is designed to drive growth and create jobs in both jurisdictions by boosting economic activity by making it easier to buy or sell goods and services between the European Union and United States of America.  Negotiations on the agreement opened last July and the fifth round of talks concluded last week in the United States.  As I stated, members are joined by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, who will brief members on the opportunities and challenges of TTIP for Irish citizens, European citizens and companies.  The Irish Government's position on TTIP also will be discussed this afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014052700002#A00400","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1401199200,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to say a few words on TTIP and hopefully to take questions from members to the best of my ability.  During Ireland's Presidency last June, an agreement was achieved at the European Council to start negotiations on a trade and investment agreement with the United States.  It was an historic agreement and clearly for Ireland, with its deep involvement with the United States over many years, seeing it to its conclusion was something in which we had a significant interest.  A recommendation and a mandate were given to the European Commissioner, Commissioner De Gucht, to commence negotiations.  The disposition was that we should seek to be ambitious in three broad areas.  The first was market access, which basically is about tariffs and obstacles that stand in the way.  The second concerned rules addressing shared global trade challenges and opportunities and the third was in respect of regulatory non-tariff barriers.<\/p><p>  Since the Council's decision, five negotiating rounds have taken place, the most recent one being last week in the United States.  As I stated, three areas are involved.  The area of market access concerns goods and services and public procurement.  The first tariff offers, that is, the immediate or phased elimination of import tariffs on an extensive list of goods, were exchanged earlier this year and I expect there will be further work on these offers.  They exclude food and agriculture, so it pertains to non-food goods.  As for services, I understand the United States tabled its first offer last week.<\/p> <p>The EU side is still working on its first offer but expects to have it ready soon.  I understand that in depth negotiations took place last week on procurement but we do not yet have the details from the Commission.<\/p><p> The second broad category comprises rules on trade facilitation relating to the customs systems between the EU and the US; rules on state-owned enterprises, which should operate along commercial lines - in other words, they should not be subsidised to enter into other markets; rules on raw materials and energy, in respect of which the EU is looking for access to US oil and gas exports, which are currently restricted; and rules on labour and environment, in respect of which there will be no weakening of standards or protections.  Coming to agreement in these areas will also serve to set standards for other free trade agreements with trading partners, reduce complexity for small companies and generally open markets in a more transparent manner.<\/p><p> The most difficult and complex, but perhaps the most important, aspect of the negotiations is on reducing regulatory burdens.  This will involve a multiplicity of sectoral legislation, particularly in areas like financial services, the environment, health and public safety.  While there are legitimate but unfounded concerns about lowering regulatory standards, the goal is to maintain high standards of public protection while finding a way to prevent them from representing unacceptable barriers to trade.  This would involve issues such as mutual recognition of the way in which one assesses a product.  The pharma sector is a good example, in respect of which we could avoid the necessity to run trials on the same product in the EU and the US in order to give it recognition.  Mutual recognition would open up possibilities in that regard.<\/p><p> Progress in respect of regulation through harmonisation, mutual recognition or convergence is the most important area because the results of studies show it will yield the biggest net gains.  The Commission's impact assessment suggests that between two thirds and four fifths of the gains from a future agreement will come from cutting red tape and having more co-ordination between regulators.  It is important to see this as a two part issue, involving both the process of how regulation is enacted and the sector specific solutions being negotiated.  How regulations are made needs to be more transparent, with regulators deepening their relationships in order to address emerging issues together.  In addition, real progress on issues like car safety standards and ending double inspections at pharmaceutical and medical device plants should reduce costs for both businesses and regulators.  Implementing agreed international finance rules in a compatible way is an example of how immediate and positive impacts can be achieved for EU and US economies as agreements are reached.  Bringing about regulatory convergence will help exporters and investors by reducing the cost of doing business across the Atlantic.  It will make it easier for companies to comply with US and EU laws at the same time.  Extending the scope of mutual recognition across many professional bodies, for example, would make it easier for professionals to source new job opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic.<\/p><p> It is important to note that while regulatory aspects are one of the main elements of the TTIP negotiations, nothing in the negotiations would prevent or undermine the rights of both sides to regulate and the level of regulatory protection on both sides, whether in respect of the environment, food or consumer safety.  The European Commission is acutely conscious of the need to engage widely with stakeholders in these negotiations and it is doing so in a number of ways, including stakeholder briefing sessions during and following each round of negotiations, a dedicated TTIP website, a specific public consultation on investment protection, which may be of interest to the committee, and the establishment of a special advisory group.  During last week's round in the US, the lead negotiators from the EU and the US held a stakeholder meeting involving a wide range of interest groups from business to consumers, and trade unions to environmental and health NGOs, as well as representatives of US states.  I understand that more than 75 stakeholder presentations were made during that meeting.  The next such stakeholder meeting is planned for 3 June and will take place in Brussels.  The TTIP website contains comprehensive information about the negotiations, including the EU's initial position papers published last year and the more recent EU sectoral proposals in the areas of chemicals, cosmetics, motor vehicles, pharmaceutical products and textiles and clothing.  These proposals set out ideas for enhancing the compatibility of existing rules and regulations on both sides and for working more closely together on setting them in the future.  In each sector the papers focus on ways to end the unnecessary duplication of product testing and plant inspections, to recognise each other's existing regulations, to bring them more closely together and to align the respective procedures for approving or registering new products.<\/p><p> The Commission has proposed a specific chapter in TTIP aimed at small and medium enterprises.  I understand there was some discussion of this during last week's round.  The Commission has produced a brochure which highlights the opportunities for SMEs from the agreement.  The brochure, which can be found from the TTIP website, includes several small company success stories.  I do not doubt that we could all add a few more examples of success stories of small businesses that are making inroads into the US market.  The idea behind the specific focus on SMEs is to create many more opportunities.  TTIP should create new opportunities for SMEs to do business not only in the area of goods, but also in services, including professional services.  Improving the coherence of rules and rule making, including standards, would have a multiplier effect for SMEs and create opportunities by opening up even niche areas of procurement.  Even in areas like customs procedures, SMEs can make large savings from small changes in regulations when considering exporting.<\/p><p> The advisory group set up by the Commission comprises representation from all stakeholders, including agriculture, business services, consumers, trade unions and NGOs.  The group has thus far met on two occasions and the topics covered to date include regulatory coherence, sectors, investment protection, investor-state dispute settlement and sustainable development.  The reports of these stakeholder meetings can also be found at the Commission's TTIP website.<\/p><p> The TTIP negotiations have been the subject of negative comments in some quarters.  One of the main issues giving rise to disquiet is investment protection provisions, particularly in respect of investor-state dispute settlements, ISDS.  In regard to the proposal that companies will have the right to seek redress from expropriation or discriminatory policies through international arbitration rather than the courts system, fears have been expressed that companies will use this mechanism to change the regulatory direction of public policy.  Last January, Commissioner De Gucht announced his decision to consult the public on the investment provisions of a future deal on TTIP.  That public consultation opened on 27 March and will run until 6 July.  As part of the consultation, the Commission published a proposed EU text for the investment part of the talks, which includes sections on investment protection and the ISDS.  All stakeholders will have the opportunity to respond to this consultation so that specific interests and concerns about investor protection and settlement of related disputes are well understood by the European Commission and can be used to better define the EU's approach to investor protection in the TTIP negotiations.<\/p><p> Assessments made by the Commission and other studies show that a comprehensive agreement could, over time, boost EU GDP by 0.5%.  Given the current low level of economic growth in the EU and Ireland, this agreement will provide a significant injection of economic activity and, consequently, new job opportunities.  Based on these assessments, if Ireland simply benefited in proportion to the size of our economy within the EU, a comprehensive trade and investment partnership could over time provide gains to Ireland in the order of &euro;800 million per annum in increased GDP and 4,000 new jobs.<\/p><p> Ireland has a close trading and investment relationship with the US and, in addition, many Irish exporters are part of European supply chains, whereby exports to the UK, Germany and elsewhere in the EU feed into Europe's exports to the US.  The TTIP is, therefore, a stimulus for longer term economic growth and jobs in Ireland.  Members should have received invitations to a conference in Dublin Castle on 20 June on the topic of TTIP opportunities for Ireland.<\/p> <p>The target audience of the conference is political and senior executive level across Departments, agencies, regulators and representative organisations.  The line-up of speakers for the morning includes the EU chief negotiator with the US, Copenhagen Economics, a consultancy firm engaged by my Department to carry out a study of the economic impacts on Ireland of such a trade agreement and a panel of respondents from industry and regulators.  I hope members will be able to attend.<\/p><p> The aim of the TTIP negotiations was that it should be concluded within 18 to 20 months from its beginning last July.  This is an ambitious timetable.  More recent public statements suggest it will be more likely towards the end of 2015.  The aim is also that the TTIP will be a living agreement to provide the necessary space for dealing with more difficult issues and the mechanisms for jointly addressing any new trade and investment-rated issues that may arise.<\/p><p> We have circulated a note to members and I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014052700002#A00500","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401199800,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  It seems that excellent progress has been made.  We are very keen that this agreement will generate additional jobs in our country.  I have two questions about jobs at European level and at local level.  Is there a risk that jobs in large car production companies in Germany and France might be in danger because of an increase in the number of American cars coming into European markets?  I have in mind the potential for flooding the market.  The American car industry was rescued by President Obama a few years ago to the tune of $50 billion - I am not sure of the exact amount - in terms of public subsidies.  Will safeguards be in place to ensure that there will be no flooding of the European market by American car producers as this would impact on German and French jobs with a knock-on effect on the European economy?<\/p><p>  My second question is about Irish jobs.  One of the criticisms and complaints during the most recent election campaign and which is voiced at constituency clinics is the concern that many Irish companies are losing out to European counterparts because of public procurement rules.  What safeguards will be in place to ensure that Irish companies are not put at a disadvantage in the domestic market if American companies come in?  What can be done with regard to public procurement rules to ensure that while competition remains in the Irish procurement market, that there is not an excessive input of American companies which will take jobs and contracts away from Irish companies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014052700004#C00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1401199800,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his attendance and I thank the Chairman for starting the debate.  We have heard something about the TTIP, transatlantic trade and investment partnership and it helps to study the briefing documentation.  I have done my best to analyse it.  If I was naive I would wonder why this project is not being fast-tracked because I am reading that it will be of great benefit to the country and to Europe.  It would be an excellent political slogan to be able to say to electors that the benefit for supporting it would be &euro;545 in disposable income for each family of four in the EU.  There are many other attractions presented to us.  These enthusiastic figures show income gains as a result of increased EU trade and an increase in European exports to the United States by 28%, the equivalent of an additional &euro;187 billion worth of exports to America.  These are very compelling statistics which seem to be based on the Centre for Economic Policy Research in London.  We are an independent entity within Europe.  Has the Minister's Department analysed those findings of the Centre for Economic Policy Research with a view to confirming the veracity or otherwise of the glowing statements about the benefits of signing the agreement?  We are told that the programme will protect the health, environment and consumer protection rights of Europeans and that these will not be diluted in any way by virtue of this agreement.<\/p><p>  The Irish Medicines Board has an American equivalent.  The pharmaceutical industry in this country must undergo stringent analysis and examination of the methodologies they use.  Companies located here who export to America are subject to intensive scrutiny to find flaws.  If the Irish Medicines Board wants to maintain our high standards and the TTIP is a project negotiated by the EU, what is our position as an independent nation within the 28 member states when it comes to the standards of other European countries?  It is argued that the Irish Medicines Board is one of the most stringent regulators in the field.  If our standards are very high compared with, for instance, Lithuania or Estonia or some other European country, what is the red line that the European Commission is adopting on standards?  Will Ireland as a nation state be required to lower its standards in order to find the average within Europe?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014052700004#C00300","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1401199800,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation to the committee.

We have a particular interest in the food industry because Ireland is a net food exporter.  How can we be assured that further stages in the negotiations do not erode the position of food industry exports which are of significant importance to our economy?  I refer to previous experiences in transatlantic negotiations when, after the event, the food sector was used in a trade-off against other products from Europe, such as cars from Germany, Italy, France, Spain, at the cost of the food sector throughout Europe.  What countries are represented on the EU negotiating team?  The Minister has indicated that the team is comprised of EU officials at this stage.  Where do they come from?  They did not just pop out of the EU without having a background from a member country.  Could the team members be all from a single member state or from two countries?  Which might those countries be?  Could their nationality have any impact on the outcome of the discussions?<\/p><p>  The Minister made a number of references to the stakeholders.<\/p> <p>I presume these stakeholders are representative of industry on both sides of the Atlantic.  To what extent has it been ascertained what these stakeholders are representing?  Do they represent the national interest, the European interest or a combination of both?  I would like to know a little more about the breakdown in this regard.<\/p><p> In respect of market access, all of this is of course to no avail unless it is a two-way process, that is, market access must work in both directions in all sorts of situations.  To what extent have the negotiations thus far indicated that such market access will be honoured in the spirit as well as the letter?  When will we see the benefits therefrom?  My final point pertains to regulation.  Regulations are the famous apparatus people can use to undermine or prevent an agreement.  Regulations can make an agreement impossible to operate or can include or exclude some parts of the agreement already entered into, depending on what they are.  Is the Minister satisfied that the tangent of the negotiations to date indicates in a meaningful way a recognition of the need to ensure that member states throughout the European Union, without exception, will benefit from the negotiations and have equal access to the market?  Alternatively, do the negotiations indicate whether one or more influential states within the Union are likely to be the greater beneficiaries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014052700004#C00600","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401200400,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials and apologise for missing the beginning of the presentation while at another committee meeting.  I have a couple of issues, the first of which is to ask why now, whether this the right time or has this initiative been in train for a number of years?  Other speakers have touched on the issue of food, which is of huge importance to Ireland.  I have raised the issue of standards at either this committee or the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation - I am unsure which - and a reassurance was given that there would be no lessening of standards in any discussions on GM food, hormone-treated beef and bovine somatotropin-injected cows producing milk in the United States.  While I am sure this is the case, the Minister might comment on this subject.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Eric Byrne has noted, this appears on paper to have huge potential.  The European Commission's economic analysis suggests that the benefits for the European Union and the US would not be at the expense of the rest of the world but estimates the increase in GDP in the rest of the world would be almost &euro;100 billion.  How is it envisaged that this will happen?  If the European Union is exporting more to the United States, presumably other countries would be exporting less to it.  Similarly, if the United States is exporting more to the European Union, there therefore would be less room for other countries to export here.  From where does this &euro;100 billion come?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014052700005#D00200","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1401200400,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and invite the Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014052700005#D00300","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1401200400,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Quite a number of questions have been asked.  In respect of the car industry, it is probably an area in which Europe is looking to opportunities in the United States market rather than losing out.  It is an area in which it is stated that we have an offensive interest and in which there are opportunities.  However, guarantees have been built into the Japanese or Korean agreements, for example, to prevent the flooding of product as raised by the Chairman.  In general, protections and safeguards are built into sensitive sectors such as the automobile sector and this has been a feature of the existing trade agreements.<br \/>On the public procurement rules, it is an issue that will be quite difficult in the United States, which I suppose is why it is not in the first round, because the United States has different procurement rules in different states within the federation.  Consequently, local rules apply and this is an area in which we obviously are seeking to get mutual reduction in barriers in order that US companies could trade in Europe and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  A fully open tender system is in operation within the European Union and consequently, one cannot discriminate.  Above a certain standard, there must be an open, published tender and one cannot apply discriminatory rules to favour one side or another although, as members are aware, one can have social clauses that might unemployed people, apprentices or whatever.  It is unlikely that such a level of openness will be reached in a negotiation of this nature.  However, one would be hoping to bring down barriers in order to enable people to have opportunities in this regard.  I refer in particular to Irish companies that have won interesting software applications in public procurement contracts within the European Union and elsewhere and one would hope similar benefits could be achieved by seeing a reduction in barriers in the US.  There would be some cases in which there would be a &quot;buy American only&quot; policy or whatever and clearly, it is in our interests to bring down barriers on both sides.  On that issue of the state versus the federation, it arose in the Canadian agreement and was an issue that took longer to unravel, that is, to get all the provinces within Canada to sign up to a set of common rules.<br \/>Deputy Eric Byrne raised the issue of how does one measure the benefits.  Obviously, economic models are used and while one always can criticise the assumptions that are made, these models consider the level of trade barriers and evaluate tariffs.  In the case of tariffs, they are not very high and I believe they are at a maximum of approximately 3%.  However, non-trade barriers can be very high and can be up to 20% in some sectors.  The models evaluate how big are the barriers, examine how trade flows could change as a result of that and then ascertain what are the benefits.  As the Deputy noted, assessments have been carried out at EU-wide level but as I stated in my remarks, this is why the Government has commissioned some work to drill down to the Irish situation to conduct an evaluation of the impact in Ireland.  In general, the Government envisages bigger gains comparatively for Ireland because we have fairly strong trading relationships with the United States and there would be opportunities for Ireland on foot of a reduction in barriers.  We have the familiarity of trading in the United States, a common language and a lot of already-built common trading relationships.  Therefore, one would hope to see better opportunities coming for Ireland.<br \/>The approach being taken by the European Union to public policy standards is to have no diminution of existing public policy standards.  This is not an issue of the European Union seeking to negotiate away any public protection that it has put in place but is to maintain standards.  I must revert to the joint committee on the extent to which Irish standards differ from European Union standards.  In general, EU recognition is what a medical device or pharmaceutical company seeks to achieve because it can then trade throughout the European Union.  Obviously, we seek to protect both sets of standards.  The United States will seek to protect whatever is its public policy in the same way as we in the European Union will seek to protect ours.  It may be easier to see this point in respect of the food sector, where the European Union has total bans on hormones and a fixed policy on GM that it does not intend to change in any way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014052700005#D00400","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1401200400,"counter":302,"content":"<p>May I ask a brief question in this regard?

However, I will revert to the Deputy on whether there are cases in which Ireland has different standards from the European Union.  In general, however, if an organisation comes to Ireland to produce a medical device, it will seek to get approval in Ireland but will want that approval to carry to the other 27 member states.  It will not wish to have approval just in Ireland and to be unable to go any further with the product.  While what regulators do is to approve to a standard, the hope is that if both the European Union and the US have certain expectations of a product and have a certain way of measuring the extent to which those expectations are being met, we will accept each other's measurements of where the product is on the spectrum.<\/p> <p>It is not that we would seek to reduce the cut-off point but that we would not require a measurement that has already been done through, say, clinical trials, to be repeated at significant cost.  It would also mean that regulators would have similar vetting procedures over time.  Having similar procedures in place allows for more opportunity for mutual recognition and reduced costs.  There is no intention to dilute public policy in this regard.<\/p><p> The reason food is not included in these negotiations is because it is one of the most contentious areas.  It was very contentious in the negotiations of the EU-Canadian partnership but agreement was reached in the end with greater access for European dairy products to the Canadian market and Canadian beef products to European markets.  This will be a hotly contested area and the stakeholders include those in primary production.<\/p><p> The European Commissioner for Trade, Karel De Gucht, will conduct the negotiations along with his directorate-general and the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development.  Their staff are drawn from across the European Union, not from one nationality - the trade Commissioner is Belgian - and they report weekly to the trade policy committee which is made up of officials from member states.  Mr. Gerard Monks is our representative on that committee.  The negotiators work on a mandate from the Council and report back to it.  Under European treaties, it is the Commission which negotiates trade agreements, not member states.  Every country, accordingly, ensures its interests are represented in negotiations.  When we negotiated the mandate, the specific issue around the recognition of cultural exceptions and diversity, a point which one would want to protect in any trade negotiations, was raised which caused disagreement across member states and had to be brokered.<\/p><p> The general European view is that we struggle for growth in the Union while up to 90% of future growth in the world economy will be outside of it.  Accordingly, we need trade agreements with growth economies such as the US, Japan, Korea, India and so forth.  Long-term European economic growth will be boosted if we can negotiate trade agreements.  Overall, it is reckoned that an additional 2% of gross domestic product could be obtained from such agreements with potential partners.<\/p><p> They have to be two-way agreements with mutual gains on both sides or else states will not sign up to them.  They are about bringing down barriers on both sides to ensure equal benefit to both.  There is a complaints mechanism if signatories feel the rules are not being applied.<\/p><p> Deputy Kyne asked why now.  It is the growth issue and the need for Europe to rebuild its economy.  Many European internal economies are going through fiscal correction and are not dynamic growth markets.  Clearly, there is an interest in the EU to getting better access to trading in other parts of the world where there is greater growth.<\/p><p> There will be no change in European policy on GM, genetically modified food, while the complete ban on hormone-treated beef and other meat will remain.<\/p><p> Progress in world trade negotiations on multilateral trade agreements has been virtually non-existent for the past decade.  In the Indonesian round last year, there were some modest changes.  That is why there have been more of these bilateral trade agreements.  If Europe starts to negotiate bilateral agreements, will it have an adverse effect on other trading partners, third countries?  Research showed it did not and that there were more growth opportunities than a displacement effect for third countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014052700005#D00600","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401201000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>When will the impact study of TTIP, transatlantic trade and investment partnership, on Ireland be completed and released?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014052700006#E00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1401201000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>It is expected in September but we will give some outlines in June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014052700006#E00300","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1401201000,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Will that deadline be extended, bearing in mind the agreement will not be concluded before the end of next year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014052700006#E00400","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1401201000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>No, this study is more about giving a framework so that we know the areas of greatest potential gain for Ireland and, accordingly, we can ensure our negotiators concentrate on these.

Its examination of these important tax issues is already making a significant contribution to the public and political debate.<\/p><p>  The use of the term \"global taxation\" by the sub-committee is well-informed.  There is no such thing as international tax - taxes are paid by companies to the sovereign governments which hold the taxing rights.  Ireland, like many other countries, charges companies to tax on the basis of their tax residence.  This concept of tax residence is fundamental to the issue under consideration today, namely, the interaction of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate income tax system with the rules and regimes in operation in other countries.  Companies which are incorporated, managed and controlled in Ireland are tax resident here and are subject to Irish corporation tax, irrespective of where their income arises.  Ireland&rsquo;s claim to corporation tax on the activities of companies which are not resident in Ireland - but which are active here by virtue of a branch operation - is sometimes overlooked.  Our corporation tax system is more transparent than other taxation systems which have higher headline tax rates but which also provide for significant deductions to arrive at taxable income and taxable profits.<\/p><p>  With the focus on Ireland's 12.5% corporation tax rate, the treatment of profits from companies when after-tax profits are distributed to shareholders and other stakeholders can be overlooked in the tax debate.  Ultimately, the profits of a company make their way to individuals and much of the global tax system aims at ensuring those profits are not taxed too many times along the way.  A clearly defined interaction of the Irish tax system with the tax regimes of other countries is, therefore, fundamental to international trade.  Ultimately, tax is a business cost for companies and it must be predicted and managed.  If our tax regime were to be too closed and protectionist, Irish companies simply would not be able to trade abroad and Ireland would not be an attractive destination for companies seeking to locate operations in this part of the world.  In that context, SAP Ireland and other companies made announcements about the creation of new jobs this morning.<\/p><p>  The main defining instrument for the interaction of Ireland's tax regime with other tax regimes in the world is the double taxation agreement, DTA.  The purpose of a double taxation agreement is in fact to eliminate double taxation, that is, the taxing by two sovereign governments of the same profits arising from the same activities of a company or for that matter, an individual taxpayer.  Double taxation agreements may have their flaws but they are vigorously negotiated between sovereign states, depending on the needs and aspirations of those states at a particular point in time.  Critics point out that such agreements can result in double non-taxation.  Another criticism involves so-called treaty shopping.  This is the idea that certain activities are better located in one country over another, not because of any commercial considerations but because of a more favourable treaty treatment of those activities.  Nevertheless, Ireland cannot tax income or assets which are outside its sovereign charge to tax.  It is no surprise, therefore, that debates concerning residence rules focus on the themes of residence in the context of the OECD base erosion and profiting shifting initiative.  I understand the Department of Finance launched a public consultation process in respect of the latter earlier this afternoon, which makes the discussion in which we are engaging particularly timely.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately our country's tax regime has become something of a target in the discussion of global tax policy.  This is unfair and unfounded.  We are not outliers in terms of our tax rules, they are grounded in over a century of common law practice and interpretation.  In particular, double taxation agreements are bilateral instruments.  In other words, they are agreements between sovereign nations.  Such agreements must work for both countries involved and can be changed where they do not do so.  Harmful tax practices are simply not a feature of the Irish tax landscape.  Harmful tax practices, as and when highlighted either by the OECD or the EU, have been changed by successive Ministers for Finance.  The Irish system has already been through the mill of good practice scrutiny.  That is why concepts such as the requirement to have a substantial presence in Ireland, anti-transfer pricing rules and exchange of information between revenue authorities are features of the Irish system.  We must always be mindful of our obligations under the EU treaties when contemplating any changes to our tax system.  That is not to say that there is not room for improvement.  Tax legislation and best practice can and must evolve, not least because many of the rules which apply predate the growth in cross-border trade and the pre-eminence of intellectual property on the balance sheets of multinational companies.<\/p><p>  I look forward to discuss this matter further with members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014052700003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Keegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401206400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I thank the sub-committee for inviting Christian Aid to make a presentation to it.  Christian Aid is an Irish development organisation which is involved in work in approximately 40 countries across the globe.  We have been working on tax and development for a number of years and became the first leading NGO to make it a major campaign priority in 2008.  Since then, the importance of tax justice has been recognised by the G20, the UN, the OECD, the IMF and by many large businesses.  In 2010 Christian Aid was identified as one of the 21 most influential organisations in the world of tax by International Tax Review.  Christian Aid is a member of the OECD informal task force on tax and development and the task force on financial integrity and economic development.  It is also a member of the European Commission's Platform for Tax Good Governance which was established in 2013.<\/p><p>  Since the 1950s, Ireland has been very successful in attracting foreign direct investment, FDI.  There are now more than 1,000 multinationals with operations in Ireland.  The corporation tax rate has been a central plank of this but other factors also contribute to making Ireland an attractive location, including a skilled workforce, an English-speaking population, membership of the EU and various other incentives such as tax credits for research and development carried out here.  I wish to highlight how some of these factors leave Ireland vulnerable to exploitation by some MNCs and pose a threat, therefore, to the country's international reputation, as well as to the development of some of the poorest countries in the world.  I will also argue that while considering Ireland&rsquo;s tax regime is important in understanding how we fit in globally, without having a more complete understanding of the workings and structures of multinational corporations themselves and the secrecy on which they depend, we are only ever going to see part of the picture.<\/p><p>  A 12.5% corporation tax rate makes Ireland an attractive destination for the legal processes of moving genuine economic activity to this country in order to avail of this rate.  Where activities of this nature are part of a multinational's supply chain, transfer pricing is used to assign the value and profits to the activities in Ireland.  However, research by Christian Aid and others has illustrated that an accurate application of the OECD's arm's length principle in transfer pricing is difficult to ensure.  Intra-company transactions between subsidiaries allows for highly subjective discretion in determining the price at which transactions take place.  This results in vast amounts of money being shifted between subsidiaries across the globe, including from those in countries of the global south.  It is particularly difficult to ensure compliance with the rules in respect of transactions involving intangibles such as intellectual property or management fees, which may not have a comparable price on the open market.  The latter is the basis of the arm's length principle.<\/p><p>  Christian Aid's research shows that the least developed countries of the world lose $160 billion each year as a result of transfer mispricing and false invoicing.  Further research looking at trade mispricing also showed that between 2005 and 2007, some $5.8 billion in mispriced capital flowed into Ireland.  Some $268 million of this came from the least developed countries in the world.  Prem Sikka, professor of accounting and director of the centre for global accountability at the University of Essex, makes the point (2010) that allowing companies to offset research and development expenditure against taxes makes it very attractive for them to have a research-and-development presence in Ireland.  However, according to Professor Sikka it is often highly subjective as to what constitutes research and development expenditure.<\/p><p>  Christian Aid acknowledges the strategic aims behind the research and development tax credit, namely, fostering innovation and research in Ireland and driving future employment and growth.  We also recognise the need for Ireland to remain competitive internationally in terms of attracting and retaining sustainable foreign direct investment.  However, in examining the architecture of Irish tax policy, consideration must also be given to the potential for our low corporation tax rate and our research and development credit to be used, or abused, in ways that may impact negatively both on our reputation and on the ability of developing countries to raise their own revenues.<\/p> <p>Through locating intellectual property rights in developed countries such as Ireland, multinationals have the ability to declare these intellectual properties rights as a large share of their profits on products developed and produced in other jurisdictions, including in developing countries.  Research and development tax credits, in reducing a company&rsquo;s effective tax rate, have the potential to incentivise multinationals to accumulate intellectual property rights in Ireland and represent a degree of moral hazard.<br \/>In September 2012, as reported by <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, the US Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Investigations found that Microsoft used subsidiaries in Ireland and elsewhere to reduce its US tax bill for 2011 by &euro;1.87 billion.  This was done in part by using the architecture of research and development tax credits and intellectual property rights in Ireland.  The subcommittee stated: &quot;Microsoft Corporation has used aggressive transfer pricing transactions to shift its intellectual property, a mobile asset, to subsidiaries in Puerto Rico, Ireland, and Singapore, which are low or no tax jurisdictions, in part to avoid or reduce its US taxes on the profits generated by assets sold by its offshore entities.&quot;<br \/>In 2001, Microsoft established a subsidiary, Round Island One Limited, operating from the offices of a Dublin law firm.  By 2004, Round Island controlled $16 billion of Microsoft's assets and gross profits of nearly $9 billion, approximately 22% of the company&rsquo;s global profits.  Much of Round Island&rsquo;s income comes from royalties and licensing fees for copyrighted software code that originated in the US.  Through another company, Flat Island Company, Round Island licenses rights to Microsoft software throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  Round Island has absorbed other Microsoft units, from Israel to India, moving much of that intellectual property to Ireland.<br \/>Colm Keena, writing in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>on this subject, noted: &quot;Seen from the perspective of Africans, it must seem very rum indeed to see profits from sales in their countries being taxed in Dublin, to fund a society a million miles away from theirs in terms of development&quot;.  However, arguably the most important elements of our tax policy for enticing multinational investment to Ireland are our extensive network of tax treaties and a relatively benign transfer pricing regime.  In theory, multinationals could base themselves out of one of the traditional tax havens of Europe, but doing so would place them outside of the global network of treaties available in Ireland and leave them vulnerable, for example, to any potential crackdown on tax havens.  Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union, however, and our network of over 60 tax treaties, in particular our tax agreement with the US, has encouraged numerous multinationals to use Ireland as a base to manage their operations in the Middle East and North Africa.  Considering the importance of our tax treaties, it is surely in our national interest to ensure their integrity is not threatened by a perception that we are engaging in harmful tax competition.  It is in our interest to ensure that elements of our tax regime are not contributing to such a perception.  For example, an Action Aid report from last year highlighted how Ireland&rsquo;s tax treaty with Zambia enabled a subsidiary of the giant food multinational ABF, called Illovo Sugar, with an address in the Irish Financial Services Centre but with no record of employees or activities in Ireland, to avoid paying withholding tax on loan payments from Zambia into Ireland, and likewise on management and purchasing fees booked in Ireland, an accusation that ABF rejects.<br \/>The impact of tax treaties on development is being increasingly debated internationally, by both developed and developing countries.  Mongolia, for example, has recently cancelled its double tax treaty with the Netherlands.  While the Netherlands is particularly in the spotlight following research suggesting its treaty network is costing developing counties more than &euro;700 million a year, it is at least beginning to acknowledge the problem and has offered to review its treaties with developing countries.  While Ireland does not have many tax treaties with developing countries, Ireland should seek to lead in this area and advocate for the need to establish principles and practices for development friendly tax treaties, both at national, EU and international levels.<br \/>In regard to our to our transfer pricing regime, allowing for retroactive challenges to inward transfer pricing as well as outward transfer pricing would bolster the integrity of our tax regime.  To explain, changes made to our transfer pricing rules in the Finance Act of 2010 granted powers to the Revenue authority to challenge suspected cases of transfer mispricing that aimed to minimise the amount of profit being transferred into Ireland.  Of course, instances of multinationals engaging in transfer mispricing to minimise the amount of profit recorded in a low tax jurisdiction such as Ireland would be highly unlikely and the changes in rules could be described as self-serving and designed to protect only Ireland&rsquo;s tax base.  Dr. Sheila Killian of the University of Limerick has made the point that it would be useful if the revenue authority were granted power to challenge retrospectively instances of suspected transfer mispricing into Ireland rather than just assume that what is being declared by the company in Ireland is the correct amount and not the result of transfer mispricing.  That would be especially helpful to developing countries, where weaker capacity-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014052700003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sorley McCaughey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401207000,"counter":328,"content":"<p>As a ten minute time limit was set for the opening addresses, I must ask Mr. McCaughey to wrap up.

Christian Aid certainly agrees with that assertion that taxation needs to be viewed as a global issue.  The policies of one country cannot be looked at in isolation when it is clear that these policies can have negative, albeit unintentional, consequences on other countries and, in particular, on those countries with less capacity to engage with multinational companies.  We also acknowledge that the international tax rules cannot be fixed by one state alone.  We contend though that there are certain things that Ireland can do to ensure we are putting our best foot forward, responding to the reputational damage we are experiencing and embracing all opportunities that present themselves to demonstrate the highest commitment to transparency, even if in cases that means going beyond what is the internationally accepted standard.  As we have learned from the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, initiative, adherence to the standards laid down by the OECD have been insufficient in some cases in curbing the problem of base erosion and profit shifting.<\/p><p>  What is clear and is uniformly acknowledged by the OECD, the Commission, the World Bank and the IMF is that it is developing countries that suffer most as a consequence of corporate secrecy and inadequate regulation.  While there is no suggestion that Ireland is deliberately setting out to deplete the resources of developing countries, which I hope has been made clear, there are gaps in the system that may result in Ireland inadvertently undermining the tax take of poor countries.  There is a clear moral responsibility on Ireland to ensure it is doing all in its power to close these gaps and honour its obligations to the poorest countries of the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014052700004#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sorley McCaughey"},{"type":"speech","time":1401207000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>To summarise where we are at and the purpose of this discussion, it is not purposeful for committee members to give their own opinions.

Committee members might be interested in the situation at a European level, but, ultimately, the issue at which we should be looking is whether Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with tax competition is having a negative and unsustainable impact on other economies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014052700005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sorley McCaughey"},{"type":"speech","time":1401207600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>That brings me to my next question.

A lot of what is possibly coming out of the OECD BEPS process is very positive, in particular in terms of country by country reporting.  It would be a requirement for multinational corporations to report on their activities on a country by country basis.  They would have to state how many employees they had, the assets they hdld, the sales they made, taxes paid and profits made.  From what we are led to believe, that is something very positive that could emerge from the process.<\/p><p>  The other issue that is positive is automatic information exchange.  Information is exchanged between jurisdictions only on a request basis, although there are instances of spontaneous information exchange.

I speak to colleagues around the world because Chartered Accountants Ireland has sister organisations in New Zealand and Australia.  Revenue is well ahead of the pack in its capacity to garner information from financial institutions because of Acts of the Oireachtas and then to exchange information, as necessary.  Other countries are not as well developed in this regard.  We would not want Irish taxpayers to be left out on a limb with information flowing that is not properly reciprocated, but we have no difficulty with information exchange in countering tax evasion, in particular.<\/p><p>  In terms of the development agenda, undoubtedly, there is a role for taxation.  We would not be as clear on the evils of double taxation agreements simply because they are agreements between sovereign nations entered into willingly.  The agreement with Zambia dates back to the early 1970s.  If it does not suit the Zambians, it is up to them to change or suspend it.

I wish to make a few points in that regard simply because the sub-committee chaired by Senator McCain made a number of specific recommendations.  It made five recommendations, three of which, in the context of a well known multinational with operations in Ireland, had to do with changing US domestic tax law, while the other two had to do with empowering the US inland revenue service to make more inquiries of its own taxpayers.  Even though the entire focus and the publicity surrounding the Senate investigation had to do with Ireland, the prominence of a major multinational and what it was doing in Ireland, the actual recommendations made by the US Senate committee had to do with US law and practice.  That is what it saw as fixing the problem and a useful point to remember.<\/p><p>  While I do not wish to constantly harp back, I keep coming back to the point that there is no such thing as international taxation.

What struck me about it was that the Irish tax system and the residency system we use is very much based on the system in the United Kingdom for obvious historical reasons.  The point that was giving people in the United Kingdom the greatest difficulty was legislation they had devised themselves to ensure that profits would be assessed where matters were managed and controlled, which was exactly the nexus of much of the debate that was taking place in the United Kingdom.  I derive two points from this.  First, the underlying reality does not always meet the headlines in this kind of coverage.

We have been calling for a long time for a country-by-country reporting requirement that will provide such information on a country-by-country basis.

I should declare an interest in that I am a member of Chartered Accountants Ireland.  However, I assure the witnesses this will not colour my questioning.  Members have heard two quite contrasting presentations from the two witnesses in attendance.  Mr. Keegan has presented quite a black-and-white picture that companies incorporated in Ireland and which are resident here by virtue of the management and control test are subject to the 12.5% rate on their worldwide income and he defends the current regime quite strongly.  Mr. McCaughey presents quite a different scenario and puts a lot of emphasis on profit shifting and transfer pricing.  I wish to tease out this issue because it really forms the nub of the debate.<\/p><p>  Everyone accepts that Ireland's system, in which the profits of companies resident here are taxed here and so forth, is all above board and is quite clear cut.  The issue that has dominated the debate concerns the movement of profits, that is, the shifting of profits from one jurisdiction to another to gain the maximum tax advantage.  I wish to try to go through this issue.  On the second page of his presentation, Mr. McCaughey made the point that because of our corporation tax rate of 12.5%, Ireland is an attractive destination for companies legally moving their profits here through transfer pricing arrangements in order that those profits ultimately reside here and are subject to our corporation tax rate.  Is there evidence for this or are there other jurisdictions in which the tax regime is even more favourable?  I thought the bigger problem was that Ireland is a link in the chain and is used as a channel through the royalty payment for intellectual property to result in profits ending up in jurisdictions that are commonly known as tax havens, even if they do not meet the OECD definition.  I refer to countries in which there is little or no corporation tax, whereas Ireland has a rate of 12.5%.  Is the bigger problem that Ireland is a link in a chain and is used to channel profits to the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and so forth or is it that profits are brought to Ireland through transfer pricing to avail of the 12.5% rate?  Are they both issues or is it clear cut as to which of them is a bigger problem from the witnesses' point of view?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014052700006#E00500","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1401208200,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Who wishes to respond first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014052700006#E00600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401208200,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I would be interested to hear what Mr. Keegan has to say in response to the first part of that question because the answer is - this is the part to which I seek Mr. Keegan's reaction - it is well known that Ireland is an attractive location for its low corporation tax rate, which attracts the booking of profits in the State.  However, in specific answer to the Deputy's question, I think it is both.  Ireland now has a reputation as a conduit country through which profits are routed and end up in some of these small island sunny states around the world in which no corporation tax at all is levied.  However, Ireland now is listed, along with the Netherlands and Luxembourg to a degree, as being a conduit country.  That is exactly as the Deputy described it, which is that the profits are routing through Ireland and ending up in Bermuda.  We know about the Dutch sandwich, in which profits are routed through the Netherlands in order that no withholding tax is paid on profits that ultimately will be booked in Bermuda, for example.  Consequently, it is both issues and the double Irish about which we have heard, as well as the Dutch sandwich, illustrate how this is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014052700006#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sorley McCaughey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401208200,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and while I do not know about black and white, I do know that one cannot be a little bit taxable.  One either is taxable or one is not.  If the Deputy bears with me for a moment, while we consider the overall structure, what happens is that a company pays tax at 12.5% but those after-tax profits must go somewhere.  In the case of a multinational, they typically will go back to a holding company and ultimately out to the shareholders.  When they go back to a holding company, they are taxed again and the holding company gets a credit for the Irish tax.  Consequently, for a lot of the structures that are under investigation, we actually are looking at a deferral of that final charge in the holding company.  The reason the so-called double Irish structure is used is not to not pay tax but to defer the payment of tax, admittedly sometimes indefinitely.  I would be giving very different answers to the Deputy if I thought for one minute that these structures were extinguishing a tax liability altogether.  They are not but are allowing multinational companies to leave profits offshore in order that those profits can be reinvested to further their European business.  We rightly think of tax incentives in terms of bringing business into this country.  In some states, the capital exporters, they think of using tax incentives to encourage their indigenous companies to go out into the broader marketplace.  This is what we are looking at in a lot of the instances of the double Irish.  I am merely reporting it as I see it.  I am not defending it but this is how I see it.<\/p><p>  The transfer pricing issue is a totally different kettle of fish.  Transfer pricing means a company is not paying an associated company a fair market price for its profits or services and, as a consequence of that, is leaving more profits in a low-tax jurisdiction, thereby reducing the overall tax bill on a permanent basis.  Therefore, there is a permanent loss.  This is a problem for governments everywhere.  It is not a huge problem for the Irish Government, as Mr. McCaughey pointed out, simply because our rate tends to be lower than that of everyone else.  However, this is not something that can be condoned.  Again, without wishing to be too black and white, because the issues are so difficult, there is an international standard for it.  Ireland has adopted that international standard and does not deserve to be kicked on the transfer pricing issue simply because it does not apply to us a lot of the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014052700006#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Keegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401208200,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I already have referred to the issue in respect of transfer pricing.

Putting aside the morality of all of this argument that these are merely the rules, if I was a shareholder in one of these companies, I would have been infuriated that the company is making a lot of profit and it is ending up in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Dutch West Indies or wherever, it is banked there and the bank account is getting bigger and bigger.  The sums out there are astronomical.

One can see a lot of finger-pointing over there and we are often at the receiving end.  However, the leadership of the OECD makes it quite clear that we are very transparent in regard to how we deal with our taxation matters.  Other countries have often been picked by the OECD chairmen when they are pointing the finger at countries like Ireland or the Netherlands.<\/p> <p>Their countries are not exactly perfect either.  If one looks at some of the stuff that has transpired from these meetings, we are more transparent than even the United Kingdom in some of our taxation matters.  Luxembourg is quite hostile regarding how taxation is dealt with.  Many of the taxation havens about which we talk - the ones in the Caribbean - are under the protection of the United Kingdom or the USA.<\/p><p> What transpires from all of this is that it will be very difficult to find a unilateral solution from any one country.  Unless all countries jump together, it is unlikely that anything significant will happen.  That is what seems to be coming out of the BEPS.  Unless the G20 and all OECD countries decide to work together, it is unlikely that anything significant will come out of it.  On the back of this, what has happened to the McCain recommendations?  I gather that the Revenue Commissioners have changed nothing in the couple of years since the recommendations were published.  Certainly, Congress has not published any legislation to change it.  In fact, some of the difficulties about which we are talking are the result of legislation which Congress passed in the mid-1990s.  I refer to the tick-the-box legislation of which Senator McCain was one of the advocates at the time.<\/p><p> When we talk about this issue, there is nothing Ireland can do on its own.  I will ask the delegates for their opinions on this, although they may not be able to answer.  They are here to discuss taxation issues.  The worst accusation that can be made against Ireland is that it is a conduit for money which moves in and out.  This has become an international issue as we are really talking about the value of intellectual property.  Is that not how much of this has come to a head?  Intellectual property is given a value by a holding company in one of the tax havens, which generates the issue.  Many countries are recognising these huge amounts of money which are being held in offshore accounts.  There was a very deliberate policy by countries.  Companies using the retained profits could not only push their own agenda but, in some respects, push that of a nation.  This seems to have become an issue only in recent years.  Is this due to the huge amounts of money about which we talk in terms of retained profits and because it is so easy to put a value on intellectual property rights that one can make up oneself?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014052700009#H03500","speaker":"1095","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401210600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>The Deputy is right that this is not something Ireland can do unilaterally.

I agree with him that it has become labyrinthine.  It is worth making the point that tax legislation is essentially driven by three factors.  It is driven by Government policies and as a response to and in anticipation of business developments.  As global business becomes more complex, the system is becoming more complex.  Equally, there is no doubt that the joining up of activity between the various revenue authorities is absolutely unprecedented.  There is the Forum on Tax Administration comprising the revenue authorities of OECD member countries and a number of others.  It is chaired by the Irish, which should be a matter of some pride to us.  It is a genuine attempt to co-ordinate that kind of labyrinthine legislation and make it navigable.<\/p><p>  In terms of who benefits from labyrinthine legislation, my suggestion is that nobody benefits.  The vast majority of my profession are employed in business.  They are the people who operate the PAYE and VAT systems and collect fiduciary taxes in respect of the Government tax take.

My first question relates to the Irish context.  Should we limit the abilities of companies to use or avail of tax provisions in other countries and with other treaties?  Should companies pay tax in the location of their assets or workers, as is now the case, or in the location of their customers?  I would be interested in hearing Mr. McCaughey's response to the next question because there is a social commentary dimension to the work of his organisation.  The question might be relevant to Mr. Keegan as well in terms of what is the best solution.  Are they looking for a universal code of practice on the global architecture of taxation, which is a one-size-fits-all approach?  Alternatively, are they suggesting that there need to be some agreed baselines across the global structure and that nations can decide their own corporation tax rates inside that global structure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014052700012#L01500","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401211800,"counter":491,"content":"<p>The first two questions are particularly interesting.  I will answer the second question first because it is germane to the answer to the first question.  The question of whether companies should pay tax in the location of their assets is a fundamental ongoing debate.  What it really boils down to is the question of whether a company pays tax where it does the work or where the market is.  There have been several attempts over the years to achieve one or the other.  The EU had a project running for several years that was called the common consolidated corporate tax base.  One of the ideas behind it was that companies would pay a proportion of their tax where their market was located as distinct from where the product was manufactured.  It is an issue that is very much to the fore in the BEPS discussions at the moment where there is a suggestion that there should be more tax attributable to the location of the market, particularly in the context of digital goods and services.  The difficulty for a country like Ireland which has a big manufacturing base and a relatively small market is that this will erode our tax take.  How would it be achieved?  It would primarily be achieved through the modification of provisions in the tax treaties, primarily the concept of permanent establishment and where companies are located.<\/p><p>  My last observation on this, which may be germane to the third point, is that there seems to be a strong move internationally towards the prevalence of consumption taxes, what we called value added tax, which in a sense addresses that point because it renders a level of taxation in the country where the market typically is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014052700012#L01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1401211800,"counter":492,"content":"<p>From the get go?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014052700012#L01700","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401211800,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Yes.

That said, we need to see a system introduced that is reflective of the particular concerns of developing countries and which enables them to factor in and be a part of that system.

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss with the Irish Medical Organisation its Help us to Help More campaign, which is designed to highlight the important role played by general practice in delivering health care.  According to the IMO, every year more than 22 million clinical consultations take place between GPs and patients, making general practice the most frequently consulted part of the health system.  Among the issues the campaign is trying to promote are a fivefold increase in the portion of the health budget spent on general practice with a corresponding plan for increased patient services, a commitment to ensuring the preservation of a community-based same day appointment service for general practice, and an agreed strategy for the development of general practice in the coming decade with a particular focus on extending the range of services provided through general practice.<\/p><p>  I welcome Dr. Ray Walley, vice president and chair of the GP committee of the IMO; Dr. Illona Duffy, a member of the IMO GP committee; and Ms Vanessa Hetherington, assistant director of policy and international affairs.

The IMO launched the campaign in November 2013 to highlight the potential for general practice to do more for the health care services and how we can do so with careful planning, adequate resources and meaningful negotiation.  General practice can deliver 21st century care that is free at the point of access to all patients.<br \/>What is good about general practice?  We have 2,414 GPs delivering care to almost 2 million General Medical Services patients.  A total of 24 million clinical consultations take place every year with 1 million out-of-hours consultations also taking place.  A total of 95% of all consultations are dealt with by a GP without the need for referral to secondary care.  We are there when patients need us.  We deliver a same-day service, 24-7, 365 days a year.  GPs are committed to change and development.<br \/>A number of issues arise with general practice.  The workload has increased while resources have been savagely cut.  The number of patients with medical cards and GP visit cards has increased by 500,000 over the past six years while resources have been cut by &euro;160 million per year, which is a cumulative total of &euro;434 million.  This is a reduction of 38% in funding to general practice, compared with an 18% reduction in other parts of the health care service.  The Government spends just 2.3% on general practice out of total health expenditure, public and private, compared with 9% in the UK.  Practices are struggling financially and in terms of capacity.  GPs are frustrated with an out-of-date 40 year old contract.  Since the Competition Authority intervened in 2006, general practice has stagnated and there have been no new initiatives or developments.  There has been no engagement.  Morale among GPs is at an all-time low.  There is a serious manpower crisis.  Young GPs choose to emigrate while older GPs see no viable future.<br \/>I have included a number of quotes from a professor of general practice and primary health care in the US, Barbara Starfield.  She stated that evidence-based studies show that primary care, in contrast to specialty care, is associated with a more equitable distribution of health in populations, a finding that holds in cross-national and in-national studies.  She also stated:<blockquote>The supply of primary care physicians was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality, whereas a greater supply of specialty physicians was associated with higher mortality.  When the supply of primary care physicians was disaggregated into family physicians, general internists, and paediatricians, only the supply of family physicians showed a significant relationship to lower mortality.<\/blockquote>The term &quot;primary care physicians&quot; is from the US and our equivalent is &quot;general practitioners&quot;.<br \/>General practice is at the centre of strong health care systems, such as those in the UK, the Netherlands and Denmark, where access to GP services is provided on an equitable basis across the population and where a greater proportion of the health care budget is spent on GP services and ancillary primary care services.  The Government's goal is to deliver GP care which is free at the point of access to the total population.  The IMO is in the vanguard of supporting this, but it requires careful planning, appropriate resourcing and meaningful negotiation.<br \/>Planning for the provision of GP services free at the point of access requires careful analysis of demographics trends.  Ireland has an ageing population and, by 2021, there will be an extra 200,000 people over 65 years of age.  It also requires careful analysis of manpower needs, including the required number of GPs and other practice staff per 1,000 population.  Priorities based on medical evidence must be established.  Clinical service and visitation rates must be defined.  Visitation rates are higher among older people and those with long-term conditions.  In addition, visitation rates increase when access to GP care does not require out-of-pocket expenses.  The ancillary workload must be defined.  Realistic timelines for implementation must be developed with appropriate cost analysis.<br \/>Appropriate resources for general practice are required to ensure sufficient manpower levels.  Ireland is facing a shortage of GPs.  Approximately 240 GPs, or one in eight, in the country are 64 years or older.  More than 4,000 doctors are registered in the United Kingdom and the majority are general practitioners.  Over the past four years, 1,049 Irish-trained GPs have taken up general practitioner principal posts in the National Health Service.  We need appropriate levels of medical, nursing and practice support staff.  Successive cuts under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act have led to cuts in employment hours of practice staff.  We need access to allied health and social services in primary care.  At present, waiting lists apply to access to all allied health and social services in primary care for GMS patients, and many of these services are simply not available for those without a medical card.  We need appropriate infrastructure.  Premises, medical and diagnostic equipment and IT requirements must be fit for purpose.  The real and specific needs of rural and deprived areas must be provided for.  Allowances should be made for opt-in to enhanced services as many GPs have training in other specialist areas.<br \/>Free GP care requires real negotiation.  Since the inception of the GMS in 1972, the IMO has negotiated with Department of Health and the HSE publicly funded contracts which have stood the test of time.  These include the GMS contract, the mother and infant scheme, GP visit cards and out-of hours co-operatives which have delivered value for money to the State, quality services for patients and a service that works.  GP services have a 97% patient satisfaction rate.<br \/>Negotiation benefits all parties.  The Department of Health will acquire GP knowledge and expertise as to what can work in general practice.<\/p> <p>It ensures GPs can deliver care in a safe, effective and sustainable way, patients remain at the centre of care, legitimacy is enhanced, implementation is smooth and delivers a standard and equitable service to all patients, and both parties have an interest in making it work and ensuring success.<br \/>The Government is fully aware that legal proceedings are being initiated by the Competition Authority against the IMO.  The position is that the IMO is a registered trade union with a negotiating licence and, therefore, is entitled to fully represent its members in all aspects of negotiation.  The position of the Competition Authority and the Government is that the IMO cannot negotiate on behalf of its members on price.  A former Attorney General, Mr. Paul Gallagher, stated the following in 2012:<blockquote>I believe that the Competition Authority's position is wrong as a matter of law and that this stance has created significant uncertainty on the part of the representative bodies with regard to what they can and cannot do and has created significant difficulties for Government in implementing the necessary changes. &hellip; GPs were all charging the same fees to the Government for the medical card services and therefore the idea that they were somehow combining on price by entering into negotiations is difficult to understand.  There was never any prospect of the Government being able to negotiate independently with GPs to achieve differential pricing.<\/blockquote>That shows that there is no impediment to negotiation and it is in the interest of all parties.<br \/>The IMO calls on the Government to do the following: agree a strategy for the development of general practice services for the whole population with a focus on extending the range of services provided, provide adequate resources to support the strategy, and agree an action plan to address the manpower needs in general practice.<br \/>The importance of general practice is evidenced in Holland which has invested in general practice for 30 years.  That underpins the provision of universal care in Holland and acts as an appropriate gatekeeper.  The international belief is that the system works but needs resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014052700003#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ray Walley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401211500,"counter":511,"content":"<p>As nobody from Fianna F&aacute;il is present, I call Deputy McLellan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014052700004#D00200","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1401211500,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I thank the delegation for its presentation.

It is great to have this discussion.  I read the presentation and want to understand more by asking one or two questions.  First, Dr. Walley stated in his presentation that GP care is provided 24-7, 365 days a year.  However, a continuum and continuity of care is very often provided by a different GP or an out-of-hours GP.  I have lived in Belgium which has a system of more medical practices and they retain a person's file, thus providing a continuum of care.  I have had some bad experiences where somebody was seen by a person who had no idea of the patient.  I found the line \"We deliver ... 24-7, 365 days a year\" interesting and I want to understand more about the system.<\/p><p>  Dr. Walley talked about being at full capacity, which I appreciate.  What should be done to develop GP services?  He said that one in eight GPs are 64 years or older.  What steps can be put in place to encourage the development of a proper GP service?  Dr. Walley continued by talking about investment in premises and that infrastructure \"must be fit for purpose\".  Is the IMO looking for the State to bring GPs together? Perhaps everybody else knows that information.  Is there a scheme to facilitate the infrastructural investment and where it is to come from?  Is Dr. Walley talking about primary care centres?  Does the IMO want greater involvement by GPs in that type of system?  Dr. Walley's answers will inform me and help me understand more about the sector.<\/p><p>  I love statistics but was impressed with Dr. Walley's statement that \"GP services have a 97% patient satisfaction rate\".  What is the basis of that statistic?  What were the patients satisfied with?  We have often heard at this committee that everybody is very satisfied once they get the care, but problems can occur with access to care and getting answers.  I am surprised the figure is so high.  GPs do a fabulous job but many times people have been left seeking a prognosis or answer.  GPs do not have a magic wand so cannot always answer their questions.  I want to understand a little bit more about the 97% satisfaction rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014052700004#D00400","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1401211500,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Walley for his presentation.  I fully support what was said about the Competition Authority's decision being incorrect.  Is the pending legal challenge likely to be heard and dealt with before the end of this year?  We need the matter to be clarified.  I do not agree with the decision and it has caused a lot of frustration.<\/p><p>  I want to touch on the cost of health care.  In excess of &euro;3 billion has been taken out of the health budget over recent years.  A lot of pressure was created by the level of taxation being collected, especially from 2010 onwards, and meant that a lot of budgets were cut such as education.  The budget ha been substantially increased due to the fact that the cost of medications was left unchecked.  Over a period of ten years the cost increased from &euro;560 million to more than &euro;2 billion a year.  This year the budget will not be much under &euro;2 billion.  If we want to increase the funding provided for GP services, we will have to make savings elsewhere.  One of the areas where we must make savings is on the cost of drugs, particularly when some medications are four to five times more expensive here than in other EU countries.  We have brought in the long overdue legislation on generic drugs.  From the point of view of practitioners, what else can we do to make savings in terms of the cost of medication?  Any savings could be given to members of the IMO and would improve practices.  How does the IMO see the matter developing over the next few years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014052700004#D00500","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1401211500,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation.

I have questioned its decision but did not receive an answer.  I spent 20 years dealing with trade unions in a former life.  There is no problem with IBEC being a trade union and negotiating as an employers' organisation.  Why is the IMO treated differently?<\/p><p>  There have been improvements in general practice but there are concerns about the treatment and identification of people with mental health issues.  Can the IMO comment on the matter?  The training of GPs has improved significantly.<\/p> <p>I know that a GP cannot give the time to fully explore a difficulty if a person has a mental health issue because of the busy nature of the practice.

What I am going to say in regard to our engagement with the Minister is quite terse.  Basically, we are in discussion with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, and our agreed comment on it has been that we have had useful talks and that the process continues.  I do not want to jeopardise that in any way, but the talks continue.<br \/>In regard to a preventative role, one area where general practitioners feel constrained is in providing preventative medicine.  We have time-bombs in regard to the development of diabetes and obesity and other health care issues.  Certainly, it is part of our training as hospital doctors coming through the system and going into general practice.  General practice training in this country continues for four years and involves medicine and other areas of paediatrics, obstetrics and so on but the problem is that within the current contract we cannot use those skillsets.  Pilots have been conducted in Ireland on, for example, diabetes shared care and these have been progressed considerably to the point where they are almost at contract level.  The evidence with the pilots is that not only do we provide better care and better statistics in regard to mobility and mortality than the hospitals - that is not to dismiss what the hospitals do as they do not have the resources either - but there is no reason the majority of this work cannot be done in communities.  General practitioners work in each community throughout the country and there is no reason people have to travel to a hospital for the majority of diabetic care.<br \/>Savings can be made in diabetic care.  Given that renal dialysis costs &euro;100,000 per year and that the most common cause of renal failure is diabetes, if one was to delay its progression by six months that is a saving of &euro;50,000.  The most common cause of blindness is also diabetes.  The social benefit of reducing the progression of blindness is phenomenal, not to mention the monetary cost.  Those are issues on which we wish to use our skillsets but there are many other areas where we could do that, such as in cardiovascular health, mental health and so on.  As there is an explosion of elderly people coming down the line we want to be involved in dealing with stroke prevention, dementia prevention and so on which can be dealt with in general practice.<br \/>An issue mentioned was bottlenecks in access to diagnostics.  Due to the withdrawal of resources, many general practitioners do not have access to 24 hour blood pressure machines.  For example, in my local area - I refer to Beaumont Hospital - there is a four-month waiting time for that, which is extending.  If a person was to purchase such a machine in private health care it will cost in the order of &euro;180.  Hypertension is very common and a risk factor for stroke, diabetes in conjunction with other illnesses, and dementia, therefore it is important that we have access to it.<br \/>On the issue of the shortage of general practitioners, recently the committee may have read that for the first time ever the number of general practice posts applied for in training was deficient in numbers.  We have 157 training posts for general practitioners.  These are four-year contracts.   They are contracts where a person knows where he or she will be for the next four years.  For the first time ever we have only 150 suitably trained applicants for those 157 posts.  We are haemorrhaging young doctors.  Not only are they leaving when they qualify, they are not even willing to stay to do their raining here because they are being sourced by locum agencies throughout the English speaking world to go to Australia, Canada and the UK.  Of more concern is that for the first time we are losing middle-aged general practitioners.  A couple of weeks ago 25 general practitioners left for Qatar.  We are aware of that because there was a large group of individuals involved but three, four and five people in their mid-fifties are leaving for places such as Canada.  The average age of a general practitioner here is 52 years.  <br \/>We have got to ensure we retain our existing general practitioners, of whom there are  2,414.  We need to retain the one in eight GPs, who is over 64 years of age because most of them want to work.  However, they want to work without having to deal with all the difficulties in the system.  The committee will have read of all the difficulties in the UK and there are similar difficulties here.  There are difficulties with burn-out because of the workload implications.  People are working 12-hour days.  People are arriving at work before their staff and leaving after their staff.  It is not an attractive job but it is a job we all love and do and we all want to work in our communities.  Putting more training posts in place will not resolve the position.  We need to ensure we can retain the existing general practitioners.  This issue has been looked in the McCraith report into which the IMO has had an imput.<br \/>With regard to the GPs who are applying for the training posts, the most common reason given for not wishing to take up a GP training post here was the uncertainty for the future.  The present generation travels easier, are more confident to travel, and are more likely to stay where they go.  The majority are trained by the time they arrive.  They get into the workforce early, find their feet, have a family and after four or five years they want to get citizenship for their children.  After they remain for seven or eight years they are less likely to come back.  I know that as I was one of those individuals who emigrated in 1990.  The difference was I emigrated for my training.  Nowadays, the majority who emigrate are trained and are less likely to come back.  That is a very expensive loss of a resource besides the fact that one would expect the community to stay and look after its own community. <br \/>On the issue of off-loading workload, a high proportion of us work in teams with practice nurses and secretaries.  Secretaries do the work of secretaries and nurses do the work of nurses while GPs do the work of GPs.  We have always worked in teams.  In recent years, the HSE has realised that primary care teams exist.  We have always dealt with them and we have all embraced changed.  All our CME is done outside of our working hours, between 5 p.m. and 9 a.m.  We are engaged in education all the time.  General practice here is of a high quality and we want to continue to prove that.  We want to work in teams within our general practice and within primary care but both must be funded.  In these systems of work, 10% goes to general practice and 10% goes to primary care teams.  Anything outside the hospital and outside the GP surgery is primary care.  All of it, general practice and primary care, adds up to community care.  There is a need to resource the public health nurses, social workers, occupational therapists and speech therapists because if they are not available they come back to the general practice.  We can only do our own job. <br \/>In regard to continuity of care, I was a founding chairperson of the D-Doc out of hours service.  I brought my skillset from the UK where I was one of the individuals who set up Brightdoc in Brighton.  The majority of shifts in D-Doc, which is the same as other co-operatives throughout the country, are done by general practitioners where, through economies of scale, we cover a population of 0.5 million people.  We have a visiting service for those who cannot come to the surgery and as a result, the majority of the care is provided by GPs local to the community.  Certainly, we do not have the manpower to do all those hours.  We no longer want people working 24 hours.  If one is working those hours, one is more likely to make a mistake.  Those reports are faxed back to the individual GP who looks at it.  I had a lady one night recently who had a problem.  The GP who was seeing it thought it was acute but to me, who knows the lady, I was able to engage with somebody else to say this is a repeated problem which we need to deal with elsewhere.  In that way the person concerned got more appropriate care.  All of that amounts to continuity of care with appropriate use of IT technology.  That is not to say one cannot improve.<br \/>In regard to the 97% satisfaction rate, I am pleased to say that comes from a State organisation, the Medical Council.  It is similar to the previous study which showed a 93% satisfaction rate the previous year.<\/p> <p>When the HSE conducts its studies, they are also over 80%.  The last one they did was three or four years ago, and it was in the order of 84%.  They are coming from State organisations that we do not influence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014052700005#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ray Walley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401212700,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Is that with one's GP?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014052700006#F00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401212700,"counter":523,"content":"<p>It is with one's general practitioner.<br \/>We have a capacity problem because, for example, there are next to no locum general practitioners.  Not only are the general practitioners who are trained moving on, but they are going to more attractive areas, such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, and as a result we have lost the spare capacity in general practice.  It has become an unattractive job because of a withdrawal of resources.  As I stated, we are on 2.3% of the State's spend whereas the equivalent is 9% in the United Kingdom, 10% in Holland and 10% in Australia.<br \/>In regard to premises, many general practitioners over the years have invested in premises, many of which are high quality and fit for purpose.  We agree that one needs to invest in premises where the need is there, but we want to scotch this view that we can do cardiac surgery, appendicectomies and all of those procedures that patients still need to go to hospital for.  We can only provide general practice care.  One will still have patients attending in casualty.  A recent study in the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i>within the past week looked at the appropriateness of referral to casualty and the accident and emergency physicians who would like to be saying they are getting the wrong patients presented in casualty.  However, it was found that the appropriate patients are being referred to casualty.  I would say in the majority of cases that is so in Ireland as well, but the problem is, because general practice is starting to fray at the edges, many of the issues that should be going to casualty could be dealt with in general practices where we had the resources.  That is something that we can improve on.<br \/>The majority of premises are fit for purpose.  Where investment is needed it should occur in conjunction with talking to the local general practitioner to ascertain whether he or she has the ability to invest or whatever.  They are the practitioners based in their own community.<br \/>In regard to drug savings, much of the pricing of medicines is not in our control.  It is dealt with between the pharmacy lobby, be it the pharmaceutical companies and the pharmacists, and the Department of Health.  We see, as part of chronic care, that one can have integrated heath care models whereby one can ensure that there is more appropriate prescribing, but that is all part of chronic care regimes.  For example, one has this in the United Kingdom.  Moneys have been invested back into general practice in regard to savings where there is a recognition - this is something recognised by the troika - that there are incentives to ensure that general practitioners are willing to meet the workload.  As was stated earlier, we only have a ten minute consultation and at times that is reducing, and there is an insatiable appetite for health care.  We can provide so much in a consultation but we must ensure that we prioritise what is most appropriate at the time and within our resources.<br \/>In regard to mental health, there is a pilot in the United Kingdom in regard to general practice being a more engaged area of mental health.  It is something that we are not averse to.  All of those prescriptions are still coming from the general practitioner and much of the reviews, physically, are coming from the general practitioner, but what we would like is a more integrated chronic care model to ensure that we can improve on that.  Whatever we are doing, we can do better but we need more resources for it.  I will ask Dr. Duffy to come in here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014052700006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ray Walley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401212700,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Deputy McLellan mentioned the check-ups.  I suppose check-ups were one of the matters that were part of the contract for those aged under six.  There is very little evidence to support the view that they will help.  The big issue we must be careful of is that we do not end up filling up the time-slots and the face-to-face GP and patient time with box-ticking exercises.  That, to an extent, is what has happened in the United Kingdom where one cannot be seen with a sore throat but one's baby will be seen in order to have its weight and length measured.  We cannot let it happen there.  We also have all of that work being done in the public health system through the public health nurses and through the public health doctors.  At present, that is the least of our worries.<\/p><p>  Bottlenecks, the congestion the Deputy mentioned and diagnostics are huge issues issue around the country.  We are seeing difficulties in access to diagnostics.  With simple diagnostics, such as ultrasound, where a general practitioner has somebody with tummy pain and wants to check whether the patient has gallstones, one cannot merely refer the patient in many areas of the country to get an ultrasound done.  The patient must be referred to a surgical clinic.  In many areas, the patient may wait nine to 12 months to get to that clinic when all he or she needs is an ultrasound for the general practitioner to make the diagnosis and then, appropriately, send the patient to see whether he or she needs surgery done.  We are clogging up the system by not letting us have access to those systems.<\/p><p>  As to why GPs are leaving, it is, as Dr. Walley stated, about stability and security.  That is what they are not being provided with in Ireland at present.  The impact of that is already hitting.  I work in Monaghan where two GP practices have GP partners about to go on maternity leave - one in July and one in August.  One of the practices is a two-doctor practice and that means it will lose a doctor.  The other is a six-doctor practice and it will lose a doctor.  They cannot find a doctor to do the maternity cover in those practices.  Already, they are saying that they cannot tell the doctor she cannot take maternity leave.  The doctors will go on maternity leave.  What they will have to do is reduce access of service to patients.  It will mean, especially in the case of the two-doctor practice, that they will be down to half-doctor time and that is not sustainable in the long term.  This is the first time we are seeing this hitting home.  Up until now, it has been that GPs merely have not taken holidays because they cannot get somebody to replace them but now, when we are seeing instances of maternity leave and sick leave, what is going to happen and where is that going to lead to?<\/p><p>  I understand completely where Senator van Turnhout is coming from on out-of-hours cover and continuity, but, as Dr. Walley stated, we must get to a stage where it is safe for GPs to be working day time and night time, and we cannot have them doing both.  My dad was a GP and I grew up with him working through the night, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014052700006#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ilona Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1401212700,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I do not expect both.

The position has improved.  The big improvement with the out-of-hours services being more organised now is that it is GPs providing the service.  It is not merely locum agencies, where it is hospital doctors or doctors flying in from abroad to do weekend sessions, which is what is happening in the United Kingdom.  In the United Kingdom, one does not know whether one is seeing a GP; one is seeing a doctor.  There is a huge difference between a parent with a sick child seeing a doctor who specialises in obstetrics and gynaecology, and them seeing a GP who recognises a sore throat and realises the child does not need to be admitted for intravenous antibiotics.<\/p><p>  It is important that we develop and protect the out-of-hours cover.  However, we are struggling with that.  As the day-time work becomes busier and GPs are having to work longer and later, they are not in a position to do as many shifts.  We are struggling with that.<\/p><p>  Dr. Walley covered infrastructure.  On the 97% satisfaction rate, one of the big reasons we have that is we provide choice.  One can choose who one's GP is here.  If one lives in the United Kingdom, one does not have that same choice; one is allocated to a practice.  I have a sister and a brother who have been in the United Kingdom and my sister was four months on a waiting list to get a GP practice.  She was told the practice she must join, which was in her catchment area.  However, they said that they did not have space on it yet and they would let her know when they do.  Any time she got sick, she was told to go to accident and emergency.  We do not want that to happen here.  This is a big issue, be it one person with a medical card or a private patient.  Patients must have the ability to move around and choose a GP who is to one's liking and with whom one gets on.<\/p><p>  Senator Colm Burke raised the cost of health care and the medication.  Professor Michael Barry, who is professor of pharmacoeconomics in Trinity, has been working on the preferred drug prescribing scheme with the HSE.  One of his tasks has been to go around the country.  One of my roles is in medical education for the GPs, as Dr. Walley mentioned already.  Professor Barry has been all over the country meeting GPs, talking about this and asking how can we get drug costs down.  It is clear that we have a finite budget.  We are aware of that.  New developments and new medication are always more expensive.  If we can save money in medications that are coming off patent and will become generic drugs, that is all to our benefit because it will mean we can have more drugs for the cancer patients, MS patients, etc.  The difficult is, as the Senator stated, that prices have been arranged, and that needs to be looked at.  Why can one go to Spain and get six months' supply of medication for the same cost as a month's here?  Why can my patients in Monaghan ask me to give them a prescription so that they can go across the Border rather than buying it here?  That needs to be addressed.  However, GPs are wholeheartedly engaging in that and have been meeting with Professor Barry to look at it throughout the country.<\/p><p>  Hospitals must become responsible with prescribing.  We all are fully aware that there is one particular stomach tablet that is prescribed by most of the hospitals, and there are reasons for that.  However, that means every time one refers a patient he or she comes home with one brand of medication only.  It is difficult for us in the community to try breaking that, yet it has cost implications.<\/p><p>  Finally, in response to Deputy Neville, mental health takes time.  We are the first port of call for many patients.  We conducted a study in our practice to look at how many patients who were on antidepressants were attending psychiatry as well and 80% of those on antidepressants in our practice only see us.  We are managing them.  One of the reasons that has improved for us, and why we are able to hold on to those patients and look after them, was the introduction of primary care access to psychology services.<\/p> <p>Something that started out as a fantastic resource for us, now has a waiting list of 15 months.  That is happening because of cuts and moratoriums on the hiring or rehiring of staff who are on leave, including sick leave.  We now find that we cannot get access to those services which we know will work to help the patient and also help us to manage them in a primary care setting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014052700006#F00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ilona Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401213300,"counter":528,"content":"<p>We also need to learn lessons from the United Kingdom where they have a nine-to-five contract.  All their funding, 10% of the budget, goes to a nine-to-five contract.  Ours goes to a 24-7 contract.  In the UK the problem is that when general practitioners gave up the out of hours service, they lost control of the out of hours system so there was no continuity.  As a result of that, two thirds of all out of hours consultations are done by people flying in to do shifts.  We still have continuity care.<\/p><p>  One of the findings from the Francis report in Mid Staffordshire Hospital about two years ago, was an estimate - the sad thing is that it is an estimate, because they cannot even be specific - that up to 1,500 people passed away in terrible, atrocious conditions where the care was substandard.  As a result of that they brought in a system whereby one would have a named GP for everybody over 75.  We still have a named GP system here, whereby matters come out to a specific GP.  Even though we are getting a quarter to one fifth of the resources, the level of care we are providing is as good, but we want a modern contract.<\/p><p>  A professor of general practice recently came from the UK to take up a job in Cork.  He complimented without qualification the general practice in this country because the strength of it is the personalised continuity of care.

I do not know whether I have questions or comments, but I will make them anyway, although the witnesses may not like some of them.  I am one of the 95% of patients who express a high satisfaction rating with their GP.  I have been going to the same GP for the last 37 years, and I am not 37 so people can do the calculations.  Since I moved house I have been with the same GP.  I have been very satisfied with that GP and so have the rest of my family who attend him.  I would give him 100%.<\/p><p>  General practice does not always offer a same day service, so people may have to make an appointment.  They do not turn up in their GP's practice, whether it is public or private, and have immediate access.  I receive complaints from people who may have a sore throat or whose baby is unwell, but who are offered a doctor's appointment in three days time.  I would not specifically agree with the statistics mentioned earlier.<\/p><p>  Only 2% of the health budget is allocated to general practice.  We cannot compare the UK to Ireland which is a smaller country with a smaller population.  Some 60 million people live in Britain, so it is not practical to compare 2% of our budget to 9% of the UK's.<\/p><p>  It was stated that doctors only get &euro;10 per month for GP card patients.  I am not sure how many medical card applicants GPs are allowed to have.  Is it 100, 200, 300 or 600?  I am not too sure.  I would imagine the more one has, the more money one takes in.  It is like any business.  When more money is taken in, it is up to business people to allocate it to what they think is more important.<\/p><p>  We should all remember that health in this country is dismal because people themselves make it dismal.  There is no proper health promotion.  People are being diagnosed with different things, particularly young people who are suffering from obesity.  That needs to be identified and dealt with because that is where a young person's health begins.<\/p><p>  From the time my children were born they had their dinner at the table.  They never sat with a plate on their knees watching television.  They were never allowed to bring their dinner to the bedroom.  They always sat at the table.  To this day, we still use that practice at home.  In a busy working day, the only time a family can be together is at dinner time.<\/p><p>  The way we use our resources makes us healthy.  I grew up in a home where we had dinner at the dining table.  It is very important but a lot of children do not grow up in homes like that now.  Many children are eating much more fast food than ever before, so we should be promoting healthier eating.  That would help to combat the rise in the number of people having to bring their children to GPs.<\/p><p>  In recent weeks, while canvassing, I met a lady who was very critical of the Government and many aspects of the health service.  She did say, however, that once one gets into the system, one is well looked after.  I have to agree with that.  It is because we have a wealth of expertise in accident and emergency units and elsewhere in the health system.  That expertise also includes general practitioners.  That lady told me she had been in hospital for a couple of weeks.  Before she went into hospital she was on 40 tablets but she left the hospital only taking 20, having been analysed medically there.  When writing prescriptions for their patients, GPs have a responsibility to try to limit the amount of medication.  It is tough on older people with medical cards who have to pay a &euro;2.50 prescription charge for each item.  If doctors properly identified the required prescriptions, there would be no need for some people to be on the amount of medication they take.  That point came across to me on the doorsteps when we were canvassing.<\/p><p>  Why do young GPs leave the country?  A fairly good friend of mine is leaving the country the week after next.  He is going to work in Australia.  He is a young doctor who has come through the system, but he is going away because he said his chances of ever being promoted in this country, particularly in the hospital ethos, are slim because of consultants.  Consultants have things wrapped up for themselves in a nice tight little bow, and they do not want to encourage young doctors to get on.  The young doctor said that if he goes away, there will be a great opportunity for him to climb the ladder more quickly.  That is a sad reflection on us as a society.  It is also a sad reflection on how our health service is run.<\/p><p>  Can anybody tell me the average earnings of a GP?  I have been trying to find this out for months but I cannot discover it.  I am not too sure whether the witnesses can answer that question.<\/p> <p>I am bewildered by the whole episode.  I would have loved if my children could have had medical cards when they were growing up, when they were under five years of age.  In my view, children need to see the doctor because they are frequently sick in the period from birth until they are in primary school.  If the under-six GP medical card is introduced we must ensure it is used well because there is a need for it.

I am concerned that people are being over-prescribed or where regular reviews of their medication is not being carried out.  For example, my 92 year-old grandmother had two kitchen presses full of medication.  I am not a doctor but I am not sure that her medication was ever reviewed.

The IMO appeared before the health committee four years ago in March 2010.  We spent a year and a half advising there was a problem with medical cards and we found it very difficult to get engagement but thankfully, the Oireachtas committee invited us to come to a meeting.  We had a 17-point plan much of which was applied and improved.  The HSE-PCRS envisaged that we would replace them in registering medical card-holders.  If we are doing their job we cannot do our own job.  We are a scare resource.  In the case of children, because we were finding that it was constraining us in immunising children as children in deprived areas were not being registered, we were able to register the child but we informed the HSE-PCRS that we would only do so with the minority of children rather than the majority because, ultimately, that is the role of the HSE-PCRS, the reason it exists and it is its job.  We asked for certain other things, such as that there would be a responsible service for the homeless and more responsible provision of services for cognitively impaired persons.<\/p><p>  I note that one of the promises - we will see if the promise is maintained - is that there will be possibly a named person to deal with a cognitively impaired person.  That did not happen four years ago.  If we are aware that somebody is being assessed we can certainly extend the medical card.  Many of these people who are cognitively impaired are aged over 70 and they are on income assessments.  We are not necessarily aware whether this is the case.  However, our job is to address the position of the minority and the seriously compromised individual.  It is not a small number as it is happening in the case of tens of thousands of people.  We have asked that the HSE-PCRS err on the side of safety whereby it asks the GP - this formed part of our submission four years ago - whether there is any reason the person should not lose his or her medical card, having made its decision that the person should lose the card.  However, they did not do that.  There is no reason that this cannot be done.<\/p><p>  We do not have the resources to monitor what the HSE-PCRS does.  I returned from the UK in 1998.  Sixteen years later, the difficulties with medical cards have not been resolved because ultimately, I am afraid, it is like trying to nail down a cat - one cannot get an answer as to what is happening.  The system for registration of medical cards has always been flawed because it is not patient-centred.  Those administering the system do not err on the side of safety.  A number of years ago I had six patients who were cognitively impaired.  I had to threaten to report them to the elder abuse officer because I was fed up with the fact that they were losing their cards.
