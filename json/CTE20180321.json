On behalf of F&oacute;rsa trade union, I will read our statement on this issue and then I will hand over to Ms Clarke and Mr. King, who are two members of our union from Mayo and Kildare, to summarise this issue.<\/p> <p>  The amalgamation to create F&oacute;rsa trade union came into effect on 2 January 2018, bringing together the 80,000 members of the former Irish Municipal, Public and Civil Trade Union, IMPACT, Public Service Executive Union, PSEU and Civil and Public Services Union, CPSU, unions to form the largest public service union in the State.  We represent working people in the health service, the Civil Service, local authorities, the education sector, the community and voluntary sector, State and semi-State agencies, commercial services as well as private companies such as in aviation and telecommunications.<\/p> <p>  Although our union has been invited to present to the committee today on this issue, it is important to note that this campaign has been formally supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, as well as many individual unions, including the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, SIPTU, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, the Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT and the Financial Services Union.<\/p> <p>  In 2001, in recognition of the key role trade unions play in Ireland in delivering economic and social cohesion for wider society and fair play for workers, the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, introduced a flat rate tax relief on trade union subscriptions of &pound;100 per year at the standard rate of tax.  The introduction of this tax relief was only starting to bring union members into line with the position of those paying fees to professional bodies, who had long enjoyed full tax relief on their subscriptions at the marginal rate of tax.  To more accurately reflect the cost in real terms of trade union membership, this relief was increased incrementally between 2001 and 2008, when it was &euro;350 at the standard rate of tax.  In effect, this was a tax credit of &euro;70 for all trade union members in the country.<\/p> <p>  In budget 2011, the then Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, announced that he intended to abolish the tax reliefs on trade union subscriptions, as well as those to professional bodies.  This was part of a review of all tax reliefs as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to the economic crisis.  Indeed, because of the very fact of that crisis, the trade union movement did not campaign on this matter.  However, when the Finance Bill 2011 was published, it became very clear that while the tax relief on union subscriptions was to be abolished, the tax relief on subscriptions to professional bodies was not.  This followed a sustained lobbying campaign after the budget by professional bodies and business organisations such as Irish Business and Employers' Confederation, IBEC, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, ACCA, the Institute of Banking, the Institute of Directors in Ireland, the Marketing Institute of Ireland and the Professional Insurance Brokers Association, among many others.<\/p><p>Instead, the then Minister decided to abolish the benefit-in-kind, BIK, exemption that allowed employers to pay the annual membership fee of a professional body where membership of that body by a director or employee was relevant to the business of the employer.  This was a different decision than the original and was not the same as abolishing the tax relief on subscriptions to professional bodies generally.  This proposal only applied to directors and employees but not to the self-employed.<br\/><br\/>Following the lobbying campaign, the decision to abolish the BIK exemption on subscriptions to professional bodies led to Revenue issuing a clarification as to how it would interpret the Finance Act 2011, the net result of which I will now outline.<br\/><br\/>Tax relief on expenses paid by the self-employed, including membership of professional bodies, continues as before and is granted at the individual's marginal tax rate.  This also exempts income from the USC and PRSI.  Professional fees paid by employers on behalf of their employees to many professional bodies may continue to be paid tax free.  Businesses can receive full relief on subscriptions to bodies such as IBEC and ISME.  However, subscriptions paid by trade union members do not qualify for tax relief anymore.  Even when they did, the relief was only at the standard rate while PRSI and other levies applied to those payments.  This situation, which still applies today, is clearly discriminatory, given that the existence of a tax relief on trade union membership is as relevant to us as tax relief on membership is to professional bodies.  In addition, there is no justification for denying tax relief on trade union subscriptions when the self-employed and members of some professional bodies have this facility.<br\/><br\/>What is particularly galling is that this discrimination goes further than just membership of professional bodies.  The Irish Farmers Association, IFA, which is the largest representative body for Irish farmers, advises its members on the basis of professional advice it has received that farmers, as self-employed traders, can claim tax relief on their IFA subs as well as their subs to the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>because those are beneficial to their trade.  This clearly does not meet the test provided by Revenue's clarifications, which justified the retention of tax relief for professional body members but not for members of trade unions by outlining that there should be a requirement for a practising certificate or licence, a statutory requirement or an indispensable condition of employment.  If tax relief for the self-employed, such as farmers, is granted to their respective membership organisations on the basis that it is beneficial to the trade, tax relief for the thousands of working people whose trade union membership brings about a clear and tangible benefit to their professions should surely receive equal and fair consideration for tax purposes.  For example, the training provided by our union to our more than 8,000 members working as special needs assistants, SNAs, is invaluable to their work.  Health and social care professionals represented by F&oacute;rsa have access to legal advice and representation through their union in the event of a fitness-to-practise case that would be financially inaccessible otherwise.  This is in addition to the practical training supports in areas as varied as job evaluation, interview skills and public speaking provided to our members as well as our core services of professional representation and collective bargaining and negotiation.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that farmers, the self-employed and employees of certain professions can get tax relief for their subs while trade union members cannot.  It is also worth pointing out that Ireland's position of not providing this relief to trade union members is out of step with the practice in many other countries.  In Germany, a trade union membership fee is classified as a professional body fee and can be declared as a professional expense in a person's tax return.  In Belgium and Holland, trade union members can get 50% of their union subs back in tax relief.  In Norway, tax relief of &euro;400 per annum is allowed for union subs and tax relief on union subscriptions applies in Australia and Canada.  Many countries that we generally look to compare ourselves to recognise the importance of union membership to their societies and seek to create a level playing pitch in terms of tax relief for membership subs.  Why does Ireland not do so, too?<br\/><br\/>The trade union movement had decided to hold off on pursuing this issue in recognition of the economic crisis that had hit the country.  In the run up to budget 2016, however, and given the much more favourable economic circumstances, congress worked to have this discrimination and anomaly addressed.  That budget contained a commitment to conduct a review of, and a public consultation on, the appropriate treatment of tax reliefs for membership fees of trade unions and professional bodies.  This process was supposed to take place in 2016.  Unfortunately, no public consultation ever took place.  What actually happened was that the Department of Finance, without any public input, undertook a review of tax reliefs.  Due to the Department's innate hostility to tax reliefs, that review unsurprisingly did not support the reinstatement of the tax relief on union subs.  The Department concurred with the 2009 report of the Commission on Taxation, which recommended that the relief be discontinued on the basis that, since membership of a trade union was likely to be influenced by the benefits of membership, the value of a tax credit was unlikely to be a factor.  We agree on that point.  The trade union movement never pursued this matter on the basis that it would have any material effect on the levels of trade union membership, but because the existence of a tax relief on membership subscriptions was as relevant to trade union members as it was to professional bodies.  We are seeking equity for our members.<br\/><br\/>Now that the economic crisis is over, the trade union movement is actively pursuing the restoration of the tax relief on union subscriptions and the ending of the obvious discrimination against union members compared with the position of self-employed people, members of certain professional organisations, farmers and businesses.  Ireland is out of step on this issue with many of our friends and neighbours, who recognise in practical terms the important role that unions play in our societies.  It is time for this discrimination to end and for tax relief on trade union membership to be restored.<br\/><br\/>We are seeking the committee's support on this issue in order to address the clear inequity and discrepancy created in 2011 in the taxation treatment of different groups in society.  Nurses, SNAs and care workers should not be treated unfavourably in this manner compared with solicitors and accountants.  The training, services and representation that are beneficial to the professional lives of many thousands of working people should not be held in less regard than similar benefits availed of by the self-employed through their membership organisations.<br\/><br\/>We are seeking the committee's support to put PAYE workers who are members of unions on an even keel with the self-employed and members of professional bodies as well as with their trade union compatriots in Australia, Canada and several European countries.  Unlike those representing professional bodies, great restraint was shown by the trade union movement in Ireland on this issue in the teeth of the worst economic crisis to hit the country in generations.  Reinstating this relief would be an important statement in recognition of the important role played by trade unions in Irish society and a small gesture to the members of trade unions who made significant sacrifices during the recent economic crash.<br\/><br\/>I will hand over to Mr. King and Ms Clarke, who would like to say a few words to conclude our opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018032100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521644400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank committee members for this opportunity.

We are seeking parity of esteem.  It is inconceivable that one can claim tax relief if one is a farmer and subscribed to the IFA, a member of a professional body or even a business with an IBEC or ISME subscription when a member of a trade union, which is the negotiating body for our sector and is valuable to us as the means through which we do our business, receives no recognition in that regard.  I would put the case from that point of view and from the perspective of people on the ground who are not earning large salaries, are committed trade unionists and believe that their trade union is of significant benefit to them in their working lives, not just in terms of training, but also in terms of upskilling, which we are all being asked to do in these times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018032100002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Clarke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521644400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Like Ms Clarke, I am a public servant.

The rest of the committee's members have been equally courteous and professional with those of our members who have approached them.  I thank them for that.<\/p> <p>  From my point of view and that of those whom I represent in this and other unions, our business today is precisely what all of us and every committee member seeks, namely, equity and fairness.  It is as simple as that.  I ask that the committee consider the initial reason for the 2001 introduction of tax relief on trade union subscriptions.  As the then Minister stated, it was done to recognise the key role that the trade unions played in delivering economic and social cohesion for the wider society and fair play for members.<\/p><p>We all know what happened after that eight years later and how ordinary people and workers, especially lower paid workers, suffered.  It is easy, looking back, to forget the critical role that Irish trade unions played during the economic disaster and the subsequent recovery.  There were many arguments within the trade union movement, but it decided ultimately to work with Government and not against it.  Public servants continued to deliver excellence, and new innovations were brought in that in many ways are far ahead of the public services in other countries.  That is certainly the case in the library service I work in.  <\/p><p> The then Minister for Finance was entirely correct.  The trade unions have a key role.  Another Minister for Finance abolished the relief in 2011.  We all know why that happened, and we had to accept that in the interests of the greater good at the time.  This hurt workers, on top of all the other cuts, but we understood and were patient, and we waited our turn.  We waited eight years, and we made submissions through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  Our members are now energised about this, and it is gaining traction.  They are saying that it is a matter of fairness in society and for workers, and it is about recognising their contribution.  We now want the relief to be restored.  It is a matter of fairness.  We believe in fairness, and I am convinced that public representatives of every party actually believe in fairness too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018032100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521644400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome all our witnesses and thank them for their opening statements, and for providing the submission in advance.

However, it will cost approximately that figure to reintroduce it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018032100002#F02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1521644400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>This really comes down to a question of the best use of resources.

Where does this issue rank in terms of the level of priorities that the witnesses believe are appropriate and that their members would be advocating for?

No, it is not, but it is an irritation because people feel a sense of grievance about the fact that we took it on the chin and no one else in society did so in a similar set of circumstances.  Now that we are back to there being budget equilibrium, perhaps budget surpluses, we believe the &euro;26 million practical cost of this, in the overall scheme of things, is probably worth more psychologically to trade union members than the overall &euro;50 billion, &euro;60 billion or &euro;70 billion State budgets.

It will not break the bank, and we have been patient about it because we did not believe it was an appropriate matter to be here talking to the committee about in the hard times.

Deputy McGrath asked a number of them for me so I will not repeat those.  I wish to begin by welcoming the witnesses, as my colleagues have done, and thanking them for their pretty passionate and very well-articulated presentations.  I acknowledge the more than significant role of trades unions in the history of the State in securing groundbreaking rights for men and women, workers generally, over the past 70 or 80 years, some of which have been eroded slightly in the past two decades.  I am hugely sympathetic towards the witnesses from that perspective and hugely sympathetic to the rights of unions to exist, thrive, encourage membership and provide the best services backup to those members.  I myself was a member of a public service teaching union for a number of years.  However, I am here as a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, and our job is to scrutinise the proposals the witnesses are making and to interrogate them with a small \"i\".<\/p> <p>  My first question concerns the Department's report and its review into the abolition and the analysis of the application of the relief.  A professional membership fee has a very clear benefit.  I was a self-employed professional and - this point is made in the Department's review - I could not practice without paying such a membership fee.  I could not practice without accruing the continuous professional development requirements that allowed me to gain accreditation, for which the fee had to be paid.  No one in any of the trades unions the witnesses represent cannot practice their profession without being a member of the trades union.  That is the difference, and I would like the witnesses' response to that.<\/p> <p>  The second point in the Department's review concerns the regulatory function of accreditation bodies.  I take Mr. O'Connor's point that IBEC is not a regulatory body but a professional body.  However, in respect of accountants, professional solicitors and the range of self-employed people who pay fees, there is a regulatory function in professional bodies, but there is no regulatory function in a trades union.  I ask the witnesses to respond to this point.<\/p> <p>  The review also points out the principal advantage that accrues to a member of a trades union, namely, representation.  Regarding the additional ongoing training services that are provided, one could argue that is not the function of a trade union.  The function of a trade union is basically to represent its members.  Again, I ask the witnesses to respond to this point.<\/p> <p>  I have two final questions.  I will use primary school teachers and members of the INTO as an example.  The witnesses are seeking that a member of the INTO gets tax relief on his or her annual membership fee.  A primary school teacher or post-primary school teacher must become a member of the Teaching Council once he or she becomes qualified.  That is a professional body, and teachers are actually obliged to become members of the Teaching Council.  Is tax relief available on those fees?  If not, can the witnesses see the other doors they are potentially opening up?<\/p> <p>  Finally, Mr. Cody mentioned retired members.  Again, I ask this as a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  I am just seeking information.  What justification would there be for tax relief for retired members of trades unions on their membership fees?  Are the membership fees of retired members reduced?<\/p> <p>  There are four or five questions on which the witnesses could perhaps provide clarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018032100002#G00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521644400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I will deal with a number of them.

Mr. O'Connor mentioned the fact that we represent thousands of special needs assistants.  The State provides very little in-house training for special needs assistants.

The INTO also doubles up as a professional body, if I can call it that.  One of its biggest conferences is its education conference, at which it discusses education issues, syllabuses and so on, as opposed to what might be called its trade union conference.  This is very common within the teaching profession.  Similarly, the Deputy may know that the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has purchased the old Richmond Hospital as a training centre for the continuous professional development of its members.  Many trade unions provide such a dimension to their work, but we see that the State does not fund this.  We are not seeking funding from the State.  This would simply be a recognition of what we do.  If we go back to the former Minister, Charlie McCreevy's comments when he introduced the tax relief following discussions behind the scenes with the trade unions, it was in recognition of their role in delivering economic and social cohesion for the wider society.  I would add to that the add-on benefits we provide for our members and the services they deliver.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Lahart mentioned, I suppose, a closed shop, whereby technically speaking one could claim tax relief on union subscriptions.  They are very few and far between in the Irish trade union movement.

I absolutely accept the situations he has described.  The trade union movement, in terms of the services and the training we provide, has not achieved the same social standing as some of the professional bodies in terms of the services and training they provide, whereby it is actually a requirement to do the job.  However, this does not mean it is not of equal value, and anyone who asks a special needs assistant or a health and social care professional who relies entirely on his or her trade union for those services will have this confirmed to them.<\/p><p>That is the professional bodies' scenario.  We have also outlined the situation where there is no case to be made for the self-employed, for example farmers, claiming tax relief on membership fees for their organisation, having any greater entitlement to that in the training, services and representation provided by those bodies versus trade unions.  I agree that our core role is a representative function with professional representation at workplace level and collective bargaining negotiations, but that is of very great significance and value within our society and it should be recognised as such.  It was said earlier that the reason we are having this conversation is because the intention was to take this away in an equitable way from all of these bodies as a response to the economic crisis.  A lobbying campaign, however, was conducted that meant certain bodies were exempted.  F&oacute;rsa had restrained in that regard and all we ask for now is to resort back to what would have remained the case if it was not for the economic crash that befell the State in 2011.<\/p><p> In my opening statement I spoke of the Revenue report.  This report, essentially, couches its opposition to this on the basis that it would not incentivise trade union membership on the basis that people do not join trade unions for the tax relief, they join for the benefits of trade unions and even if it did incentivise, why would the State do that?  We fully accept that point.  This is not about incentivising trade union membership.  It is about trade union members receiving the same tax treatment in their membership of F&oacute;rsa, which is of great value and as other professional bodies and self-employed people get.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018032100002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521644400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I have one final supplementary question on an issue about which I am particularly concerned.

Since the crash, and until relatively recently when there has been a small bit of clawback, almost all of the training we have had to do with our jobs, personal development and everything else, has been through the various trade unions.  As Mr. Cody has said, much of this training happened on evenings and Saturdays.  It was critical for continuous personal development.

It is a cut and dried case of fairness and equity that the tax relief for union subscriptions should be restored.<\/p><p>The witnesses may not have the answers to some of my questions.  Why do they think this iniquitous situation has persisted? I find it bizarre that a subscription to the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>or a membership of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, qualifies for the tax relief but this does not.  I do not see the difference between the representative function of the IFA <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>its members, and the representative function of trade unions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>their members.  I do not get how it can be justified to give the tax relief to one and not the other.  The <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>situation is stranger.  Is the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, included along with the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC?  By any stretch I do not believe one could say IBEC or ISME are anything other than representative organisations for certain businesses that campaign and advocate on behalf of their members' interests.  They are not, however, a trade expense.  It they are then so too is being a member of a union.<\/p><p>I do not understand how the Government could have refused the unions' request before the budget.  Perhaps the witnesses will elaborate on how the Government can justify this iniquitous situation.  It seems to be completely baffling.  The representatives said that those organisations lobbied whereas in the teeth of the recession the unions did not.  Is there anything more the union representatives can say about the nature of the lobbying by those organisations and why they were listened to?<\/p><p>Maybe it is due to my own political biases, but on the face of it it appears there is one law for workers and a different law for businesses and people who are trading.  This is what seems to be running behind it and it is deeply unfair given the sacrifices workers were forced to endure in the period of austerity.  Do the witnesses see it being as simple as being just a political or ideological bias?  Was any credible argument put forward to them to explain how this iniquity has been maintained?<\/p><p>Have the unions had any recent engagement with the Government since it refused to reapply the relief in the last budget?  Have there been subsequent discussions with the Government around what its stance might be coming in to the next budget?<\/p><p>Primarily this issue is an irritant.  It is not a huge financial issue.  It is an irritant because it is so unfair and inequitable.  Ms Clarke spoke of how hammered the union members got on other fronts.  It may stray from the subject but as rank and file F&oacute;rsa members what other measures would the witnesses like to see, beyond this, to try to restore the fortunes of workers who got hammered?<\/p><p>My last point may add to the armoury of the union's argument.<\/p><p>Profits have gone through the roof in the last six or seven years such that pre-tax profits were approximately &euro;149 billion based on the last figures available.  I think there is approximately &euro;80 billion in tax reliefs and deductible expenses, overwhelmingly going to business.  Even at that level it seems like a tiny request that workers might get something that might cost about &euro;20 million, given the huge number of very questionable tax reliefs and deductions that are allowed for big business.

We were in very dark days and the trade union movement decided to live with it.  We did not press it until now.  We have been speaking to various Deputies throughout the country.

We defeated that one and hopefully we can get rid of this one as well.  It did not actually suggest that there should not be an incentive for trade union membership.  The argument it made was that the incentive was not working and that it was kind of mandatory to be part of a trade union.  From a public policy point of view, support for trade union subscriptions should be justified and legislated for.  I wholeheartedly support the campaign.<\/p> <p>  There was mention of the support across the trade union sector and from ICTU.  Have the unions had indications of political support or has that not yet been formally offered?  I do not believe that my party has written formally to the trade unions.  Is this something that is building momentum?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018032100002#J01000","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521644400,"counter":69,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first point, he and I both agree that there is a role for the State to recognise in this way the important role that trade unions play.

I looked at the proposal in detail and discussed it with Mr. O'Connor at some length.  I will be advocating within Fianna F&aacute;il that we support it in the upcoming budget negotiations.  I am conscious that the relief was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and abolished by a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Finance during a crisis.  It is time for it to be reintroduced.  The equity argument stands for itself but, in addition, the State must do what it can do support trade unionism and ensure we have strong trade unions in the country.  There has been a very serious widening of the wealth gap in Ireland.  The two biggest asset groups which we can track are home ownership - we are at the lowest level since 1970 in that regard - and pensions, which are in an absolute mess at the moment.<\/p><p>My portfolio is Brexit.  I firmly believe that Brexit is part of a consistent pattern across much of the western world, as evidenced in public support for Marine Le Pen and Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland, AfD, and all sorts of unpleasantness.  That has largely arisen because the <i>status quo<\/i>is not working for many of the people who are or should be in trade unions.  We need to do reintroduce the relief and work with the unions to ensure the trade union movement in Ireland grows stronger and that employers are not allowed to tell their staff they may not join a trade union.  I have spoken to my colleagues on this issue.  We must be cognisant that we are in the middle of crises in homelessness, housing and hospital trolleys, as well as dealing with threats from Brexit.  Significant investment in social and transport infrastructure is needed across the country and &euro;26 million is not a small amount of money, so it will be assessed in the context of many urgent and competing demands.  I will advocate that the relief be reintroduced and that we can potentially go further in supporting the growth and strength of the trade union movement in this country.  It is very important.<\/p><p>In terms of the procedure of getting back the &euro;70, must a member fill in a form 11 or go through a full self-assessment to do so or is there an easy way to get it?  The only reason I ask is that one must assume that, at the margin, price matters and there will, therefore, be those for whom the &euro;70 will make the difference between joining or not joining a union or, indeed, it may take pressure off another part of their lives.  That becomes far more difficult if one must fill in an entire Revenue form 11 online.

I am also joined by my officials, Mr. Brian Carroll, assistant secretary with responsibility for climate action and environment; Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in, assistant secretary with responsibility for the communications division; Ms Rebecca Minch, principal officer, energy efficiency and affordability division; Mr. Denis Maher, principal officer, inland fisheries division; and Jim Whelan, assistant principal officer, finance unit.<\/p> <p>  The total provision for my Department in 2018 is &euro;587 million which comprises &euro;215 million for capital investment, inclusive of a capital carryover from last year of &euro;6 million, and &euro;372 million for current spending, of which &euro;222 million represents a pass-through of television licence receipts.  During 2018 my Department will progress projects in a number of areas of strategic national importance, encompassing climate action, energy efficiency, communications, broadcasting, the environment, waste management, natural resources and inland fisheries.  A number of the strategic investment priorities identified in the national development plan are directly relevant to my Department and its agencies.<\/p> <p>  I will highlight some key projects and policy objectives to be progressed this year.  Delivering a connected economy and society is a key priority for my Department.  Commercial investment continues to improve and expand the breadth of broadband and mobile telecoms services available in the State.  Complementing this commercial investment, the State is committed to investing through national broadband plan intervention in the delivery of a future-proofed network to support high quality affordable broadband services in those areas where a commercial investment has not been demonstrated.  Fast, secure, high capacity digital connectivity will underpin balanced regional development, allow new businesses and services to emerge and increase Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and attractiveness as a place in which to live and do business.  Under the national digital strategy, there will be continued support for digital adoption measures to enable small businesses and citizens to realise the full social and economic potential of the digital world.  Facilitating a secure and safer Internet environment for citizens, businesses and critical infrastructure providers is essential.  The National Cyber Security Centre which plays a key role in securing Government and critical national infrastructure and data will be strengthened.<\/p> <p>  Climate mitigation and adaptation are cross-cutting priorities for the Government.  My Department will continue to progress the climate action agenda, in line with the whole-of-government national mitigation plan.  This year the focus will be maintained on achieving targets in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency to combat climate change and contribute towards the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 targets.  The development of renewable energy sources across the electricity, heat and transport sectors will be critical in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon economy.  Increased investment in energy efficiency upgrades in the residential, commercial and public sectors is a central plank of Ireland's action on climate change and will deliver significant energy savings.  Decarbonising the built environment is the most effective way to tackle climate change.  Energy efficiency measures will also realise benefits for air quality, health, social inclusion and business competitiveness, all of which will make a real and positive impact on people&rsquo;s lives.  The roll-out of the support scheme for renewable heat aims to support the replacement of fossil fuel heating systems with renewable energy technologies.  The continued incentivisation of the uptake of electric vehicles will further support the transition to a low-carbon economy.<\/p> <p>  The sustainable management of waste and improved resource efficiency are critical.<\/p><p>In the environmental area, the Environmental Protection Agency will continue to deliver on its research commitments and meet its expanded role regarding ambient air quality, noise and non-ionising radiation monitoring, as well as a significant climate action agenda.  Continued investment in INFOMAR and TELLUS geo-environmental mapping projects will provide reliable geoscience support, underpinning the sustainable development of Ireland's natural resources.  I am happy to discuss the Estimate with the members.<\/p><p> The focus of programme A is to support economic growth, jobs, competitiveness and social inclusion through a range of policies and regulation designed to facilitate a more digitally connected economy and society.  It provides for investment in next-generation broadband networks, promotion of the use of digital technologies by citizens and businesses and support for digital entrepreneurship.  The Estimate for programme A includes funding of &euro;15 million to finalise the tender process for the State-led intervention to bring high-speed connectivity to all parts of Ireland where there is no existing or planned commercial network.<\/p><p> The programme also supports digital adoption measures such as the trading online voucher scheme, the school digital champion programme and the digital skills for citizens training scheme.  A sum of &euro;3 million will be made available this year for the trading online voucher scheme to support a further 1,500 small businesses to trade online.  By the end of 2017, over 4,100 small businesses had successfully applied for trading online vouchers and over 10,600 businesses in total had benefited through participation in training sessions delivered by the local enterprise offices under the scheme since it began in 2014.  Under the digital skills for citizens scheme, community and voluntary organisations will receive funding of &euro;2.2 million to deliver ten hours of free digital skills training to 25,000 people who have never used the Internet.<\/p><p> Programme A also supports growth and innovation in digital entrepreneurship through the Digital Hub Development Agency and the National Digital Research Centre.  The 2018 Estimate includes &euro;1.8 million for Eircode postcodes and &euro;2 million in operational funding for the National Cyber Security Centre for the protection of critical infrastructure and Government networks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018032100002#B00400","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521639000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Regarding the Department's expenditure of &euro;15 million under subhead A3, pertaining to the information and communications technology programme, the development of next-generation broadband is covered.

I had not had a chance to review the figures.  In his opening remarks, the Minister said that the National Cyber Security Centre is to be strengthened, which is very welcome.  On the Channel 4 documentary on Monday night, the UK Information Commissioner, whose office has a role slightly similar to that of the centre, said she was unresourced to tackle cybercrime, social media issues, etc.  She had to talk about getting a warrant a day or two after the event although Facebook was able to go in that same night, apparently.  Nobody can quite understand how that happened.  I would hate to see the same happen here because of a lack of resources and support.<\/p> <p>  We know local authority and public websites have been hacked.  The Houses of the Oireachtas website was taken down about a month ago because of a cyberattack.  Therefore, a national cybersecurity centre is very much needed.  We also saw what we might have thought was a plot from a James Bond movie but which is becoming real.  FBS agents based in Dublin were targeting multinationals based in Dublin.  Many of those companies have expressed concerns regarding this type of development.  There is a directive to be transposed - the EU information security directive but I am not sure what the position is in respect of it.  Perhaps the Minister could provide an update.<\/p> <p>  In the same vein and very much related, we heard concerns in the House yesterday and again today on the social media issues pertaining to online campaigning, the Cambridge Analytica data mining, the use of social media platforms using information malevolently or lending it to other actors to use it in that way.  I had legislation before the House, the Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill, which would tackle many, if not all, of these issues.  In the context of the Estimates, I understood from the Department that a money message was required for that Bill to be progress.  I hope all parties now agree that the Bill is important and that it tackles many of the issues that have been raised and over which concern has been expressed in recent days.<\/p><p>Earlier, the Taoiseach said that there were some technical issues.  I am happy to work with the Minister and the Government on refining those issues if that is the case but I ask for the Minister's support to bring the Bill to committee as soon as possible.

I will begin with the spending and changes in the figures from 2017 to 2018 under the various subheads.  On information and communications technology, between 2017 and 2018 the Estimate has gone from &euro;20.5 million to &euro;19 million.  That is because of anticipated contractual payments under the concession agreement for phase 2 of the metropolitan area networks which are projected to be less than was budgeted for in the 2017 allocation.  The outturn for 2017 is &euro;1.45 million less and that is reflected in the change in the subhead.<\/p> <p>  Some &euro;15 million is allocated to complete the procurement process in the national broadband plan.  The process commenced 27 months ago and we have gone through the process and the complexities involved.  As I have said before, is not a simple auction.  At the start of the process we did not have the technical solution, so that as part of the whole procurement process, one is bidding for the technical solution.  The three bidders who had progressed forward had recommended a primarily fibre-based solution for this.  David McCourt put it well in one interview when he explained what a competitive dialogue procurement process is.  At the start one has 200 issues to deal with, and now we are down to the last handful.   Once they are agreed, one signs off on the matter and moves on.  We are now at the very end of the process.  As I told the committee here some weeks ago, we will have a preferred bidder stage by September.  I think we can expedite this and we will get contractors on the ground delivering high-speed broadband quicker than we had envisaged.  The build out is expected to be three years and we are making significant progress.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked for a breakdown of subhead 3A.  The substantial part of that relates to the national broadband plan.  There is &euro;140,000 for the metropolitan area network, MAN, phase 2.  The management services entity, MSE, process management, which relates to the MAN ducting, has a fee of &euro;80,000.  The MSE 2 concession agreement is &euro;1.4 million.  The Galway-Mayo ducting is about to come to committee -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018032100002#D00500","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1521639000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>It is on Second Stage at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018032100002#D00600","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1521639000,"counter":118,"content":"<p>---- it is currently &euro;500,000.  The Tuam ducting has a sum of &euro;100,000.  The North-South telecoms operation is &euro;20,000 and &euro;1.8 million for Eircode.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Dooley asked about subhead A4 on multimedia developments.  The projected change from the 2017 Estimate to the 2018 Estimate is &euro;654,000.  The decrease relates to the Digital Hub Development Agency 2018 allocation which reflects the ongoing implementation of the 2015-2019 financial model which is designed to gradually phase out the agency's reliance on Exchequer funding.  Funding for operating expenses and capital has decreased in line with the financial model.  In plain English, part of the long-term strategy for the digital hub is that over time it would become less reliant on public moneys and be able to generate more income itself.  Much of that income is being generated in relation to the development of property on that site which is then let to companies including tech companies.  As the rental income from the site increases, the Exchequer contribution towards its running cost diminishes and the figure of &euro;645,000 reflects that.  <\/p> <p>  Those are the two big changes in spending on the A Vote.  Deputy Stanley asked about the difference between the spend.  There is another slight change in this, namely, &euro;258,000 on administration non-pay aspects.  That relates to overall savings on that side.  Deputy Stanley also asked about the trading online voucher scheme.  Since I was appointed Minister, we have increased the funding available to the trading online voucher scheme year-on-year.  On several occasions I have publicly made the local enterprise offices aware that if applications for the trading online vouchers scheme is over-subscribed and the funding is not there to meet it, I will find the funding for it.  I do not want funding to be an issue on that.  Many colleagues here have actively encouraged companies in their own constituencies to apply for the trading online voucher scheme which is a 50% grant up to &euro;2,500 for people to start trading online or to be able to take online payments if they already have an Internet presence.  We have found that those people who have started to trade online are increasing their sales by one fifth, employment by one third, and two thirds of those companies are now trading internationally.  <\/p> <p>  It is not only traditional retail businesses which can benefit from this.  I was in Deputy Dooley's county town of Ennis recently and visited Bridget Haren hairdressers, not that I am an expert in visiting hairdressers, where we had an interesting conversation regarding Bridget having availed of the online voucher scheme.  They have used it in order to make all their bookings online.  Whether it is a wash and blowdry or highlights, the client is allocated whatever period necessary and the staff member to do it.  It provides them with a huge degree of flexibility as well as being able to sell the hair products online that they have the rights to stock in their salon.  Over the Christmas period, they saw their sales increase dramatically.  There are huge opportunities there for businesses which may not traditionally see themselves as having an opportunity to go on the route of trading online.  I actively encourage people to avail of the scheme.  Up to one third of that grant may also be spent on online marketing.  There is no point in having a shop window online unless people can actually see it.  <\/p> <p>  Another interesting thing that we have found from it is that quite a number of people who have availed of the training have found that their existing system meets their needs but they may not have been maximising it.  Over 10,000 businesses have received training where about 4,500 have availed of the voucher.  There are 1,500 vouchers.  Let that not be a limit.  I encourage colleagues here to actively encourage businesses in their constituencies to avail of that support.<\/p><p>Deputy James Lawless asked a number of questions.  On the legislation he introduced, I have spoken privately to him about it.  I also discussed on the floor of the D&aacute;il the technical difficulties with it, although the Deputy gave a different impression on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; earlier in the week.  We are all agreed on the route we need to take.  An interdepartmental group which is led by the Taoiseach's Department and comprises representatives of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is due to meet on Friday and this issue will form part of its discussion on electoral reform.  We are and were conscious of the issue in advance of the Channel 4 documentary and what was reported in <i>The Guardian<\/i>this week.  The interdepartmental group was established on foot of the Deputy's legislation and it is our intention to progress swiftly in that regard.<br\/><br\/>On the Deputy's question of whether there is a lack of resources on the cyber security side, all of the resources that have been sought have been provided.  I had a discussion recently with the head of our cyber security division about whether resources were an issue.  The main issue is the provision of accommodation to meet staffing levels which have increased dramatically from a low base.  The intention is to recruit additional staff this year.  The challenge, therefore, is not resources, but, rather, finding staff with the requisite training.  Traditionally, we have seconded staff from the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this practice is continuing.  We liaise with our colleagues across Europe in that regard.  A recruitment process will commence soon to ramp up capacity in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018032100002#D00700","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521639000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>It is good to hear that the Minister listens to \"Morning Ireland\".

In the next day or two, I am due to receive a report from my officials on that report, and I want to compliment the committee on it.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Eamon Ryan, I note that Deputy Dooley asked me the same question in the House a couple of weeks ago.  We need to deal with this urgently.  I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan in that regard.  That is why last May I got Government approval to bring forward the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2017.  Hearings on the Bill started here on 11 July 2017, and the committee produced its report on it on 8 March 2018.  I have only just received that report.  My intention is to move as quickly as possible on this.  Specifically, this Bill addresses the issue of evasion.<\/p> <p>  In answer to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's query about the impact on An Post, I note that An Post says that it is losing money on the enforcement of television licences.  We have looked for expressions of interest with regard to this service.  An Post is the collection agent at the moment, and the work is carried out through local post offices.  We have no plans whatsoever to move collection away from the local post office.  An Post is one of the organisations that is anxious to bid for this service if it goes through a tendering process.  The intention behind this legislation is to enact it quickly and deal with some of the challenging problems that we have.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith asked about the issue of retransmission.  The report of this committee of 8 March asked me to prioritise measures to tackle evasion, which is what I intend to do.  It also said that we need a detailed regulatory impact analysis of the issue of retransmission.  We have just received that report, and I have directed officials to work on this immediately.<\/p> <p>  As I say, I am expecting to receive feedback on the broader report the committee has produced from my officials very shortly.  I presume this will include Deputy Stanley's suggestion concerning registration at the point of purchase of a television set.  Deputy Stanley is right in this regard.  This is something I feel very strongly about.  There have been numerous calls to increase the price of the television licence.  We are effectively asking people to pay more to subsidise those who are refusing to pay.  At the moment the public is actually subsidising the television licence because of the rates of evasion.<\/p><p>Those who pay a television licence effectively subsidise those who do not to the sum of &euro;39 annually.  About a quarter of the television licence fee is being used for that purpose.  We need to increase funding to RT&Eacute; but the way to do that is by ending evasion and closing off some of the loopholes and anomalies associated with the current licence.  Since 2013, sales of the licence have increased, although not at the rate we would like.  We want to encourage people to buy the licence.<\/p><p> Deputy Dooley is correct that combatting disinformation is the fundamental reason we need public service broadcasting.  Any robust democracy has a well-functioning, publicly supported media.  That is not only in relation to broadcasting but, as I said shortly after my appointment, it is something that we need to broaden out.  We can see challenges across the board.  We have very good quality journalism in this country, both from broadcasters and print media, and it is something I want to see supported.  That is why the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill includes provision to support community and local radio stations, and also to support young journalists.  I would like to see a situation eventually where we had the flexibility to go further than that.<\/p><p> Deputy Stanley asked about governance.  The 2016 code of practice for the governance of State bodies issued in August 2016 applies to RT&Eacute;.  However, it did not come into force immediately.  State bodies are expected to be in compliance with the code by the end of the first full financial year subsequent to the publication of the code, which was 31 December 2017, in both cases.  The Department has been working with RT&Eacute; to ensure full compliance with the code within the specified deadline.  In line with the code's requirements, an oversight agreement has been signed by the Department and RT&Eacute;.  The oversight agreement does not include any additional obligations, rather it describes the roles, responsibilities and obligations of the Department and RT&Eacute; as set out in the Broadcasting Act.  RT&Eacute; provides detailed financial analysis to the Department each month, including revenues, costs, deficits and surpluses, by channel, service and broadcasting genre and between public service and non-public service activities.  The information is consolidated at the end of year and published in the RT&Eacute; annual report.<\/p><p> On the key performance indicators for broadcasting, both public service broadcasters, namely, TG4 and RT&Eacute;, prepare annual statements of performance commitments setting out how they intend to meet the targets in their respective strategy statements and how they will meet their statutory objectives as set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland review these statements in the context of the annual reviews carried out under section 102 of the Act and the BAI then reports to me, as Minister, on the performance of each public sector broadcaster with regard to its statutory remit and commitments, and can make recommendations regarding funding required to enable the public service broadcasters to fulfil their obligations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018032100002#F00800","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521639000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I cannot remember when the committee started debating the retransmission issue but I think it was nearly a year ago that we had the hearing.  Anyone listening to the discussion we had around it would know that the Minister has the political cover to act on it because we were pretty much united and perfectly clear having heard the initial evidence that there was a really strong case.  There is some frustration that the process took time, although we were clear in our report after the Dublin Castle event that we thought the retransmission issue was one of the basket of measures that the Minister needed to pick up.  It is true there are all sorts of legal checks, and a final legal scoot around is necessary, but for the Minister to suggest the committee delayed it to 8 March is incorrect.  Anyone following this process over the last year knows that the committee could not have been clearer about the retransmission issue and the need to act fast on it.  The idea that the committee's main recommendation was for there to be more regulatory analysis and that the Department has not done it over the last year beggars belief.  We need to act fast on this.  As Deputy Dooley said, the Minister has political support and cover to do something.  It cannot just be the advertisements I keep hearing on the radio from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment telling me to pay my television licence, which do nothing to address evasion.

Maybe Members of the Oireachtas can be political at times when we do not need to be.  I am sure the Minister and the Department were observing the discussions which were ongoing here.  It was not necessary for us to finalise the report in order to know the direction the committee was taking.  Early on, the majority of the members of the committee had spoken of the Revenue Commissioners as an effective methodology for collecting the moneys owed here.  The Minister's Bill does not do that.  It looks at a hybrid model and gives the Minister options.  I do not know how successful the Bill can be in capturing that &euro;40 million.  I suspect it would be less effective than the direction which this committee suggested.  The Minister does not have to take on board the views of the committee.  Previous Ministers moved this matter on a considerable distance but were unable to get it over the line for political reasons.  The Minister identified the problem in the early stages of his time in office, but he immediately took the notion of a broadcasting charge off the agenda without consultation.  My party, which facilitates the Minister being in government, made it clear in its manifesto that we support the idea of equality and fairness for all, in the sense that everyone would pay their fair share and those who pay do not carry the burden of others.  It is a little disingenuous, if not overly so, for the Minister to suggest that there were delays here in this committee which have delayed the process of getting at that &euro;40 million.  In my view, the Minister could have moved more quickly with the Revenue Commissioners, and could have done it six, eight, ten or 12 months ago, and we would not be where we are.  Now it is coming into really sharp focus because, as others have said, RT&Eacute; has a plan.  The director general has not been before the committee for a while, but I assume she will be in the normal course of events.  Presumably she will say the same thing she said last time, and I paraphrase, that she had heard a lot of claptrap and a lot from politicians about the necessity to provide for RT&Eacute;'s public service obligation but we have not come forward with the money.  The committee has outlined the way to do it.

The Littleton briquette factory has been a victim of that particular policy, which I understand.  Today is a very sad and difficult day because it is the last day of production at the plant.  It closes this evening.  It has been a very traumatic experience for the 120 people who have lost their jobs in Littleton.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge and appreciate the Minister's assistance and support and that of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, in facilitating through Bord na M&oacute;na a redundancy package that was accepted by the vast majority of the workforce.  What I and everybody in the local community are concerned about is that we have a plant that has made an enormous contribution to the economic and social life of the area.  It is hugely important and beneficial to the local economy.  We are now bereft of employment in that isolated area.  I am asking the Minister to discuss with Bord na M&oacute;na what the future holds for the plant.  How can we maximise and utilise the existing bog?  How can we provide alternative employment opportunities for those people who have lost their jobs and their dependent families?<\/p> <p>  I am also concerned about security.  We are talking about roughly 12,000 acres of bogland and we already have a lot of encroachment, trespassing and security issues.  The local people are extremely concerned that the property will be vacated and that it will result in trespass of a serious nature, which has already taken place.  Does the Minister have any suggestions or ideas?

I presume the reason for that is energy efficiency.  How many renewable energy projects have been supported through the SEAI schemes over the past year?  Have any schools been given support to develop renewables?  One of the good things that has been happening over the past number of years is the number of new schools being built even in 2013, 2014 and 2015 when there was not much money about.  I give the Government credit for that.  It is good that education continues to be a priority.  We have built schools and a lot of money is spent on architects doing designs and all of them look the same.  I am not sure why there is so much hoo-ha about the design.  One of the things that is noticeable is they have flat roofs.  A huge opportunity is being missed to capture solar energy on the rooftops of schools.  I am talking about schools but one could also consider county hall in Laois where a new storey has been added for the payroll section for all the local authorities in the State and a whole lot of public bodies.  There are 70 or 80 new employees in it.  There is a flat roof which is mostly south facing.  Have any schools been given support for that?<\/p> <p>  My other question is on renewable energy.  It receives money from the ordinary householder through the PSO levy.  There is a slow-down in the development of new renewables.  If one looks at the figures for 2015 and 2016, will one see a downward trend in recent years?  The figures indicate there has been a slowdown.  At what point did it begin?

The Minister has talked about an increase in rapid chargers.  Collectively, we will have to find a way to get many more charging points out there.  I am hearing it consistently from people who have taken quite some time to get to a point where they are prepared to purchase an electric car.  They have purchased one and are finding that the chargers, on many occasions, are not working.  They are down for considerable periods of time.  It is hugely frustrating.<\/p> <p>  The most frustrating aspect is that people have come to me to say that if they could they would give up their electric cars and go back to petrol or diesel, not because of anything to do with the car but because of their inability to find effective charging points in the towns which they frequent.  It is very disheartening.  We have to front-load the charging points way above what is needed in the short to medium term.  We should be putting the long-term requirement in right at the very start so that we overcompensate to ultimately encourage their use.  It is a big behavioural change to get people to change from the traditional fuel methods to electric vehicles.  It takes a lot of confidence.  Range anxiety is a very significant inhibitor.  If people have worked out that the range is doable but then discover there is not an available method of charging in the areas they frequent, we have a problem.  I appeal to the Minister to do whatever it takes to get a system in place of rolling out these chargers.

It is important now to explore the opportunities for the site and source alternative employment for it.  I discussed this with the outgoing chief executive of Bord na M&oacute;na and we have discussed possible alternatives for the site.

There was an initiative between the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Department of Education and Skills and &euro;2 million was allocated for a renovation pilot scheme for medium to deep retrofit upgrades of ten primary and secondary schools.  The purpose of the pilot scheme was to help to develop a scalable model for energy efficiency retrofits to schools across Ireland.  On foot of the learnings from that, we are going to try to develop it further.  We had a number of other pilots, one of which involved energy upgrades of central government buildings with the OPW.  This year, we have set aside &euro;9 million to invest in further support for public sector energy efficiency strategies.

Solar panels are part of the mix.  In fact, I visited a school in Leixlip where the kids were showing me the solar panel.  They actually had battery storage in the school.  The big problem with schools is that they are closed a lot of the time whether at weekends or out of term.  As such, one is not getting the same bang for one's buck when investing in a solar panel there.  However, this is a whole issue we are looking at in the context of microgeneration.  We had a workshop in October 2017 on this.  It is something not only colleagues here, including me, are anxious to see pursued, but under the new directives on microgeneration and community participation from Europe we will have to do it anyway.  What we are looking at now is a number of options.  Self-consumption seems to be the easiest area in which to get over some of the technical challenges.  That was the example I saw first-hand in Leixlip.  It is our intention to run an initial phase on solar panels for domestic purposes this summer.  We will look at the uptake there.  The SEAI is working on the scheme now.<\/p> <p>  Right across the public sector, there are huge opportunities.  The Deputy is right about that.  In effect, the grant aid available is roughly at about 30% and we are working with the OPW, local authorities and other bodies.  There is a number of avenues.  We have the public sector energy efficiency targets for which funding is available.  Whatever energy savings are made by the public sector can also be retained by the relevant division or Department and does not have to go back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It can be reinvested in other services within the relevant body or agency.  There are other funding avenues across the public sector for initiatives.  We are quite open to any initiative.

I will come back to the Deputy because I honestly do not have an answer to that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Dooley asked me about electric vehicles and charging points.  He is right that this issue is coming up all over the place.  There are approximately 900 charging points nationally, most of which are the relatively slow ones.  On top of that, every person who purchased a new electric vehicle had a charging point installed at their home.  The vast majority of people are actually charging at home.  Some people are charging during the day, but the numbers are limited.  If we want to get people to move from using their cars purely for commuting and to travel across the country, it will be necessary to have an effective network of charging points.  That is why we announced this year additional funding of &euro;1.8 million, of which &euro;1.5 million is for capital expenditure and &euro;300,000 is for current expenditure, to expand the network of charging points nationally.  Currently, we have approximately 4,500 electric vehicles in the country.  The grant has been paid out for 2,636 electric vehicles since it was initially introduced and there will have been imports on top of that.<\/p> <p>  The number of charging points per electric vehicle is probably better than most other places in Europe.  However, that does not take from the point the Deputy makes.  We saw a significant improvement last year.  Approximately one third of all new electric vehicles on our roads were purchased in 2017 and we expect to see that increase again this year.  In tandem with that, we need to repair the points which are not operational.  Some local authorities, including Deputy Dooley's in Clare, have improved the signage and road markings for electric vehicle charging points.  My own local authority, Roscommon County Council, has done the same.<\/p><p>We must encourage local authorities to do that across the country.  We are now rolling out the fast-charging points.  We are conscious of it.<\/p><p> Interestingly, we held a new electric vehicle-hybrid trial in Letterkenny last month.  Where taxis were used to transport patients for dialysis to Letterkenny hospital, they were conducting trials on the use of battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and hybrid vehicles.  The plug-in hybrids and the hybrid vehicles were supplied by Toyota - they were Toyota Priuses - and Nissan provided the electric vehicles, which were Nissan Leafs.  We also had the cold weather and we will be able to look at the impact of the cold weather on that.  Taxi drivers will give us a good idea, particularly in rural areas, such as Letterkenny, where they are servicing a rural area, of some of the challenges and issues.  As the committee will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport last month launched the new grant scheme for taxi drivers of electric vehicles and hybrids.<\/p><p> The Chair asked about the national development plan and the ramping up, from 30,000 premises to 45,000 premises per annum.  The main aspect where we will see the ramping up will be on some of the lower volume schemes.  On the better energy homes scheme, last year we did 14,606 homes.  On the better energy warmer homes, we did 6,555 homes.  However, the newer schemes include the warmth and well-being scheme, where we will conduct a pilot on 1,000 homes over a three-year period.  This will involve a deep retrofit and looking at the health outcomes for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and children with asthma.  We have asked the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to examine the health outturns in that regard.  We have spent &euro;15,500 doing a deep retrofit on each of those homes.  In fact, we had envisaged a budget of &euro;20,000 on average per home.  In practical terms, the cost was &euro;4,500 less than that.<\/p><p> We are also looking at a further deep retro-pilot, some of which will involve turf cutters - those who were availing of turf compensation scheme.  In fact, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne and I are participating in an information evening quite soon on that, talking to some of those families to see whether we can transition away from solid fuel to more sustainable forms of heating.  The other deep retrofit pilot will look at moving away from oil-fired heating.  The cost of doing this is not as prohibitive as we initially thought but we are building capacity within the sector, giving contractors the opportunities to bid for these scheme, building up the skill sets and building up the training ability for contractors to do it.<\/p><p> We have now also ramped up the sustainable energy community scheme this year.  We have the better energy communities across the country.  Last year, there were 44 projects approved and we have put additional funding into that this year.  The call is just opening on the sustainable energy community scheme for &euro;3 million.  The objective is to look at communities that have not availed of energy efficiency grants up to now and, working closely with them, put a facilitator in place so that they can put a detailed plan in place to improve the energy efficiency of the community as a whole.  Effectively, we will guarantee any group that works with us and the SEAI on this and that meets the terms and conditions, funding this year to get on that process because on so many occasions in the past we have communities go to a huge amount of effort and submit applications to find that they were not successful.  We are saying we will guarantee them funding this year to get their project off the ground and then give them the capacity to bid for the better energy community scheme next year.  We would expect, because of these pilot initiatives that are now ramping up, that we will be able to meet that target of 45,000 premises or homes a year by 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018032100002#J01100","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521639000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, I have to speak in the Chamber shortly.

There was ill-feeling about the issues and historical legacies of Silvermines.  It shows the importance of other new mines that are being developed and the remediation fund which unfortunately was not there as part of the Silvermines development.  Following discussions with the Department, the Chief State Solicitor's office wrote to the solicitor acting on behalf of the owners of the Gortmore tailings facility stating that, in effect, in the event that the owner does not wish to negotiate along the lines of the previous offer, the Department would consider retention by the owner of the site subject to a comprehensive management plan being submitted by the owner and signed off by a suitable expert.  There has been no response to this letter to date.  I understand that the Department, via the Chief State Solicitor's office, has, in the last week or so, contacted the landowners to again seek a response to the November 2017 letter and to remind them that they have an onus to keep horses off the older, remediated parts of the site.  Following an update in February 2018, approximately 25 horses were found to be on the site.  That is the site that has not been remediated by the Department.  The result has been significant damage to the grass which was seeded directly onto the tailing.<\/p> <p>  This is an issue for which there is ongoing monitoring by the Department and ongoing liaison with the landowners through their solicitors, with a view to seeking a response to the letter of November 2017 and a follow-up to that.

There is the possibility of the purchase of other sites subject to work being initiated by Tipperary County Council, which we have not heard about, and I know the chief executive was present at that meeting as well as experts in the area from the local authority.  We are open to assisting Tipperary County Council should it come forward with proposals for other parts of the Silvermines site.  We are still in liaison with regard to the Gortmore tailings facility.  As the Deputy said, there have been discussions with the veterinary officers in Tipperary relating to that site.

The Deputy is right in that the primary objective should be to try to reduce the generation of waste in the first place.  That is why last year we brought all of the retailers in the country together to look at ways in which we could reduce the amount of waste or packaging generated in the first place.  One of the first companies out of the block was Lidl which got rid of discounted rates for multiple purchases of fruit and vegetables which in many cases, unfortunately, ended up in either the black or brown bin.  Bread presents another big problem, although I know that it was in scarce supply last month.  We are trying to encourage people not to generate waste in the first place.  I attended the European Council of Ministers' meeting last Monday week and this was a discussion we had, both in public and private.  We considered how packaging and plastic waste, in particular, could be reduced.<\/p><p>It is an admirable goal that all plastic material will be recyclable by 2030, however, we need to focus on not generating it in the first place.  In advance of the crisis created by China's ban on plastic waste, I had written to the Commission on that point specifically.  <\/p><p> Deputy Dooley asked about the waste watchdog, the household waste price monitoring group.  This group was put in place to ensure there would not be price gouging when we made the transition from the flat rate system to the system based on use.  As members know, a range of usage systems have been put in place.  We were quite open to the type of systems that would be used.  There are approximately nine different types of usage systems in place across the country.  <\/p><p> There are 120 different price factors, service charge, lift charge, kilogram weight charge that were recorded in the latest report that was between November and December 2017, some 20 changes were made November and December, 12 had decreased and eight had increased.  One provider recorded a decrease in the service charge per months from &euro;17 to &euro;12 per month and decreased the per kilogram weight charge from 22 cent to 19 cent.  Other providers quoted lower lift charges, a reduction from &euro;12.80 in November to &euro;12.30 in December.  Some companies increased charges, one company had a service charge and charge per lift plus excess charge.  The quoted service charge went from &euro;4.14 to &euro;4.17, so there was a marginal increase.  On average there has been relative price stability since the price monitoring group started looking at charges last September.  All of the price monitoring group reports are available on line.  <\/p><p> The Fianna F&aacute;il Party had proposed regulation and at that time, I said that I was open minded.  I still remain open minded.  As members know the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, is conducting a review of the industry and will complete it later this year.  I will act on its recommendations.  Let us wait and see what the CCPC recommends.  The CCPC did not participate in the watchdog because it was carrying out this review and felt to do so would compromise its position.  We have a good mix of consumer advocates on the monitoring group, and their output is fully transparent.<\/p><p> Deputy Stanley is correct on illegal dumping.  I believe that illegal dumping is both economic and environment treason.  That is why we have increased the funding to &euro;2 million for community groups that want to clean up blackspots around the country.  We are working with the local authorities in looking at innovative ways to monitor particular locations.  I hope we will secure prosecutions.  We are providing additional resources to the EPA and through the EPA to the local authorities to enforce the legislation in this area.  I have given additional powers to the regional waste management offices so that there are regional inspectors that can go along and deal with cross-county breaches in the legislation.  I will bring forward revisions in the legislation on littering.  I believe strongly that it is totally unacceptable to litter and dump waste.  I am open to new suggestions and ideas.<\/p><p> The closure of the Chinese market for waste has caused us a problem.  We are liaising quite closely with the waste sector and the waste regulatory authorities regarding the impact of these restrictions.  Basically China has closed its doors to recyclable material.  The vast majority of material that was generated in Europe, both paper and plastic was recycled in China.  It is possible to get other markets for some of this material but in order for us to obtain other markets, it must be clean recyclable material.  The problem arises because of what is presented in the green and blue bins at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018032100002#M00600","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521639000,"counter":197,"content":"<p>What happens in the interim?

The pizza boxes must now go into the brown bin and not the recycling bin.  There is a market for paper.  We do not have the paper mills or the plastic recycling facilities.  I had a very interesting discussion with two of my colleagues in Canada last week.  They have come up with some solutions to get around this.  We are exploring those.  There are companies looking at providing processing facilities in Ireland.  There are processing facilities available in eastern Europe and we are accessing some of them at present.  It appears that we must establish a more comprehensive network of processing facilities in Europe.  It is about reducing the waste and providing material for recycling in a clean manner and having outlets for it in Europe without having to export it to China.  China is still taking some material.  Other parts of Asia are taking clean material.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018032100002#N00300","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1521639000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>We now come to programme G - appropriations-in-aid<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018032100002#N00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1521639000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Appropriations-in-aid are income receipts into my Department other than from the Exchequer.

Weight Management Service at Temple Street Children's University Hospital, and its staff, we thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to present on the challenge of addressing childhood obesity.  Temple Street hospital, as a national acute paediatric hospital, sees up to 145,000 children per year, promotes healthy lifestyles for all children, which includes the prevention of overweight, obesity and dental decay and the promotion of a healthy diet, exercise and optimum dental health, in addition to treating multiple clinical conditions.<\/p> <p>  I am joined by representatives from the W82GO! multi-disciplinary team, namely, Dr. Sarah McGuire, senior clinical paediatric psychologist, Ms Nicola Sheridan, clinical specialist physiotherapist in paediatrics and Ms Michelle Strahan, senior medical social worker in child protection.<\/p> <p>  I will begin by contextualising our role in childhood obesity in Ireland and highlighting that we can represent only one small part of a larger discussion related to the complex social challenge of obesity in children.  As such, we will focus solely on the treatment of clinical obesity in children and adolescents and recommend that additional stakeholders are invited to present on other aspects related to this issue.<\/p> <p>  The W82GO! clinical service was established in Temple Street hospital 14 years ago and, as with many worthy endeavours, the initiative was commenced without dedicated clinical funding but survived on staff commitment and research funding from the Temple Street Foundation and the Health Research Board of Ireland.  Thereafter, temporary seed funding from the Health Service Executive was secured and service development was facilitated.<\/p> <p>  Since 2017, some funding has been provided by Temple Street hospital, thanks to the vision and growing understanding of the childhood obesity problem by the hospital's executive team.  This understanding is founded on scientific evidence, including some stark facts.  These include the fact that 20% of children and 25% of adolescents in Ireland are overweight or obese; the fact that children with obesity are at increased risk of health complications at an early age; the fact that admissions to UK paediatric hospitals for weight related issues have quadrupled over ten years; and the fact that children with obesity are more likely to develop serious adult diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and many cancers.<\/p> <p>  The most recent data from the Irish arm of the WHO childhood obesity surveillance initiative, COSI, study run by the national nutrition surveillance centre at UCD, reveal that the estimated number of primary school children with clinical obesity and morbid obesity is around 6.5%.  From Growing Up in Ireland data we know that, in addition, approximately 6% of 13 year olds have clinical obesity.  This means an estimated 80,000 children and adolescents in Ireland have clinical obesity.  The rates of clinical and morbid obesity are nearly double in schools with high levels of disadvantage.  This is particularly worrying because these children are even more at risk of morbid obesity and cardiovascular ill-health in adulthood.<\/p><p>In Ireland, those with clinical obesity can receive multidisciplinary treatment at Temple Street.  However, they currently have to wait nearly two and a half years to see the treatment team.  For adolescents who will age out of paediatric services, this is particularly unacceptable.<\/p><p> A multitude of comorbidities are associated with obesity.  An estimated three quarters of children will develop health complications at an early age, including physical and mental health complications.  In Temple Street, we are conscious of the impact of childhood obesity on families.  We approach this issue from the perspective that family re-education and support are essential elements in changing the eating and exercise patterns of our patients.  We are also conscious that this can be particularly difficult for families with financial challenges or who have complex social circumstances.  We work to support families to address issues that can cause barriers to the successful treatment in the child&rsquo;s home.<\/p><p> The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child demands that those who are already obese and who may have comorbidities must have access to early treatment in childhood in order to avoid progression of associated conditions.  The most recent estimate of the lifetime economic and health care costs incurred due to childhood obesity indicates that the amount involved is over &euro;4.5 billion.  Treatment needs to be available for all children when and where they need it.  Research tells us the intervening early and in a holistic manner is essential if we are to manage this condition.  A staged approach is recommended based around the needs of the child.<\/p><p> The children of Ireland urgently require timely access to treatment in primary, secondary and tertiary care.  At primary care level, GPs and public health nurses who are interested in this area must be provided with the appropriate resources to treat obesity including access to practice nurses and to the paediatric health and social care professionals, HSCPs, working in the community.  They often deliver the bulk of childhood obesity treatments.  In addition, public health nurses will be unable to identify and act for infants and young children at risk of obesity if they do not have funding and staff dedicated to the delivery of infant and child health.<\/p><p> At secondary care level, any child in Ireland suffering with the physical or mental health comorbidities of obesity needs timely access to a general paediatric service.  Areas with large populations - for example, surrounding the satellite centre currently being built at the Connolly Hospital site and the planned centre at the Tallaght hospital site - need integrated services which must be clearly planned and implemented in the children&rsquo;s hospital group as a matter of urgency.  Only then can we ensure better access for those most severe coming into tertiary services.<\/p><p> At tertiary care level, discussions on obesity service provision have commenced between the HSE and the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group, CHG.  However, transparent planning and implementation engaging all those involved in the care of these children is needed.  Of particular concern is the lack of health and social care professional involvement at executive level in the CHG.  This will no doubt have a direct impact on children with obesity whose care is, in the main, delivered by HSCPs.  New services at the new children&rsquo;s hospital will also need to plan for the inclusion of bariatric procedures in line with best practice guidelines for those adolescents most severely affected.  My colleagues will now update on our service in Temple Street and on progress to date in the area of childhood obesity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018032100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Grace O'Malley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521624600,"counter":217,"content":"<p>As previously highlighted by my colleague, our team in Temple Street treat children who are clinically obese.  To explain this further, the average nine year old in Ireland weighs 34 kg, that is 5 stone 5 lb.  The average nine year old attending our clinic is 55 kg, or 8 stone 9 lb.  In keeping with the ICGP and HSE algorithm for childhood obesity management, all the children referred to our centre are clinically obese.  In the past 14 years since inception, we have treated over 1,500 children with obesity.  Specifically, between 2014 and 2018 we have had over 4000 attendances.  In 2017, 49% of patients were aged under ten years, 29% were 11 to 13 years and 22% were 14 years or older.<\/p> <p>  Treatment is provided in line with current best practice guidelines and patients are offered group-based family treatment or individualised treatment, based on the health care needs of the child. Over the past four years, we have seen rates of non-attendances reduce and rates of attendance increase.  Providing services to children and adolescents presenting with a range of complications is challenging because 40% already have risk factors for heart disease, 17% meet the criteria for having the metabolic syndrome, 40% have significant and severe mental health problems, and 75% have experienced bullying, with 11% experiencing severe bullying.  Unfortunately, a number of the children seen have a history of self-harm or suicidal intent.  These children have complex needs and as we know from other EU experiences they require access to the paediatric specialties.  Over 40% are from deprived to severely deprived areas and rates of homelessness have become more common.  As such, we are seeing at first hand the effects of inequality on health outcomes for  these children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018032100002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Nicola Sheridan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521624600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Since 2013, some substantial progress has been made.

In 2017 the HSE appointed a clinical lead for obesity, Professor Donal O&rsquo;Shea.  He has acknowledged the need to provide obesity services in the CHG.  There has been improved collaboration at Government level and in 2018 the Joint Committee on Education and Skills is convening to address the issue of obesity in children.  Further work is required, however.  For example, the CHG recognised obesity as an issue in paediatric health care in its 2016 operational plan.  However, to date, there have been no definite signals on whether or how the new children&rsquo;s hospital will provide the level of service currently available to those attending Temple Street.  The hospital will indeed be built according to bariatric specifications however the blueprints for the required clinical services are yet to be clarified.

There are short, medium and long-term effects.  I note that the unit is part of Growing Up in Ireland - National Longitudinal Study of Children.  Has the research and study had a bearing on the issue?  Fundamentally, this committee wants to find ways to stamp out obesity.  What tools are needed to tackle the problem?

While my colleagues can also comment on this matter, at undergraduate curricula level there is very little education in this field.  Therefore, recently qualified health professionals have a pretty inadequate knowledge of this field because it is relatively new.  Without question, the curricula need to be examined.  Based on that, graduates will have scientific evidence because we know that the problem is far more complex than just eating too much.  We know there is a huge epigenetic component.  Epigenetics is like a light switch, by which I mean one has the ability to switch something on or off.  Let us say a person is predisposed to gaining weight and leads a lifestyle whereby he or she is very stressed, not sleeping and eating ultra processed foods.  That switch gets switched on and then he or she is more likely to become obese.  Conversely, if a person is predisposed to obesity but that light switch is kept turned off, he or she is less prone to develop obesity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018032100002#K01900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Grace O'Malley"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I want to discuss the statement that families with financial challenges are more likely to be prone to obesity and 40% of the children who attend the unit come from seriously deprived backgrounds.

In the past month, five children who have been in a homeless situation over the past three or four years have attended our unit.  Even though their parents were working, the family could not access cooking facilities and the children developed the habit of hoarding and hiding food because they felt insecure and stressed.  Another issue is that sometimes, due to the educational attainment of people who come from a deprived background, they do not understand the necessity for good quality food and leaning how to cook and so on.  Many cheaper food options are heavily marketed and are widely available to the extent that eating healthily is difficult to do.<\/p> <p>  Having safe places for children to play is another factor.  In many areas children do not feel that is safe to play outside of where they live.  When we asked them whether they play outside of their homes they told us they were scared to do so due to shootings on their road or because of a real fear of being shouted at and bullied.  It is no surprise then that children are afraid to play outside and their parents are afraid to let them do so.  When I was growing up I played outside in my area all of the time with my family, neighbours and friends.  When I asked some of the children who attend the unit whether they have played hopscotch, I was surprised to learn that they did not know what it was, which is sad.  While parents may know the value of play, there is fear.

I thank her for the important work she does.  As the Chairman said, we have invited her in at the outset to highlight the seriousness of this problem.

I am grateful to the Chairman for putting it on the committee's agenda.  Dr. O'Malley has given us a list of organisations that should ideally attend the committee's hearings on this issue.  Perhaps we have already invited many of them.  I think the Irish College of General Practitioners needs to come before us.  Surely the introduction of free GP care for those under the age of six gives us an opportunity to track the likelihood of obesity arising in a child.  I understand that children are first weighed by GPs at the age of two.  Dr. O'Malley will correct me if I am wrong.  Does she think we need to face up to issues of societal embarrassment when we are dealing with families?  There is a reluctance to ascribe fault.  GPs should be able to tell parents that their children are becoming obese and that they need to do something about it.  A more mature approach to children's health needs to be taken at that stage in order to prevent them from being brought to Dr. O'Malley at a later stage.  Surely the fewer children she sees, the better.<\/p> <p>  As a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, I suggested that the assembly should prepare a report on this issue.  There is a lot of useful stuff in the report, which was published recently.  I am not sure whether my assistant sent it on.  The assembly usually confines its activities to Scotland, Ireland, England and Wales.  Representatives of those nations chat to one another about issues that affect them.  I argued that there was no point in talking to one another in this case because we do not know what to do where childhood obesity is concerned.  We decided instead to go to Amsterdam to examine the localised cross-departmental approach that has been adopted there.  Obviously, there is some childhood obesity in the Netherlands.  It is really interesting that local government has got involved in this issue in the Netherlands and I think we should look to mimic that approach.  The main point I took from our meetings is that patience is the big thing we need.  This problem did not develop overnight.  It will take a long time to sort it out.  Therefore, policymakers to be mindful of its gravity and complexity.  I am tired of listening to colleagues in the Seanad and elsewhere saying that children with childhood obesity are just fat and if they eat less, they will not be fat.  It is not that simple.  I am grateful that there are psychologists here who can speak to that.  I ask Dr. O'Malley to respond to the two points I have made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018032100002#L01500","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521624600,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Self-monitoring is part of normal practice that should be done everywhere.  The HSE's \"Make Every Contact Count\" initiative is definitely a welcome one.  It would be interesting to examine how GPs are resourced in the Netherlands by comparison with Ireland.  As far as I am aware, the current contracts here do not provide for any treatment.  That definitely has to be looked at.  We cannot expect primary care practitioners to deliver treatment when they are not paid to do so.  These patients definitely need to be treated by GPs and public health nurses, but the resourcing to facilitate this has to be guaranteed.  There is no point in a family picking up the courage to go to see a GP who might not attach any priority to a patient in respect of whom he or she is not able to be paid.  If a family gets a negative response or is not treated with the same dignity or respect that another patient would be treated with, there will be a reduction in that family's interest in attending again.  The Senator has mentioned stigmatisation, which is a huge issue.  Dr. McGuire will probably want to speak about this.  We have done a lot of work on stigmatisation across all of our society, including the Government and the media.  We need to have stricter rules on bullying people who are of a different shape.  We have rules and laws that prohibit bullying based on gender, race and sexual preference, but nothing of that kind applies to body shape.

In the case of a child on the more severe end of the scale, there may be parental mental health issues which may or may not be dealt with.  The parent may not be accessing services and the child will often have a mental health issue as a result.  This may not be a priority for the child and adolescent mental health services because it may not reach a threshold at which it will be deemed a priority.  Because of these issues, however, such children may not be going to school.  Educational achievement is incredibly important for health outcomes in the long run.<\/p> <p>  We see that kind of mix from a mental health point of view.  From a physical health point of view, our general understanding of this issue is \"move more, eat less\".  However, these kids will experience pain, so they are not able to exercise.  As they may not be confident moving or competent in their motor skill, they are not the kids who want to join sports.  They will be sidelined at PE or, depending on the ethos of the school, they may not be encouraged to participate because they do not achieve well in movement and games.<\/p> <p>  As human beings, we all know that food has a multitude of uses for us.  We use it to nourish ourselves to help ourselves grow but we also use it to soothe ourselves.  If a child grows up in an environment where food is used as a reward or where it is used to sedate or placate, a cycle is set up very early.  As a society, we still think very simplistically about obesity.  The new Horizon 2020 research call includes funding in the area of endocrine disruptors.  There are huge issues around pollution, which can disrupt how hormones work within the body.  Water pollution, air pollution and plastics within our food system can affect us.  The same is true of ultra-processed foods.  It is like climate change.  The child or adult is a physical manifestation of the environment in which he or she is living.  This does not just include the family home.  It pertains to people's own biology, the family home and the society they are living in. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018032100002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Grace O'Malley"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I would like to ask about the role played by supermarkets and food producers.

Speaking for myself, if we grow up with a privileged middle-class lifestyle, we do not really appreciate the skills we glean by osmosis when surrounded by capable, skilled parents.  There is definitely an issue around the promotion of unhealthy ultra-processed products.  The sugar tax is definitely going to help that, but we need to evaluate how promotions change within supermarkets.  As the cost of one beverage goes up, are they promoted differently?  We must also examine how they are marketed.  The Sydney principles call for the regulation of food marketing to children but we have not been very good about moving on that in Ireland.  The Irish Heart Foundation, whose representatives the committee will hopefully invite, has done a lot of work around online advertising, which is hugely important.<\/p> <p>  In the realm of technology, retail stores are now using really pervasive techniques to draw people into the retail environment.  Because the child is not really protected in the online world, there is even more vigorous marketing towards children.  There is a big difference between different supermarkets.  Some are much better at providing a balance between healthy foods and ultra-processed foods, but when one walks into some corner stores and local shops, one is confronted solely by ultra-processed food.

A lot less sugar is going into foods because at the end of the day, these companies want to sell their products.  It is all about profits.

The issue must be addressed by planners using a whole-of-government approach.  The EU is considering the matter and it is an issue for all of Europe.<\/p> <p>  Community supports and mental health services have been mentioned.  Understanding what the acceptance criteria of these services are is really important.  Why do some services accept children with certain conditions but some will not even though they all receive funding from the public purse?  We believe that every child needs to be able to access a service.  Of course we accept that there must be prioritisation.

Collecting the data is not as easy as saying we think it is a certain percentage.  Without questions around parental educational attainment, maternal educational attainment and income, it is very hard to get good data.  We can use small area research unit data, based on the child's address, of whether he or she is from an area of disadvantage.

I do not think anybody would disagree with such a view.  More ultra processed foods are available and marketed, particularly to vulnerable groups such as children.  Sadly, children are considered to be a vulnerable group.  Also, physical activity has decreased throughout our society.  In terms of running, there is more litigation in schools.  The matter must be considered.  One cannot have a situation where children are not allowed to run about during break time at their schools due to a fear of litigation.  Internationally, there is a sleep debt.  It has been discovered that people sleep two hours less now compared with 50 years ago.  A proper amount of sleep is important if one wants to manage hormones that affect weight.  Children sleep less due their use of technology.  I know that some Oireachtas committees have recently discussed technology usage by children.  It is important that all of us switch off our mobile telephones at night in order to protect our health.

It occurs to me as someone who will go through this process with his colleagues over the next number of months - it could be six or seven months and well into the autumn before we complete it - that, when trying to figure out how to approach it and what the best model would be, there are three or four main themes, those being, food intake and education, psychology, and health, exercise and activity.  If the witnesses put themselves in our shoes for a moment, how would they approach it?  From my perspective, it is not just about physical activity, although that is an important aspect.  A fear of litigation was mentioned.  That situation is crazy.  While I was in a primary school in my constituency not that long ago, I heard a teacher roaring \"stop running\" as I walked through the yard.  I wondered why anyone would stop a child running.  I would not mind, but it was on grass.  I thought it might be the small break and the school had that element of discipline so I did not interfere, but it appeared strange.

We must try to break the cycle of screen time and the other elements that the committee discussed in our previous reporting.<\/p> <p>  On the healthy eating side, ease of access to foodstuffs that are saturated in fat, sugar or worse is an issue.  I noted the interesting discussion between Senators Noone and Reilly and Deputy Neville on sugar tax and its effectiveness.  I was always concerned that a sugar tax might have a detrimental effect on certain socioeconomic groupings.  That remains to be borne out, but it is positive to see the industry taking the initiative and opting for drinks that are less sugar sweetened.  Senator Noone has done considerable work in that regard, at least from the perspective of public perception.  It is noted and appreciated.<\/p> <p>  The other side of the situation is the question of psychological issues with food and food intake, be those relating to bullying, the body image issues that Deputy Neville alluded to or a failure to parent, which might be an abuse in itself or a result of abuse or lack of knowledge about how to parent in respect of food intake.

It was a pilot initiative to see whether we could work with some community health care professionals to provide services locally.  It was a really interesting project.  We were very much operating on a wing and a prayer.  It did not involve a huge amount of planning or communication around how we might get the best outputs from it but the community teams were really wonderful.  They were very committed and we did our best to try and set up a system of sorts.  What came out of that was some really valuable information about understanding the community and working with it before trying to say \"do it this way\" and understanding the needs of that community.  From that work, we have a template on how we might go further.  In 2014 and 2015, the Government and the HSE did commit some funding to experiment a bit.  We got a lot of learning from that and we can build on that for a hub and bespoke model or to improve community services in the future.<\/p> <p>  Failure to parent was mentioned.  We very rarely see a failure to parent.  It is usually around capacity issues or opportunities for parents to parent because often both parents are working shift work and there is very little time when the parents are actually in the home in many cases.  We very much work with parents.  From a young age, we are working with parents and linking parents in with parenting programmes around how to say \"No\" and behaviour.  Dr. McGuire will probably have more to say.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018032100002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Grace O'Malley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521624600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>As we mentioned earlier, many parents might come from low socioeconomic backgrounds or have huge psycho-social stressors so they have other issues going on as well.  Tackling this can be very overwhelming.  A lot of the work we do involves supporting them to set smaller goals that are reachable and the inherent reinforcement that comes from reaching the goal allows the children to make progress in modelling that within the house.  Maybe they have to make systemic changes in the house such as not bringing in treats.  It becomes about the whole family as opposed to just the one person.  Families tend to need support with that even to get started initially.  When they come to the initial group, they are able to go away and put in some of those changes but they do need support around it in respect of getting started, keeping that motivation going and setting realistic goals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018032100002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sarah McGuire"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I have no problem with the nanny state policies, as my colleague knows well.

To provide the committee with some background, I am a clinically and research-active GP who trained in epidemiology and public health.  I have been based in the UK for 14 years, working in Oxford, Bristol and latterly Dundee.  Since returning to the RCSI in 2006, I have led the Centre for Primary Care Research, which is nationally funded by the Health Research Board, HRB.  To give the committee a brief idea of what we have done in that time, our research group is active in the area of prescription medicines and drug safety.  We work with colleagues in the school of pharmacy in Queen's University Belfast, and this has enabled us to examine the quality and safety of prescribing in Ireland both North and South and to benchmark Irish prescribing practice to other countries.<\/p> <p>  The current challenges in Ireland are that prescribing in many hospitals remains a paper-based activity; communication regarding medication for patients between hospitals, general practice and pharmacy is also predominantly paper-based.  This means that transcription, dosage and monitoring errors are more common and patients are at greater risk of adverse drug events.  Electronic prescribing and dispensing are the standard in general practice and pharmacy practice, but electronic prescribing and dispensing systems do not interact effectively, meaning the process of prescribing and dispensing is disjointed and poorly integrated across the health sectors.  Lastly, access to prescribing data for research, education and quality improvement purposes is very limited in Ireland.  The solution to all these issues is to develop an e-prescribing platform in Ireland with appropriate training and education for all health professionals involved in prescribing.  Enhanced transparency in respect of prescribing practice will enable a culture of professional reflection and engagement with nationally established quality improvement initiatives, such as the medicines management programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Tom Fahey"},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Fahey.

The college is committed to helping doctors to enhance their skills, competencies and professionalism throughout their working lives.  The RCPI includes six of the 13 postgraduate medical training bodies, including the faculty of occupational medicine, the faculty of paediatrics, the faculty of pathology, the faculty of public health medicine, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Irish committee on higher medical training, which includes medicine.  It also has two joint faculties, namely, the joint faculty of intensive care medicine of Ireland with the College of Anaesthetists of Ireland and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the faculty of sports and exercise medicine, which is a joint faculty with the RCSI.  The college also provides lifelong learning and continuous professional development for members and allied health care professionals.  The RCPI leads 20 ground-breaking national clinical programmes in conjunction with the HSE that are helping to transform health care in Ireland.  The college is also a passionate advocate to improve the health of the nation.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>As for medical training and education, the prescribing of medicines is a fundamental part of the interaction between doctors and patients and is an integral part of the postgraduate medical training programmes and continuous professional development courses provided by the RCPI.  Every year, the RCPI delivers over 200 courses to approximately 7,000 participants to equip health care professionals with the skills to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving society.  As a college, our objective is to deliver world-class specialist training to the 1,200 doctors in our basic and higher postgraduate medical training programmes across all the specialties alluded to above, which are in the main delivered in hospitals across Ireland.  As these trainees are responsible for a substantial amount of prescriptions given to patients in hospitals, it is fundamental that they are equipped with the knowledge and skills to do this safely and effectively.  All of our courses on safe prescribing are mandatory for doctors in our basic specialist training programmes, which is a programme just after intern year.  They include awareness of prescription pattern monitoring and the audit of usage and effectiveness trends for prescribed medications and the economics of prescribing.  All the doctors who come to the RCPI already will have some knowledge of prescribing as it falls within the remit of undergraduate medical schools.  As I have just completed a term as dean of the medical school in University College Cork, UCC, I am aware of this. <br\/><br\/>In our basic specialist training programmes, safe prescribing is embedded in our curriculum and focuses on prescribing in various medical speciality areas such as obstetrics and gynaecology, general internal medicine and paediatrics.  We also deliver a clinical pharmacology training programme for a small number of specialist doctors at a higher level.  Our courses are designed to support doctors to prescribe the right dose of the right drug for the right diagnosis to the right patient at the right time.  Trainees learn about the elements of safe and appropriate prescribing, adverse drug reactions and to how report them to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, risk management and legislation related to prescribing in Ireland.  A mandatory course has also been developed for doctors in haematology and oncology that covers the essentials of chemotherapy.  Doctors learn about the essentials of chemotherapy, including classification of chemotherapeutic agents, the principles of chemotherapy, standards and the mechanics of chemotherapy and common supportive medications, pharmaeconomics, which is very important, and drug access.  In addition to safe prescribing, trainees are taught to help to combat the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.  I am an infectious disease physician and this is a particularly challenging area of our job in hospital-based medicine.<\/p><p>Antibiotics are the most commonly prescribed drugs and our course outlines the general principles regarding antibiotic prescribing, the mechanism of action and spectrum of activity of commonly prescribed antibiotic, the rates of antibiotic resistance in Ireland and key aspects relating to antibiotic stewardship.  This online course is approved by the national hospital antibiotic stewardship committee.  Value for money and efficiencies are addressed through an online introduction to the health economics landscape in Ireland that focuses on health service funding models, equity, cost effectiveness analysis and health technology assessments.  These courses have all recently been reviewed and updated and are generally updated every three to five years.  RCPI is committed to providing world class postgraduate medical training and education for the next generation of specialists and will continue to explore how to enhance this experience in all areas, including prescribing of medicine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Mary Horgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Horgan.

We intend to split our five minute opening statement into several sections and I will begin.<\/p> <p>  To provide some context, there is a rising prevalence of chronic diseases and multi-morbidity in Irish society and while this is not currently reflected in the new GP contract, we hope that it will be soon.  This increased prevalence coupled with the fact that we have an ageing population means that we have seen a rise in the number of dispensed items and in the cost of medications in the annual health budget.  Our submission outlines in detail the expenditure on pharmaceutical products but in summary, we spend approximately &euro;2 billion on pharmaceutical products per year.  That money comes exclusively from the community budget, even if the product is prescribed in a hospital setting.  In contrast to our drug budget, Irish general practice is extremely poorly resourced.  We spend less than 4.5% of our overall health care budget on general practice.  At a time when GP led, community oriented health care should have happened, we have seen a massive retraction in GP funding and in the time we have with each patient.  The FEMPI cuts are still imposed on general practice, which limits time for patient care.  We work off a 40 year old contract and have severe capacity restraints, with the lowest number of GPs per head of population in Europe.  We are also seeing an exodus of our GP graduates.<\/p> <p>  I will now provide some context for how repeat prescribing works.  In the context of acute consultations, it is estimated that two out of every three will result in an acute prescription but GPs manage the repeat prescribing.  All of the repeat prescriptions that are issued in pharmacies are delivered by GPs.  We might issue a repeat script every three to six months but this can be more frequent if there is a clinical need.  While the GP takes the responsibility and assumes the risk for repeat prescribing, the GP may not have been the original prescribing doctor.  If a drug is initiated in hospital, the GP transcribes that prescription to a GMS script for a GMS eligible patient.<\/p> <p>  The ICGP supports evidence based and cost effective treatments in the Irish health care setting, including prescriptions.  The ICGP also supports initiatives from the medicines management programme to support effective prescribing.  Opportunity costs are evident throughout the health care system, whereby we spend money on low value products with limited benefit and excessive costs which results in other areas of our public health care system being under funded. <\/p> <p>  Finally, with respect to evidence of trends, from a general perspective raw data from the annual Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, statistical analysis is very helpful but we must remember that it is raw.  I point committee members to the work of the department of general practice staff of the Royal College of Surgeons, where I also work.  Professor Tom Fahey and Dr. Frank Moriarty have published research in this area which shows that from 1997 to 2012, there has been a massive increase in prescribing.  The prescribing of ten or more drugs for over 65s in 1997 stood at 2% but by 2012 this had increased to 22%.  Prescribing has increased massively and we must ask if this is appropriate.  The Health Research Board has examined this and found that the odds of what is called \"potentially inappropriate\" prescribing in 2012 compared to 1997 have reduced by 60%.<\/p><p>GPs and hospitals are prescribing more medications for an ageing, more complex and more multimorbid population but they are doing a better job at it.  Our submission also outlines valuable research from other cohort studies, such as the Irish longitudinal study on ageing.  That has shown that we can save more than &euro;150 million each year if we introduce a system of reference pricing.<\/p><p> Finally, I will address the prescription of benzodiazepines, anti-depressants, opioids and antibiotics.  These are high-profile, topical drugs.  We can discuss this in the questions-and-answers session but I will discuss anti-depressants as an example.  In 2016, we spent more than &euro;40 million on anti-depressants.  To put that in context, we spent only &euro;10 million on counselling in primary care.  All evidence suggests that GPs are prescribing very appropriately in the context of a severe capacity shortage in general practice and primary care.  Our prescribing of anti-depressants largely reflects a lack of psychological therapies and a lack of social therapies to deal with issues including isolation, fragmented communities and austerity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521622800,"counter":392,"content":"<p>What can we do about it?  It is pivotal that GPs are provided with sufficient time and resources to enable shared discussion on medicines management.  We need to address the challenge of medicines reconciliation across health interfaces and promote electronic discharges to reduce error and improve quality.  The role of clinical pharmacists in the general practice team or in a nursing home setting should be explored albeit as part of a new GP contract.  Monitoring and audit of prescribing, if done correctly, has the potential to be an extremely powerful tool for GPs in their ongoing efforts to deliver the very best care for their patients.<\/p> <p>  Research and audit needs to be actively supported and promoted at the highest level.  We need to be careful when comparing raw prescribing data from individuals with national standards.  We need to take account of confounders such as poverty and deprivation or conditions such as multimorbidity and depression.  Continuous medical education has seen a curtailment in funding in recent years and this needs to be reversed.  Pharmaceutical advertising in the national media indirectly promoting certain products has been an unwelcome development in recent years.  This should come under legislative control, as GPs are encountering demand for drugs and services which have dubious cost-benefit.  This committee should endorse a recommendation for a ban on non-governmental health care advertising, especially the indirect promotion of drugs in the media.<\/p> <p>  GPs need time to deal with complex cases.  This will require a modern GP contract that facilitates the management of chronic conditions and medication management.  Before this, there is need for the urgent reversal of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, provisions, which have curtailed the ability of general practices to grow at a time when GP services should be expanding in the light of multimorbidity, ageing and increased numbers.  We also need to retain our brightest and best GPs.  Some 20% leave the country.  They see other health care systems as a preferable career option.  The ICGP is becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of Government action on these key matters. <\/p> <p>  We need to direct any savings that we make in drug prescribing back into general practice to reinforce a cycle that is to the benefit of the patient and of the health system more widely.  A medicines management programme, led by GPs, needs to be created as part of the new contract.  The ICGP is willing to continue to work and collaborate with the HSE and educational bodies to promote cost-effective, evidence-based prescribing.  Sometimes collaboration has not happened.  An example would be online ratification for the issuing of certain drugs, which is time-consuming and often quite complicated.  This has disenfranchised and increased frustration among GPs as they try to deliver care.  Prescribing trends can only be identified through research and audit.  Academic career structures for GPs have not been sufficiently facilitated by the HSE or the Department of Health.<\/p><p>Similarly, research on our electronic health records is underdeveloped in the Irish setting - I refer, for example, to the research done through the Irish Primary Care Research Network, which is run through the ICGP - and will require expansion and State funding in order to deliver savings in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. John O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Brien.

We appreciate their commitment to trying to improve the health care sector.  As the Chairman has outlined, we decided to look at the increase in the prescribing of drugs on foot of media coverage of the issue.  According to the paper submitted by Professor Fahey, the percentage of people over the age of 65 to whom five or more medicines are prescribed has increased from 17.8% to 60.4% and the percentage of people in this older cohort to whom ten or more medicines are prescribed has increased from 1.5% to 21.9%.  I wonder how this country compares with other countries in this regard.  Are comparisons available?  Can what has occurred in this country in this area be compared with what has occurred in other countries in this area?<\/p> <p>  I know there have been huge demographic changes in Ireland.  People are living longer.  Life expectancy has increased by 2.5 years since 2000.  This means we have more people over the age of 65.  The number of such people will continue to increase.  I am sure the witnesses have looked at the changes in demographics we will face over the next 12 years.  How can we best deal with this issue?  If we have more people over the age of 65, will we have an increased level of demand for medications and will costs continue to increase?  The cost of medication has increased dramatically over the past ten or 15 years.  I think the annual cost of pharmaceuticals was approximately &euro;570 million in 2000, but now it is slightly over &euro;2 billion.  When there is such a substantial increase, other areas like GP funding lose out.  I agree with the witnesses that the whole GP contract needs to be reformed.  That needs to be fast-tracked.  I have been one of the people looking for that.<\/p> <p>  The second issue I want to raise is electronic prescribing, which is used very effectively in other countries.  Sample prescriptions have been given to us today.  If we tried in the morning to set a target for the introduction of electronic prescribing across GPs, hospitals and pharmacies, and if the necessary funding were provided, what kind of timescale would be required for the introduction of such a system?  Should we be setting targets to be achieved?  My concern about health care is that we seem to be doing budgets on a year-to-year basis without also doing long-term planning.  We have lost out in the whole area of electronic records.  Someone who goes to three different hospitals will have three different files.  The same point can be made with regard to prescribing.  I wonder whether we can set targets and, if so, what kind of timescale would be required for us to implement those targets.<\/p> <p>  My final point relates to the substantial increase in the number of people applying for GP training this year.  There has been a slight increase in the number of places, but this has not been substantial enough.  Do the witnesses believe we can reverse the exodus of GPs out of the Irish system?  If a new contract is offered, obviously it has to be attractive.<\/p><p>Will Ireland still compete on the world market?  This is one of the problems we are now dealing with in all areas of medicine.  We are no longer competing in an Irish market or a UK market, rather we are competing with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States of America.  What else do we need to do besides providing a new contract?  What else do we need to do to keep medical personnel in Ireland and to provide a better level of service at community level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#M00300","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and I apologise for misnaming Senator Burke earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#N00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for giving up their valuable time to speak with us today.

This is serious and has the potential of snowballing and becoming more serious.  Do the doctors have statistics to back up this contention and could they comment further on this issue?<\/p> <p>  The committee recently discussed the need for GPs to be transparent on the issue of gifts received, for example, from pharmaceutical companies.

Would this be true of drugs for pain management?  In the absence of access to proper physiotherapy, are GPs finding themselves in situations where they now have to prescribe painkillers?  Would we see a reduction in the amount of pain management medication being prescribed if the resources and personnel were available in the primary care centres and if there was a fully functioning primary care team that included physiotherapy and other therapies?  We are aware that these services are not in primary care centres but would this be more appropriate?  Could it be better managed if more supports were available in the community?  Perhaps the witnesses could give their views on where those supports should be based and how people might be able to access them.  I understand that the majority of supports that are provided are in the private sector and are for people who have the money, and that the supports are not available for people on medical cards.<\/p> <p>  We cannot sit here and not talk about the pain medication patch, Versatis.  This issue has been in the media where it was highlighted that the level of use of the patch in Ireland is out of kilter with its use in other jurisdictions.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on this issue in the context of the availability of therapies.<\/p> <p>  I have another query that is related to the use of Versatis.  Is it the witnesses' opinion that GPs want to be in a position to prescribe it but cannot do so?  Clearly GPs were prescribing Versatis, and I am sure the witnesses will tell me the GPs were prescribing it in line with procedures and so on, and that is fine.  They were, however, prescribing it and now they cannot.  Are there other drugs such as this?  Are GPs sitting in their surgeries this morning with medical card patients in front of them thinking, \"I would like to be in a position to prescribe these drugs\"?<\/p><p>Can the witnesses give an estimation of whether that is a problem?  We are currently debating legislation on the eighth amendment.  People know my view on that which I will not rehearse as it is not for this committee.  In the event that the amendment is repealed, it is proposed to roll out a GP-led model.  I do not propose to go into the merits of that, but will specific training be required of GPs and how long will it take?  Are we equipped to upskill GPs in the event that the eighth amendment is repealed?<\/p><p> Dr. Murphy said that having controlled the issue for polypharmacy, the odds of potentially inappropriate prescribing in 2012 compared to 1997 have reduced by 60%.  What he is saying is that, in essence, we are prescribing more drugs but getting better at prescribing them.  How do we fit with the rest of Europe on this?  What I have read in the newspapers indicates that we are out of line and have a problem as a nation with prescription drugs.  I am sure Dr. Murphy has seen that.  Clearly, we are not writing the prescriptions for ourselves; they come from somewhere.  Perhaps Dr. Murphy could give us a view on that.<\/p><p> As to nurses prescribing, is there much interaction between the GP service and nurse prescribers?  Are there many nurse prescribers in the community?  Could we make better use of the skills of nurses within the community with regard to prescribing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#N00400","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":401,"content":"<p>We might start with Professor Fahey.

We are not that far out of kilter with other countries.  Every country in the developing world has experienced a substantial increase in the use of medicines which, by and large, has been a very good thing.  We should not forget that.  While we can, rightly, worry about inappropriate medicines, many of these drugs are very efficacious and helpful for patients and they have improved the length and quality of people's lives.  While that is likely to continue, I do not know if many projections on demographic trends have been done in that regard.  Most of the focus now is on trying to alleviate errors of omission.  In other words, we must prescribe drugs which we know are effective to patients who benefit from them.  Then there are errors of commission, which are those Dr. Mark Murphy just mentioned where potentially inappropriate drugs are prescribed and the risk-benefit ratio is marginal at best and potentially harmful.  That is the context of what has happened.  As we have all seen over our professional careers, the main challenge is to get the balance right in terms of drugs which are effective and helpful for patients while reducing as much as we can the use of potentially inappropriate drugs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Tom Fahey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521622800,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I was asked by Deputy Murphy O'Mahony about antibiotic resistance and whether training was enough.  More than training is required.  There needs to be ongoing education, not only of health-care professionals but of the public too.  Not all infectious diseases I see require antibiotics.  Many of them are viral infections for which there may not be any treatment.  It is often fluids and paracetamol that cure those.  People are under pressure to get back to work and get their kids to school and it is important to keep that in mind, but ongoing sustained education of the public is important.  Immunisation is important also, in particular for influenza.  We had another outbreak this year.  There is a very effective vaccine available.  While it changes a little from year to year, it is safe and effective and it prevents infections.  There are other vaccines, for example the pneumococcal vaccine which prevents a certain type of pneumonia.  With that, one can reduce the use of antibiotics.  A lot of us may also prescribe courses of antibiotics which are a bit too long.  Using shorter courses of antibiotics can cure a lot of the infections we see.<\/p><p> Lastly, it is important to educate doctors on prescribing the correct antibiotic for the appropriate infection.  Sometimes doctors prescribe very broad spectrum antibiotics for an infection such as cellulitis which can be targeted with a very narrow range antibiotic.  This is just a reminder on prescribing.  Just because an antibiotic is new and more expensive does not mean that it is the best one for a particular condition.  There is a need for ongoing education and training on prescribing that should be integrated in our daily practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Mary Horgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Public awareness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#P00200","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521622800,"counter":406,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

Some 40% of the funding of general practice has been taken out of the system.  The first point that one must realise is that this has had consequences.  GPs need time with people for a variety of reasons.  The management of medication is only one of those reason, but there is also the management of their other problems, such as social and psychological problems.  In order to provide time, one needs staff and staff cost money.  This is linked to the issue that we are losing 20% of our GPs each year.  They are choosing to go abroad.  Their career opportunities are being impaired by what is taking place.<\/p> <p>  On the question of Versatis, it is worth noting that today there will be approximately 650 people on trolleys and some 500,000 people are waiting for appointments.  Where do those people go for care?  They actually end up in general practices and there is little in the line of immediate support in general practice for many of the conditions people have.  We are talking about psychological therapies, physiotherapy and access to consultations with consultants, but those services are not available.  The GPs are left in a predicament where they have to do something with the person who is in front of them who may be in pain.  Not all of the 500,000 people who are on waiting lists are in pain, but some are.  It ends up that medication is tried and if it is effective, that is great.  Everybody has a pain tree, so one might start in the first instance by taking paracetamol and then one might take opioids.<\/p><p> Another is that one does not like to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatories in elderly people because of the impact on the kidneys.  One might then wonder if there might be a neurogenic aspect to it or whether a Versatis patch might be a suitable way of prescribing in respect of a particular person.  The Versatis patch is now much more difficult to get, so one finds oneself scratching around for other forms of nerve-blocking agents.  As a result, one looks at anti-depressants, which are used but which tend to sedate.  There is increased use of pregabalin, which has the brand name Lyrica and of which the members may have heard.  It diverts prescribing into other areas.  As a result, that issue arises again.  The net problem is that there is not enough provision where it is necessary.  It is necessary to bring the guns up to the front line.  The front line is general practice.  GPs deal with their patients in a holistic way and on a continuous basis.  There is a whole iterative process that takes place and they are comprehensive, dealing with everything from people with diabetes to children with ear infections.  If one is prepared to bring the assets to bear in the place of least expense and at the point of earliest contact, one is likely to have the best impact possible.  If one does not do so, one is in trouble.  We see the trolley numbers, the waiting times and the numbers on waiting lists, but what we cannot see is the contraction in the amount of time that GPs have to give to their patients, which is a major source of much of what the members are speaking about this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#P00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. John O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521622800,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I will take a number of the remaining questions, some of which are difficult.  Senator Colm Burke asked about ehealth.  It is a very heterogenous, complex and large phenomenon.  We are very saddened to see the loss of Richard Corbridge.  We need to retain people and build incrementally.  It is a loss to our health system that multi-annual capital funding was not put in place in respect of this.  Professor Horgan and I would agree that it is not about blaming GPs and community-based doctors or hospital doctors, but errors can happen with handwriting and paper.  That is the reality.  My practice lives off fax machines, which is not good enough.  Professor Fahey has shown examples of prescriptions that are illegible.  I am frequently unable to read a prescription of 16 drugs, and would not be able to contact the prescribing doctor in the hospital.  I am not blaming that doctor.  That is a State error, because we have not invested sufficiently in electronic discharges.  Electronic referrals have started, which go to the hospitals, and I now do that.  It is very useful for the clerking doctor in the emergency department, but we need a full roll-out of electronic discharges when the patients returns to me.  We are ready to go on electronic prescribing but, unfortunately, our electronic health records, which have been there for 15 years, do not talk to the secondary care electronic health records, nor do they talk to the pharmacy electronic health records.  We are ready to go now.  The question of timescale is one for the Department of Health and the Minister to answer.  It also requires funding.<\/p> <p>  GP training numbers have increased to 202 this year.  We have now filled 194 places, which is welcome.  On whether we can reverse the exodus with a new GP contract, I am of the view that if GPs can do what they are trained to do and manage chronic illnesses, access diagnostics and have a satisfying work environment, we will absolutely retain them.  I am very committed to that.<\/p> <p>  Responding to Deputy Murphy O'Mahony, to put it in context, GPs manage the majority of mental health problems in the State.  This includes patients with severe anxiety, generalised anxiety disorder, panic attacks, severe depression and labels that we do not even use for people - just mental health complex phenomena.  In my practice, I probably start patients on anti-depressants each week.  They work and there is a strong evidence base to show that they are effective.  They are in every guideline for managing mental health problems across the world for moderate and severe depression.  The first-line treatments are lifestyle, social treatments and psychological treatments.  I am afraid that sometimes those psychological services are not there.  In the case of private patients, I had a patient recently who spent &euro;1,200 accessing cognitive behaviour therapy for their son aged 15 years.  It is an absolute disgrace.<\/p><p>That patient did not start on anti-depressants, although that would have been a lot cheaper.  First-line therapy was started but it is prohibitively expensive.  I am afraid that it can take a GMS patient up to six months to access psychological services which, when accessed, are excellent.  That is the reality.  <\/p><p> Gifts from pharmaceutical companies is a complicated issue.  I personally do not see pharmaceutical company representatives but indirectly, a lot of our medical education is partly funded by the pharmaceutical industry.  It is not a black and white issue but I personally do not deal with company representatives.  Transparency is absolutely required in this area.  A recent development in this area is the IPHA's Transfers of Value register, which allows one to go online and see who has voluntarily declared income from pharmaceutical companies.  The voluntary aspect of that probably needs to change.  We need to know those numbers and I would stand over that.<\/p><p> The medicines management programme is an excellent programme run by the HSE that delivers education to patients and doctors.  Doctors always need to improve quality and standards.  In terms of antibiotic stewardship, for example, it has developed a suite and platform to enable GPs and patients to understand appropriate prescribing.  However, sometimes that involves a transfer of workload and that must be factored in, as a matter of basic respect.<\/p><p> I will deal briefly with Versatis before touching on nurse prescribing and the eighth amendment.  We can only prescribe cost effective drugs.  If there is an indication, we will prescribe it and for neuropathic pain, the prescribing of Versatis by GPs is both legitimate and understandable.  I am not blaming anyone but much of the Versatis prescribing came from the secondary care setting, that is, from pain clinics.  As a GP, if I referred a patient to a pain specialist and he or she waited for 18 months to be seen and was then referred back to me, I could not just say that I did not agree with the pain specialist, if the drug had been prescribed already.  I welcome the initiative to reduce inappropriate prescribing but as a GP, I am expected to spend 15 minutes on an online platform for each patient.  As a matter of respect, the HSE must talk to our representative bodies about that.  Let us do it and let us consider other drugs on which money can be saved but we must bear in mind that there is a cost aspect to that.<\/p><p> On nurse prescribing, I work with a nurse who is a prescriber and I believe we should get going on this.  This is all part of the GP contract.  There has been a feeling within general practice for the past 15 years that they have not believed in the current model of general practice.  They are finally coming around to that.  It is to the detriment of patient care that funding to allow practice nurses to train in this area and to upskill has not been provided.  That must happen.  Obviously there are quality and educational issues that need to be factored in but most other health care systems have allowed nurses to expand their portfolio of skills and we should allow that to happen here.<\/p><p>On the eighth amendment, Deputy O'Reilly knows my personal opinion.  However, I am speaking here on behalf of the Irish College of General Practitioners.  The college made a submission to the Citizen's Assembly and to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, both of which came up with what they believe are workable recommendations.  There is a problem with the phrase \"GP led\" because in the future, we do not know what model will develop.  Specialists and clinicians who have an interest in this area, whether in secondary care or in the community, will provide the service.  I know there are many clinicians who will do so and that model needs to be thrashed out and delivered.

I wish to raise the issue of e-prescribing and the cost-benefit analysis of same.  What are the potential benefits of a greater reliance on and upgrading of technology in terms of making prescribing more effective and efficient?<\/p><p>For instance, how do we rate at the present time in comparison with other jurisdictions in terms of our GPs, consultants, hospitals and so on?  I got a report from somebody recently to the effect that we are light years behind.  Everything has a waiting time.  One has to wait for X-rays, for scans and for reports.  This waiting time intrigues me.  I have raised it in this committee on numerous occasions in the past.  I presume that technology is the way around that issue.  However, if the person to whom a message is given at a particular time also has a list of people waiting, it does not serve any useful purpose at all.  Everybody is in a circle of waiting.  Essentially I am asking how fully that issue has been studied.  How do the witnesses see efficiencies in that area benefitting the patient?<br\/><br\/>On under-prescribing and over-prescribing, how much evidence exists of under-prescribing, for example, ultimately resulting in a longer duration of prescription by virtue of an inadequate prescription in the beginning?  This is something that certainly has been brought to my attention in the past.  As a result of trying to ensure that we do not cause the problems about which we are all worried in respect of resistance to antibiotics, there is a tendency to under-prescribe, resulting in a longer period of medication, which ultimately has the reverse effect.  The patient consumes far more than they would have done if he or she had got an adequate prescription in the beginning.<br\/><br\/>The last question I want to raise relates to Versatis and the alleged excessive use of it.  I take the points that have been made in respect of solving the particular problem which presents itself at a particular time.  I am concerned, however, that in comparison with the UK, we seem to be way ahead in terms of prescription in that area.  There has to be some reason for that.  It escapes me at the moment.  I do not know what it is.  If it is an instant solution, why is it not an instant solution in the UK?  I fully appreciate the fact that pain can be a factor that can drive people to seek the ultimate solution in the shortest possible time, but why is it that our use <i>per capita<\/i>is way ahead of that of the UK?  To what is that attributable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#R00300","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#S00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":419,"content":"<p>The Chairman looks shocked.

I could spend all day talking about this.  I thank the witnesses for coming in.  First, regarding formularies, I am sure that everyone on the committee is aware of it but I am a pharmacist by profession.  When I worked in the UK approximately 15 years ago, formulary prescribing was standard across the NHS.  I was surprised when I came back to Ireland that this was not the case.  For example, the particular trust in which I worked made a deal with Wyeth, the company which made Zoton at the time.  Everybody who was admitted to the hospital in which I worked, no matter what proton pump inhibitor, PPI, they were on, left on Zoton unless there was contraindications relating to diarrhoea, an intolerance to the drug or so forth.  We seem never to have done that in this country.  I understand that GPs want autonomy over their prescribing in the same way that pharmacists want a degree of autonomy, but that sort of logic on bulk-buying never seems to have transferred here.  That said, it is not all bad.  When I came back there were no generics on the market in Ireland and we could not substitute generics.  If a doctor such as the Chairman wrote a prescription for Zoton, we had to give Zoton.  That has obviously been resolved since.<\/p> <p>  With regard to formularies and our guidelines, I will move onto Brexit.  We all depend on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, guidelines for our prescribing and that may now be taken from us with Brexit.  Do the witnesses think that Ireland needs its own group or should there be prescribing guidelines from Europe to govern European countries?<\/p><p>I missed the start of the presentation but I heard very little reference to pharmacists in the contributions.  Perhaps I am wrong, but I asked my colleagues on either side of me and they did not hear mention of pharmacists either.  It seems bizarre that we would talk about polypharmacy and medicines management without mentioning pharmacists.  I was a medicines management pharmacist in the UK and I can read this perfectly.  It is very bad, but is a very good example of why we have errors and why we cannot collate data.  As Dr. Murphy outlined - and Dr. Harty knows this - the situation is that this comes rattling through on a fax machine.  It has probably been crumpled by the person on the far side.  This is the practical situation, and people do not know this is going on.  Some of the hospitals have the old feeder faxes which have a big crease down the middle.  The controlled drugs are not legal because of the way it is written.  The pharmacist is then caught.  The doctor in the hospital wants to discharge a patient as soon as possible and the pharmacist wants to fix them up.  Suddenly it is 7 o'clock in the evening and there is nobody to call about what is written down the crease.  It is so unsafe.  We have done work on tracking errors, but I would imagine that there are many instances where there are problems for six or seven years because of a crease in the paper or because the wrong person answered the phone.  <\/p><p> There is also a huge confidentiality issue when it comes to what doctors, pharmacists, nurses and ward managers have to do with medical records.  There has to be an element of trust, otherwise we would find out nothing.  One has to hope that the person at the end of the phone is the actual patient or is a doctor.  If a malicious person out there wanted to get a person's information they probably could get it.  One might wonder why a person would do that, but it is very possible given how the system is set up at the minute.  Furthermore, the lack of electronic prescribing and the prevalence of this sort of paperwork means that we cannot collate the data.  We are only aware of what goes through the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS.  We do not know anything about what is going on with private prescriptions.  <\/p><p> Dr. O'Brien said that different areas have different requirements.  In my particular area we deal with many patients who require cancer drugs because St. Luke's Hospital is beside us.  There are obviously spikes in the data.  For example, in areas with high addiction rates there will be issues, or if there are particular pockets of illness in an area.  <\/p><p> It was mentioned that GPs are under pressure, and I understand that.  The figure of 40% was mentioned.  Some people say 35% while others say that it depends on the mix of practice.  It is a large amount to be taken from anyone's bottom line.  The headroom was not there in general practice.  People thought it was, but it clearly was not.  It is now a case of getting people in and out as quickly as possible, and that is no way to provide a service.  I have long thought that the GP is the key person in people's lives in the community.  The rest of us assist people from that base.  Without the anchor of a GP and that relationship that people have, things just go unnoticed.  That rapport is only built up through consultation, from people being comforted in their time of need.  The other stuff can be fixed.  It is almost a preventative form of medicine.  <\/p><p> I understand where the witnesses are coming from.  Do they have any views on the outsourcing duties to other professions?  I am talking about nurse prescribers and pharmacists who would deal with things like the contraceptive pill and people who are established on cholesterol medication.  These things are fairly standard, and this approach has been taken in some other countries, such as Canada where there have been pilot schemes where pharmacists deal with hypertension management.  Vaccinations also work exceptionally well in the community pharmacy setting.  We were told at the time that people would be having anaphylactic reactions, and some GP friends of mine asked me how I would cope and suggested that people would be dropping dead.<\/p><p>One in 2 million is the incidence of anaphylaxis to the influenza vaccine.  I am not sure if anyone has dropped dead from it in that setting.  It is very much risk free and pharmacists have embraced it.  At the time, personally, I felt I did not train to inject people and I did not want to do this but we got over it.  Like that, can we not train up other health-care professionals in the delivery of other vaccinations?  I note the pneumococcal vaccine is out now.  Obviously, I am aware vaccinating children is a specialist area and I firmly believe that should be in the GPs' hands.<\/p><p> Also, I see there is a larger role for pharmacists in addiction.  We tend to be the profession that often meets people twice a day and because of the nature of pharmacy businesses, the doors are open.  This was particularly evident to me during the recent snow when those with addiction, probably, a bit like the women who could not travel to the UK, were the ones who were without necessary medication.  A number of us in the Dublin area worked closely together to ensure they were fixed up.  Pharmacists in the role of addiction treatment, obviously with specialist training, would take a bit of heat off the GPs.<\/p><p> The Versatis patch is an issue I do not want to go into at length.  It is the case that these patches have provided many with really good pain relief but when one has a situation where the total spend in Ireland, at &euro;36 million if we did nothing, was the same as the total spend in the UK - Deputy Durkan asked why that is - I genuinely believe the reason is as simple as that this company just had very good representatives on the road.  As a product - they mentioned about non-steroidals in older people with reduced renal function - it was a particularly clean drug.  As a prescriber, one could hop it on and one need not worry about this list because it did not interact with anything.  It has a huge and convenient role.  Also, it left the secondary care setting and arrived in to GPs but those who had to deal with the hassle were the GP and the pharmacist, and the bad news had to be delivered by the GP.  I am aware, from talking to colleagues because I am not working in practice anymore, that the letter arrived in September to the pharmacist to say this was happening.  Normally, people on stable medication would have three to six months prescriptions and with three month prescriptions this fell right at Christmas to stop people's pain relief.  Yet again the doctor had to tell patients they could not have this drug and then the pharmacists in many cases were the ones who were caught in that we knew we were not going to get reimbursed.  There was no way around it.  The way the HSE handled it was bad and the way GPs and pharmacists were allocated the job of delivering the bad news to those with chronic was quite disrespectful to both professions, which do a great deal for nothing much of the time.<\/p><p> Non-government health-care advertising is something I have seen an emergence of.  There is a testosterone advertisement I heard somewhere - I think it was on the radio.  This is something I was only aware of in the United States.  I would be supportive of the proposal to ban this advertising.  I will endeavour to speak to the Minister, Deputy Harris, about this.  The witnesses may be aware I am working on a particular piece of legislation to do with the advertising of fake cures or false remedies for cancer at present.  This, in some way, is linked with it. <\/p><p> On Versatis, the 15 minutes of paperwork was mentioned.  This is also true of the new anticoagulant drugs.  I refer to this idea that pharmacists and doctors would have to spend 15 or 20 minutes, and that is in Dublin with broadband.  I have heard of people in areas with poor broadband who literally cannot get the form done as the system crashes.  When one is a health-care professional, one generally wants to be doing the business of providing health care.  One does not want to be filling in forms and justifying why Mrs. Whoever needs whatever.<\/p><p>I understand there have to be guidelines and parameters but when we have shortages, we cannot have skilled people in the medical field filling in forms.<\/p><p> On the total cost of drugs over the past ten or 15 years, since reference pricing came in, it is worth noting that the high-tech drugs are pushing up the total spend.  There is this idea that Irish drugs are more expensive than anywhere else in the world.  When I qualified, it was about &euro;110 for a box of Lipitor but one can get a box of generic atorvastatin for about a tenner now and that is a blockbuster drug.  Many of those drugs came off patent in recent years.  However, that slack has been picked up by the high-techs.  I feel that is the area we have to really target when it comes to pricing.  We are not going to get the atorvastatin any cheaper and even if it came down to &euro;6, it is not going to make any odds.  It is the box of whatever high-tech drug that costs a couple of thousand euro.  There could be more stringent auditing of these products by the HSE.  Sometimes, when supply is restricted until the prescription arrives there is a gap in care, so there are ways of making it better for patients.  That said, in the case of the new anti-coagulant drugs, although they are increasing the price of prescribed drugs, there is a knock-on benefit in that we are not going to have people attending Warfarin clinics in hospital.  The cost that is being put onto the drugs is coming off outpatients and that has to be recognised.  Consequently, people not going into Warfarin clinics and queuing up with snotty noses, coughs and 'flus means the exposure to disease is reduced.  The hospital car parks and staff are freed up also.  It is not a simple sum - I just wanted to make that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#S00600","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy have actual questions for the witnesses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#V00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Yes, I do.  Do the witnesses have any views on the use of combo drugs like Vimovo that are coming onto the market?  Two molecules are combined by a company to reduce the drug from two to one.  However, the two components are far cheaper individually.  We have seen an emergence of that kind of smartness, as I would consider it, on the part of drug companies, where two off-patent drugs are combined.  For the prescriber, it is sold to some extent as having the patient on one tablet instead of two, leading to better adherence to a regime.  How can we deal with that and the cost of it?<\/p> <p>  Somebody spoke about cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressants.  This is a huge issue and I have seen it in community regarding people with certain means, the mental capacity, and the people within their lives to assist them.  I know one particular girl in her 30s who spent &euro;5,000 on cognitive behavioural therapy over six months.  She did not want to go on antidepressants.  She did not really have the means but she got them and she was fixed up fine.  That is just prohibitively expensive for anybody, however.  In the case of a 15 year old, it is so important that, where possible, we do not medicate young minds unless absolutely necessary.  If there is a cognitive behavioural method available, it should definitely be prioritised for young people.<\/p> <p>  It was said that there were 650 people on trolleys.

Prescribing is such an important and, I can see from the questions, impassioned issue for everybody in Ireland.  I want to put things in the context of initiatives that are going on at present and how we might build on them.  There are some very good and important initiatives in respect of prescribing under way Ireland at the moment.  I will mention two.  On prescribing guidelines, there are two clinical care programmes that I think do pretty good work.<\/p><p>There is no particular conflict of interest in my saying so.  The medicines management programme does good work because it provides guidance on prescribing practice that is based on current evidence.  Deputy Durkan asked what will happen in terms of Brexit.  We have evidence-based prescribing guidance already but we need to build on that through the medicines management programme.<\/p><p> Professor Horgan is better able to talk about antibiotic resistance than I am.  We have a good clinical care programme in the primary and secondary care sector that provides very good evidence on first and second line antibiotic prescribing.  To build on such initiatives, and returning to the reason for my attendance here this morning, there is an e-prescribing issue.  We are falling behind other countries, and European countries in particular, in the aggregation and usage of prescribing data and in how we might continue to improve both the equality and safety of prescribing.  That is what we need to take away from today.  We have a base of good initiatives but we need to develop a national system where access to public data on prescriptions, retained as part of the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, must be more widely available.  I mean anonymised data that researchers or postgraduate training bodies or quality improvement bodies can access and use in realtime for prescribing, reflection, practice, audit and feedback.  We should prioritise the initiative.  <\/p><p> Lastly, there was a question about the high-tech drug versus a generic substitution.  We are going in the right direction in terms of generic substitution.  The preferred drugs initiative, via the medicines management programme, reflects this.  Again, we can do more about that by reducing or enhancing the amount of drugs that we prescribe generically.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#V00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Tom Fahey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I wish to comment on generic substitution.

On his or her next visit the chemist will suggest that another generic substitute is the same as the last one but it has been produced by a different company.  People react to products in different ways.  Not all generic drugs are the same and not all generics drugs are the same as the proprietary drug.  Patients using multiple versions of the same drug is a huge problem and it is very difficult to identify the culprit when they, inevitably, develop an adverse reaction.  Multiple generic substitutions is an issue for patients and GPs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#W00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521622800,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I agree.

Let us say one has a list of generic drugs, and please correct me if I am wrong about the following, a pharmacist can prescribe an equivalent generic if he or she has it in stock.  One must convey such information clearly to the patient.  We must move in that direction because otherwise we will have a very high proprietary prescription rate and a much more costly prescribing environment here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Tom Fahey"},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Fahey for his comments and call Professor Horgan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#W00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521622800,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I shall pick up on the point made about pharmacists operating in a health care setting.  In the States I was trained in the area of infectious diseases where the hospital pharmacist was absolutely essential.  Not only did the hospital pharmacist save about $1.5 million a year in the infectious disease service of a  large university hospital, they contributed to good outcomes for patients.  Pharmacy and medical students are taught safe prescribing at undergraduate level but we should do more with hospital-based pharmacists at postgraduate level.  Such instruction is given for antibiotic stewardship and cancer chemotherapy.<\/p><p>However, it must be expanded above that.  It should be a team-based approach.  That is how we should be educating our trainees.  We recruit very smart people into undergraduate programmes in pharmacy and medicine.  The two groups can work very well together and that should continue.  I can speak for a hospital where most of our trainees, members and fellows are based.  Dr. Mark Murphy and Dr. John O'Brien might wish to comment on that.  More integrated education at postgraduate level is essential.  I frequently ring the pharmacist to ask about adverse drug effects and interactions before I send patients out.<\/p><p> The other thing I find helpful is that I always look at the drugs the patients are on when they come into hospital because I do general medicine.  A lot of the time they do not need to be on all of the drugs.  This is about working with the pharmacist to go through everything, what the patient needs, what interacts with what and what we can stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#W00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Mary Horgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521622800,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I will also start with the role of the pharmacist.  There is a specific paragraph here and I apologise to Deputy O'Connell if I did not quote it.  However, it is here and I have said it at previous meetings.  The first sentence is that the community pharmacist is an essential and extremely valued member of the primary care team.  I talk with multiple pharmacists each day.  They are critical to the delivery of safe and effective care.  As we move forward we need to have a debate about the fragmentation of care.  We have a privatisation and corporatisation agenda in the Irish health care services which has absolutely undermined the ability of our health care system to function effectively.  Our system should have moved to GP-led, community-based care working closely with community pharmacists, but it has not.  We have been moving increasingly away from that.  We need to disentangle that fragmentation.<\/p> <p>  There are enhanced roles of practice-based pharmacists, practice-based nurses, nurse prescribers and enhanced roles for community pharmacists as well.  However, when talking about prevention of cardiovascular disease or addiction services I do not want the services to be further fragmented for patients.  They need to have a system where they are not over-medicalised and made more vulnerable by having multiple sources and avenues of accessing health care.  Consider contraception.  We have to balance that with access.  The Deputy has been a particularly strong advocate on sexual and reproductive health care.  We have to ensure that all patients have accessible care.  I believe that is primarily in the GP setting but not only there, and the Deputy has highlighted a few reasons.  However, we cannot fragment care further.<\/p> <p>  I will make a couple of comments on the issue of advertising.  General practitioners are extremely frustrated with the manipulation and erroneous marketing and advertising on radio and in newspapers by private hospitals and, indirectly, pharmaceutical companies.  They are targeting vulnerable patients and it is an absolute disgrace.  It promotes an over-medicalisation in our society.  We must think long and hard at State level about the harm that is happening because of this agenda.  For GPs it is very upsetting to see the anxiety and frustrations visible in our waiting rooms because of the frightening perception that is created in patients' minds.<\/p> <p>  Combination drugs is a complicated issue.  One is balancing compliance, because it is one medication rather than two, versus cost.  We have to be responsible in the health care system.  We must prescribe cost effectively.  When we spend somewhere we lose out somewhere else.  With regard to high-tech drugs, we spend &euro;700 million on high-tech drugs while we spend approximately &euro;1.4 billion on other pharmaceutical products.  It is astronomical.  It is very upsetting, for example, for a provider of home care packages in the community, one of the most valuable interventions one can make to keep people living at home for longer.  We cannot afford home care packages but we can afford medications at astronomical costs with very limited benefit.<\/p><p>Some drugs have a definite cost-effective balance but others do not.  We can work that out in the medicine management programme, which Professor Michael Barry has specified.  The politicisation of certain drugs has led directly to the reduction of community-based care.  We need to get very honest about that in our society.  We have a responsibility, given that we have one budget in health care, to spend money where we get a bang for our buck.  I will let my colleague, Dr. John O'Brien, talk about formularies and guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521622800,"counter":437,"content":"<p>We do not want to be the dog in the manger.  That is not the issue.  There are issues around fragmentation which need to be taken on board.  The reason a GP needs to lead primary care is not because he or she is such a wonderful thing, but, rather, because the model of general practice is one which provides for integrated care, which is what is proposed in Sl&aacute;intecare.  Integrated care depends on the GP delivering care in a holistic manner, which means that one is looking at all of the contexts of a patient's problems, be they biological, social, psychological or even existential.  The model has to be comprehensive and deal with everything.  A GP may deal with lupus, diabetes, oesophagitis or psychiatry.  The care has to be totally comprehensive.<\/p> <p>  Another important aspect is continuous care.  This is all within the European definition of general practice but I am distilling it down for the committee.  Continuity of care is important because with each consultation another twist in the relationship with the doctor and patient takes place.  All of that iterative building over a period leads to a resource which the patient can draw down during times when they are in difficulties.  It also helps in terms of balance.<\/p> <p>  We discussed multimorbidity, which means that a person has a range of different diseases.  If one is going to introduce into the community specialist nurses in cardiac care, respiratory care, diabetes or whatever else they will all follow the guidelines pertinent to their area of expertise.  Who takes all of that, marries it together and integrates it for a single person?  That is what a GP should be doing.<\/p> <p>  This brings me back to the issue of time.  If GPs are not given enough time to do that, then they cannot do it.  People will go on to waiting lists or into casualty departments where they should not be, which is another cost to the system.  Savings can be made by taking a lot of funds out of general practice, but we lose out on a whole load of other things, including the budget, which is what we are discussing today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. John O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":438,"content":"<p>We are here today because there is an expectation that there is a pill for every ill.

It is a very interesting prescription and learning tool.<\/p> <p>  When I have students with me, I often show them a prescription and ask them which two items they would remove from the list because they are unnecessary.  As professionals, we can be drawn into the idea that there is a pill for every ill and, as a consequence, there can be a prescription with 14 items.  If an elderly patient has a prescription with 14 items the likelihood of compliance is low unless the medication is blister-packed, and there are issues around that.  Perhaps the witnesses might comment on the perception that there is a pill for every ill.<\/p><p>Reference was made in one of the opening statements to low value items having a high cost and how these are screened out in the context of medication reviews.  In regard to general practice, general practitioners and geriatricians are probably the only generalists practising medicine now.  As stated, to get a holistic picture of a patient general practitioners often have to distil down through prescriptions.  I note Professor Fahey is smiling.  I am sure he will have some comments to make on that issue.<\/p><p> In regard to Sl&aacute;intecare, the report is with the Department of Health.  We have not yet had a reaction to it.  It is a radical report in that it proposes so many different changes to our health system, one of which is a transfer from hospital to general practice and community services, which are essential.  It is important that we have a robust primary care service because the rest of the health service is built on sand.  Perhaps the witnesses would like to extrapolate on that issue on the GP contract, which is a 24-7 and 365 day contract and on the concept of the doctor taking on all of the responsibility and paying for everything which is dead in the water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#Y00300","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521622800,"counter":440,"content":"<p>On Deputy Harty's first comment, generally speaking, I hold my clinics, see my patients, do some house calls and I then update my repeat prescriptions.  Usually, I see between ten and 15 people per morning clinic such that the clinic mentioned was a fairly typical one.  On prescription pattern monitoring and audit of usage, this script is not that bad; it is possible to read it.  What the Deputy is doing is trying to surmise the indication for these drugs but the indication is not on this prescription.  Under the current system, the prescription of a drug is not linked to a diagnostic code for indication.  This is something we should have because it enables people, either in the community or the hospital sector, to make more rational decisions about the need for a prescription and to have a meaningful discussion with the patient.  If we had an interoperable system that spoke to the hospital system, we could then make a joint decision or at least identify that a person has been in a hospital and was refused a drug for a particular reason.<\/p> <p>  The system around prescribing needs to be enhanced in the short term.  Education and training in Ireland is reasonably okay, but it can always be improved.  The systems around supporting prescriptions in the community, dispensing pharmacies and hospitals is lagging behind and this should be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Tom Fahey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521622800,"counter":441,"content":"<p>The first thing I do when I see a patient on a ward round is to review their drug list to determine what he or she is on and the reasons for it.

I work in a system here within a hospital where there are no electronic medical records other than discharge summaries and these are not available to everybody.  Some 23 years on, I do not think we are hugely further along.  If we cannot do everything together, why can we not do it piecemeal?

One of the things that worries me is hearing people talk about the worried well.  Since when were the well worried?  I think people do have an expectation of medicine and what it can do for them which is perhaps not exactly what medicine can do.  As part of their relationship and dialogue with their GPs some of this can be thrashed out, although I am back again to the issue of time.  We spoke earlier about issues that arise out of advertising, specifically the advertising of medication but there are even campaigns such as those I have heard on the radio asking listeners whether they could have cancer or heart disease or suggesting colonoscopies.  This can be driven by marketing and advertising, but equally I think there is a national admiration for what medicine can do, and rightly so.  However, perhaps that admiration goes a little too far in terms of what it actually delivers because what it does not say is that medicine can do this but there is a cost.  It is a question of that balance between the benefits that people will accrue from various interventions and the cost to them of all that.  Going back again to the business, we were talking about the advertising of medications on the television and radio - on the radio anyway.  I was away recently and listened to CNN for two hours, and in that two hours there were separate advertisements for 12 different medications and one for colonoscopies.  I do not know that that is a wonderful place for us to be going; I think we need to back away.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, when people get to the back end of their lives, very often they are on a great deal of medication and have had a great deal of intervention.  Whether further intervention, or even the medications they are already taking, is appropriate for their care and what their care will be at the end of their lives are questions that need to be planned with them.  They need to have those kinds of discussions with their GPs and that is not happening because of lack of time.  The net effect is that people who really should not be in emergency departments are ending up there.  This is inappropriate care and goes back to a wider exposition of the Chairman's comments on a pill for every ill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#AA00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. John O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I have just one question.

I appreciate the witnesses may have to follow up with us on this, and that would be fine, but could they offer us a view as to whether, in their experience, there are people for whom GPs may prescribe medication but who do not have the means to fill that prescription and who may find themselves at the doors of accident and emergency departments or elsewhere because they are not getting the treatment they need, even though they may have been prescribed it?

Further to this, we learned at some stage on that committee of the huge expense of long-acting reversible contraception - for example, Mirena.  People put it off because of the price.  It is allowed under the drug payment scheme, but there is the insertion and so on.

It is estimated that 400,000 people in Ireland suffer from loneliness, and more than 9 million people in the UK, where it costs the NHS &euro;35 billion.  That is an incredible amount of money.  It is linked with an increase in mortality rates and dementia, and is considered to be as bad for a person as obesity or smoking 15 cigarettes a day.<\/p> <p>  There is a taboo around loneliness and a shame around admitting that one is lonely.

In an evidence-based consultation, a doctor uses his or her own clinical experience.  He or she also considers the evidence available about the drug, which will often have limited benefit but which is beneficial nonetheless.  There may be side effects of the drug.  The decision is shared with the patient and their preferences are considered.  That takes time.  For a patient who is on 14 different drugs, considering the fact that all of those drugs are dynamic and that at any one time they are not definite or absolute forever, a medication review every six months takes a significant amount of time.  If one wants to take the prescription of medication seriously, apart from the capital infrastructure to make prescribing between interfaces safe, that time needs to be resourced.  This is particularly true in the last five to ten years of a person's life.  If a person is over 80 or 90 years of age the evidence base for those medications is limited, particularly for primary preventative purposes, and we need to fund that time to have those long conversations with patients.  I believe we would reap dividends in terms of a reduction in health care spending.<\/p> <p>  On Sl&aacute;intecare, the Irish College of General Practitioners really wants to commend the Chair and every Deputy and Senator here on their hard work in advocating for a long-term vision for a fairer and better health care system that is more community orientated.  We absolutely support the initiative taken.  We really are getting frustrated that the Department of the Taoiseach and other high offices have not taken this on to implement it.  <\/p> <p>  On Social Justice Ireland and the working poor, it is those persons who are above the means threshold for a medical card, who have to pay to see the GP and who perhaps must pay &euro;149 every month for their medications.  It is extremely unfair, and it is a definite phenomenon that those patients are not compliant in returning to us or with taking their medications because of cost.  Some of those patients end up with catastrophic out-of-pocket payments, which is simply wrong and immoral.  It is a difficult issue, and I believe that Sl&aacute;intecare is seeking to address it.<\/p> <p>  On the question of loneliness, I agree entirely with Senator Swanick.  There are issues in the health care system about which we have to be honest.  We cannot do anything about some of the issues.  Much of the life expectancy improvement that has taken place over the last 50 years is not due to the medical profession but because of advances in other areas of the civic environment, such as education and social protection.  A community health care system is very important and is useful for the prevention of loneliness.  Having a day in a community hospital, accessing a GP, a public health nurse and a home care package are some of the benefits.  However, we have to get real and not over-medicalise this.  This is an issue of a fragmentation of our communities and a change in culture.  It is a wider civic societal issue as well.  GPs have a pivotal role in identifying loneliness but in terms of social prescribing and other phenomena to try to help loneliness, it is a major issue and I believe we should not over-medicalise it.  It is a very important issue to raise.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#BB00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the witness is very busy, but he might take the time to make a submission to the Loneliness Taskforce at <i>www.lonelinesstaskforce.com<\/i>.

This brings me back to the business of holistic care.  In the main, depression does not fall out of the sky.  Generally speaking, people are depressed for reasons which are immediately clear.  This is not be true in all cases, but it is true in many.  Certainly, the social circumstances of the individual will have an impact on his or her psychological state.  As to how that all plays out, two particular pressure areas in general practice are emerging.  The first is deprived urban areas where the resources are just not there and the second is rural practice.  Rural practices are shutting because they are not economically viable and large swathes of the countryside are without GPs.  Patients use GPs in a manner which is not just about the ordinary taxonomy of diseases we were all taught in medical school.  There is a lot more that transacts within a general practice than that.  This part of what Senator Swanick refers to - loneliness.  The loss of those critical services within communities is where all that stems from.  The Chairman was involved in the \"No Doctor, No Village\" campaign.  It is the critical end of things.  The people who get the raw deal out of all of this every time with health are poor people.  They have twice the problems of the rest of the community but  they get the same level of allocation.  That means they get half the service.  I find that hard to stand over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. John O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":449,"content":"<p>During the Sl&aacute;intecare report process, all members of the committee became expert in the inverse care law and Tudor Hart and could lecture on it by the time our deliberations had concluded.

There may or may  not be a basis for that but certainly there is a delay in people receiving chronic care for conditions such as osteoarthritis and hip and knee replacements.  I am very impressed with the prescription the professor has brought along because the patient is not on a sleeping pill or benzodiazepine.  That is probably an exception to the rule because there is an increasing demand for benzodiazepines which we, as a profession, are trying to resist.  Many years ago, GPs were accused of under-prescribing for depression.  The accusation now, perhaps, is that we are overprescribing.

Each of those drug classes is a separate issue which needs to be looked at separately.  We have to stand over safe, high-quality prescribing.  Are there cases when certain drugs should not have been prescribed?  There is no doubt.  There are human errors, complex phenomena and there may be certain doctors who might overprescribe a certain drug.  That might be the case.  It is true in every health care system.  As training bodies and health care professionals, we all want to do our best and need a robust postgraduate education infrastructure which facilitates colleagues to have the very best evidence base and understanding of cost-effectiveness.  We also need to provide them with time so that they can share those decisions with patients.<\/p><p> Some of the drug classes are more problematic than others.  The case has been made for anti-depressants, which it is very appropriate to prescribe in very challenging psychological and social circumstances for patients without psychological services.  Benzodiazepines are sedative medications.  While raw prescribing shows that is going up, the extent to which people are prescribed a benzodiazepine for over eight weeks, which is known as chronic benzodiazepine prescribing, has decreased in the past 15 years.  I have not started a patient on a benzodiazepine for more than eight weeks in five years.  While I prescribe benzodiazepines once every few weeks, it is a short course and it relates to a variety of phenomena, for example, severe, acute bereavement.  I give one tablet for back spasm where there is extreme pain.  That is not wrong or inappropriate.  Prescribing for more than eight weeks, however, is largely a legacy issue.  Some patients are addicted and have been on the drug for more than 15 years.  The ICGP works with colleagues in the RCPI and the HSE on guidelines to manage benzodiazepines and opiates.  We will continue to work with these guidelines.  It is a challenge to tell an 82 year old who has been on a benzodiazepine to try to come off it.  It is a challenging issue.  While we can probably do better, we have to be mindful of the personal and unique circumstances of patients.  We will continue to promote the highest quality and standards going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#CC00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Tom Fahey of the Royal College of Surgeons, Professor Mary Horgan of the Royal College of Physicians and Dr. Mark Murphy and Dr. John O'Brien from the Irish College of General Practitioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018032100002#DD00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1521622800,"counter":453,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 11.20 a.m. until 9 a.m. on Wednesday, 28 March 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality","time":1521622800,"counter":454},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Joint Committee met at 09:00<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy Colm Brophy, Senator Frances Black, Deputy Jack Chambers, Senator Martin Conway, Deputy Clare Daly, Senator Niall \u00d3 Donnghaile.

I must apologise at the outset as the version of the statement that we sent initially contained some typographical errors.  Another version was supplied to the clerk late last night.  We will blame the holiday weekend.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman has invited us today to discuss four topics.  I thank him for the opportunity to make these opening remarks.  It may be helpful if I touch on each topic briefly.  The first topic is issues surrounding ICT, specifically the Garda internal audit service audit report 2017 in respect of ICT payment processes.  The position on this item is that the Policing Authority does not receive the Garda internal audit reports on a routine basis.  They are mandated, undertaken and overseen by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na audit committee, the members of which we do appoint.  We are aware of media reports about this particular audit but it is appropriate to allow the audit committee to do its job first, before we get involved.  We will shortly be receiving the annual report of the Garda audit committee.  We will be meeting the chair of that committee and will have an opportunity to raise any matters arising from the annual report.<\/p> <p>  The second item was the report from the chief administrative officer in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding the history of email usage in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the mechanisms for protecting security.  I understand that the Garda has supplied the committee with a copy of the relevant report and I believe the committee heard evidence on this point recently from Garda senior management, which broadly corresponds with the information supplied to the authority.  The main point I want to make this morning is that the roll-out of a new enterprise content management system is under way.  It is an important step as it enables the secure, remote access of files from mobile devices and negates the need to send files via email.  The sooner that is completed, the better.  We would also like to see the key commitments the Garda has made to us being met, namely, to have in place a policy on Internet and email usage.  <\/p> <p>  The third item is progress since the committee's report in respect of Garda oversight and accountability of December 2016 to which the Chairman referred.  By way of the update requested, I thought the most useful thing I could do would be to circulate two important documents the authority has prepared and published recently.  One is the authority's statutory report on its effectiveness and the adequacy of its functions at the end of two years.  Committee members had several questions on this matter when I last appeared before them.  The second document is the authority's submission to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Between them, these two reports address and set out the authority's position on many of the key matters discussed in the committee's report on oversight and accountability.  For example, we call for the removal of duplication and ambiguity as to who does what in Garda oversight and accountability.  We call for steps to be taken to ensure that there is a single pair of eyes on Garda performance, either by including security in the remit of a future policing authority or by having authority members included on a security oversight body.  We call for much greater transparency by the Garda, including the extension of the Freedom of Information Acts to a broader range of Garda functions.  We call for a future policing authority to have significant oversight competence in respect of the use of resources, both people and money.  We also raise concerns about training and formation, culture and integrity.<\/p> <p>  The fourth item, which the Chairman has also mentioned, is the review of domestic homicides.  As I said at the authority's most recent meeting in public in February, in many ways this has been the most frustrating and most troubling piece of work in which the authority has engaged.  We began to examine the matter in March of last year.  We are still not finished and we are still not fully satisfied.  From the outset, the authority has made it clear that its key concern is the risk that wrong classification could have affected the quality of Garda investigations.<\/p><p>We have emphasised time and again the importance of good data for intelligence, public policy, risk assessment and crime prevention.  This is not confined to domestic violence risks.  <\/p><p> Related to that, the Policing Authority is concerned not to prematurely or unnecessarily alarm families.  For that reason, and for reasons of practicality, much of the authority&rsquo;s detailed work on this matter has been carried out outside of public fora through our committee structure or between officials.  Before the most recent meeting in public about the homicide review, we pressed the Garda for assurances that in the 12 cases where it was reclassifying a death upwards into or within the homicide category, family liaison had been put in place and families had been contacted.<\/p><p> The authority&rsquo;s approach to assessing any significant aspect of Garda performance is to gather data and information from a broad range of sources.  We then compare and critically examine the information, and use it to inform ourselves and develop our oversight approach to a particular matter.  With the Garda, we persist in private and public until we are satisfied or report to the Minister for Justice and Equality. <\/p><p> Our approach to the homicide data was no different.  For example in addition to the Garda, authority officials engaged with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  We had the benefit of Garda Inspectorate reports and a report from a Department of Justice and Equality working group on the crime counting rules.  Since late March 2017, we had intelligence in addition to the official Garda documentation.  Since then, there have been at least 20 formal authority meetings on the topic in plenary or committee and as many or more engagements at official level. <\/p><p> Several documents received from the Garda were rejected as inadequate, beginning with the correspondence we received for our meeting in public on 27 April 2017 where those watching would have been left in no doubt that the authority was not best pleased.  Certainly, the media reports the following day got the drift.  The paperwork which we received did not merit the title of report and I believe I made that very clear publicly.  <\/p><p> Professional tensions within the Garda organisation regarding this matter were very clearly visible to us at the April 2017 public meeting, after which we had four key concerns.  Despite assurances, was there an article 2 compliant investigation in each case?  Were there arrangements in place to speak to families?  Had the PULSE records been updated with sufficient information to mitigate risks to potential victims?  Had the Garda analysis service been fully involved and signed off on the work?<\/p><p> I wish to address the concerns regarding the role of the Policing Authority and the witnesses, Ms Galligan and Ms West, from the analysis service.  I am taking it, based on the committee&rsquo;s discussion in public session and related comments, that Ms West and Ms Galligan have given their permission for certain matters relating to their contact with the authority to be discussed with the committee.  I believe the chief executive raised this matter yesterday with the clerk to the committee.  <\/p><p> At the outset, I would like to say that their evidence about how they were treated in their workplace sounded deplorable and is very concerning.  It speaks to issues of culture and speaking out, matters which the authority raises continually.  Differing perspectives and professional tensions are healthy and are to be expected, and ought to be welcomed.  Although it is an employment matter, their experiences seem in this instance to have made the whole review more contentious than it needed to be.<\/p><p> Returning to the homicide review, the position is that the authority has many sources of intelligence and information regarding the review - perhaps more than Ms West and Ms Galligan realised - and has done a huge amount of work.  The concerns which they brought to the authority&rsquo;s attention were already well known to us before their contact.  At a point where the analysts seemed to be having difficulty getting access to certain information, authority members and staff were being offered opportunities to review investigation files, which we declined, and be briefed in detail on cases. <\/p><p> In fact, having reviewed their evidence to the committee, I can honestly say that there was very little of substance in it about the review which we did not know or have grounds to believe since late March or early April of last year.  Far from being misled, the authority rejected the document submitted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to our 27 April 2017 meeting in very strong terms.<\/p><p>In addition to expressing serious disappointment at the late arrival of correspondence at 8.30 p.m. the night before, we wrote to the Commissioner to express significant concerns about its tone, content and accuracy.  This was also covered by the media subsequently.  <\/p><p> The analyst's professional concerns were widely known, and the fact they were in contact with the authority could not have been considered by the authority to be confidential.  For example, the analysts indicated it was a member of senior Garda management who provided the personal contact details of the authority staff member who was first telephoned in April 2017.  In the interests of transparency, it was Garda management which gave us a copy of the letter of 11 May, addressed to several people in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This letter sent out the concerns it had and its disquiet about them.  The analysts were advised by authority staff that we had the letter dated 11 May.  They were given an assurance that the authority was live to all of their concerns and that those concerns would be followed up.  They were followed up.  That letter further underlined the professional tensions around this whole matter which were already very visible to the authority.  <\/p><p> The names and the facts and details which caused the analysts' disquiet was a matter of record and in no way confidential.  However, the context of their direct communication with the authority subsequently was recognised as sometimes sensitive, and it was treated as confidential.  The analysts specifically declined to allow later correspondence to be shared with Garda management, and that was fully honoured.  <\/p><p> In terms of where are we now, the committee is aware that the Policing Authority received a report dated 21 September.  This report differed so much from the April correspondence that initially we did not accept it either.  Following robust engagement over the period from October to January, we have very recently reached a position where we accept that a police investigation did take place in each of the 41 cases which are the subject of this review.  It is important that I say this for the information of the community.  However, we have not yet been reassured about the quality of those investigations.  At an authority committee meeting on 3 November 2017, we pressed for and secured agreement from the Garda for a peer review of the investigations in a number of cases.  The Garda gave evidence to the committee recently about its approach to this work.<\/p><p> On the question of classification, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has re-classified 12 of the 41 cases upwards, either into homicide or between classifications within the homicide group.  We understand now how those positions were reached.  From our work, we would say that some change was made to the classification of a further 16 cases, meaning that only 13 are unchanged.  Authority staff have personally confirmed that the PULSE system has been appropriately updated in these cases, which is really important from the point of view of risks to any potential victims.  The Garda have given us assurances that in those 12 re-classified cases, the families had been contacted before we discussed the matter in public.  That was very important to us. <\/p><p> Another concern related to the role of the analysis service.  We have been assured, as has this committee at its recent hearings, that the analysis service signed off on the report given to the authority in September and that it will be fully involved in the next phase.  The authority intends to meet the working group charged with the next phase, which I understand includes Ms Galligan and Ms West, to ensure that it fully understands our concerns.  It is important to us that this working group is managed in a way which allows all voices to be respectfully heard and considered.  It is also important to us that it proceeds with some pace and reaches conclusions which we can interrogate.  Furthermore. we will require interim reports.  In the meantime, the homicide review remains a standing item on our agenda, and given the timelines outlined for the next phase it will clearly be there for some time to come.  <\/p><p> The authority takes its statutory responsibility to oversee Garda performance very seriously.  Our work is broad-ranging and complex.  I hope I have provided a flavour of the approach we have adopted.  It uses external performance indicators where they exist, and intelligence or information from a broad range of other sources in addition to that we receive from the Garda.  Crime classification, PULSE, data quality and performance management are by now enduring themes for us and the 2018 policing plan contains some important actions in this regard.<\/p><p>At all times the authority is mindful that it must strike a careful balance between challenging An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and undermining it, and between transparency and concern for victims and families. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018032100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Feehily.

In fact, a senior person recently said to me that they are now realising that when we ask for something, we do not go away.  We were asking for material.

That is the reason we have procedures in place that mean all our engagements are on the record.  They take place through the liaison office and they are transparent.

We receive significant material very late all the time.<\/p> <p>  We also have major concerns over data quality.  Again, that sounds technical but it is not.  Homicide data comprise a really good example.  Issues have arisen regarding breath-test and homicide data.  There is a casual attitude to data and recording data on PULSE.  The committee will probably be discussing with the Chief Inspector from the Garda Inspectorate his recent report on child sexual abuse.  One will find data quality issues at play in that regard.  We have had issues over what was or was not on PULSE in the Jobstown review we got.<\/p> <p>  We have decided this year that no matter what policing topic we are discussing, we will examine it through the lenses of data quality, governance, supervision and ethics because the issue is just pervasive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018032100002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1521622800,"counter":495,"content":"<p>It was really disappointing to hear Ms Feehily having to say that, after the whole process associated with the homicide review, involving the three reports and an 18-month period, the Policing Authority is still receiving the same types of treatment and reporting from what is at this point nearly the third reincarnation of Garda management, that it is still being handed material at 6 p.m. the evening before a public meeting, and that it is still unhappy with the data.

I must also apologise as I must leave to go to the Chamber soon.<\/p> <p>  I wish first to deal with the Policing Authority's oversight of ICT within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In her opening statement, Ms Feehily stated that she does not receive Garda audit service reports on a routine basis but that she is aware of media reports on this particular audit.  This audit concerned ICT payments and processes in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I raised this during Leaders' Questions in January.  I will not go over the whole thing again but to give an idea of the figures involved, ICT costs in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2016 were &euro;49.9 million, of which &euro;26.6 million went to Accenture, based on a contract dated August 2009 which the audit found breached public procurement guidelines.  <\/p> <p>  I have been looking at the Policing Authority's most recent quarterly report to the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, in December 2017 on progress by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in implementing the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate report, particularly on ICT which has a full chapter.  On external ICT contractors, the Policing Authority's report states that \"It is clear that the financial burden of supporting external contractors is high\" and that \"contractors have a strong financial incentive to remain\".<\/p> <p>  These statements by the authority seem to indicate that it is aware that there is a high price connected with external contractors.  Did the authority ask for the details of the expenditure associated with external IT contractors?  The phrase \"financial burden\" in particular seems to indicate that the authority is aware that there is a high spend in the area of external contractors.  The authority states that it is aware of media reports about the audit.  I am asking if how ICT functions in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is news to the Policing Authority.  The authority seems at least to be aware of a high spend on contractors.  Was the Policing Authority aware of any of the public procurement breaches by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2016 appropriation accounts list 94 breaches totalling &euro;27.8 million and it lists security ICT as one of the main areas.  That information is available to everyone online.  Will Ms Feehily answer those questions first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018032100002#S00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521622800,"counter":500,"content":"<p>We were aware of the appropriation account information, and, in fact, we followed that discussion closely.  Something the Deputy will have seen in our various reports that I mentioned, including the two year report and the submission to the commission, is that we have asked for the removal of duplication and for the removal of ambiguity.  Our role in relation to the resources of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is very circumscribed and very narrow.  From the outset, we have tried to get ourselves more closely involved with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform so that we become part of that resourcing discussion.  When we cannot do it that way, we come at the issue a different way and we do it from a performance perspective.  We also come at it from the point of view of our determination to increase the proportion of civilians in the Garda.<\/p> <p>  Part of our concern about the spend on ICT would have been that we think some of it could have been done by skilled professionals hired directly by the Garda, probably for less money.  That partly is what would have been behind the comment in the quarterly report to the Minister.  Also, it is the case that for private sector bodies, the bottom line is repeat business.  That is what they do.  We were extremely concerned.  We have not been able to get good benefits realisation statements from the Garda about what it was actually getting for this spend in detailed form.  That is what is behind our concerns.  We come at it through whatever areas we have power, which is civilianisation and the implementation of the modernisation plan, and ask what it is getting for the money, rather than our oversight of the money.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the public procurement breaches, we took the view when the Comptroller and Auditor General audited, which is as high as one can get in auditing terms, and of which the Committee of Public Accounts had oversight, that it had its own oversight machine and we had enough to get on with.<\/p><p>When the chair of the audit committee comes before us in a couple of months' time with its annual report, we will ask how the committee assures itself.

We have received the same assurances that the committee received.

We did not accept that at the time at face value; we followed it up in public.  It is important to make the point that there are technical solutions that law enforcement agencies and other agencies charged with matters that are confidential must deal with all of the time.  They have a responsibility to ensure they use those technical solutions such that it is not necessary to use commercial providers.  It is in this regard I referenced the enterprise content management in my remarks.  It is really important that the Garda remove the need for the use of external providers.  Often Garda officers on the ground do not have the most sophisticated technology and consequently, in trying to do their jobs, they may inadvertently use a commercial provider, which is not a good idea.  We are keen to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rolls out the technology that makes it possible for Garda business to be done in a secure way at all times.

I do not know how one would describe professional expertise in terms of data analysis, on the one hand, and rank structure, on the other, as being two factions.  They are different skill sets.

She referred to the most useful thing she could do for the two women.  Does she not accept that the issues that were being raised were not for the two individuals?

I was trying to convey that a body that oversees an organisation must be very careful not to get involved with one side of an argument.

That is their employment matter.  My issue about conflict is entirely different.  We have no business being involved in the employment matter.  My issue about conflict is that we are a regulator, an overseer.  In order to be able to do our jobs properly, we have to have good order about how we engage with the body we oversee.  We have established that order through the liaison office.  We operate on the basis of transparency in all our engagements with the Garda.  From that point of view, when we were asked by a person if they could come to a meeting with the authority, we had no trouble with it.  The specific response was that we had no difficulty with their attendance but that it was a matter for the Garda as to who attended.  The difficulty for an oversight body in terms of conflicts is that if we become involved in resolving a professional conflict, then we ourselves become conflicted.  I am talking about a professional conflict rather than an employment matter.  We try to provide structures, we are transparent in our engagement and we invite the Commissioner to meetings.  We also insist that people who attend are authorised to commit the organisation.

The answer was that the authority had no difficulty with their attendance but that it was a matter for the Garda as to who was to attend.  We are examining that engagement now through the lens of something that happened a couple of weeks ago.  At the end of the day, the most important thing is that the homicide review proceeds. All of the authority's work has been to insist that the analysis service was fully involved and that it signed off on the material that came to us, and that happened.  However, our capacity to engage must be open.  We oversee the entire organisation, which includes the analysis service as well as the sworn side, and we have to take a view on its performance also.

I must apologise because I will have to depart for another engagement as soon as I finish my questions.  First, I wish to deal with the initial public presentation of the homicide report, or document, as Ms Feehily has referred to it, in April.  It is fair to say that it was an extraordinary episode when taken in the context of everything we have learnt since.  This document was heavily criticised by Ms Feehily and the Policing Authority.  It was stated by Dr. Gurchand Singh that although he did not raise it at that meeting, he had serious concerns and was not satisfied with it, and clearly Ms West and Ms Galligan were not at all happy with it.  It appears that only the senior garda&iacute; who presented the document at the meeting were satisfied with it.<\/p> <p>  One of the key issues with the document was not only its content but the process that took place before it was presented to the Policing Authority and the fact that Ms Galligan, Ms West and the Garda analysis service were not consulted, despite being significantly involved in the audit and Ms Galligan and Ms West being the primary analysts.  The analysts were not involved in the report that was presented.  Does Ms Feehily agree that it was unusual and remarkable and that if a comparable report were to have been prepared by the drugs section and presented to the Policing Authority, those involved would have been consulted?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018032100002#MM00400","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1521622800,"counter":728,"content":"<p>It was very clear to us that the entire analysis service had not been consulted and we dealt with it at that level.

We have a problem here sometimes with drafting.  I understand Deputy Troy's intent but the effect of what he has set down is not the same as what he intended.  We often hear complaints that drink-driving cases take too long to go to court.  According to the wording of the amendment, Deputy Troy wishes to move these cases from trial in front of a judge in a District Court to trial by jury in a higher court.  This would further delay the process.  That is what it would mean if we were to change the reference in the legislation from summary offences to, as suggested in the amendment, trial on indictment.  I am sure what is proposed is unintentional but it would further delay what is already a very lengthy process.  If there were a trial on indictment in every case, it would involve a jury having to be called and the case going to the Circuit Court.  There might be up to 1,800 people and a very long process.  I do not believe the Deputy meant for every case to go to trial on indictment but that is the effect of the amendment.<\/p> <p>  If the amendment were accepted, people in the lowest range of alcohol while driving - 50 mg for standard drivers and 20 mg for specified drivers such as learners or novices - would have to go to trial by jury, with a possible penalty of up to &euro;10,000 and-or two years in prison.  I am slightly at a loss.  I have been subject to much criticism about this Bill being disproportionate.  This amendment is disproportionate as well.  It would be an extraordinary move to bring every case of prosecution for alcohol while driving straight to the Circuit Court and before a jury.  I do not believe it could possibly be the intention to go straight to the Circuit Court.<\/p> <p>  The proposed amendment will unbalance the legislation on intoxicated driving.  Deputy Troy is proposing to make this change to section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, which deals with intoxicated driving.  The Deputy might not have noticed that section 5 of that Act, which deals with intoxicants and being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle, parallels section 4 in structure and in offences.  By proposing to amend one and not the other, he is doubling one set of penalties and leaving the other untouched.  This seems to be a disproportionate response.  The Deputy probably meant, and would like, to make these equalised in one way or the other but he has not done so.<\/p> <p>  There is a general difficulty here.  I see it in several of the amendments that have been ruled out of order.  Members of the Opposition have difficulties in drafting amendments.  The fact is that they have certain intentions - whether they be the best or worst of intentions and with which we may or may not agree - but the meaning of the amendments when they are drafted and tabled is not exactly what they intended.  That raises the question of whether parties in the opposition have enough expertise at hand to draft complicated amendments to traffic legislation which is, by definition, extraordinarily complicated and difficult.  I am not being obstructive here but this happened with the last Bill we dealt with and the Clancy amendment.  We had a very well meaning amendment, the sentiments of which I agreed with and accepted, but when it came to it being implemented, it was drafted in a way which made that difficult.  I will remedy that on Report Stage of this Bill.  However, I will raise this question at Government level.  Members of the Opposition do not necessarily have the facilities to draft legislation in the way it should be drafted and whereby it means what they intend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#B00700","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":954,"content":"<p>The Minister is right.  I have highlighted my intention on every occasion we have discussed this legislation.  The Minister is correct that the Opposition is somewhat hamstrung due to the lack of resources.  The Minister originally mooted this Bill over 14 months ago and, even with the support of a full Department and its officials, it has still taken him this long to bring it to Committee Stage.  He can appreciate the frustration on this side of the House in terms of the lack of resources available to us.  We put forward amendments to try to improve legislation, which is why there are Committee and Report Stages.  If the Minister believes in the intention of an amendment, he has the wherewithal in the Department, while not accepting the amendment on Committee Stage, to work with me or any other Deputy who the Minister believes is making a worthwhile suggestion to try to address the anomalies that may have arisen and accept it on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  This amendment relates to the fact that I believe the Minister is tackling the wrong element of this Bill.  We are going on the figures for fatal collisions that were produced in the period 2008 to 2012 by the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  We have no updated figures despite the fact that I have requested updated figures on numerous occasions from the Department of Justice and Equality and the fact that we know there have been 1 million fake breath tests.  The figures we are working on, from the report for the period 2008 to 2012, indicate that 38 of the fatal collisions involved alcohol as a factor, correlating to 39% of the fatalities.  Half of that 39% of fatalities involved blood alcohol levels in excess of 200 mg, four times the legal limit.  The Minister has done nothing about that.  He has decided to pick the low-hanging fruit in terms of putting people who might be marginally over the limit off the road.  We are not changing the limits here.  We are changing the penalty.  In the context of my proposed amendment, I am of the view that we should introduce much stricter penalties for people who are two, three and four times above the legal limit.  In the period to which I refer, people who were four times the legal limit contributed to half of the fatalities and the Minister has chosen to ignore that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#B00800","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":955,"content":"<p>I noted the Minister's comments on drafting.

We want to get this legislation through and there have been efforts to filibuster it, as members might be aware.  I am trying to keep the momentum going on the legislation as it is.

That is the motivation behind it.  The delay is only due to what I believe is serious legal scrutiny, and the last thing I want after this legislation is passed, hopefully, is to have this clause being challenged or getting into the same state as happened with the Opposition's amendment, which was that it was impossible to implement and legally unsound.<\/p> <p>  The options for me are to go ahead or delay this Bill now in favour of having one legislative measure.

First, I take serious issue with the Minister's comment that there was filibustering on this issue in the D&aacute;il.  It is a false accusation.  The Minister is like a dog with a bone.  Before Christmas 2015 there was a spike in the number of road fatalities and without due investigation and a proper examination, he jumped straightaway to increase fines for those found to be above the lower drink limits.  The committee engaged in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill nearly 12 months ago.  I remind it that the former Chairman, now a Minister of State at the Minister's Department, produced a report which was inconclusive on whether this amendment to the Road Traffic Act was necessary.  Also in support of my argument, in the Minister's deliberations 12 months ago he stated the reason he was introducing the increased penalties was the system was being abused.  At the same time, however, when I tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister for Justice and Equality on the issue of repeat offenders, no figures were available in respect of this section which we are being asked to amend to increase the penalties.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Robert Troy is correct when he says the Minister is trying to pick the fruit from the lower branches of the tree and that he is not assessing the entire issue.  What has the Minister been doing about the flaws in existing road traffic legislation dating back to the 1960s?  We saw a programme - it might have been a \"Prime Time\" programme - which showed that people caught driving while excessively over the limit had been able to walk out of the court because of flaws in the Road Traffic Act.  What are we doing about this?  Why are we not bundling that legislation?  Nothing is being done about it.  I refer to some of my colleagues who asked questions about this issue in the D&aacute;il.  At the end of the day, we have to acknowledge that in 2015 there was an upturn in the economy, but there was a smaller Garda presence.  I bet that tomorrow morning, because of the extra Garda presence, the existing legislation would be shown to be working perfectly.  I refer to a well known traffic expert referring to other legislation.  He asked why we needed more legislation when we could just enforce existing legislation.  That is the kernel of the point being made.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has become like a dog with a bone on this issue.  We must not forget the impact this legislation will have on rural Ireland.  The Minister can come here with gimmicks such as tax incentives, rural transport initiatives and measures to increase the provision of taxis - he has also talked about insurance - but no one from any organisation is coming forward to say the Bill will work and that it is a solution.  The Minister is going down the wrong track.  There is no need for this legislation.  We have already discussed the issue and are wasting more time here.  The Minister has to be fair; take his beating on this one and focus on other major issues in the transport network which need to be resolved.  Where was his reaction when there were two fatalities before Christmas at dangerous junctions on national primary roads?  There was no sign of him.  Even with regard to the number of cyclist fatalities----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#D01300","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":989,"content":"<p>I am reluctant to interrupt the Deputy, particularly as he is the Vice Chairman, but the problem we have is that we have to deal with the actual amendments before us.

It costs more lives at higher levels than it costs at lower levels.  It still costs lives at lower levels and people should be disqualified at the lower levels.  This is the fundamental disagreement we have.  I want to disqualify these drivers with the lower levels of alcohol and the Deputies do not.  That is the members' view and the fundamental disagreement about the Bill.  Presumably this is why the Deputies are refusing to support the Bill and this is their right as democratically elected representatives.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to statistics.  We do sometimes quote 2008 to 2012 figures.  They are very powerful statistics, especially the 38% figure we quoted a legendary number of times, but that figure is probably worse now that it was.  We have quoted an enormous number of detailed figures in the D&aacute;il and I will give some of them to the committee if it wants me to.  During 2013 to 2018 a total of 381 road users died in road traffic accidents in the State.  The 2013 to 2014 coroners' data captures 269 of these fatalities with 82 of these fatalities, or 30.5%, having alcohol present as a factor in the accident.  Eight of the fatalities were in the 21 mg to 50 mg range.  Six of the fatalities were in the 51 mg to 80 mg range.  Four of the fatalities were in the 81 mg to 100 mg range.  I put it to Deputy Troy that I do not like quoting these figures in that particularly inhuman way.  I do not regard human beings as figures.  We keep coming out with figures but every time we quote a figure in this regard we are speaking of a dead person.  To save one life is enough, if we are sure of it, for legislation.  We want to save that life.  That is what we are about here.<\/p> <p>  The Deputies want to continually quote figures and they say we should be doing this, that or the other.  I believe the Deputies should stop talking about figures and start talking about human beings.  If we can show that one or two people will be saved by this legislation then it is good and it is enough.  In time we will address every other issue also.  Of the 82 fatalities where alcohol was a factor, 44% of the cases also had one or more drugs present; in 63% of these cases it was the driver, in 17% of the cases it was pedestrians and in 11% it was the passengers.  The 38% figure from the pre-crash 2008 to 2012 study refers to fatal collisions; the 30% cited above refers to fatalities.  I do not need any more convincing than that to know that this is a major and difficult problem, and that drink impairs driving and causes death.<\/p> <p>  I can quote statistics until the cows come home.

The Minister is right but he is wrong in some of his assertions.  We helped and ensured the passage of the Bill on Second Stage to allow it to move on to Committee Stage.  I am concerned and worried based on the length of time it has taken the Minister to bring in this one piece of legislation.  In his contribution a few moments ago the Minister seemed to believe he was the most reforming Minister on road safety, but this is the only Bill that he has initiated that he will bring to the end.  The Road Traffic Bill dealing with drug driving was left by the Minister's predecessor and the current Minister has brought it through the D&aacute;il, to be enacted, after eight months.  It has taken the Minister 14 months to bring this legislation to this stage.  I am concerned that if the Minister is to address road traffic fatalities on a piecemeal basis and it takes 14 months at every stage, then it would have made more sense to address the causes of fatalities at the higher end than at the lower end.  This is a simple point.<\/p><p>It is not contradictory for me to believe that the Minister's proposal is disproportionate.  A much more proportionate sanction would be five penalty points and a &euro;500 fine.  Figures were give to the committee and to the D&aacute;il by the Minister during deliberations in the committee last year.  The Minister has never answered a question to me directly about the 2016 last full set of figures the Minister made available to members during Committee Stage.  Of the 8,100 motoring offences for drink driving, 93% of the people convicted were found to be in excess of 80 mg.  This means that 93% of people who were convicted were subject to automatic disqualification and 7% were in the lower category of the penalty points system and a fixed fine.  If automatic disqualification was the deterrent the Minister says it is, then one would expect it to have been a reverse of those figures.  With regard to the regulatory impact analysis of the road traffic (fixed penalty - drink driving) Bill 2017, presented to committee members on 30 January 2017, one of the things considered by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was an increase in the fixed penalty amount.  The regulatory impact analysis states:<\/p><blockquote>An increase in the fixed penalty amount was also considered, but given that this would impact on the timelines for implementing this change (significant IT administration changes in both An Post and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) coupled with the fact that the real deterrent is the disqualification and not the monetary amount, it was considered not necessary to increase the fixed penalty amounts at this time. <\/blockquote> <p>This says that the Minister's and the Department's considerations are the increased cost and the timeline for implementation of change, along with significant changes to IT systems.  It is not just I who have considered this measure; the Minister's own Department has also considered it.  Some of the reasons it was ruled out of order were the increase in &quot;the timelines for implementing this change&quot; and the IT administrative changes that would be needed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#F02000","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":1031,"content":"<p>I propose that Deputies Murphy and O'Keefe come in next, and the Minister may reply after those contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#F02100","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":1032,"content":"<p>It is important to say that the Bill is very patchy on the issue of enforcement and this lets the legislation down.  The expectation of being caught is a very sizeable deterrent.  As I said at the previous meeting, the issues around fake breath tests and so on have done no service to this area and there is a need to come back from that.<\/p><p>Like other members of the committee, I have been lobbied on this legislation but not by the large drinks companies.  It was very much local lobbying on issues such as employment in the area and the impact of the legislation in that regard.  It was targeted.  People and businesses are entitled to make those points, but let us not ignore the fact that that is a backdrop to what has happened.  We have all experienced it.  <\/p><p> We have to make a decision in the public interest.  The committee met the Road Safety Authority to discuss the issue.  The statistics it provided were not dry.  They were derived from inquests into fatal road accidents.  I came here with an open mind.  It is a big deal to put a person off the road, even if for only three months because it can be life-changing in terms of work and being able to get insurance into the future.  In its responses to the committee the Road Safety Authority was very convincing.  We need to focus on the evidence.  I was particularly concerned about the morning after a conviction.  Several people who had contacted me said they were very concerned about this being an impediment.  As I have said previously, I tend to think it has more to do with home drinking than drinking in pubs and so on, but that would probably require some analysis.  According to the Road Safety Authority, 14% of all alcohol related fatal crashes occur between 6 a.m. and noon and that 15% of all alcohol related fatal crashes involving a driver or motor cyclist occur between 6 a.m. and noon.  This is an issue about which I had a particular concern, but the evidence must be acknowledged.<\/p><p> Getting legislation of this type over the line is never easy.  I can remember a time when there were no drink driving limits.  There is a supermarket in my area, which was previously the Hitchin Post.  People used to drive there and back, but this behaviour was modified by the introduction of drink driving limits.  Reducing the limits helped to save lives.  If we find evidence that will further enhance road safety and saves lives, there is an obligation on us to legislate in that regard, regardless of how unpopular it makes us.  I am supporting this legislation because the evidence supports it.  The public attitude surveys show that people support it and that support is greater in rural than in urban areas, which is remarkable when one considers the impact it will have on people's social lives, the level of rural isolation and so on, which is better understood in rural areas because it is a lived life.<\/p><p> I am not satisfied with the enforcement provisions and believe there is a piece of work yet to be done in that regard, but this change will be beneficial.  While it will impact on a small number of people only, if it is to have a positive impact, it will need to be enforced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#F02200","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>Nobody wants to see lives lost.  The Minister will probably try to ban contact sports in situations where people end up paralysed owing to freak accidents.  The Road Safety Authority, RSA, has become loaded.  Has the committee heard submissions from the Irish Road Haulage Association or similar organisations?<\/p> <p>  It has to be acknowledged that following on from the provision of additional resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it has become more competent in enforcing road traffic legislation.  As I said, if existing legislation was enforced better, we would have better results.  In sport, a player is issued with a yellow card and then a red card.  If what is provided for in this legislation comes into force, people's lives will be ruined.  Under current legislation, they are given a second chance, but under this legislation, despite having committed only a minute offence, they will be banned from driving.  By way of example, a girl interviewed in the public survey mentioned how she had consumed a moderate amount of alcohol on a night out but because of her physique when she was stopped on the roadside the following morning and tested she was over the limit.  However, by the time she had reached the Garda station and been retested, she was okay and got away with a fine.  She said she had learned her lesson.  There are many people who will find themselves in a similar position.  We need to give people a chance and not destroy their lives.  <\/p> <p>  We should also not seek to destroy the lives of people living in rural areas.  Mental health is a big issue in the context of this legislation, particularly for those living in isolated areas.  I do not like going on and on like a broken record, but I would like to give an example to show how this legislation will impact on such individuals.  A general practitioner told me that when he and his wife were out walking, they would often have been passed along the way by a person they knew driving to the local pub and that since the introduction of the drink driving limits, he no longer went to the pub and that when they passed his house, they would see piles of cans and so on stacking up at the side.  When one is drinking in a pub, one is doing so in a controlled environment.  People who live in isolated areas were doing so, but now they are drinking at home with no control over the level of alcohol they are consuming.  This may be good in the context of road safety, but it will lead to a lack of engagement with neighbours and others and isolation.  What about these lives?  The impact of this legislation on the lives of such individuals will be huge.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to crashes in which alcohol was a factor.  Does he have data for the roadworthiness of the vehicles involved or the condition of the roads?  When a person is found to be over the limit, is the condition of a vehicle also taken into account in the even of an accident?  In other words, are the brakes and tyres examined?  All of these things come into play when an accident occurs, but they are being pushed aside for the Minister's gain in having this legislation enacted quickly.  He needs to take on board the points we are making.  On the surveys he mentioned which were carried out by the RSA, what questions were put to those surveyed and when were they put to them?  If I were to ask people in my area tomorrow morning if they were happy with the drink driving laws, they might say yes.<\/p><p>What way were questions put to people?  Are they in favour of drink-driving?  No one is in favour of drunk-driving.  As for where Deputy Troy is coming from, those who go beyond the one or two drinks maybe need to be penalised more to teach them a lesson.

It takes lives in many ways.  It definitely takes lives on the roads but it also takes lives through illness.  It makes a misery of other people's lives and all we have to do is go down the main street of our towns on the weekends to see what is happening, or go into the emergency departments of hospitals.  I have spoken many times about the need to deal with this huge cultural issue in our society.  I welcome the Bill that is before the Houses about the alcohol issue.  Surprisingly, I have not been lobbied that strongly about this Bill.  I cannot remember any significant lobbying on the Bill.  I believe that when one tackles any problem, one goes to where the biggest gain is possible.  When we look at statistics, we know where the big gains are, such as people far exceeding speed limits, not the person who, at 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. at night, goes through some country village at 60 km\/h.  They are not the big killers.  Those of us who are perennially on the road see them.<\/p> <p>  Let us talk about enforcement.  Since 2011, I have travelled something like 500,000 km of road in Ireland in my car.  I think I was breathalysed three times.  I assure the House that each of the three times was, of course, random.  I was breathalysed about two months ago, one evening, after having driven from Tipperary to Dublin, on a very quiet suburban street.  There was no problem.  I guarantee that I had no alcohol on board.  It was the easiest thing to take a deep breath.  That was three times over 500,000 km.  I drive on main roads, on byroads and on rural roads.  The first thing we have to face up to is that all one is creating is a mega-lottery.  Without consistent enforcement, all of this is a waste of time.  It will just be a matter of luck whether one is caught or not.  I would say that if one checked out the number of actual, real checkpoints that have taken place, one would find that, because it is so random in my case as to where I am, what time it is, day and night, and so on, it is fairly representative for anybody else.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has done nothing to ensure that students or workers from Galway, for example, can get bus services after 6 p.m. on many of the radial routes out of the city to areas 30 km or 40 km away from the city.  The Minister has done very little about rural transport and rural transport options.  I always believe that if one wants to reduce occurrences of an incident, one makes it much easier for people to avoid it.  Every one of us has been at too many funerals over the years of people who have been killed in alcohol-related accidents.  One of the great successes between 1997 and 2011 was the dramatic decrease in road fatalities.  Legislation was brought in during that time, most of which I spent at Cabinet and I supported that legislation.  Much of it related to both speeding and the issue of alcohol in blood.  There is no question that we went from being a country with a very high level of fatalities and reduced it.  Other factors were involved, since we increased enforcement, and also better roads.  There is not a need here, in my view, for a moral lecture.  The problem here is twofold.  If I am reading the right statistics, drivers with more than 251 mg comprised 39 fatalities, those with more than 201 mg comprised 37 fatalities, those with 151 mg to 200 mg comprised 25 fatalities and those with 101 mg to 150 mg comprised 20 fatalities.<\/p><p>Qualitatively, given the funerals we attend and the tragedies that happen, any of us could have said that this is where the major problem is.  How does one stop that major carnage?  Compared with that, the figure is seven for drivers between 51 and 80 mg per millilitre.  I agree that if the Minister was going to reduce that figure to zero it would be significant.  However, it would not be half as significant as reducing the figure of 39 to ten for the 251 mg per millilitre or from 39 to 30, if the Minister is saying that every life counts.<\/p><p> Why do I have a problem with the Minister's proposal?  There are two reasons.  Incidentally, I wish to make it clear that I have no support for the argument for going to the pub, having three or four pints and then toddling home.  I accept that on many rural roads, for older people, statistically the risk is small because there is just no traffic.  On many a night that I drive 30 miles home from meetings, and I assure the Minister I would not be drinking, I do not meet another car on the road.  I might meet one or two but on certain stretches of road I would not meet any car on most nights.  However, I am not justifying that or making a case for that.  The Minister is saying that if people have a few drinks on a night out and if they drive to work and are between 50 and 80 mg per millilitre he will disqualify them from driving.  One of the problems is that most people will not know that they are between 50 and 80 mg per millilitre.  We know that, statistically, the body mass of women is less than that of men so they are more likely to get caught having consumed the same amount of alcohol.  Heavier people and so forth have a better chance.  Then there are metabolism issues and the like.  I have a problem with the lottery element of this and the proportionality of the penalty, not the principle.<\/p><p> The Minister seems to think that there is no penalty that has any measure of deterrent in it other than being put off the road.  However, if that were true the horrendous statistics at the high end would be long gone as a thing of the past due to the deterrent of the penalty.  It is also a disproportionate penalty, as I said in the D&aacute;il previously, for rural people versus urban people.  In this city and in Galway city we are told there is, effectively, a bus service within 500 m. of everybody's house.  Where I live there is one bus service eight miles away that goes to Galway in the morning and returns in the evening.  There is no way of getting children to school or of getting to work.  The penalty of getting disqualified in a rural area, therefore, is totally disproportionate in terms of the cost to the person, his or her livelihood and the daily things the person must do.  One of things we must do with law is try to make it proportionately equal for everybody.<\/p><p> Deputy Troy has tried to propose two things to deal with the 39, 37 and 25 figures, that is, the areas where we are getting the big numbers.  Yes, it is probably badly drafted.  However, what one does in that situation on Committee Stage is say, \"That is a great idea.  I will come back to it on Report Stage.\"  Deputy Troy is taking out the big figures, but for some reason the Minister is not running with something that would deal with those figures.  He is wedded to the exact formulation.  We agree with the principle of stiffer penalties, but the Minister will not even look at the formulation of his proposal in respect of the very small figure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#H01200","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>In fairness, the Minister has said he is more than happy to work to increase penalties in other areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#J00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>He said he would not accept it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#J00300","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>Everybody has the right to speak here for as long as he or she wishes so I am not interrupting in that respect.

I wish to explain exactly what my personal concerns are, and they are not the concerns of any lobby group.  They are about the lottery effect.<\/p> <p>  I will explain the Fianna F&aacute;il proposal.  If somebody is prone to not obeying the rules of the road, is careless about speed and various other matters and if there is reasonable enforcement, there is a high chance that the person will have over seven penalty points.  When one adds five points to that there is a total of 12 and the person will get six months off the road.<\/p> <p>  If the person is persistently careless, unless the person is very lucky and there is no enforcement, under our proposal that person with seven or more penalty points will end up with twice the length of disqualification.  We are trying to protect somebody who in good faith did not realise that they had between 51 and 80 mg per millilitre.  As I said, it depends on so many variables.  One could have 49 mg per millilitre and one will be fine but if one has 51 one is in trouble.  At the low end of that, such as 52 mg per millilitre, one does not realise it.  One does not realise, because of how one's metabolism works, that one is still over the limit.  Somebody who has never had other driving issues, who has always adhered to speed limits, driven with care and thought he or she was all right could suddenly end up in a situation where he or she cannot do the essentials for which one needs a car in most parts of the country, such as bringing children here and there and getting to work.  If I live and work in the city and I am on one of the bus routes I can get the bus.  To be unable to drive in rural Ireland is a massive cost.  In some cases people would have to pay a driver for three months.  That is the problem. <\/p> <p>  As I said, the person who is careless will have the seven penalty points anyway so that person will be off the road.  I am talking about the person with the unblemished record who drove in good faith and did not realise.<\/p><p>If someone goes into a pub and knocks back three or four pints, he or she knows that a risk is being taken and that he or she will be put off the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#J00900","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":1057,"content":"<p>That person deserves to be put off the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#K00200","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>I am not making a case for such persons.

I will support him in anything he does to tackle what we all know is the real problem - the carnage on the roads caused by people who are driving, despite having been disqualified after consuming enormous amounts of alcohol.  Many complain about speeding offences on the grounds that someone who toddles along at 5 km\/h or 7 km\/h over the speed limit - I accept that it is against the law - receive three penalty points when someone else who is 20 km\/h or 30 km\/h over the limit receive exactly the same number of penalty points.

I thank him for his reasoned and eloquent explanation of the views he and many people in rural Ireland hold.  His comments were representative of the views of other's.  I am not saying he is pleading for it, but we cannot make a different law for rural Ireland than for urban Ireland.  I do not see that as a possibility or probability, nor would it be right to do so.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy was correct to refer to the carnage on the roads.  Carnage is one, two or three deaths.  What is important in the Bill, apart from its detail which is critical, is that it sends the message that we are serious about tackling drink driving.  While the Bill, rightly, affects the 50-80 mg group that is its target, the message must also go out that we will not tolerate drink driving.  People take disqualification more seriously than penalty points because it has a more dramatic effect on their lives.  Consequently, it will deter them.  It is a heavy price to pay, but it is not the price paid people who are killed.  That is why it is worth paying.<\/p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Catherine Murphy's point, all of the evidence from rural Ireland is subjective, whereas we are discussing independent evidence provided by the Road Safety Authority and, as far as I know, in the survey conducted by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes.  The evidence is that people living in rural Ireland want such measures.  The evidence is clear that more lives are lost in rural Ireland than in urban Ireland as a result of drink driving.  There is sometimes an extraordinary mismatch between the advocates for rural Ireland and the cold statistics provided by such surveys which are scientific.  I am not sure what is happening, as I do not believe people living in rural Ireland are up in arms on this issue.  Being disqualified affects people badly, but there are more people in rural Ireland who have been bereaved and support the introduction of such a Bill.  We, in this House, may have created something of a false divide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#K00400","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":1060,"content":"<p>I will interrupt the Minister.

Perhaps that is the reason the number of fatalities is lower in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#K02300","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>It could be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#K02400","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":1080,"content":"<p>Unless it-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#K02500","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":1081,"content":"<p>I concede the point made about enforcement.  There is a road safety meeting every two months involving the principal stakeholders, namely, the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Attorney General, various other Ministers, the RSA and all other such stakeholders.<\/p><p>At every single meeting, the Garda representatives are being put under pressure to say what is happening with the traffic corps and enforcement.  We are acutely aware of it.  It has turned that corner.  Obviously, one can say there are 150 in the last two years, which is 10% per year by the end of this year.  They have to be trained as well and the Deputy will raise that, as is quite right.  It is improving and it has got to improve.  They are going to be under pressure to enforce this law more strictly.  It is a fair point.  It was bad but we are not unaware of it and are certainly doing something about it.  It is a question I ask every single time, as does the RSA and others.  The Department of Justice and Equality is there as is the Garda.  It is not restricted to public statements in the D&aacute;il but is also regarded as very important behind closed doors.  Figures are going to be released on a very regular basis.<\/p><p> I hope that the message is getting out.  Deputies may say the measure is small and we should be tackling a lot of other things; that is what Deputy O'Keeffe says.  However, I disagree with Deputy O'Keeffe about the RSA.  It has been producing some very strong advertising.  This, together with the debate to which all Deputies present have contributed, is sending a message out to people to be more careful on the roads and that road safety is their responsibility.  There are indications over the years that the general trend is improving.  There is greater consciousness.  There have been some very moving advertisements on television with the victims' groups very bravely coming forward and telling their own stories.  I am not claiming credit myself for them.  I think that has had an effect.  We just marginally got the lowest figures ever last year for deaths on the roads.  That is not a cause of satisfaction at all.  I think it was 160, which is appalling and totally unacceptable.  However, there is a message going out that road safety has moved up the agenda and that people have a responsibility.  The Bill is part of that message and I hope it is going to continue with further legislation on other issues.  It will continue as long as I am here.  I will introduce more legislation this year on road safety.  We are deadly serious about it.<\/p><p> I am very sorry if I gave the Deputy a moral lecture.  I did not mean to do that.  That is not the objective.  It is a kind of moral issue but it was not meant to be a moral lecture at all.  Far be it from me to give anyone a moral lecture about anything.  It does seem to me to be a no-brainer that if a measure of this sort saves lives, we should pursue it.  It is not a moral issue but a matter of trying to see that more families are not bereaved.  I will submit to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and come second to him on morality.  I am happy to do that.<\/p><p> Deputy Munster raised the issue of the traffic corps and the 10%.  I think I have answered that.  Yes, it is happening by the end of this quarter, which is now.  That should be completed and there should be 150 new members, which I think is actually over the 10%.  There is a bit of a time lag on it.  Enforcement is absolutely vital, the Deputy is quite right.  The introduction of the measures in some way acts as an impetus and incentive for the Garda to enforce.  They realise that as well.  There is an onus on the Government to produce the garda&iacute; to enforce the measures we are introducing.  I do not think we should hold back because enforcement was inadequate.  I do not think it is now.  I actually think this acts as some sort of pressure on other Departments to do what is necessary in terms of enforcement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#K02600","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":1083,"content":"<p>From the outset we said we were very supportive of this legislation because it is about saving lives.

That will be well over 10% per annum.  The Deputy questions introducing this legislation without having the enforcement there.  Enforcement has been increasing during the passage of this legislation even though the legislation is not even on the Statute Books yet.  The increase in the traffic corps, happily, will coincide almost exactly with the passage of this legislation.  That may be a coincidence, but I think it will take the sting out of the criticism the Deputy is rightly making.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Keeffe raised enforcement as well.  He referred to this as a minute offence.  I suppose that is where I disagree with him more fundamentally.  I regard it as a serious offence, not a minute offence.  I think it would be absolutely wrong and I take issue with the Deputy when he talks so casually about the one or two drinks.  That kind of statement encourages people to think that having two drinks is acceptable.  That leads to a culture of acceptance of drinking and driving.  I do not accept the jargon we use about a yellow card.  There are no yellow cards in drinking and driving; it is a red card situation and that is it as far as I am concerned.  It is impairment.  One drink impairs driving and two drinks impair it more.  It is that kind of casual talk that leads to a culture of people getting into their cars and saying it will be alright when it will not be.  I fundamentally disagree with the Deputy and I do not think we are going to agree about this.  Deputy O'Keeffe has always taken that point of view and that is perfectly legitimate.<\/p> <p>  The other thing Deputy O'Keeffe regularly addresses here is the fact that there are lots of other problems.  There are; he is right.  He refers to bad brakes, bad roads and bad road conditions.  There are problems there as well.  However, that does not mean we should not address this one.  It may mean we should be more progressive and energetic in respect of other problems as well.  That does not mean this one should not be addressed, however.  It is a diversionary argument.<\/p> <p>  I was interested in what Deputy Catherine Murphy said about not being lobbied, particularly by the vintners.<\/p><p>If I were in the Vintners Federation of Ireland, I would not lobby the Deputy either.  I would give up.  On the point the Deputy made about small lobbyists and small businesses, the measure does cause inconvenience and difficulties.  There are certainly small off-licences complaining about it also.  There has been pressure exerted in this regard but what we are doing is right as far as I am concerned.  This measure is correct and we have to pay a bit of a price for introducing it.  There will be a cost and perhaps it will cost some people dearly in the context of their livelihoods.  I do not want to do that at all but sometimes one has to pay a price in order to save lives and for the greater good.

Therefore, one cannot really make a distinction.  Alcohol impairs a driver's judgment and ability to drive.  Drivers feel they are okay but they are not; they are impaired.  The level is too high and they are still impaired by the alcohol in their system.  International evidence shows that alcohol, even at low levels, has an impact on driving ability.  The WHO warns that the risks from alcohol begin at very low levels.  The risk posed by being over the limit is caused by the alcohol and it makes no difference to that risk how long it is since the person consumed the alcohol.  People who drank very heavily the night before must take responsibility for their own behaviour.  If they have any doubts, they should not drive.  It is a cardinal rule that one should not get in the car if one has any doubts at all.  One cannot necessarily self-test so the rule is, \"Do not do it.\"  It is easy enough.<\/p> <p>  I agree on public attitudes in rural areas.  I have addressed that already.  I refer to the Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes polls in rural areas that the RSA quoted.  The results were very powerful and indicated support for this measure, presumably because people in those areas are so conscious that it saves lives.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the very small number of people affected.  It is probably true but I do not like addressing the subject in that way.  While the number is small, it is a very big message.  A very strong message is coming out from here that drinking and driving do not mix in any way.  What we want to do through the disqualification is fight the impression that it is acceptable to drive after one, two or three drinks; it is not.  We want to make people think twice about drinking and driving.<\/p> <p>  People can quote statistics and say that there are only so many affected.  However, saying \"only so many\" is just not acceptable.  It may be one life, two lives or three lives.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Robert Troy said that this is the only Bill I have taken through the Oireachtas.  That is wrong.  He mentioned five penalty points.  We have been through that before.  On his point that 93% of convictions are associated with the higher category and 7% with the lower, I am of the view that the 7% matters.  We would not dispute that 93% of those convicted are in the higher category and that 7% are in the lower category.  Those in the 7% category have the potential to cost lives and have done so in the past.  This is the category we are addressing.  We believe the penalty is appropriate.  It is not right to suggest that the proportion is only 7%.  I understand the Deputy's point in respect of  addressing the higher limit further but those exceeding it are being disqualified and taken off the road.  That is an appropriate punishment for them.  There is a good case for punishing them further, and I am happy to discuss that with the Deputy.  To be consistent, it might be more helpful if the Deputy withdrew his opposition to this Bill and accepted the disqualification we are introducing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018032100002#M00600","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1521624600,"counter":1093,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I do not minimise the loss of one life at all.  The point I was making is that, based on the figures supplied by the RSA and the Department, the greatest number of fatalities relate to the higher category.  It is currently illegal to exceed 50 mg per 100 ml and that is not going to change.  The point I was making on number of people caught in 2016 and subjected to automatic disqualification is that if automatic disqualification were such a deterrent, there would be more people in the lesser category.  This is not the case, however.  Unfortunately, automatic disqualification is not the great deterrent the Minister believes it to be because the greatest number of offenders have blood alcohol levels in the higher category.  If we were really serious about taking impaired drivers off the road, we would do so through enforcement.  I have said that all along.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's statement that there will be 150 additional garda&iacute; in the traffic corps this year but he should forgive us if we are somewhat sceptical.  He said last year that there would be an additional 10% in 2017 but this did not happen.  According to the figures I obtained through a parliamentary question on 16 January last, the number decreased from 669 to 643 between 2016 and 2017.  Forgive me if I am somewhat sceptical about promises made at committee meetings, particularly as previous promises were not honoured.  Even if the 150 come on board, how many of the existing traffic corps members will retire?  The number decreased from 669 to 643 last year.  Was that through natural wastage owing to retirements?  Will there be a similar reduction before there is an increase this year?  This must be figured out.<\/p> <p>  The Minister should not suggest that some lobby group has come to me.  I did not meet the Vintners Federation of Ireland.  I refused to meet it.  I am not here as a voice for the vintners at all; what I want to see is proportionality.  Based on that, I was advocating an increase in penalty points for what is already illegal, namely, having a blood alcohol level between 50 mg per 100 ml and 80 mg per 100 ml.  I want to see a stiffer penalty introduced for people in the higher echelon.  There is already automatic disqualification for those in the higher echelon.  It is simply not deterring them.
