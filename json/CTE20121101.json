Are these minutes agreed to?  Agreed.  The minutes of 25 and 31 October will be taken at our next meeting.<\/p><p>  Deputy Harris had indicated that he wished to raise the issue of Irish Aid and we had that down as No. 2 on the agenda, but we will wait and see if Deputy Harris attends and we can take it at that point. <\/p><p>  No. 3 is correspondence received since 25 October.  No. 3A is correspondence from Accounting Officers.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence dated 12 October 2012 from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, that was deferred from our meeting on 25 October 2012.  It is a minute from a previous report and we will take that at another date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  No. 3A.2 is correspondence from 5 October from Mr. Ray Mitchell, parliamentary and regulatory affairs division, forwarding a note regarding the deal on the cost of drugs with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association.  This is to be noted and we will incorporate this note in our upcoming report on the HSE, which is being completed.<\/p><p>  No. 3A.3 is correspondence dated 25 October 2012, from Mr. Tom O'Mahony, Secretary General, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is linked to correspondence under No. 3A.7 re providing information previously requested by the committee regarding CIE and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  This is to be noted and published.  There is a separate letter relating to the oversight of the spend from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Taking the two together, I think the committee could have a useful session with the National Transport Authority whose accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and who has received independent audits of the public service obligations payments made to CIE.  We can table that for a future date, perhaps as early as possible now that we have the information.<\/p><p>  No. 3A.4 is correspondence dated 26 October 2012 from Mr. John Moran, Secretary General, Department of Finance, re providing information previously requested by the committee regarding taxpayers' money given to AIB for the purposes of mortgage write-downs.  This is to be noted and published.<\/p><p>  No. 3A.5 is correspondence dated 26 October 2012 from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, re providing information requested by the committee at its meeting of 18 October 2012.  This is to be noted and taken into consideration in the context of our upcoming report on the review of public sector allowances.<\/p><p>  No. 3A.6 is correspondence dated 30 October 2012 from Mr. Tom Boland, chief executive, Higher Education Authority<i>, <\/i>re providing information requested by the committee at its meeting of 4 October 2012.  This is to be noted and published.<\/p><p>  No. 3A.7 is correspondence dated 31 October 2012 from Mr. Andy Harkness, secretary and director of audit, Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, re providing information previously requested by the committee regarding CIE.  This is to be noted and published.<\/p><p>  No. 3C is individual correspondence.  No. 3C.1 is correspondence dated 26 October 2012 from Mr. John Curry re County Wexford Vocational Education Committee, to be noted.  This is an individual grievance issue, although it also shows up how the Department mishandled the issue and did not issue a reply to this individual's concerns for three years.  The resolution of this is not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts, however, so we will ask that the Department and County Wexford VEC deal fully and openly with this individual's complaint and correspond with us concerning the response they issue.<\/p><p>  No. 3D concerns documents relating to the committee meeting of 1 November 2012.  No. 3D.1 is correspondence dated 17 October 2012 from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na forwarding details regarding payment of allowances in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to be noted.  No. 3D.2 is correspondence dated 24 October 2012 from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na forwarding details regarding payment of allowances in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to be noted.  No. 3D.3 is correspondence received 31 October 2012 from Mr. Martin Callinan, Commissioner, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, re opening statement, to be noted and published.

No. 4.1 is Leopardstown Park Hospital, annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011.  No. 4.2 concerns the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's annual report for 2011.<\/p><p>  No. 5 is our work programme which is now on screen.  It takes account of the schedule of meetings on the payments of public sector allowances in 2011 and also includes meetings scheduled up to 20 December 2012.  The meeting arranged with the HSE on Tuesday, 6 November will have to be rescheduled due to an issue with the availability of Oireachtas committee rooms.  The HSE representatives are available on Thursday, 8 November but only in the afternoon.  I propose, therefore, that we schedule the meeting for 2 p.m. on Thursday, 8 November.  Would members consider that to be an appropriate time?  The HSE representatives are not available on Tuesday or on Thursday morning so we have suggested to them to meet at 2 p.m. on Thursday, 8 November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110100003#B00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351778400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>There was a problem with the room here because we do not have first call on it on Tuesday.

I look forward to discussing any aspect of the Vote with the committee.  I have previously supplied briefing material to the committee in response to several queries it has raised and on which it wished to have information.<\/p><p>  The strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 December 2010 was 14,377, all ranks.  The strength of the force on 31 December 2011 was 13,894, a reduction of 483 members.  The strength of the force on 26 October 2012 was 13,476 sworn members, inclusive of all ranks.  We are three members fewer today.  In total since 31 December 2010, 901 garda&iacute; of all ranks have retired or left the organisation.  On 31 December 2011, there were 2,074 full-time equivalent civilian staff employed in an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a ratio of civilian to sworn members of 1:7.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains committed to attaining a lower ratio.  However, this is influenced by the current public sector recruitment moratorium.  It must also be borne in mind that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na performs security, intelligence and immigration functions that are not performed by many of our comparator police organisations.  These additional mandates have an impact on the garda-civilian ratio.  The number of full-time equivalent civilian staff employed in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 26 October 2012 was 2,031.<\/p><p>  This year to date has been challenging and demanding yet An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had much success operationally and organisationally with decreases in many categories of crime, reductions once again in road fatalities and many successes against dissident republicans intent on causing injury in either this jurisdiction or in Northern Ireland.  The efficient use of resources has been highlighted in the annual Garda policing plan 2012.  One of its objectives is to promote efficiencies and effectiveness in resource allocation and deployment so as to enhance the policing service we provide to members of the public.  However, I am conscious of the need to make the best use of State resources made available to me.  With this in mind, I have initiated constructive dialogue with our criminal justice sector partners such as the Courts Service, the Prison Service and the Department of Justice and Equality that will generate further efficiencies in the years to come.<\/p><p>  The 2012 budget for the Garda Vote amounts to &euro;1.325 billion, 8% less than the 2011 budget of &euro;1.439 billion which was also reduced from the 2010 figure.  The rapid decline in the public finances in recent years requires us all to do more with less.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not immune from the effects of the downturn in public finances and we continue to play our part in our nation's economic recovery.  The public and other stakeholders expect as efficient and productive an organisation as possible.  Indeed, the significant achievement already made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in delivering organisational reform is widely recognised.  For example, there has been the piloting of a new roster, the first in almost 40 years in the force, and the new performance and accountability system which is due for full roll out in 2013.<\/p><p>  In conjunction with these achievements, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has a significant organisational development and change programme in operation encompassing my commitments towards the Croke Park agreement, the integrated reform delivery plan and the GRACE, Garda response to a changing environment, programme.  This programme has 39 projects either completed or in progress in areas such as a new service delivery model, district and station rationalisation, workforce realignment and an examination of specialisation in the organisation among others.<\/p><p>  Up to 90% of the Garda Vote is expended on wages, salaries and allowances.  Several allowances were first introduced by the then Government in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Allowances Order 1924 and 1926.  These allowances recognised the unique nature of the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and were awarded in many instances in lieu of basic pay rises over the years.  This uniqueness was subsequently recognised by both the Conroy commission in 1970 and the Ryan committee of inquiry in 1979.  The Conroy commission recognised the significant impact these allowances had on the morale of the organisation.  The debate around allowances has particular resonance in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na similar to other public service organisations and, indeed, has implications for the Croke Park agreement.<\/p><p>  The conciliation and arbitration process is one of the negotiating mechanisms which exists for the purpose of enabling the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the one hand, and the Garda representative associations on the other, to provide for the determination and validity of claims including pay and allowances.<\/p> <p> A further purpose of the conciliation and arbitration process is to secure the agreement and fullest co-operation between the State, as employer, and the members, as employees, for the better discharge of the functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Indeed, it is a mechanism which has served the State well in that it has ensured the preservation of industrial harmony, while at the same time maintaining confidence and effectiveness in the Garda industrial relations machinery.<\/p><p> For over four decades this mechanism has been utilised by both sides in the initial granting of and subsequent increase in these allowances and expenses for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the case of civilian employees, the trade unions that represent civilians in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to engage and work to ensure their members work efficiently in the organisation.<\/p><p> When the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, published the outcome of the review of public service allowances and premium pay on 18 September 2012 following consideration by Government, one allowance, similar to that in other public sector bodies, namely delegates allowance, was deemed no longer justified.<\/p><p> In addition, the Minister announced that arising from the review a number of changes will be made to the public service allowance regime which included certain allowances for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These included classes of allowances proposed to be abolished for new beneficiaries and allowances which were subject to review and-or modification.  In addition, it identified classes of allowances proposed to be approved for new beneficiaries.  A total of eight allowances were identified within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for priority elimination.<\/p><p> Following this central Government decision, I have instructed, as part of the revised action plan 2012 for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, that the consultation process will now begin with the Garda staff associations with the objective of establishing a mechanism whereby these priority allowances to existing beneficiaries will be eliminated.

The association represents 2,007 members of sergeant and inspector ranks.<\/p><p>  AGSI welcomes the opportunity to address the committee today and hopes the issues surrounding allowances in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which may be raised by the committee can be discussed and explained by this association.<\/p><p>  AGSI is anxious to dispel the myths surrounding the payment of allowances to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including ambiguity surrounding the amounts of payments made, taxation liability, the numbers to which the payments refer and the widespread belief that all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na get all allowances.<\/p><p>  The Croke Park agreement is working.  It has saved approximately &euro;1.5 billion in costs to date.  As the committee will be aware, it guarantees no further wage cuts in return for industrial peace and a far-reaching aggressive agenda for change across the public sector.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has progressively pursued these changes.  Moreover our members have delivered what was required to date and this has been publicly acknowledged by Garda Commissioners, Mr. P. J. Fitzpatrick, chair of the Garda implementation body, and the Ministers, Deputies Howlin and Shatter.<\/p><p>  I would like to remind the committee that we were subject to a wage cut, universal social charge, increased PRSI, increased insurance levies and a pension-related levy, all of which resulted in a reduction of over 20% in pay for our members.  Coupled with this, a 6% increase granted under Towards 2016 was withdrawn and, of course, will not be paid now.<\/p><p>  One significant change under the Croke Park agreement to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na comes in the form of working patterns of members.  Since changes have come into effect, officers now work a ten-hour day with a more relevant supply-demand ratio.  The resulting availability of more members on the streets has been commented on by the public.<\/p><p>  The Central Statistics Office, in a 2011 report, cites figures which show that public sector pay has fallen since 2008, while private sector pay has increased, and the computations exclude the public sector pension levy.  In addition, working time has increased across the public sector by an average of 5%, while in most private sector employment it has decreased.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na members still work on average a 40 hour week.  Employee numbers have reduced by 10% since 2008 with further reductions to come.  In An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the numbers are expected to be at a maximum of 13,000 by the end of 2013.  That is a significant reduction from current figures of approximately 13,350 and well down on our peak numbers a short couple of years ago.<\/p><p>  Considering pay across the public sector, 60% of employees earn under &euro;55,000, with 25% earning less than &euro;35,000.  More reductions in pay through allowance reduction or elimination, at a time when costs are rising in utilities, bank charges and mortgage rates, merely constrict further the spending ability of, and increase financial pressures on, moderate income earners.<\/p><p>  Allowances form a significant part of the core pay in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This was borne out in two Government commissions - under Judge Conroy and Professor Louden Ryan - two Government benchmarking reports and the conciliation and arbitration scheme for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It should be remembered that despite reports of huge increases under benchmarking, members of the AGSI were awarded a 5% increase while senior civil and public servants were awarded 16% increases.<\/p><p>  The report on remuneration and pay in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, known as the Conroy report, was presented to the Minister for Justice in January 1970.  The Minister's commission, under Judge Conroy, was established in September 1968 to \"examine, report and make recommendations on the remuneration and conditions of service\" in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In chapter two of that report, Judge Conroy makes reference to the type of person burdened with being a policeman, and the benefits to Government of his role, at page five, when he states that a Garda's powers and duties are with him whether he is in or out of uniform and whether on or off duty, and he is responsible for any error of judgment in exercising these powers and is answerable for any such error.<\/p><p>  Some 43 years later, this remains the case.  Members of sergeant and inspector ranks are tasked with responsibilities that no other individual in the civil or public service must bear.  Solely, we can deprive a person of his or her liberty; make life-changing decisions in split seconds; expose ourselves to prosecution-investigation by carrying out our statutory role; have our decisions scrutinised by an outside agency in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission or internally through Garda discipline regulations; be suspended without pay or at best with 90% of basic pay; be left without professional legal assistance, apart from the AGSI scheme; and, ultimately, be open to losing one's job for relatively minor infringements of the regulations.  Sadly, many of our members have lost their lives through the carrying out of their policing duties and many more are injured through assault each year.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is unique in this regard.<\/p><p>  This association has yet to see any other public servant targeted in the same way for the performance of his or her duties as an officeholder.  Most mistakes in other agencies are referred to as \"systems failures\" and often the result is that an undertaking is given that procedures have been put in place to ensure the same thing cannot happen again.<\/p><p>  It has been the practice that police in Ireland and the United Kingdom were paid a rent allowance if they could not be supplied with free accommodation.  This practice was established before the Desborough commission reported to the Government of the United Kingdom in July 1919.<\/p><p>  In Ireland, there is a similar historical aspect to rent allowance and other allowances in the Garda organisation.  I have a written submission, which I will leave with the committee, which deals with a selection of allowances which are targeted for elimination or restructuring within the Garda organisation.  I will conclude at that.  I thank the Chairman and members of the Committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110100005#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Redmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1351779600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Redmond.

I thank the Chairman for giving us the opportunity for coming here today to address him and the committee.<\/p><p>  This is the first opportunity we have been given to address the issue in a public forum.  Much of the debate and discussion in respect of allowances has been conducted in an atmosphere of hysteria.  One matter it is important to point out in respect of the 11,100 members that I represent is that the allowances applicable to those known as front-line responders, the young men and women of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have to go to every call, amounts to approximately three in all: rent allowance, boot allowance and uniform maintenance allowance.  The notion that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are in receipt of some 101 allowances is a misnomer.<\/p><p>  The question of the way the allowances are paid should be addressed in the context of the real meaning of what is an allowance.  For instance, when one talks about the earnings of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of overtime, that should be clear and distinct.<\/p> <p>Equally, when one talks about earnings in respect of the payments for unsocial hours working, that should be clear and distinct.  To bundle that into some sort of notion of allowances puts a skew on the public purse in a way that I do not think gives a true picture or accurate reflection of what is required in terms of the policing of this State.  It must be remembered that when everybody else is curled up at night in their beds and comfortable, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to provide a service 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year.  Nobody with any sense of moral right would begrudge those members the entitlement to be paid, as is paid right across the public and private sector, commensurate wages in respect of what should be known as a shift allowance.  That is the direction in which we should be going and they are the areas that need to be addressed in the context of putting this right once and for all.<\/p><p> Equally in respect of the number of allowances which have been bandied about both in the public media and elsewhere, in reality the number of allowances which can be reflected accurately which could be taken as the amount that are in usage, in my view, is about 34.  They are paid for very specific reasons and they are paid for the purpose of ensuring continuity of service so that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of my rank are able to do the job they are targeted and charged with by the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p> There is one thing I would like to say to the committee and it is very important because it is lost sight of in respect of the force.  The majority of garda&iacute; will retire as garda&iacute;.  Some 80% of my members who joined the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will retire as garda&iacute;.  There is no facility within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for grading or grade structures as apply elsewhere.  It applies in European police forces where they have different grades and different structures.  That would have dealt with the issue of why people are paid a particular amount of money for taking on the responsibility of a particular job, but what it would have meant in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that one would have had different pay levels for different members of the force.  That might not necessarily have been a bad thing, but this is the issue in respect of where we are from the point of view of the public perception of the way allowances are paid.<\/p><p> In the context of the negotiations we have engaged in, we have always stayed within the industrial relations mechanisms available to us, which have served the State well - the conciliation and arbitration machinery.  While I might not be particularly in favour of the way it has operated throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in my service, I still have to acknowledge that it is a forum where we can go and make our case.  I know that when we have argued at that forum in respect of issues pertaining to our conditions of employment, it was always people from the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Finance present who ensured - to quote a Secretary General of the Department - that we pulled the ladder up after us so as to ensure that nobody else could effectively follow and pursue some claims that were agreed for garda&iacute; because of the unique nature of policing.  These things must be borne in mind in the context of now looking at whether something is justified.  While I respect, Chairman, that you and your committee are not doing that, it is important in the context of any discussion that is taking place that we do not open up another forum for negotiations because it is my contention that we have proved the point in respect of the entitlement of some of these allowances and we have shown quite clearly and illustrated that, in the norm, these allowances are much cheaper than that which relates to some of our European counterparts.<\/p><p> I might make a simple case on that.  A lot of outsourcing has happened with European police forces and in any analysis of that outsourcing, one will find that it actually cost more than it costs in Ireland in terms of the service we provide.  It has already been related by the Commissioner that we are a unitary police force.  We do everything from the point of view of investigation of traffic accidents to the security of the State.  In other jurisdictions some of those issues are handled by MI5, M16, etc., but we take on board every aspect and facet of policing and we do it with a proud tradition and with a degree of service that is second to none.<\/p><p> It is important in the context of a debate on garda&iacute; and their pay and remuneration that we clearly understand that some of the issues pertaining to pay and allowances are historical, outside our control and are matters which, in the context of any important review, could be addressed in a way that would not cause this type of concern into the future.  I certainly would be anxious to participate in that type of discussion and I look forward to the forum the Commissioner has alluded to being set up so that we can then make our business case in respect of the matters that are now before the committee.<\/p><p> It is also important to say that there is a great deal of frustration among young garda&iacute;, particularly those with about eight or nine years' service, who hear again through the media that the average pay they receive is in the region of &euro;53,000.  I have a payslip here that reflects the pay of about 80% of the members I represent and it can be sent to the Chairman, if that is what he requires.  The pay of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - it can be clearly shown - is &euro;46,631 for a member with nine years' service - it is not &euro;53,480.  They get very annoyed and aggrieved when this kind of wage average is put out in the public arena.<\/p><p> I know the Chairman and the committee have a very serious task.  I know they are charged with looking after the public purse strings and reporting back to Government and making recommendations.  I sincerely hope, once they have had the opportunity to talk to us - to talk to our members, if necessary, beyond this forum - that their understanding will be much more and that they will have a greater degree of acceptance of the necessity for the continuation of the arrangements, perhaps in a different guise, as important for the proper perception and right of the Irish people who are paying our wages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110100005#D00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. P.

I would like those present to view it in that way.

I do not believe any representative organisation or trade union appearing before the committee has anything to fear from this process.  This has been a very constructive exercise in recent weeks and has performed the function of busting some of the myths about public sector allowances that have been perpetuated in recent weeks and months.  I welcome the Commissioner, his colleagues and the representatives of the staff associations.  I put on record our thanks to the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for protecting the people and the State.<\/p><p>  Approximately 108 allowances are payable to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across all ranks with an overall cost of in excess of &euro;214 million.  More than half of the allowances are taken up by payment for work at weekends, on public holidays, etc., outside non-core hours.  A quarter of the &euro;240 million is paid for the Garda rent allowance.  According to the figures we have, a total of 21.6% of a garda's pay is made up of allowances.  By any measure that is quite large in the context of the relationship between basic pay and allowances.  I know that overtime constitutes a large part of the pay of members of the force.  As with teachers, the pay structures for garda&iacute; are quite complex and cumbersome.  They have developed in a piecemeal fashion since the foundation of the State.  Representative bodies and members of the force over the years may not have been too concerned about how they were awarded provided that the money hit the bank account at the end of the week or month, which is entirely understandable.  As was correctly pointed out, many of the allowances have been in force since the mid-1920s.<\/p> <p>Many of them constitute core pay in my opinion.  What efforts have been made by the representative organisations to absorb or consolidate the allowances into core pay?  Were they content to continue to call the payments allowances when for all intents and purposes they constitute core pay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110100006#E00300","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351780800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>It is probably not a bad thing that we evolved to where we are today in terms of scrutiny of some of these allowances provided that it is done in the context described by Deputy Nash and the Chairman.  A number of these allowances could be subsumed into pay in order to remove the idea that they are perks.  I am sure that is the way forward.  It is fair to say that the allowances were previously used to make up for increases in pay.  That is a pity in one sense because if, for example, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were paid according to the proper pay structures, the question of making claims to conciliation for this or that allowance might not have arisen.  Comparisons are constantly made with other forces.  A police officer starting in the London Metropolitan Police Service earns a salary of &euro;35,464, compared to &euro;25,745 here.  The same relationship exists throughout the service.  It is a pity that we have not arrived at a proper benchmark for pay of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If that had been done 15 or 20 years ago we might not be having this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110100007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. P. J. Stone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351780800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I wish to make a couple of general points on the issue of allowances.  In the context of the 108 allowances outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the difficulty of being both descriptive and prescriptive in respect of a unilateral allowance for the Garda was recognised in my opening remarks and by subsequent speakers.  This is particularly the case given the unique duties applicable to the force.  Some of the allowances could certainly be subsumed into basic pay and I support the arguments articulated by others in regard to the various allowances that accrued to members of the force over the years.<\/p><p>  However, other issues arise which might make the process somewhat difficult.  I refer to the totality of the allowances rather than individual allowances.  The services provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have always been driven by demand.  This means we need the requisite number of people in the right place at the right time to meet demands.  As the pattern of demand will not always be uniform across the ranks, the nuance between those who are entitled to allowances and those who are disentitled, if I may use that term, would have to be carefully considered in most cases.  The issue also arises of operational police officers being available on a 24-seven basis, 365 days per year.  The third leg of the problem is discommoding people from their places of employment and asking them to be available for duty at locations other than their normal place of work.<\/p><p>  These issues have to be factored in.  Many of the allowances - no more so than overtime - are demand driven.  The need to match demand with the nature of the employment dictates where allowances should be paid and who should receive them.  I agree, however, that a number of allowances could be subsumed into basic pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110100007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Callinan"},{"type":"speech","time":1351780800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Mr. Callinan mentioned overtime.

A particular spike appears to occur with overtime for inspectors.  Four inspectors each earned more than &euro;60,000 in allowances and overtime.  That is an extraordinary figure by any stretch of the imagination.

A set budget for overtime is allocated to chief superintendents at the start of the year.  Inspectors are a divisional resource, in other words, they work to their chief superintendents and superintendents in their respective districts.  This means, for example, they are occasionally required to travel significant distances to service the courts.  As the Deputy will be aware, we prosecute in the District Court.  They are also involved in a considerable range of interfaces with committees, whether in joint policing committees, the health service, justice or the courts.<\/p><p>  They have a wide range of duties and their span of control must also be taken into account because as operational officers will have in their charge a number of sergeants and garda&iacute;.

Senior management is acutely aware of how that money is spent.  The figures substantiate what the Deputy has pointed out.  More than one third of the gross salary of inspectors is consumed by overtime and allowances generally.  This is not money that is thrown away like confetti at a wedding, however.  There are tight controls and structures around the allocation of overtime.

It has not always been the case that expectations are met in terms of the amount of money for which we ask.  In more recent times, however, committees have sat and rates have been struck with concert promoters, etc.<\/p><p>  There is always a debate on what is representative of public duty.  For example, sporting events have a community value.  Therefore, there are obligations on the Garda to act in the public interest and provide a certain level of service.

Non-pay allowances do not increase with increases in pay, but pay allowances do.  Some pay allowances are pensionable, but others are no longer pensionable as a result of a recent decision by the Revenue Commissioners.  I will not go into that, because it relates to the issue of plain clothes, detective allowance etc.  Detective allowance, for example, is not a pensionable allowance.  It is a non-pay allowance, but it is taxable.  Normally, allowances which carried an element of taxation became pay allowances for the purposes of pension.  The decision on whether allowances are pensionable are a result of Labour Court decisions, not just as a result of the conciliation mechanism available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

However, under the Minister of the day at the time there was an embargo on recruitment.  When the advertisement went out originally and the pay levels were presented, they were the same levels payable to members of the Garda, but there were no applicants.

The employment control framework, ECF, level is 2,074 and we are at approximately 2,031.  The moratorium is hampering issues around civilianisation.  That said, I can point out that the Garda vetting unit, for example, in Thurles is very heavily populated with a civilian cadre.  Of the 80 personnel there, some 75 or so are civilians.  In more recent times, command and control, the radio system in Dublin which is based in Harcourt Square, has been hugely civilianised.  In the Garda information services centre, GISC, in Castlebar, we imported a number of staff from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who at the time were being sent to different areas.

In other words, we are trying to ensure there is an organisational fit with the individuals.  That is work that is long overdue within the organisation.

He spoke about the policing plan and its objectives and efficiencies and effectiveness in resource allocation and deployment so as to enhance the policing service.  He spoke about doing a lot more with less and making the organisation as efficient and productive as possible, as well as achieving organisational reform.  There are a lot of challenges in all of that.  The garda&iacute; have changed and the new rostering system has proven that the force can change effectively.

It is important, if we go down this road, that this is presented carefully to the public, particularly to those living in rural areas who are used to having a Garda station in their communities.  As I said last week, when such people, having heard that their town councils, local banks and post offices would close, hear that their Garda station will also close, will be very concerned.  If the plan is to reorganise in order to effect better policing - and having spoken to the chief superintendent in my area, that seems to be the plan - then that must be presented very carefully and clearly to the public when the list of stations to close, which could be more than 80, is published.  This is not a criticism, but my experience of the force is that it is sometimes very focused.  It is no reflection on Mr. Callinan, but there have been times in the past when it has had tunnel vision in the sense that it sets out its goal and does not consider the peripheral issues that need to be explained to the public.  The force needs to be careful in how it presents this programme of closures.  Obviously, personal issues will change with regard to this plan coming into force but I ask Mr. Callinan to comment on my concern regarding how this is presented and explained to people, if it is a plan to make policing more effective, particularly in rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110100012#L00200","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1351783800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>The Deputy has engineered that question much better than last week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110100012#L00300","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1351783800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I have learned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110100012#L00400","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351783800,"counter":139,"content":"<p>It is incumbent on me to answer, so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110100012#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Callinan"},{"type":"speech","time":1351783800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I put a lot of effort into it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110100012#L00600","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351783800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  We are painfully conscious of all of the sensitivities around station closures.  Indeed, just last week we had the bi-annual commissioners' conference in Templemore, where I assembled all of my senior command, from chief superintendent up, sworn and non-sworn.  It was a two-day conference and the first day was largely occupied by the issue of station closures and the type of policing service that we could provide into the future when X number of stations would close.  The second day was spent dealing with the corporate strategy.  As members will know, we are obliged under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act to provide a three-year corporate strategy and within that, an annual policing plan that services each individual year of the strategy until it is completed.  Any change to a district, division or boundary of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must to be included in the annual policing plan and those plans and the corporate strategy are placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is the legal aspect of the issue.<\/p><p>  Implicit in all of the discussions is how policing will look into the future with reduced resources, both financial and human.  Obviously, we have given careful consideration to a number of stations that have closed already and the closures that will happen in the new year.  We have, from the centre, pushed out through the organisation, through the assistant commissioners, down through the chief superintendents, down to the ground, to involve as many stakeholders as possible in the discussion as to what stations might usefully be subsumed into the station closure programme.  That has filtered all the way back up and we are at an advanced stage of planning now.  I will be in a position in the coming weeks to provide the Minister with my recommendations with regard to closure.<\/p><p>  However, the points raised by the Deputy concerning the programme and the sensitivities that are involved were very much on our minds when we were discussing the topic over the last few days.  Central to it is communication both with the public and with our own organisation when we have established what stations are going to close.  Typically, we were discussing the type of service that will be available to communities in the areas where the stations will close and what that service will look like after closure.  The plan has always been to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the organisation and is not, as I have indicated previously, a cost-saving exercise for the State, although there will obviously be savings.  I am on the record as indicating that somewhere between &euro;2,500 and &euro;4,000 would be a typical maintenance bill for stations, so that money will be saved.  However, in the overall context, it is not about savings but about providing a blueprint for future policing.  That is what we are aiming for and I am absolutely subscribed, to the last scintilla, to the points raised by the Deputy regarding communication.  However, before we get there we must establish which stations it may be appropriate to close.<\/p><p>  A lot of this work is running in tandem with the new rostering arrangements and undoubtedly there will be a requirement to cluster some resources in order to provide the service.  I was clear in saying to my officers that I did not want a situation to arise in which, if a particular Garda station was generally open in a particular area for a particular number of hours in a week, we would not match that service in that area at those times.  Then, beyond that, we must have a clear and succinct policing plan to follow the various trends, particularly in the area of crime, and meet the challenge of reducing crime in those areas.  Communication is very much a part of our programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110100012#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Callinan"},{"type":"speech","time":1351783800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>We are in a time of massive uncertainty and I am particularly concerned about elderly people in rural areas.

The difficulty arises when members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who, for example, finish work at 7 a.m. have to hang around, because they have long distances to commute, before they go to court with a remand prisoner.  It is unacceptable, in this day and age, that there are no night courts, which would do away with the need to pay staff overtime to attend court sittings during the day.  However, we have no control over this matter.

The matter has been approached badly in terms of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the sense that one will create major difficulties when one brings in new recruits.  Whatever about keeping them on a pay level for a certain period, if one does not bring them into the fold, one will create major difficulties and relativities because in respect of the new pay arrangements, people will be choking each other to get promoted because, once they are promoted they go onto the scale of serving sergeants or inspectors.  This has been very badly thought out.  One could, perhaps, understand brand new scales being introduced to start on a particular day in order that people would know what they were buying into, right up to the rank of Commissioner, but the way the system has been approached is mistaken.  The big problem is that there was a lack of understanding about the fact that in some other sections of the public sector, people move onto different grades and therefore the pay scales take care of themselves.  In respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the young men and women who should be recruited immediately to provide a policing service must be treated with fairness and equity.  If that is allowed to proceed, while people might break down the door to get recruited, they will not be long in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when there will be levels of dissatisfaction that will be difficult to contain.

The call to formulate plans regarding the stations prioritised for closure went out from the centre, that is, my office, to the various assistant commissioners and chief superintendents, and it filtered down to the divisions and districts.

A range of products came into play in the context of the consideration of the closure of the stations.<\/p><p>  The point must be made, however, that this is a matter of managing with very limited funding.  It is about managing resources to the optimum.  Garda stations are buildings.  If the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not doing in a very proactive manner the type of work they are supposed to be doing, we will not have the types of efficiencies and effectiveness I spoke about.  I am not for a moment diminishing the perception and reality represented in the various communities.  Of course, we are alive to the sensitivities of all the communities in terms of the closure of Garda stations in the context of closures of post offices, banks, and so on.  This is a matter of putting in place a policing model that will replicate the system that obtained previously and which will, I hope, go beyond that.  It is question of smart, intelligence-led policing that will grapple with the types of problems that exist.  In a considerable number of the stations we are examining, there was no presence greater than one or two hours per week.  That reflects reality, I am afraid.

Of course, communication is vital, and that is why the substantive portion of the discussion we had during the week was on those very subjects and how we, as managers, would formulate plans to compensate for the closure of the stations such that we can provide the type of service we are espousing at the point of closure.<\/p><p>  The rest of the discussion, which will be when we have our stall set out, will involve engaging with our colleagues in the associations and the wider community to ensure there is a loud and clear message that we will provide the same service or a better one to the affected communities.  That is a given.  It would be foolish to embark on a course of action resulting, intentionally or otherwise, in the failure to provide a service of the type that already exists.  It would be folly.  As a consequence of all the closures, there will be a cost saving.

Generally speaking, these cases are the exception rather than the rule.  We will have heard a lot of talk and speculation in the media about the fleet and the unavailability of cars, and so on, but it is important to point out the position on vehicles.  I acknowledge and thank the Government, including the Minister, for providing me with &euro;3 million to purchase 171 vehicles this year.  They will be available very early next year to assist in what is certainly becoming a difficult fleet to manage given the age profile.<\/p> <p>That said, we have had 37 cars brought on stream in May in addition to the 171, so one is looking at 208 vehicles in the past 12 months.  That is something for which I am very grateful in the context of the economic climate in which we find ourselves.  It will go some way towards assisting in managing an ageing fleet.  The fleet is something which must be worked on year on year or else it will be quickly depleted.  We have been managing over the last couple of years to get vehicles, albeit in small numbers, but we have still managed to get those and we are very grateful for that.  I am working hard with the Minister and the Department to try to provide a funding stream into the future to replace some of the other vehicles, so there are works in progress.  There are certainly challenges for Garda management in providing transport for some of the operations for which we would like to provide transport.  That said, we have not yet reached the point where vehicles have become such an issue that we are unable to conduct our business very efficiently.

I will move to the subject of juvenile liaison officers, JLOs.  I note the Garda has 118 JLOs, who are paid a modest allowance of &euro;30 per week.  Given that JLOs probably deal with teenagers up to the age of 18 or whatever, I note that much crime begins at that age, before people move on to their 20s.  I presume that more crimes are committed by younger people than by older people.  Consequently, as an observation, I would have thought the Garda could do with more JLOs.  There are more people in receipt of a Gaeltacht allowance than a JLO allowance and I am sure there are more younger people committing crimes than there are people so doing within the Gaeltacht.  Consequently, I believe the numbers in this regard could be stepped up.<\/p><p>  I refer to the well-discussed issue of the closure of Garda stations.  I represent a rural constituency and am on the front line in respect of this issue.  However, I am as much concerned about the reduction in opening hours of Garda stations that heretofore were open on a 24-hour basis.  For example, Abbeyleix station was a district headquarters and formerly operated on a 24-hour basis.  Were its opening hours reduced to a nine-to-five basis or something similar, that would have a far greater negative impact on a wide area than would cutting further the hours of a station that only was open for a few hours each week.  As losing 24-hour cover has a greater impact, does the forthcoming plan envisage that many stations will lose their 24-hour cover?  I acknowledge that people break into houses during the day and so on but most crimes about which people are worried, in the sense of security, probably are committed during the evening and the night-time.  I consider 24-hour cover in Garda stations potentially to be a major issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012110100019#S01800","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351788000,"counter":297,"content":"<p>This absolutely addresses the nub of the issue we are discussing.

I am accompanied by my colleagues, Liam McLoughlin and Lynda Carragher.  We have provided the joint committee with a presentation in advance, which hopefully provides a reasonably comprehensive picture of our position.  The bank is a public company that is subject to the listing rules of the Irish, London and New York stock exchanges.  The presentation is a public document and is presented under the rules of the aforementioned stock exchanges.  All comments I make are governed by the stock exchange disclosure rules.  As the Chairman has suggested we keep this relatively brief, if it is acceptable to members, I would like to go through the presentation relatively quickly.  Clearly, however, if I have skipped or have not paused for long enough on any particular part of it, I am sure that will come up in our questions and answers session.<\/p><p>  I will turn to slide four of our presentation, which sets out, from Bank of Ireland's perspective, its strategic goals.  It is important to bear in mind that the bank raised a significant amount of capital in 2011.  Virtually all this equity capital came from the private sector and was provided by investors who believe that the Irish economy is recovering and that Bank of Ireland can support and benefit from that recovery.  The investors' investment case is that Bank of Ireland can become the pre-eminent bank in Ireland and they have provided the capital and endorsed the use of the bank's funding and infrastructure in support of this goal.  We in Bank of Ireland believe this is a time of both challenge and opportunity.  We believe that if we are the most focused bank, if we engage heavily with and work with our customers and if we derive new lines of business in our franchises, then we can establish ourselves as the pre-eminent bank in Ireland.  We are extremely well positioned in our core markets.  We have had agreed a European Union restructuring and viability plan and are the only Irish bank that has had such a plan agreed.  Under that plan, it is clear what businesses we have exited and what businesses we are in.  In accordance with the plan, those businesses that we are in, and in particular our Irish franchise, are those businesses to which we can devote capital and funding.  It clearly is one of our key goals to be strongly capitalised, thereby reducing our reliance on monetary authority and Government guarantees.  At 30 June 2012, our core tier 1 capital was 14%, which is a very strong capital ratio well in excess of any regulatory requirements.  Over the period since 2009, we have generated equity capital of &euro;10 billion, of which approximately &euro;1.5 billion net has come from the State.  We must ensure that, in the future, our businesses are sustainable and, in particular, sustainable from a funding proposition.  Over the past three years, we have worked very hard to grow our customer deposit franchises.  Our deposit franchise in Ireland has proved to be highly resilient and, in particular, we have grown a retail deposit franchise in the United Kingdom, primarily through our relationship with the United Kingdom's Post Office.<\/p><p>  Over the past three years, we have continued to reduce our cost base and costs are down by approximately 20%.  The stock market is expecting our costs to be approximately &euro;1.5 billion within the next couple of years and we believe this to be a sustainable target.  We are in the middle of a redundancy programme within our business and have taken a &euro;66 million charge in the first half of the year, which we expect to have been utilised by the year-end.  At the same time, we are continuing to invest in our businesses because we wish to ensure we are here for the long haul and it is not just about cost-cutting.  Therefore, we are investing heavily in payment systems and in branch networks in Ireland and in other parts of our franchises.  From our perspective, the raising of capital, restructuring and deleveraging our balance sheets and reducing our costs will not achieve our goals unless we grow revenue.  It is extremely important that we grow revenue as we cannot cut or restructure our way to glory.  In simple terms, the way in which we grow our revenue is to sell more products to our existing customers and to get new customers.  This is a key focus in those core franchises we have decided we are in and which have been endorsed under our European Union plan.  The Irish taxpayer has taken a considerable risk in supporting Bank of Ireland and has provided investments to Bank of Ireland.  Clearly, as an investor, it is our absolute goal that we reduce the Irish taxpayer from any support provided to Bank of Ireland, we reward any taxpayers' investment in Bank of Ireland and, ultimately, we repay the investment in Bank of Ireland.  As a public company, my colleagues and I work for our stockholders and our job is to ensure we have a sustainable business into the long term with good sustainable returns for those who have provided us with capital.<\/p><p>  As for the restructuring of the balance sheet shown on slide five, we have achieved our business sale targets.  We were required to sell &euro;10 billion of loans and we have sold those well within the discounts assumed for the prudential capital assessment review, PCAR, 2011 exercise and well ahead of the schedule that was set therein.  A total of 50% of our assets are outside of Ireland and our deleveraging initiatives are all outside of our Irish businesses.  I have touched on our deposits franchises, which have remained very strong and resilient.  Based on both the deleveraging and the deposit, at 30 June our loan-to-deposit ratio, which is a key target, was 136% and based on developments since that period, our loan-to-deposit ratio will have reduced further.  As I mentioned, our capital ratios remain strong.  Our market positions in our Irish and United Kingdom franchises are strengthening.  In particular, in July 2012 we signed an extension of our very important franchise with the United Kingdom Post Office, which extends our contract with the Post Office beyond 2023.  A total of 21 million people per week visit a post office in the United Kingdom and we are the chosen financial services provider.<\/p><p>  Turning to slide six, I mentioned that we continue to work on our cost programmes.  We have a redundancy charge, which we took in the first half of the year and, as I mentioned, I believe this charge will be fully utilised.  From the bank's perspective, the repayment period and payback on a redundancy charge of that note is approximately 11 months.  As I mentioned, we continue to invest strongly in our core franchise and in particular in payment systems.  The key task we have is rebuilding the profitability of the bank.  We believe we have made significant progress in capital raising, in deleveraging and in our cost initiatives but, ultimately, our route to profitability to repay taxpayers' investment and to provide a return to our other shareholders is through increasing the profitability of the bank and that is our focus in the future.  On slide seven, we explain in particular our balance sheet targets and as I have just advised, I believe we are well on the way to progress in that regard.  The rebuilding profitability targets are more influenced in particular by interest rates, economic growth and the self-help initiatives we are undertaking.<\/p><p>  Slide eight demonstrates the pressure under which our income has been in the first half of the year and the initiatives we are taking as a bank to try to enhance our operating profits.  The most important focus for us is to reduce the cost of raw material.  The cost of raw material to the bank is influenced by the cost of wholesale funding, by deposit pay rates in the markets and in the Irish market in particular, as well as in the cost to us of the Government eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, guarantee.  We are taking a number of initiatives to reduce that cost of raw material.  Slide nine shows the breakdown of our portfolios, both between the different business segments and on a geographic basis.  Approximately 54% of the group's balance sheet is in mortgages, of which approximately half are in the Republic of Ireland and half in the United Kingdom.  The rest of our business is spread between Ireland, the United States and the rest of the world.  It is likely, in accordance with our strategic plan, that the proportion of our balance sheet in Ireland will increase and the proportion of our balance sheet outside Ireland will reduce, which is in line with our deleveraging plans.  Slide 11 demonstrates the impact that low interest rates, which are not reflected in the cost of money to the bank, are having on our net interest margin.  Our net interest margin reduced from the second half of 2011 to the first half of 2012.  We are taking a range of initiatives to try to address this and to improve our net interest margin.<\/p> <p>We anticipate that that margin will gradually start to improve.<\/p><p> Slide 12 deals with our costs, which I have already touched upon, but I am obviously happy to discuss that in more detail.<\/p><p> Slide 13 looks at our provisions and impairment charges in the first half of 2012 compared to the first half of 2011.  It demonstrates where the provisions are taken between our different loan books.  We provide significant further detail in our interim accounts.  Based on the trajectory of what we anticipate and if the economic environment, both in Ireland and the UK, continues at its current pace, we believe our loan loss charges will reduce further in the second half of 2012.  Key influences on our loan loss charges are commercial real estate in the Republic of Ireland and our Irish mortgages.  As regards the Bank of Ireland commercial real estate book, we have estimated for our provisions a peak-to-trough fall in commercial real estate prices in Ireland of 65%.  We see evidence of the market stabilising at that level.  <\/p><p> At the interim results announcement in August, I advised the market that from Bank of Ireland's perspective the pace of increase in the formation of arrears in our Irish mortgage book was reducing and that continues to be the case.  <\/p><p> Our assumptions for our loan loss provisions are based on a peak-to-trough fall in house prices in Ireland of 55% and then another 10% on top of that for sale costs, etc.  From our perception, the market appears to be stabilising at current levels.  Obviously the market is a mix of a number of different micro-markets, but our experience in the main urban areas - both in terms of our own existing book and the flow of new business - is that house prices seem to be stabilising at current levels.<\/p><p> Slide 15 demonstrates the mix of our deposits, in particular between Ireland and the UK.  The rationale is that we can fund our UK business through retail deposits and therefore it is a sustainable business going forward.  Our deposit target of &euro;75 billion to &euro;80 billion by December 2014, based on our experience in the period up to 30 June and since, looks eminently achievable.<\/p><p> I will now turn to slides 17 to 20, which deal with the two aspects of our business upon which there was a particular focus in the committee's invitation.  We have tried to demonstrate in pictorial form how we see our different tasks and initiatives.  One of our most important tasks is continuing to provide new mortgages in the market.  That is because it is a sustainable part of our business going forward.  We strongly believe in Ireland and that the Irish economy will recover.  We were provided with capital liquidity by our investors to support that recovery and to benefit from it.<\/p><p> In the first half of 2012, mortgage demand remained relatively muted in the economy.  We did about 40% of the flow of business in that economy and we have been heavily advertising our products and services.  In the period since, we have seen a noted pick-up in mortgage demand and activity in September and October.  We have come out with a wide range of new products and services, both for existing customers and to deal with customers who are facing financial challenges.  We have a significant number of staff involved in working on short-term and long-term solutions for customers.  We have more than 16,000 customers who are currently subject to mortgage forbearance or who have had their mortgages restructured.  Our mortgage forbearance and mortgage restructures are based on customers who can meet, in our estimation and theirs, at least the full interest on their mortgages.  Some 86% of those customers who are subject to forbearance or restructuring are fully meeting the revised arrangements.  While it is early days yet, we believe that our restructuring approach is benefiting a significant number of our customers, which is evidenced by the low level of re-default.  <\/p><p> We could probably spend a little more time on the SME sector.  A key part of our future business strategy is to be the pre-eminent bank in Ireland.  We are currently number two in business banking in Ireland, and it is our goal to be the number one bank.  A particular focus we have is on the SME sector, where we are number two.  We have a wide range and are a universal bank.  We have a distribution system in every part of Ireland, primarily through our branch network, which tries to reach out to our customers.  We have an internal target, which is also a target agreed with the Government, that we will provide &euro;3.5 billion of new lending to the SME sector.  From a Bank of Ireland perspective, we measure this target on the basis of new and increased lending.  From our perspective, new and increased lending is what derives revenue, and that is why it has our focus.<\/p><p> We obviously have a number of customers in the SME sector who face different challenges and we are working closely with them to help them restructure their businesses and look at their propositions going forward.  From our perspective in Bank of Ireland, we have a risk appetite in every sector because we believe that in every sector good business people can make money and can develop good businesses.  We are not closed to lending in any particular sector.  We have identified certain sectors which we feel have higher growth potential and we are devoting more resources to product innovation in those areas.<\/p><p> In slide 26, we try to demonstrate both for the market and for the committee where the different divisions are in the second half of 2012.  We have tried to point out that certain of our divisions have moved more quickly towards profitably.  Our Irish division continues to require the most work and therefore the contribution of our overseas and corporate divisions in rebuilding profitability for the group as a whole, as we restructure our Irish division, is extremely important.<\/p><p> I will now move to slide 27.  As investors and representatives of the taxpayer, we try to demonstrate what the taxpayer is getting out of its support for Bank of Ireland.  Our first task is to reduce the risk to the taxpayer from support provided by the taxpayer.  We believe that the capital we have raised, the restructuring and deleveraging, the cost-reduction programmes we have undertaken, the agreement of our EU viability and restructuring plans, and the enhancement of our franchises - including the franchise in the UK, further protected by an extension to post office contract - have been a very important part of reducing the risk to the taxpayer.  The most significant contingent liability the taxpayer has is in respect of the eligible liabilities guarantee or ELG.  Through a range of initiatives, particularly deleveraging and increasing our deposit franchises, we have reduced the liabilities under the ELG from &euro;136 billion at their peak in September 2008 to &euro;36 billion at the end of June.  They will have reduced further since that date.  Bank of Ireland notes that the ELG is due to expire on 31 December and we are prepared for that.<\/p><p> The State invested &euro;4.8 billion in cash in Bank of Ireland in the period up to 30 June 2012, and Bank of Ireland returned &euro;2.5 billion in cash to the State in that period.  The State's current investment in Bank of Ireland is a 15% shareholding, preference shares of &euro;1.8 billion which bear a coupon of 10.25% per annum, and a contingent capital instrument which is not part of our core tier one, which bears a coupon of &euro;1 billion per annum.<\/p><p> In summary, we are making progress against the priorities we have set for ourselves and that we have shared with our investors.  It is a very challenging environment, but one that we believe creates opportunities for us.  We will continue to build our businesses in Ireland and invest in our Irish franchises.  As regards our progress on deleveraging our balance sheet, it is self-evident that deleveraging is outside Ireland and outside our core franchises.  We will continue to reduce our reliance on the ELG and we are actively reducing the cost of money to us.  We have significant enhancements of some of our key franchises and our capital remains robust.  We are on track to achieve our goal of becoming the pre-eminent bank in Ireland.  The most important thing we can do in Bank of Ireland is to have a strong focus on all of the objectives that are under our own control and that we can influence.  That is our target going forward.<\/p><p> I will be pleased to take questions now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110100003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351767000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>As this meeting has to come to an end at 1 p.m., the first round of questions will be for 15 minutes, the second round for ten minutes and remaining questions for six minutes.

Many citizens watching this meeting believe it is important to hear the answers from the banks because they have had significant support from the State and its citizens.  The people feel they should be the boss.  We, their representatives, are asking the questions.<\/p><p>  One issue not dealt with in Mr. Richard Boucher&rsquo;s presentation on revenue growth was standard variable rate, SVR, mortgages.  Is that part of the bank&rsquo;s strategy in revenue growth, on top of selling new products and getting new customers?  Yesterday, AIB gave a fairly stark outline of where it sees SVRs going in the short and medium term.  What is Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s assessment of this?<\/p><p>  Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s mortgage resolution options seem to be mainly concerned with moving people out of their houses.  In its submission, the terms &ldquo;assisted sales&rdquo;, &ldquo;voluntary sales&rdquo; and &ldquo;trade down&rdquo; are used.  Surely, we should be trying to keep people in their homes.  There are other options open to the bank such as the shared equity scheme.  Has it considered this as a way of keeping people in their homes?  I do not see any mention of a deferred interest initiative which was a recommendation of the Cooney report, commissioned by the previous Government.  How many mortgage-to-rent arrangements has the bank undertaken?  That has been flagged as a major answer to mortgage difficulties but it does not seem to be happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110100005#D00500","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351767000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Our SVR is designed to be competitive in the marketplace.

Our products are designed as such that they are commercially sensible for the bank but also help in growing a long-term franchise.<\/p><p>  I cannot predict where mortgage rates will move.

Mortgage-to-rent is critically about realising the true value of the property because it must be converted from a mortgage and sold to a housing agency, with the tenant who was previously the resident remaining in the property.

We believe that prices in particular urban areas have stabilised.  In some rural locations, it is more difficult.  Price discovery is difficult.

It is important that we take a realistic view.<\/p><p>  Working with customers who are builders or developers, or in terms of repossessions, Bank of Ireland has been involved in the sale of more than 1,000 houses in this market and we are informing ourselves on those views.

We obviously keep a close eye on rentals in the buy-to-let book, and we see that rental levels are stabilising.  Those are all indicators to us that they are stabilising, but I would concur with the view that in certain rural locations it is very difficult to get a market-clearing price because there is not enough liquidity.

He also stated the bank's customer analysis pointed to how important it was for customers to be able to engage with the bank face to face.  In the past 12 months, however, the bank has removed a link between branches and customers.  When one telephones a local branch in Scariff, Miltown Malbay or so on, one gets through to a central call centre and it is not possible to speak to the branch staff with whom one has built up a relationship.  The bank has maintained the ability to telephone the branch in the Law Library, but ordinary people in counties Clare, Kerry and Donegal are unable to telephone their local branches.  Does this demonstrate an ability to interact with staff?  As people now realise, banking is about relationships.  Does Mr. McLoughlin accept that part of the reason Bank of Ireland did not lose as much as other banks was that it maintained a more traditional practice of building relationships with customers?

We put this question yesterday to the other bankers and Mr. Boucher's counterpart in AIB had the nerve to give us a lecture on moral hazard as it pertains to owner occupiers, those people who are stuck with exorbitant and extortionate mortgages as a result of blatant speculation in building land and house prices.  Why will the bank not consider a write-down for owner occupiers to the real value of their homes and a recalibration of mortgages on a monthly basis to the equivalent amount?  That would remove massive amounts of stress from those who are trapped in this nightmare and release badly needed funds into the domestic economy, shops and services, which would help to regenerate the gutted domestic economy with all the downsides of mass unemployment.

A question was put to Mr. Boucher, as it was put to AIB, on the absolute cost of the institution reducing the standard variable rate on domestic mortgages by 0.5%.  The figure we got from AIB yesterday afternoon was that private dwelling houses on its domestic book is worth approximately &euro;14.3 billion and a 0.5% reduction would result in a loss of &euro;71 million to AIB.  On the figures Mr. Boucher gave us this morning, the domestic book of Bank of Ireland is approximately &euro;21 billion and if the bank reduced its standard variable rate by 0.5% its loss would be &euro;29 million, approximately a third less than AIB.  Could he explain to us how it is the case that a smaller loss would be incurred following a 0.5% reduction given that the loan book is bigger?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012110100017#Q08000","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351774800,"counter":882,"content":"<p>The trackers are excluded.

Yesterday afternoon, AIB was asked the number of mortgages with a shortfall that it has allowed to be surrendered voluntarily and its policy on shortfalls.  We seem to have received a very vague response from Bank of Ireland on the matter.  The AIB officials advised us yesterday afternoon that 140 properties were surrendered with a mortgage shortfall.  The response of Bank of Ireland to date has been that it has a responsibility to maximise the recovery of all moneys owed by customers and that it has a comprehensive arrangement and process to work with customers to find solutions that can work for them and the bank in this regard.  Bank of Ireland states that, as a last resort, it may have to instigate a formal legal process.  That is not answering the question; rather, it is symptomatic of some of the replies we received this morning.  It indicates the bank is not really engaging with the process in a serious manner.  It also means it is not engaging with this committee in a serious manner, which is of equal concern to me.
