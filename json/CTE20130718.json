The expenditure includes around &euro;650,000 in respect of the work of the valuation tribunal, which handles appeals against valuation determinations by the Valuation Office.<\/p><p>  The Valuation Office has two major streams of work.  First, it carries out revisions of rateable valuations, based on the existing valuation norms for a specific geographic area.  This is required where there are new developments or alterations to existing rated properties.  Second, the Valuation Office has been engaged since 2001 in a phased national revaluation programme, designed to bring the valuation of all properties into line with recent rental values.  Previous work by my office, reported on in November 2007, outlined these Valuation Office programmes in detail and drew attention in particular to the slow pace of the revaluation programme, due to certain operational inflexibilities.  I understand that faster progress is now being made in relation to that work.  The Accounting Officer will be in a position to update the committee on developments in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800005#E01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374139200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to make these opening remarks.  On the last occasion the Valuation Office appeared before the committee, in October 2011, two particular areas of concern were discussed.  These areas were, various shortcomings in the financial controls and governance arrangements in the Valuation Office in 2010 and the pace at which the office was conducting the national revaluation programme.<\/p><p>  In regard to the financial control issues, significant progress has been made in implementing the necessary measures to address the shortcomings.  A number of these are set out in the progress report provided to the committee in January 2012 and in the updating document we have now provided.<\/p><p>  The committee is aware that conducting a national revaluation programme has been Government policy since the enactment of the Valuation Act 2001.  After a very slow start, the Valuation Office has achieved considerable momentum in the programme over the past two years.  The current position is that the programmes for three authorities in Dublin are complete.  Revaluation of the three Waterford rating authorities and Dublin City Council will be concluded by December 2013.  This landmark will increase the amount of the revalued commercial valuation base in monetary terms, to over 50%.  Work in regard to the two Limerick authorities is well under way and we have also initiated the statutory consultation process from which orders for the revaluation of an additional five authorities can be expected imminently.<\/p><p>  The case for conducting a national revaluation programme is compelling.  The rental values of individual properties and categories of property change over time as a result of differential shifts between categories and locations.  Apart from the rating authorities that have been revalued to date, commercial rates in all other areas are, at present, based on valuations which reflect market conditions and relativities prevailing in 1988.  The only comprehensive way to address this is through a revaluation programme from which some ratepayers will obtain a reduction, while, inevitably, others will experience an increase.<\/p><p>  The committee will already be aware of the efforts which have been under way to accelerate the national revaluation programme.  This requires a multifaceted approach from the staff and management of the Valuation Office.  We have concentrated on bringing about improvements in how we organise and carry out our work, using a wider range of data sources to inform or validate our valuations, and developing innovative approaches to valuation, including proposals which require legislation.<\/p> <p>The proposals set out in the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 will, when implemented, provide an important set of additional measures to expedite the programme.  The Bill provides the legislative basis for carrying out revaluations using self-assessment by ratepayers and for the delivery of elements of the valuation process by external contractors.  We have already developed our plans so that we can pilot these approaches, following enactment of the legislation.  The Bill also provides for streamlining of the current legislation, including the appeals process, and for the wider application of statistical information, as is the case in other countries.<\/p><p> The Government has decided to proceed with the merger of the Property Registration Authority, the Valuation Office and Ordinance Survey Ireland.  A project board, comprising senior officials from the three parent Departments and the chief executive officers of the three organisations directly affected by the merger, has been established recently to oversee the process.  This development is likely to have an important impact on how the Valuation Office conducts its business in the future.  In summary, the past two years have been very significant for the Valuation Office, and we can point to substantial progress on several fronts.  However, much remains to be done and there are many challenges ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800005#E02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374139800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>May we publish your statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800006#F00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374139800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1374139800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Sullivan and his officials.  I would like to thank him and Mr. Declan Lavelle for meeting me in Waterford recently.  It was very informative.  I am interested in this issue because of the revaluation process that is ongoing in Waterford and the impact it will potentially have on businesses there.  Over the last two months, I have been trying to ascertain whether different Departments are up to speed with the revaluation process in which the Valuation Office is engaged, which is a technical exercise and analysis, as Mr. O'Sullivan pointed out.  I did not find a lack of understanding, but a lack of cohesion in respect of the implications of the revaluation process throughout the Government, which I think is improving.  Due to the statutory independence of the Valuation Office, there is perhaps a lack of appreciation in some Departments of the implications for businesses of the results of the valuation process, but I think that is changing.<\/p><p>  Where are we now?  I had a very positive meeting with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform this week.  At this stage it is fair to say there is an acknowledgment within the Government that there is a problem and that something needs to be done about it.  I would describe the process in which the Valuation Office is engaged as a system that was outdated and needed reform - it goes back to 1998, and there is acceptance of that - mirrored with a disastrous business environment, especially as it affects small businesses outside Dublin.  What does the Government do to cushion the blow of a revaluation process that has resulted in some cases in a sharp upward adjustment for small businesses that do not have the ability to pay?  That is where my interest comes from.  I know these businesses.  I know the profiles of the individuals involved and I have a serious concern that they will be put out of business.  This will certainly assist them in going out of business.<\/p><p>  The larger issue is that this is self-defeating.  Our rates base has shrunk and it is unsustainable in many cases to increase rates.  I have examples from my home town of Dungarvan which were given to me by the chamber of commerce.  Rates for a clothes shop are potentially going from &euro;800 to &euro;9,000.  There is an appeals process and a potential tribunal process that goes with that and the office works with the individuals involved, but that is unsustainable.  I know the individuals involved in many of these businesses and it will lead to unemployment and non-hiring of people in future.  There is an issue for the State in that respect as well.<\/p><p>  Following the meeting with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I can say the problem is being acknowledged.  There is legislation in the pipeline.  Over the next two months, departmental officials will take a look at that legislation, potentially amending it in respect of issues such as spreading out payments over time.  That leads to an issue of funding with regard to any deficits at local authority level.  That is what will be examined over the next couple of months.<\/p><p>  I understand that the Valuation Office is given a role that is underpinned by legislation, and officials at the office go about their work based on that legislation.  There are policy issues here that obviously they cannot address and I accept that.  A comment was made to me by a number of local authority officials as I was educating myself in this process.  They were critical of the fact that there was not more interaction between their offices and the Valuation Office.  They understand the statutorily independent role that the Valuation Office has, but they believe their local knowledge and local experience with particular small businesses is being ignored.   When they tried to communicate that to the Valuation Office, however, they were told frankly that they should not call the office.  I can understand why political interference would be guarded against by the Valuation Office at all times, but I heard this comment so many times I have to take it seriously.  Local authority officials say that there should be a role for local authorities to have more input into the process than is currently the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800006#F00400","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374139800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments, and particularly his opening remarks about our meeting.  I understand the point that he is making.  It is a very important point.  Everybody in the Valuation Office is very aware of how difficult the current environment is out there for business survival and for trading.  However, as the Deputy said, the functions of the Valuation Office are limited by the legislation under which we operate.  Our primary remit is to conduct the revaluation in accordance with the Act.  The outcome of the revaluation and measures to address or ameliorate its impact are issues of policy, as the Deputy acknowledges, which go beyond the remit of the Valuation Office.  We have no remit whatsoever in the legislation in respect of any of those issues.  Our job is to estimate the net annual value, which in real terms means the rental value.  The proposition is to figure out what the rent for a particular property would command on the statutory date if it was vacant, on the basis that the tenant would pay the rates, look after the repairs and look after the insurance.<\/p><p>  I am very interested in the comments made to the Deputy by the local authority officials, because I like to know about particular difficulties to see if we can address them.   As the process currently stands, there is a consultation period before the Commissioner of Valuation ever signs a valuation order.  There are two parties to be consulted as required by the legislation.  The first party is the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, presumably on the basis of having a policy input into whether the order should go ahead.  The second party is the local authority in question.  There is a consultation process that takes place at the very beginning.<\/p> <p>We would have had several meetings, as far as I am aware, with senior officials in the local authority.  We would also have interacted with them while we were on the ground, but to a limited extent - I acknowledge what the Deputy says - because we do not see that they have an actual input into setting the valuation levels.  I do not think that is what the Deputy is suggesting.  If there are local factors at play we are looking at and analysing rental values.  There has always been a separation of process and function in respect of the rating system in Ireland.  The valuation is intended to be an objective exercise conducted independently by a statutory office acting on foot of the evidence that is proceeding from ratepayers or from any of the other sources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800006#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374140400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>That is where the problem lies.  There is no argument there.  As Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan said, it is a technical exercise and analysis.  The difficulty is that we are living in extraordinary economic times and these businesses cannot pay.  I know that.  When there is a 1025% increase for a clothes shop that has seen its footfall decrease by 50% there is a problem.  There is a problem for Government generally.  When I raised this before in committee I said we should look at the rates arrears in this country, the amounts that have been written off.  When I asked the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government how it works from one local authority to another, there was not much of a response.  It seems to be an arbitrary, subjective issue within local authorities as to who writes off, or how they write off, particular arrears in different rateable local authorities.  There are very significant issues there.<\/p><p>  At the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform an undertaking was given to work with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to examine the legislation to see if some facilitation can be made for businesses that are in trouble and cannot sustain the kinds of increase that will result from the revaluation process.  I do not want to say too much more than that because the specifics of this have not been nailed down.  None of us can ignore the reality on the ground when it comes to the businesses about which we are speaking.<\/p><p>  The technical exercise of analysis is flawed because it does not take into account ability to pay and in many cases there is no ability to pay for some of these businesses, even though we are looking at a system that has been updated from 1988.  When an assembled group of businesses and retailers in Dungarvan recently asked one of Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s employees why they were going to be asked to pay these increases his response was, &ldquo;Because you are the ones that are left.&rdquo;  It was an unfortunate comment.  I understand why someone would say that because in many cases these are the businesses that have survived, they have cut their cloth and let employees go but they feel victimised by Government.  They think what is happening is unreal considering what has happened to their businesses and the potential down the road.<\/p><p>  A motion was sent through the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on impact assessments and I received a very good response in which the Department indicated that it will conduct an impact analysis in Waterford, which is great news.

The short answer is that it is because our analysis of the evidence put before us leads us to believe that the rental levels for retail have gone ahead of the rental levels for industrial units in relative terms.  It is that simple.  Everybody would accept that there has been a big falling-off in rents from the height of the boom down to modern levels but not all have fallen at the same rate.

To date, we have looked to see whether the results are within the expected range as to the winners and losers and to what degree they have won or lost.  A range of plus or minus 20% might be acceptable.  We examine how many are in the extreme position.  As the commissioner pointed out, we examine the extreme positions in more detail and review them.  There is an explanation in some cases.  One cannot simply look at the percentages and sometimes one must look at the absolute increase as well.  Some of them can be explained and then one is left with a small number.  One then makes a judgment based on that number and the process of representations and appeals, the time gap between the 1988 valuation and the new valuation date.

My concern is that this needs to be done in depth and in a timely manner in order to gauge the kind of impact it will have on those small businesses.

Dungarvan has an ARV which is lower than the county rate.  As a result of amalgamation and the abolition of town councils, it is expected that there will be a harmonisation - a wonderful word which means an increase - in the ARV to the county rate, potentially.  In that case, Dungarvan will move to the Waterford County Council rate.  This is a double whammy in that businesses will have to face that and then have to suffer a revaluation and an increase.  The Valuation Office impact analysis needs to take that into consideration.

Unfortunately, I found that with regard to government there is a lack of cohesion and communication and linkage to the end result which is that businesses will pay a lot more in rates and who may go out of business as a result.

The first involves the measurement and assessment of the physical dimensions of the property, and the second is the application of valuation levels in order to determine the rental rate per square metre.  The plan is to request ratepayers to undertake the measurement of the premises and convey their assessment to us.  We intend to provide considerable support in this regard.  We will have a presence in Galway City Council rating authority area, for instance, and we plan to produce a series of explanatory videos to assist ratepayers with the process.  A good deal of support is needed and will be provided.  In the meantime, we will conduct our market analysis of the rental situation, which we will provide to ratepayers.  The latter can then put the two together and provide us with a self-assessment.  To be absolutely clear, it cannot and will not be a case of write your own valuation.

At is stands, quite a lot of the delay is to do with having physically to inspect properties and do these types of calculations.  If the ratepayer can help us with that element of work, we should be able to get to a stage where we can publish lists much more quickly than heretofore.  It will allow us to address the criticism the Deputy made earlier that it is taking two years to get from the beginning to the end of the process.  The intention is to get the recycles into much tighter time lines.  At the end of the day, the basis of the valuation, as set out in the legislation, is not changing.  It is still about estimating the net annual value on a valuation date.  The Bill provides that the commissioner will be allowed to make regulations as to how the mechanics of all of this will actually work.  As we see it, there are several important points to consider.  We will, for example, have to conduct very stringent audits.  We cannot simply accept at face value the measurements and so we get back.  In fact, we must have power under the legislation to override what the ratepayer is proposing.  Ultimately, the published valuation levels will reflect assessments that have been determined by the Valuation Office and over which we can stand.  The self-assessment element is about speeding up the information-gathering process and facilitating us to analyse the correct net annual values for the rating authority area.<\/p><p>  The Deputy referred to limiting appeals and streamlining the appeal process.  The proposal in the Bill is that one of the current steps in the appeal process, namely, the appeal to the commissioner, will be removed entirely.  There is a history to this in that prior to the introduction of the 2001 Act, there was no concept of representations as they currently operate.  Representations are a relatively informal and straightforward way for the ratepayer to interact with the Valuation Office and help us to get the list right before we publish it.  After publication, as things stand, there is a right of appeal to the commissioner, which is sometimes called the first appeal.  It is essentially an internal appeal within the Valuation Office, after which the ratepayer can proceed to the tribunal if he or she remains dissatisfied with the outcome.  The proposal under the Bill is not only to retain the representations facility but to bolster it by allowing greater time for the ratepayer to interact with the Valuation Office.  The right of formal appeal to the tribunal thereafter is also retained.  It is a question of streamlining the process to address the types of time delay the Deputy mentioned.<\/p> <p>It is in all our interests to have a valuation done as quickly as possible.  There should be the shortest time possible between the date on which the order is made and date on which the valuations are published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800009#J01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374142200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I do not accept the rental value argument when it comes to retail properties versus manufacturing and industrial properties because of what I know about what is happening not only in the retail sector but also in small businesses and pubs.

The situation obtained in which the Valuation Office came up with a valuation and there was an appeal at that stage.  Prior to 1988, one could then go on and appeal to the Circuit Court from the Valuation Office.  In 1988, the valuation tribunal, which is an independent separate body, was established and that took over the role of the court.  However, there still is provision for an appeal on a specific point of law to the High Court and on afterwards to the Supreme Court, if necessary.<\/p> <p>Under the current system, post-2001, there are three possibilities of interaction.  There is the representation stage, before the certificates are made final, which is where we are at in Dublin city and Waterford.  The certificates are finalised and the list is published.  Before the Bill becomes law, there is an appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation, that is, a formal process conducted internally within the Valuation Office.  Thereafter, one may go to the tribunal and on to the High Court and the Supreme Court on a point of law.  The proposal in the Bill is that the second stage, the appeal to the commissioner, would be removed on the basis that what was introduced in 2001 and what it is proposed to enlarge in the 2012 Bill provides adequate safeguards and the supports the ratepayer needs to be able to challenge the process and get his or her point of view and information across.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800012#M06200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374144000,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Therefore, the internal appeal will probably be the first step.

As a ratepayer, I notice that businesses generally throughout the country, particularly small businesses, are in serious difficulty.  The delegation has stated the person holding the lease or the person renting the property pays the insurance and the rates.  My experience of dealing with the SME sector and its information on leases suggests leases are not worth the paper they are written on and are generally just being held together in terms of the relationship with the landlord.  The landlord is now probably paying the rates and the insurance and this is affecting the level of rent, which is becoming increasingly lower.  This is a feature of the marketplace that the delegates must have discovered in their interaction with the sector, regardless of the county.  Will the witnesses comment on this?<\/p><p>  The office has stated the make-up of the rent, leases, etc., on a street is identified.  What about the streets in every city and county on which there are but a few shops open and quite a number of premises on which no rent or rates are being paid?  How is this factored in to the office's evaluation of the businesses on such a street?<\/p><p>  With regard to the subsequent occupier clause, whereby a new tenant becomes responsible for the previous tenant's unpaid rates, it is causing a problem throughout the country because it is making properties more difficult to rent.  The issue of previous tenants' rates not having been paid is beginning to emerge and becoming a problem in every county.<\/p><p>  Will the witnesses address these three issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800014#O00800","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374144600,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Consider my comment on the tenant paying the rent and insurance and for repairs and the maintenance of the building.  It has more to do with the fact that our definition of net annual value, as defined in the Valuation Act, assumes that the rent is the amount left after the tenant pays these outgoings.  If I am told the rent payer is paying &euro;100 per week and that, in addition, the landlord is paying the insurance and rates and maintaining the building, we would say that, under our definition of value, the &euro;100 per week is not the rent.  It is a figure less than this and we have to adjust it to reflect these outgoings.<\/p><p>  I agree with the Chairman on the reality of the marketplace; however, in terms of our deciding what a value is, it is not gross value that the landlord gets but essentially the net rent.  That is our definition of value.  Therefore, when we publish our new valuations in places such as Waterford, for example, and Limerick next year, we will actually be publishing the net annual value or net rental value.  That is the rental value we are putting on the property.<\/p><p>  Vacant properties on streets present a valuation challenge, about which there is no doubt.  Sometimes there is an extreme where there is so much vacant property on a street that it actually affects all values on that street.  Generally, thus far our experience is that we do obtain rental information and it is a question of analysing it when we get it and making the judgment call.<\/p><p>  On the third point to which the Chairman referred which concerns the subsequent occupier, sometimes the clause will lead to a property being vacant.  If one examines a number of properties on a street and asks why they are vacant, it may be a factor.  We receive additional information from the stamp duty people, etc., but it is much more challenging for valuers in a recession to value property because many market incentives and other factors must be accounted for by the valuers.  During the Celtic tiger period leases were much more standard, as were letting agreements.  Now we find they are bespoke.  However, that is a challenge to our valuers.  Ultimately, they must stand back and decide what property would be let for on the market, assuming it is vacant to let and the tenant is paying rent knowing that he or she must insure and maintain the building and pay the rates.  That is the statutory definition of value.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800014#O00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Lavelle"},{"type":"speech","time":1374144600,"counter":349,"content":"<p>On the third point, I do not believe Mr. Lavelle answered the question.

When applying the \"rate in the pound\", as it was known by the councillors, or the county manager in bringing forward his or her rate every year, there is unevenness across the country.<\/p> <p>Some counties have increased it continually over those years, while others, for competitive purposes, did not increase it or kept the level lower than what might even be the national norm.  Therefore, there is a very uneven playing field which might create competitive tension between, for example, my neighbouring county of Waterford and Kilkenny, or Carlow in the other direction.<\/p><p> How does Ms McLaughlin plan to even out that field after the valuation is done?  How will she go about reducing the rate in the pound that was applied over the years to give a reasonable, even rate across the country?  That is where part of the problem lies.  <\/p><p> My second point is that while one has the local government valuation authority discussing this, one should also have the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation discussing it.  After one squeezes the situation in business and reduces one's costs, the only cost one cannot adjust is that of rates.  That cost is closing businesses down whether they are on an industrial estate or on the high street.  Rates constitute the biggest challenge that businesses face in keeping their doors open.  We are not taking rates seriously enough and are not reacting quickly enough to give businesses that lifeline to stay in business.<\/p><p> Ms McLaughlin heard from Deputy O'Donnell about Limerick and from Deputy Deasy about Waterford.

It is designed to provide speedy and flexible assistance to people who do not qualify for other scheme payments or who are awaiting decisions on claim applications under other income support schemes.  Supplementary welfare was formerly administered by the community welfare Services division of the HSE on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  In October 2011, the community welfare staff transferred to the Department, which now has direct responsibility for scheme administration.<\/p><p>  The assistance available consists of basic income support and a range of payments to cover certain living expenses that claimants may not be able to meet including urgent and exceptional needs payments.  Rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement are also elements of supplementary welfare.  Together with basic income support, these account for more than 80% of supplementary welfare expenditure.  These are the three elements covered in the report before the committee today.<\/p><p>  Each category of supplementary welfare examined has distinct target groups albeit with some overlaps.  In effect, they are different schemes administered within a common organisation structure.  Due to the different scheme risks and claimant profiles, the report recommended that the Department should treat them as separate schemes and that separate control policies should be developed for each.<\/p><p>  Three out of every four claims for basic income support relate to people who are awaiting decisions on applications under primary schemes such as jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance.  Expenditure on basic supplementary income support in 2011 was &euro;169 million after recoupment of around &euro;137 million from other schemes.  The Department's policy is to check interim supplementary welfare claims weekly.  The report recommended that an automated link should be established to trigger an immediate review of a claimant's basic supplementary income payment when a decision is made on an application under another scheme.  This should ensure that when decisions are made about the primary scheme applications, appropriate action is also taken promptly on supplementary income support including any required recoupment of interim payments.<\/p><p>  Rent supplement is an additional payment available under certain conditions to tenants in private rented accommodation who are in receipt of any social welfare or HSE payment or are on low incomes.  It is not restricted to those on supplementary income support.  Expenditure on rent supplement in 2011 was over &euro;500 million.  Almost 100,000 households were in receipt of support at end year.  While rent supplement was originally intended as a short-term support, many recipients depend on the scheme over the medium to long term.  At the end of 2011, more than half of the dependent households were in receipt of rent supplement for a year or more.  The duration of claims may be understated because claimants who change address may in some cases be recorded as new claims.  It would be preferable to measure the duration of claims based on length of household claim rather than length of tenancy.  The Department sets maximum eligible rent rates for the scheme by reference to the location of the property and the composition of the claimant's household.  In contrast, rents in the market are set by reference to property type.  For risk management purposes, it was recommended that the Department develop its scheme management system to record and analyse expenditure by household composition and the type and location of accommodation rented.  <\/p><p>  A review carried out by the Department in 2011 estimated that the rent supplement scheme was funding about 40% of all households in the private rental sector.  Analysis indicates that the maximum rent limits set by the Department have a significant influence on the rental market with evidence of many landlords using the rent supplement limits as benchmarks in setting rental prices in the respective areas.  As a result, the Department has potential to influence the residential rental market to a significant degree.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is also a significant market player through the rental accommodation scheme.  The Department carries out reviews of the maximum rent limits about every 18 months.  A review carried out at the end of 2011 resulted in reductions to the rent limits in almost all locations reflecting market decline in rents.  I understand that another market-based review has recently been completed resulting in further adjustments to rent limits.<\/p><p>  Controls are required to verify the accuracy of rental amounts paid by claimants because these determine the level of rent supplement that may be payable.  Scheme guidelines require claimants to provide evidence of their tenancy and of the amount of rent being paid but the examination found that such evidence was not on file in 80% of sample cases examined.  The Accounting Officer stated that additional staff training would be provided on the proper maintenance of records and that powers of enquiry have recently been granted to appropriate staff to request and oblige landlords to provide information in respect of rent supplement tenants.<\/p><p>  The Department rarely refuses to pay rent supplement on the grounds that the accommodation is not to an acceptable standard.  Staff administering the rent supplement scheme are not required to make a judgement on whether accommodation is of a suitable standard as they are not qualified to do so.  Staff can refuse to pay rent supplement where the Department has been notified by a local authority that the relevant accommodation standards are not being complied with.  If a notification relates to an existing claimant, the situation is discussed with the claimant and the Department staff attempt to act in the claimant's best interest.  Home visits by staff provide evidence that the claimant is living at the address they have stated and can also be used to assess the standard of accommodation and its suitability for the claimant's needs.  In two local offices visited, the examination team found very different approaches to the conduct of home visits.  In the Bishop's Square office in Dublin, all 15 cases examined had a home visit at claim award stage.  In contrast, the examination found that 14 of the 15 rent supplement claims examined in Galway had never been the subject of a home visit either when the claim was put into payment or at a later review stage.<\/p><p>  The discrepancy between offices in the home visit rates is striking and may reflect different legacy approaches taken in HSE regions.  Given the level of expenditure incurred and the vulnerability of many of those dependent on welfare assistance, it is important to ensure that accommodation of an acceptable standard is provided.  For that reason, the report recommends that occasional home visits to rent supplement recipients should be undertaken.  In cases where deficiencies in the standard of accommodation are evident, the Department staff should refer the accommodation to the relevant local authority for inspection.  Results of such referrals should be monitored and taken into account in reviews of claims.<\/p><p>  Mortgage interest supplement is paid to assist eligible households with the interest portion of their mortgage repayments.  The number of claimants increased from around 3,700 in 2007 to 18,700 in 2011.  Expenditure in 2011 was around &euro;67 million.  A review published by the Department in July 2010 confirmed that the overall objective of the mortgage interest supplement scheme remained valid but recommended a number of changes.  Legislation enacted in June 2012 provided that applicants must have secured alternative payment arrangements with lenders for at least 12 months prior to applying for mortgage supplement.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee in respect of other changes to the scheme and their impact on eligibility and expenditure levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800017#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1374146100,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I invite Ms O'Donoghue to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800017#R00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374146100,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to make a brief opening statement.  I understand that the committee wishes to examine the chapter on supplementary welfare allowance in the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report for 2011.  As requested, I provided the committee with an update on the conclusions contained in this chapter.<\/p><p>  In 2013, the Department will spend &euro;20.243 billion on a wide range of schemes, services and administration.  It is estimated that almost &euro;718 million will be spent on supplementary welfare allowance schemes this year.  The committee will be aware that there have been significant changes in the management and administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme within the last two years with the transfer of the community welfare service and some 1,000 staff from the HSE to the Department on 1 October 2011.<\/p><p>  As chapter 24 of the Comptroller's annual report confirms, the total scheme expenditure on supplementary welfare allowance in 2011 was &euro;911 million.  As the committee will see from the material I have provided, the provisional outturn figure for the scheme for 2012 is &euro;787 million.  I and my staff in the Department are very aware of the responsibility we carry in ensuring the proper disbursement of Government funding.<\/p> <p>Supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, is an important \"safety net\" within the overall welfare system.  It is aimed at persons whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance to persons in need who do not qualify for welfare payments under any other State scheme.  This can take the form of basic income support, supplementary payments or exceptional needs payments in respect of certain living expenses a person may not currently be able to meet.  Given the nature of the payments and that the people seeking payment may be in difficult situations, the Department can operate discretion, as set out in the legislation, regarding these payments.<\/p><p> The chapter focused on control within the overall scheme and covered the three main areas of basic income support, rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement.  I will provide an update to the committee on each of these three areas.<\/p><p> Basic SWA or BASI, as it is known, may be payable to customers awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment.  In 2011, expenditure on this scheme was &euro;174 million in respect of more than 34,000 customers.  Expenditure increased marginally to &euro;179 million in 2012 in respect of 32,000 customers.  The Department has introduced a number of measures which, when combined, reduce the recourse to BASI.  This can be evidenced by a drop of more than 2,200 in the numbers on the scheme in the 12 months ending December 2012.  The numbers on the scheme have continued to drop by almost a further 4,600 to a total of 27,800 in 2013.<\/p><p> One of the key measures is the new Intreo service, which is currently being rolled out across the Department's local offices on a phased basis.  This new service integrates employment and income supports and provides for a streamlined and personalised service to clients in accessing job opportunities and availing of supports to enable them to get back to work at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Intreo centres also include a single integrated decision-making team that integrates and streamlines the processes formerly undertaken by the different agencies, including the community welfare service, which has been amalgamated into the Department.  The benefits of the integrated decisions process are already visible in terms of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary payments in the 28 offices where integrated decisions are now in operation.  It will be extended to the remaining offices as quickly as possible this year.<\/p><p> Rent supplement provides short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Expenditure on this scheme in 2011 was &euro;503 million in respect of almost 97,000 customers.  There was a significant reduction of &euro;80 million in the scheme in 2012 over that in 2011 yielding significant savings to the Exchequer while maintaining the demanded levels of service.  This reduction can be attributed to a number of factors including a reduction of more than 9,000 customers, saving &euro;25 million, an increase in the customers' minimum contribution they are obliged to pay, saving &euro;35 million, and a reduction in the maximum rent limits available under the scheme, saving &euro;20 million.<\/p><p> As the Department currently funds almost 30% of the private rented sector, it is essential that State support for rents are continually kept under review and reflect current market conditions in a balanced way.  A review process is undertaken every 18 months to ensure value for money is achieved while, at the same time, ensuring people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  The Department has recently completed the 2013 review with revised limits being put in place from 17 June 2013 up to December 2014.  The recent review broadly reflects the new market trends with rises in counties Dublin and Galway and the majority of rural counties falling.  In terms of policy, the aim is to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long-term housing need from this Department to housing authorities using a new housing assistance payment, HAP, and to return rent supplement to its original objective, which is the provision of short-term income support to those who have become temporarily unemployed.  Officials in the Department are working closely with those in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to give effect to this transfer.<\/p><p> Mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  Expenditure on this scheme in 2011 was &euro;68 million in respect of almost 19,000 customers.  In 2012, expenditure on the scheme was reduced to &euro;55 million which can be attributed to a number of factors, including an increase in the customers' minimum contribution and a reduction of more than 4,300 customers.  The drop in customers can be attributed to a change in the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  Budget 2012 provided for the curtailment of access to the mortgage interest supplement scheme for the first 12 months the person is involved in the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP.  This process acknowledges that it is in the interest of both the lender and the borrower to address financial difficulties as speedily and effectively as circumstances allow.<\/p><p> As a Department, we have restructured and transformed our organisation with colleagues from a number of different organisations, including the community welfare service, bringing their unique insights and experiences to the work of the new DSP organisation.  Once again I would like to express my own gratitude to all the staff across the Department who work hard every day. These are changing and challenging times for us and, in particular, for our customers who depend on us.  The role of the community welfare service and the objectives of the SWA scheme are compatible with the goals and objectives of the Department.  My colleagues and I continue to strive to provide income support and employment and activation services support particularly to those most in need while continuing to ensure the controls in place minimise incidents of fraud and error.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800017#R00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374146700,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Can I publish Ms O'Donoghue's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800018#S00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374146700,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800018#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1374146700,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms O'Donoghue and her colleagues.

The economic downturn, which began in 2008, caused huge problems for, and placed huge demands on, the social welfare system across all its schemes and services. That peaked in 2010 and 2011.  Many of the schemes we provide are demand-led and, therefore, if somebody meets the eligibility criteria, he or she qualifies for payment.  It is not a question of the scheme being budget capped.  The person who meets the eligibility criteria will receive the payment involved.  In 2010 and 2011, because of process difficulties the Department experienced across a wide range of primary scheme areas, there was increased recourse to supplementary welfare payments.  That demand not alone translated into claims on our primary schemes but also to claims for BASI payments while people awaited a decision on their primary payment.<\/p> <p>The big change over the last couple of years, particularly this year, is that, as we have got our act together in regard to claim processing within the Department, this means there are speedier decisions, so people who are entitled to be paid the primary payment are now receiving it more quickly.  As a consequence, they do not have to make a claim for supplementary welfare payment to bridge a gap while that decision is being made.  That is the kind of big change that has happened.<\/p><p> In regard to rent supplement, particularly over the last year there have been changes in the contributions people have to make to rent supplement, and that has generated savings for the Exchequer.  However, it has meant there has been more responsibility on the individual to contribute to their housing need.  There has also been a significant movement in the last 18 months of people from rent supplement into the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which has reduced the numbers there.  From about the middle of 2012 onwards, there has been a stabilisation and a reduction of in jobseeker claims, but as the numbers on those payments has reduced, their entitlement to claim rent supplement has also reduced.  That is accounted for by a number of different factors, including the fact there are fewer people in receipt of jobseeker's payments.  It could be that people who had previously migrated into Ireland to work have now migrated back home, and they are not relying on either getting a welfare payment or rent supplement here.<\/p><p> That is the general picture.  As I said, one would need to look at this over a four-year period to see how it peaked and has now begun to stabilise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800018#S00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374147300,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I can accept any of those scenarios, which are extremely plausible.

We are dealing with this on the ground every day of the week.  The vast majority of people getting social welfare payments go about it in the normal way.  Many of them are struggling and are under an awful lot of pressure.  However, there are abuses of the system.  For example, 84,000 people were on rent supplement at the end of June this year.  What is the average length of time a person is on rent supplement?  Is it six months, a year, two years or three years?<\/p><p>  The majority of people on rent supplement are totally above board but have fallen on difficult times.  However, there is a very small cohort of people who crop up all the time - I am sure it is the same in every constituency - and they move from house to house.  The landlords are as culpable as the tenants because they are renting dives and hovels.  These people wreak havoc when they move into a neighbourhood.  We cannot pull the rent supplement because it is not our role.  We are making a payment to the tenant; we are only a conduit providing the funding to pay the rent.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why the rent is not paid directly to the landlord, so he or she is held in some way accountable.<\/p><p>  As Ms O'Donoghue is probably well aware, RAS has, by and large, worked for myriad reasons.  Invariably, there are proper controls and the houses are of a very good standard.  However, a small group causes untold havoc with the rent supplement scheme.  The same names crop up all the time.  It is unfair to the reputation of the scheme and to the people availing of it and it gives them a bad name.  I have a major problem with that.  For some reason, they appear to be able to abuse the scheme.  I have no doubt this is nothing new to Ms O'Donoghue and she has heard it before but it appears to continue.  One could pull rent supplement based on perhaps Garda reports and one could pay the rent supplement directly to the landlord.  Something must be done.  Is this new to Ms O'Donoghue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800025#Z00600","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374150900,"counter":516,"content":"<p>The scheme has grown beyond its objective, which was a short-term income support.

For the general public and for the vast majority of people who are claiming social welfare in the normal way, it does them a disservice.  There is a perception that we have not got to grips with fraud.  I would like to hear someone on the airwaves from the Department of Social Protection at assistant secretary level, who is heading up fraud, saying it is great if people are complying with the terms laid down.<\/p><p>  However, side by side with the ordinary person who is on basic social welfare and who is barely getting by, there is an abuse of the system in various areas.  Where people engage in anti-social behaviour and move from house to house, through rent supplement, and terrorise neighbours, that is an abuse of the system and it must be stopped.  I would have thought the wherewithal was in Ms O'Donoghue's Department.<\/p><p>  The CWOs do great work on the ground but they are curtailed in what they can do.  I have brought this up before and I will do so again.  When one gets a representation that there is a problem with a particular house, the occupant of which is in receipt of rent supplement, the Department could bring in the person and contact the landlord to ask what is going on.  If the garda&iacute; have been called, account could be taken of that and the rent supplement could be withdrawn until such time as the person agrees to normal standards of behaviour.  I do not think that is too much to ask.  Perhaps I am different from other colleagues, but I am hearing that it is an ongoing problem and that it never seems to go away.  With a small amount of goodwill and effort by the Department at local level, in terms of the procedural rules, it would make a difference to the operation of the rent supplement scheme on the ground for a tiny cohort but it would have major positive ramifications for people living in those areas.  Will Ms O'Donoghue look into that matter? <\/p><p>  It is something about which I feel strongly because it comes up so often.  Side by side with that is the extremely important matter of ensuring landlords are not letting houses under the rent supplement scheme which are hugely substandard.  Once again, there is a commonality between the landlords and the tenants.  The same landlords crop up as do the same tenants.  It is just too frequent.

They will be left on the former rent supplement scheme unless the Department provides for certain controls, for example, by holding over or withdrawing the rent supplement.  I accept that the Department does that on some occasions.  When that happens, the tenant and the landlord should be pulled in and the Garda reports should be taken into account.  People are perfectly entitled to stay on so long as they behave by normal standards, but that is not what is happening.  Can I take it that the Department will look at that?  The housing assistance payments scheme, which is a variation on the rental assistance scheme, will end up being taken over and looked after by the local authorities, rather than by the Department.

I think the Department has been engaged in quarterly meetings with the troika.  We have serviced those meetings along with our colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and other Departments.  There is a significant engagement by the Department every time the troika comes to visit.  Three different areas are generally discussed as part of that.  The first area of focus is the financial outlook for social welfare expenditure, which accounts for such a substantial element of Government expenditure.  It involves an examination of whether what is actually happening on the ground mirrors what had been estimated or projected to happen.  That process relates not only to social welfare expenditure, but also to PRSI income because that is the other side of the coin in terms of social welfare expenditure.  The second area of focus tends to relate to activation measures and the commitments that were made in Pathways to Work.  That process, which gives rise to a great deal of discussion of what might be possible, involves looking at trends in the live register and some of the issues I mentioned earlier in response to Deputy McDonald, such as the institutional reform that is required to bring the organisations and the services together in order to roll out the Intreo programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800026#AA01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1374151500,"counter":539,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013071800026#AA01800","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374151500,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Part of that requirement involves bringing together an integrated service and rolling it out in an holistic way to customers.

Reference has been made to the question of whether the best way to make sure courses are designed to meet the demand we are seeing from our customers is to focus on community employment or to develop links with SOLAS and the educational training boards.  All of that is in the activation space.  There is a great deal of interest in that.  There have been many detailed discussions about what we are positioned to do, what we are capable of doing, what our plans are and whether we are achieving the targets we have set out to achieve.  The third area of focus tends to relate to the question of structural changes in the social welfare system.  There has been a particular focus on payments to people of working age.

In some areas of the country there was no history or track record of exceptional needs payments being made for these, but in others modest or large payments were made.  The group then came up with a view as to what might be appropriate and this was rolled out in 2012.

However, let us get as much done as we can.  I am in the Chairman's hands.<\/p> <p>I can speak for an hour on the Common Agricultural Policy, or I can give a five to seven-minute outline of what has been achieved, after which we can have questions and answers.  Most committee members have a reasonable idea of what was agreed.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and others have tabled detailed parliamentary questions to which they have received replies.<\/p><p> If one were stopped on the street and asked what are the big ideas in this CAP reform, one could probably sum it up under three broad themes: environmental protection, generational change and an open market for food production and agriculture.  The reform guarantees a minimum level of environmental protection, which for the first time is enshrined in direct payments under Pillar 1.  A total of 30% of a farmer's payment is directly linked to qualifying for a greening payment.  We have discussed the greening criteria previously; these include protecting permanent pasture, guaranteeing crop diversity and having an ecological focus area on farms, particularly arable farms.  This contains a series of flexibilities which will mean the vast majority of farms in Ireland will automatically qualify for the greening payment.  It has been designed predominantly for other countries which have very large arable areas with no hedgerows.  There will be an impact for Irish farmers, particularly arable farmers - not in an overly onerous way, but farmers will have to adapt somewhat to qualify for a greening payment.  It is good to have an environmental benchmark above which everybody must be.  The greening of the CAP and guaranteeing a basic level of environmental standards are enshrined for the first time under Pillar 1.<\/p><p> Generational change in farming is a very Irish issue.  We are now openly and on a mandatory basis requiring countries to positively discriminate in favour of young farmers.  They will receive a top-up to Pillar 1 payments of 25% on the first 32 hectares, which is the average farm size, which is similar to an installation aid scheme through Pillar 1.  This will be available for five years to a farmer under the age of 40.  Only 6% of farmers in the European Union are under the age of 35 and, with regard to young farmers owning and managing their own farms, this is no basis for an innovative, growing sector.  Getting young people into agriculture and farming has never been as much of a priority as it is now under Pillar 1, and as an option under Pillar 2.<\/p><p> The reform will also move food production and agriculture to a more open-market approach.  The world and Europe need more food and we need to find a way of producing it sustainably and competitively, while at the same time having market interventions when necessary if there is a collapse in price.  Such interventions are now more focused on providing a safety net for farmers in response to a crisis rather than managing markets and prices on a monthly or annual basis.  This is good from an Irish perspective because we are quite competitive in producing beef, milk and sheepmeat.  This theme is reflected in the removal of dairy quotas in April 2015 and the removal of sugar quotas in 2017.<\/p><p> Moving towards a competitive and more market-oriented approach to food production is also reflected in how we propose to redistribute single farm payments to allow farmers with the capacity to produce the most food to retain higher payments than farmers who do not have this capacity because of their land or where they farm, while at the same time recognising that the gap between these needs to close.  It is not sustainable to have one farmer earning &euro;80 per hectare and another farmer next door, or in the same country, earning &euro;800 per hectare.  This is why we have agreed to have flexibility in the redistribution of single farm payments, which was the big issue in the debate in Ireland.  Every farmer asked what he or she would get under the new CAP versus what he or she received previously.  Approximately 50,000 farmers in Ireland will lose some of their payment in the redistribution and just over 60,000 farmers in Ireland will gain.  The average losses will be between 11% and 12% while the average gain will be approximately 35%, but this will happen gradually over a seven-year period.  There will be no dramatic shocks to the system in terms of farmers losing a lot of money in a short period of time, which would have set Ireland back significantly in meeting the targets under the Food Harvest 2020 plan, to which the Government and the previous Government were and are committed.<\/p><p> My objective was to ensure that we moved from the Commission's position, which would have resulted in a dramatic shock to the system in Ireland which would have been felt immediately because 40% of the move towards flat-rate area-based payments would have happened in the first year.  In fact, it would have been much more than this when one added the greening payment, as it was proposed, and the other proposals.  It would have meant that approximately 60% of the change would have happened in the first year.  The proposals changed dramatically over the past 12 months, and we now have flexibility which will bring about a more gradual redistribution, while the amounts being redistributed are less but still quite significant.<\/p><p> At present farmers are on &euro;50 to &euro;70 per hectare, but after this change nobody will be on less than the minimum payment of 60% of the average, which we anticipate will be between &euro;145 and &euro;150 per hectare or slightly less.  We have the option, if we wish, to set a maximum payment per hectare.  With regard to the idea of somebody being on &euro;50 per hectare while somebody else is on &euro;1,200 per hectare, after this reform no farmer will be on less than &euro;145 to &euro;150 per hectare and, if we choose, there may be no farmers on more than &euro;600 to &euro;700 per hectare either.  We have this choice and flexibility.  By any standards this is a dramatic change to what existed previously in terms of the huge differential between low earners and high earners in direct payments.<\/p><p> I could spend a long time speaking about this flexibility.  I understand we have provided quite a lot of information to committee members, which they have been able to read through.  In essence, the key issues for Ireland, and the key decisions we need to make, are that we need to finalise how we use the toolbox for which we fought hard.  Everything we sought, we got.  We obtained a reasonable minimum payment at a reasonable level and flexibility on a voluntary basis in a series of other issues under Pillar 1.  If we wish we can reintroduce coupled payments if we have vulnerable sectors we wish to support, such as protein crops, suckler beef or sheep.  I would like the views of committee members on this, not necessarily today but during the consultation period.  We can set a maximum payment if we wish.  We must set a minimum payment.<\/p> <p>We can transfer up to 15% of the money between Pillars 1 and 2 or take a series of other actions, but we must prioritise young farmers and set aside money in a national reserve to prioritise new entrants and to top up those who have done badly out of the system through no fault of their own.  We must provide up to 1% for a crisis reserve that farmers will get back if it is not spent.  The model that I was seeking is now available to us, in that there will be a fair redistribution of the single farm payment.<\/p><p> We have broad options under Pillar 2.  Much consultation is necessary on the priorities that we are being asked to support, such as innovation, climate change, the environment and young farmers.  I hope it will allow us to maintain some of the existing schemes that we view as being valuable while replacing others with new schemes that are more effective in responding to the challenges of modern agriculture.<\/p><p> The budget under Pillar 1 will be similar, albeit with a 3.3% reduction, whereas the reduction under Pillar 2 will be more significant.  We will go from approximately &euro;350 million per year in European supports to approximately &euro;313 million.  On average, this is approximately 53% co-funding.  As such, we will have less money to spend on rural development.  We must be more targeted.  I would be open to people's opinions in this regard.  We have already started a public consultation process on the matter.  We want to hear from farming organisations in writing and verbally.  If the committee chooses to do so, it can contribute as well.  If individuals wish to express their opinions to me in person, we can discuss them publicly or privately.<\/p><p> My only objective in putting together a new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, for Ireland for the next seven years is to do what is best for Irish agriculture as a whole.  Some farmers will not like this system, but the objective is to make decisions that, on balance, are the right ones for Irish agriculture and have two aims: first, to fulfil the promise of Food Harvest 2020 in terms of expansion and the potential of Irish agriculture and land to produce more food sustainably; and, second, to protect vulnerable areas and farmers who do not have the capacity for expansion through the provision of the supports needed to keep family farms intact.  These twin objectives have been the Government's goals since taking office.  They will be the guiding objectives as we put CAP together for Ireland, now that we have a broad range of flexibilities from which to choose.<\/p><p> Those members who know me and have spoken to me about this issue have a fair idea of the kinds of area we will pursue.  We are in a good place versus where we were 12 months ago.  We need to move on, listen to people about what they want for agriculture and why they want it and make informed decisions early in the autumn so that this process is not allowed to drag on forever.  We need to have all our decisions made by the end of the year so that we can allow the system to prepare for implementation in January 2015.  My Department will need to put software, inspection and payment systems in place to ensure we can implement Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 of a new CAP from that time onwards.  A full 12 months will be necessary for these preparations and to allow us to inform farmers of what they must do to ensure that the overall system works seamlessly.<\/p><p> My timescale on Pillar 1 is to make decisions in early autumn.  Since the consultation on Pillar 2 will take longer, we will try to finalise decisions by the end of the year.  I suspect that we will have a number of committee meetings on the details before then.  I do not propose to supply exact answers today as to what options we will adopt.  Instead, I will provide details on the process by which we will make the decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800003#B00300","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374137100,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for outlining where we stand.

The Minister stated that he did not want any dramatic shock.  The first day this issue was discussed, I stated that the changes should be introduced over time.  There have been dramatic shocks for farmers in the past five years while we and the Minister were in government.  For many farmers, rural environment protection scheme, REPS, payments exceeded the single farm payment and the disadvantaged area payment combined.  When it came to an abrupt end and was replaced by the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, many people could not access any scheme, resulting in a significant loss to farmers in every county who had been receiving substantial REPS payments.

There have already been dramatic shocks that we need to address.  It is good that a minimum payment was included, but my understanding is that &euro;103 million must be realised as a result.  The Minister has been working on figures, so I will work on the 2010 numbers on the basis of which the &euro;103 million figure is calculated.  They do not include deductions for young farmers, the national reserve, etc.  We are discussing redistribution.<\/p><p>  The next question is how to remove the money from farmers above the national average.  We are not discussing something that will happen in 2015, but the endgame in 2019.  There must be objective reasons for taking money from one group versus another.  The system must be as objectively fair as possible by 2019.<\/p><p>  The Minister has made available figures on stocking density per hectare - this is a fair reflection of productivity and is the best we will get - for everyone but tillage farmers.  Using this as a measure, we should try to bring farmers in a similar output category - as we do not know individual outputs, we cannot work on that basis - to the same level of payment by 2019.  There is no reason to pay someone more in 2019 just because he or she received many grants in 2000.  It would be more logical to connect payment to average output per hectare of the relevant cohort.  This would lead to a fairer single payment system, as the current system is riddled with inconsistencies and there is no relationship between productivity and euro per hectare.  This is important, as many farmers in the 350-450 ha bracket are productive.  I do not know why they should be penalised because of history as opposed to a rational reason.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister confirm whether regionalisation is off the agenda?<\/p> <p>Will he also confirm whether he is considering the single farm payment coefficient as regards different types of land?  An acre would not be counted as an acre and a hectare would not be counted as a hectare.<\/p><p> My understanding is that the greening payment is for carrying out greening activities.  Will the Minister relate that payment to something that farmers used to get or will it be made relative to the amount of greening activity they must undertake?  If all farmers must go to the same amount of greening effort, will they get the same payment per hectare?  Alternatively, will someone who used to get a large payment get more under this scheme even though he or she might be less green than someone in receipt of a lower payment?  This is an important issue.<\/p><p> There is so much to discuss, but I will not delay the meeting for long, as this is our first cut at it.  Optional provisions include the prevention of land abandonment and compensation for specific advantages.  Is it intended to consider these for payment under the national reserve?  For example, land abandonment could become a major issue in certain areas.<\/p><p> The battle in the next six years will be about the prices that farmers get.  Unless we pay farmers adequately for the food they produce and unless they make a profit from production as opposed to the single payment, it will be impossible to reach the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  In many sectors, farmers' prices are being squeezed and there are no margins in their activities.  If this persists, the consequences for agriculture could be disastrous.  This issue must be put at the top of the European and Irish agendas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800005#D00600","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374137700,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.

If we had not achieved that deal, we would have been in serious difficulties going forward.  It is important now to try to make the best of it and achieve as much as possible.  <\/p><p> The Minister might refer to the reference year, which was a key issue for Ireland in the negotiations.  The issue was raised at this committee on numerous occasions.  I would like to think that in some way it fell into the final decision.  When is the final decision on the reference year likely to be made?<\/p><p> Another big issue, which arises on a regular basis and which has become topical again in recent days, is the inspection regime in the whole system.  I very much appreciate that when one is in receipt of large amounts of taxpayers' money there is justification for it, but there is a perception, whether right or wrong, that we are over-inspected in some areas.  Could that be looked at or could a protocol be put in place so that people know exactly what is happening in advance of inspections?<\/p><p> We are heading into a new regime with regard to the payments system.  As the Minister said, a new IT system has been put in place.  There is the issue of bureaucracy and more paperwork.  Are we starting from a green-field site, so to speak, in regard to the new application process?  When the single farm payment began approximately 20 years ago, very complicated and detailed work had to be done.  In recent years, it has become easier, and it can now be done online in a few minutes if there are no real changes from year to year.  Will this new process create difficulties?  As everybody knows, all most farmers want to do is farm, but obviously there is paperwork to be done.  If it gets very complicated and messy, people get turned off.  Will there be an easy system in order to qualify?<\/p><p> We have the single farm payment and a greening payment.  Will two separate applications be required, for example?  Will it be a matter of ticking boxes?  We are probably at too early a stage to decide, but will it just be a matter of ticking boxes in order to qualify for the greening payment or whatever the case may be?<\/p><p> A key element, which must be welcomed, is the mandatory top-ups for young farmers.  The Minister said that 6% of farmers in the EU were under 35 years of age.  That is a major issue which must be addressed and I hope this will address it.  It may not be just a matter for CAP, but there must be an incentive for farmers at the other end of the scale to move on or to pass the farm to younger farmers.  <\/p><p> One of the key elements, which must be remembered, is that as a result of what we have got, productive farmers have been protected as much as possible.  We need to achieve the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  If we had achieved only part of what we achieved and what the Commissioner proposed in October and November 2011 - the flat rate system - our chances of achieving the Food Harvest 2020 targets would have been minimal.  While the nuts and bolts need to be sorted out, the fact the productive farmer has been protected is important, as is the fact that there is flexibility to ensure farmers can get extra payments for whatever they may lose.  <\/p><p> The consultation process in which the Minister went around the country selling his idea of the approximation model was a very worthwhile exercise.  His timescale might be tighter on this occasion but he might consider a similar process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800006#E01900","speaker":"968","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374138300,"counter":717,"content":"<p>Many of the issues I wanted to ask about have been dealt with.  Our own group had a meeting with the Minister when he came back from Brussels with the deal and I said I would hold a public meeting in my area, which I did.  I was asked specific questions which I e-mailed to the Minister's officials.  The biggest issue arising is land.  The land system in Ireland is very complicated, whether the land is leased, rented or owned, as is the transfer of land and the transfer of entitlements.  I do not know whether the Minister or his officials are expert enough to deal with specific issues.  I would welcome a meeting with somebody who is an expert in that area because we all have specific issues in regard to land which has no entitlements.  Does that receive the minimum payment now?  Who owns the entitlements to land that is leased?  Is it the owner or the farmer who has been farming it for the past seven or five years?  I do not want to go into specifics but I would welcome it if the Minister would make an official available to the committee to go through aspects such as that.  We would all be better informed, because those are the questions we are being asked.<\/p><p>  I welcome the measures in regard to young farmers.  If we are to achieve the Food Harvest 2020 targets, we must make a big issue of getting more young people involved in farming.  I agree with Deputy Deering that we will have to provide an incentive at the other end to try to get people to move out of, or to retire from, farming and let younger people take over.  I do not know whether it could be done through Pillar 2, but we should look at a scheme.  <\/p><p>  I will welcome the consultation process and I hope this committee will play a very active role in it.  I was very alarmed last week to see a headline in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i> stating that penalties are up by 500% in the past three or four years.  That is frightening people.  It is easy to forget, given the weather we have had over the past three weeks, that farming has had its toughest 18 months, and to see a headline like that and money being taken from people is frightening.  I know there is the issue of cross-compliance and so on, but a headline like that does not do any good.  With a new scheme coming in, we must ensure it is farmer-friendly in terms of how one applies for it and how one stays within the guidelines.  If it is too complicated, it will frustrate people and their livelihoods could be affected if they face penalties.  When the new scheme is devised, it should be farmer-friendly in regard to how farmers must comply with everything.  We should not get tied up in bureaucracy and red tape.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800007#F00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1374138300,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I agree with the last thing Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, which was that we need to work to ensure farmers get the best price they can for their animals.  We have been doing that.  We now have the highest price ever being paid for milk.  Over the past five or six months, we have had pretty high beef prices also.  The way in which we do that is to support farmers, to ensure we have the maximum demand for Irish products, to protect our reputation as we did during the horse meat crisis, and to open up live export markets when we can to provide competition, which we have been doing, with boats going to Libya.  Discussions are taking place as to whether we might be able to export live cattle to the UK, because UK prices for beef are the highest in Europe.<\/p><p>  We are doing what we can to work the market to ensure Irish produce is sold into premium markets and that Irish farmers get the highest value they can.  However, farmers need to respond to that too, with more farmers entering into the beef quality assurance scheme and the lamb quality assurance scheme.  Approximately 80% of the beef produced in Ireland is under the quality assurance mark while approximately 50% of sheep and lamb meat is.  There is no reason a farmer should not be operating out of that quality assurance scheme.  That helps us all to market Irish meat as the best in Europe from the point of view of quality, safety, animal husbandry, environmental controls and all the other things the quality assurance scheme guarantees.<\/p><p>  The whole point of having a national reserve is to support new entrants into farming, farmers who have been farming without any payment on what is called naked land who should be eligible for payments in the future, and farmers who may have been ill during the reference year, or were out of action for some other reason, and got a raw deal in terms of their entitlement.<\/p> <p>They can make their case and look for a top-up on their existing entitlement.  That is the kind of thing the national reserve can do.<\/p><p> I fought really hard to get what is called a flexible greening payment.  Ireland was the only country that even thought of this concept initially, but we got strong support once we started selling this approach.  If we were to do as the Commission proposed, which is what the Deputy is also proposing - that is, to give the same greening payment to every farmer per hectare - it would not reflect the effort for certain farmers and the incentive that is there for certain farmers to abide by the greening rules.  If somebody is operating a low-intensity form of farming on a hillside somewhere, he will essentially have to do nothing to get the greening payment, whereas an intensive dairy, beef or arable farm will require a whole series of things to qualify for a greening payment.  It is much more sensible to say to farmers that they will have 30% of their payment held back until they can show that they meet the greening criteria, and then they will get that 30%.  This is distinct from having a payment of 70% and then 30% of the average payment across the country assigned as a greening payment to each farmer.  Thirty percent of an average payment is between &euro;70 and &euro;80, so for somebody who is on &euro;600 per hectare it is nowhere near 30% of their payment.  Therefore, the incentive is not the same for higher earners as it is for lower earners.  If somebody had an &euro;80 payment per hectare at the time we were negotiating, the greening payment would be the same as the other base payment because it would be 30% of &euro;270, which is the average payment.  I thought it was much more sensible and much simpler for farmers to understand to tell them that 30% of their payment relates to their greening responsibilities and they only get it if they meet those responsibilities.  If everybody has the same flat rate payment, then the greening payment is 30% of that average, but if there is a differentiation between higher earners and lower earners based on past productivity and so on, which is what we are proposing for Ireland, then it makes much more sense to have a flexible greening payment because the incentive for farmers to be green is the same regardless of income.  If the Deputy has a different view, that is fine.  We can talk about it again, but my view is that a flat rate payment would have had a very significant redistributive effect for many farmers, which was something we wanted to avoid.  Having a flexible greening payment allows that payment to change over the seven years with the rest of the payment.  It is a much more gradual change and farmers will be able to adapt to it more easily.<\/p><p> I could ask the Deputy the question of whether regionalisation and the single farm payment coefficient are off the table.  It is an option that is on the list.  All options are on the table at the moment.  I think it is unlikely that we will go down the regionalisation or the coefficient route, but let us not write things off before we start the consultation process.  Some people might feel that we should use those tools.  I think it would be very divisive to use either of those tools.  One of the reasons we argued so strongly for a gradual redistribution of funds and to limit that redistribution was that we would not have to break the country up into different regions.  I do not want people in the west of Ireland, the north west, the south west or south east to be put into categories on the basis of their geography.  Instead, I would rather a gradual redistribution at a national level.  That has been my preference, but let us hear what people have to say in the public consultation process.  Some people may feel we should use a coefficient in mountainous areas, but personally I would need persuasion on that.  The less we divide the country into different areas and payments, the less divisive this debate will be.  Now that we have got our approximation redistribution model, I think it is less likely we will have to do that.  If we chose the Commission's approach, which some people have advocated-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800007#F00300","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374138900,"counter":720,"content":"<p>Who advocated that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800008#G00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1374138900,"counter":721,"content":"<p>The Deputy advocated that we redistribute more than what the Commission was proposing.

I think we got a good win on that and now we have to design it with the flexibility that we have.<\/p><p>  The question about making a direct connection between stocking rate and payment is a fair one, but it is not the only issue on the table.  Even if we wanted to do so, we are not allowed under world trade rules to directly link payments to productivity, which is why the only option we had available to maintain any link with productivity and stocking rate was to maintain a link with the historical payments.  We are moving away from those historical payments and converging towards an average.  That was the only way we could maintain some link, and we have done a reasonable job at that for the next seven years.<\/p><p>  The redistribution figure is about &euro;103 million.

These are 2010 figures.  We are talking about a payment that farmers would have got in 2010 and the payment they will get after the redistribution effect of what we are proposing.  Figures have changed slightly since 2010 for some farmers.  The average payment will also be less because redistribution will happen after the 3.3% budget cut is applied, after the 2% for young farmers is applied, after the 3% national reserve figure is applied, and after the 1% crisis reserve is applied.  The figure that everybody gets before redistribution kicks in will be less.  We may not use a full 2% for young farmers.  In my view we are unlikely to use the full 3% for the national reserve, but these are maximum figures that could be cut.  The reality is that some money will be taken from farmers' payments before the redistribution kicks in.  Money will be given back to farmers on the basis of young farmers and the national reserve, and money will be given back from the crisis fund if it is not spent.  I have heard farm organisations stating that farmers are going to lose 9% before they even start.  In my view, that is the maximum possible that could be lost before we start, but it is very unlikely to be 9% because most of these funds will not reach their full amount, and in most years the 1% crisis fund will be reimbursed to farmers the following year as we do not have a crisis every year.  People need to understand that.<\/p><p>  Some of the figures we read about are accurate, but some of them also factor in maximum losses without factoring in gains.  When farmers say that they will lose 2% to give to young farmers, their sons might be gaining from that, or they might be gaining from it if they are under 40.  Some of them might be losing 2% and gaining 25%.  Let us not just focus on losses, because that is what makes the dramatic headlines.  Let us try to look at what is lost and what is gained, because all of those initial losses are for very strategic reasons that all of the farming organisations support.<\/p> <p>Farming organisations tell me they are in favour of supporting young farmers, yet they are concerned about the fact that everybody is losing 2% to facilitate that support.  They say they support a national reserve, yet they are uncomfortable about the fact that farmers have to lose 3% to facilitate it.  They cannot have it every which way.  That is why I hope this consultation process can be non-partisan.  Let us try to put together a package of measures that work.  We will disagree on some things but it is important that we all operate on the basis of accurate figures.<\/p><p> I accept that the REPS payments have resulted in a fairly dramatic loss of income for many.  When REPS payments were at their height we had a lot of extra national money that was being added to European money, beyond matching funding to put more money into agriculture, and rightly so, because the country could afford it at the time.  We are now just about matching European money to make sure that we have full draw-down, but adding nothing on top because we cannot afford it.  One of the casualties of that has been the switch from a very generous and popular REPS to the less generous and less popular but much more focused AEOS.  It is still popular.  It is oversubscribed.  There were 9,000 applicants for the last AEOS that we launched last year but we can take only 6,000.  Anyone who says it is a Mickey Mouse scheme should look at the applications.  I accept that there is less money to spend on rural development and that is why we need to be more accurate about how we spend it.  My comments on avoiding shocks to the system are about the redistribution effect in the new CAP for people&rsquo;s single farm payments.  I said that very clearly.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Ferris's comments on coupling, this requires a real discussion and I would appreciate an input from this committee.  There are pros and cons to coupling.  We will send out a very good paper on this, if we have not done so already.  People need to realise that we have the capacity to couple up to 10% of Pillar 1 money - that is, 8% plus an option of 2% for protein crops if we want.  Ten percent of &euro;1.2 billion is &euro;120 million, which is a lot of money that we could choose to couple if we wanted to max that out.  That means that every farmer loses 10% of his or her payment to facilitate that fund.  The arable or dairy sector may be paying for re-coupling in the suckler beef sector.  If we want to do that let us go into it with our eyes open.  Sometimes farmers call for coupled payments as if it were new money coming from Brussels that does not affect single farm payments for everybody else.  That is not the situation.  This is a  &euro;1.2 billion pool of money.  That is it.  If we decide to take some of it to re-couple payments we need to consider that option carefully and we may well pursue it to support vulnerable sectors.  Let us be clear, however, if we do that we are taking the money from other sectors that must sponsor it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800008#G00500","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374139500,"counter":725,"content":"<p>Does that come out of the Department&rsquo;s financial reserves for young farmers and other funds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800009#H00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1374139500,"counter":726,"content":"<p>Yes, exactly.  Coupled payment is a double-edged sword.  It benefits the sector that we want to support, but it has to come out of the other sectors.  If we were to support suckler beef, for example - there are approximately 80,000 beef farmers - we would be giving the money back again.  For someone who is not benefiting from a coupled payment it could result in their getting a more significant payment.  It is not fair to say that they could have a 19% loss because we are not going to couple 10%.  If we do couple it will be a much lower figure.  We would try to put a scheme in place.  The obvious sector would be suckler beef farming, but it is interesting to consider how we would do that.  For example, rather than introducing a coupled scheme we could transfer money from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 and then design a scheme that would not simply give farmers money for producing beef.  We could introduce something like a suckler cow welfare scheme that would give farmers money for producing beef but would also ask them to do some other things that would add value.<\/p><p>  It is possible to transfer money from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 without any co-decision funding requirement.  In other words, we could do something more strategic with that money, but it would be the same as coupling.  There are options available to us to do strategic things with the money that we have.  Every time we spend money in one sector it costs another sector and that is what we need to understand.  If we couple beef, that is at a cost to the sheep, dairy and arable sectors.  If we couple sheep it is at a cost to other sectors.  We have the flexibility to do that if we want, but that coupling debate is a very divisive one.  Farming organisations take different approaches to it.  The Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association will, I suspect, take a very hard line to oppose coupling.  I do not want to cite other organisations but I know the ICMSA's position.  Others will have an internal debate on this issue and will try to find a balance on the coupling option.

The more data we can get, the more people will be informed as to what their real options are.  The people who are not in the coupled area will be against it and all those within it will do a quick calculation on the basis that if they get &euro;10,000 they will lose &euro;800, and wonder what they will get back.  My calculation is that if it was &euro;1,200, that would be a gain of &euro;300 or &euro;400.

We are still talking about it.  We still have not figured out the definition of \"active\".  Going back to coefficients and different categories of land - and, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, people in the same cohort of production - there are ways to tailor a scheme with some decoupling to make sure that the people who get the extra money are those who are more active.

In response to questions about sugar, I have always said that I would love to see the sugar industry rebuilt in Ireland, but I have also said I am not going to consider supporting that financially and committing public money to it only to see it collapse at some stage in the future.<\/p> <p>Any rebuilding of the industry must be based on sound commercial principles.  It has to make sense to grow, process and produce sugar in Ireland.  In my view, we have a good chance of making that commercial case.  However, the Government will not provide subsidies to an industry if it will collapse in the future without those subsidies.  The business case must be made.  The promoters of the sugar industry are not asking for State subsidy; they asked for an end to EU quotas.  That is what we have achieved and it is over to them now.  They and the growers will be required to put together a business case to show how they would build, finance and pay for a processing plant that could also produce bio-fuels.  They are quite confident that they can do it.<\/p><p> Ireland is very competitive at producing certain foods.  Our climate is very suitable for growing grass and I believe we can be competitive at growing sugar beet, even though when it was produced in the past we were not as competitive as other parts of Europe.  I think competitiveness can be improved by the use of new varieties, as demonstrated in the UK.  The issue is that we want food to be produced in Ireland at a competitive price.  I hope we can do that in the case of sugar, but that commercial case and the backing finance have to be put together.  I presume Enterprise Ireland or the other arms of the State can help in that process to a certain extent.  However, we have no intention of creating an artificial market for sugar that then collapses at some stage in the future after people have committed significant funding and effort in order to rebuild it.  The policy is in place to allow the rebuilding to happen because quotas will be gone.  It will take until 2017 to be ready in any case.  It is now over to the promoters and developers of this project to make it happen.  I will be as supportive as I can but given the money available to me we need to be very careful about how we spend it.<\/p><p> The Commission is holding a conference on the issue of milk prices in September which will deal with post-quota market supports for milk.  Some countries are very concerned.  These are countries which do not produce milk as competitively as Ireland and may have an average herd size of three or four cows.  Some central and eastern European countries are in that position.  They are concerned that they cannot compete on milk prices against Ireland or Denmark.  Some of those questions will be teased out at the conference.  However, this was a red line issue for me.  The Irish Presidency was in receipt of proposals for some kinds of supply control measures post-milk-quota.  I said that if that was in the CAP reform I could not and would not support it.  Ireland has spent an absolute fortune in time and money preparing for the move away from a quota system.  The growth potential under the Food Harvest 2020 targets is a 50% increase in the volume of milk produced over five years.  Co-ops, companies and farmers are spending significant money to facilitate that growth.  We need to ensure it happens and we will fight hard for it in the autumn.  Some safety-net proposals will be made and I need to ensure that those safety nets do not prevent us from achieving the growth we want to deliver.<\/p><p> The scheme for young farmers was an Irish proposal which was welcomed by everyone.  Members asked about the consultation process.  We have not yet agreed an exact timetable.  I would like to have a focused consultation process that does not go on forever.  We could debate and discuss this for months because it is so complex.  However, we need to make judgment calls and decisions.  We have the information on which to base those decisions so that implementation can be planned in a way that does not take farmers by surprise and so that everyone is informed about what is happening and how to prepare for it.  I would like to see a full year lead-in period.  I propose that we focus intently on this issue.  The month of August will be a holiday time but I would like to make decisions on Pillar 1 towards the end of the September to October period because that pillar represents &euro;1.2 billion.  It will take us a little longer to put rural development schemes in place but I hope that decisions on Pillar 2 can be made before the end of the year.<\/p><p> We have the option to choose either 2013 or 2015 as the reference year.  I suspect the strong preference will be for 2013 because the die is cast with regard to land and entitlements and the applications have been made.  I hope this will end land speculation by people trying to work the system.<\/p><p> Inspections are a separate but linked issue.  There are no additional inspections in Ireland above the number required.  I thought the headline referred to was unhelpful, but the article made a more reasonable point.  We are required to inspect a certain percentage of farms every year and we are audited on that basis.  If we do not fulfil the requirements on inspections, auditing and penalties, we are fined through disallowances, whereby the Commission will not release moneys owed to Ireland.  I take the point that the more complex the system, the more likely it will be that farmers will break the rules by accident in many cases.  We need to keep the system as simple as possible to ensure that farmers are not being caught out by the complexity of a new system and that penalties are not applied to farmers who have made honest mistakes.  That has happened with regard to mapping and digitisation issues.  The appeals system is designed to allow for fair treatment of farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800009#H00700","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374140100,"counter":732,"content":"<p>I asked about the ownership of entitlements on leased land and whether it is the owner of the land or the farmer who is farming it.

A large chunk of Leader funding is administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This funding has not been drawn down and it looks like it will not be drawn down even though eligible projects are waiting for funding.  This is a no-brainer, in my view.

The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, is taking the same approach in the context of putting Leader companies under a great deal of pressure.  Many Leader companies have spent only 38% or 40% of their allocations.  The Minister's Department is working hard to ensure that these companies spend what they indicate they are going to spend and that there will be full draw-down.  There is a great deal of work taking place in that area because, like the Senator, we want to ensure that all of the matching funding available from Brussels for us under CAP will be drawn down by the end of the period in December 2015.<\/p><p> In the context of the additional payments for what is referred to as high-altitude farming, I do not believe there are any mountains high enough in this country to allow anyone to qualify for such payments.  Essentially, they relate to those who farm in the Alps and the Pyrenees.  In fact, it is mainly the Alps and in Austria where there are land management systems in mountainous areas that are designed to retain animals on the land in order to keep vegetation down.  Those involved receive very significant payments which, in some cases, greatly exceed the highest payments received by farmers in Ireland.  It is unlikely that such payments would be made in respect of those who farm on the hills of Donegal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800010#J00500","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374140700,"counter":737,"content":"<p>Unless the Minister takes on board the Chairman's proposal relating to the Wicklow Mountains.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800011#K00200","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1374140700,"counter":738,"content":"<p>That is a different issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800011#K00300","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1374140700,"counter":739,"content":"<p>Yes; it relates to commonage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800011#K00400","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1374140700,"counter":740,"content":"<p>The proposal in question relates to a Pillar 2 scheme which is designed to match environmental management of sensitive geographical or mountainous areas with farming.

As the Minister indicated, in the early years we overpaid in the context of co-funding and it was then necessary to engage in a clawback exercise.  I understand that under the new CAP, payments relating to any new agri-environment scheme will be approximately halfway between those which currently obtain in respect of REPS and AEOS.  The amounts which previously applied in respect of the latter were &euro;12,000 and &euro;4,000, respectively, so farmers will be lucky if they obtain in the region of &euro;6,000 in the future.  The orders of magnitude which will apply must be made known to members because otherwise we will not be able to discuss the matter with farmers in any meaningful way.  Would it not be possible for the Minister to indicate what was spent under the previous CAP and the pro-rata position which will apply under the new CAP - in this regard we must ensure that no more and no less co-funding than is required will be provided - and the amounts that will be available under the relevant schemes?

As members are aware, the Common Fisheries Policy has not received the attention it merits.  The agreement relating to it was negotiated at the same time as that pertaining to the CAP.  In many ways the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is much more radical.  This was necessary because the existing policy was not as effective as it should have been in terms of ensuring that we protect and maintain fish stocks and support fishing communities.  When, 20, 30 or 50 years from now, people look back at European policy from the point of view of fisheries, I hope this will be seen as a very radical point of change in terms of how European waters are fished.  The CAP is also a point of change but it is nothing like as radical from a policy perspective.  The CAP is more about money and how it is distributed.<\/p><p>  There are a number of key features in respect of the Common Fisheries Policy agreement.  In the first instance, we are committed to fishing to what is termed the maximum sustainable yield.  This will not happen overnight but we have stated that we will fish stocks, where possible, to maximum sustainable yield by 2015.  All fish stocks to which quotas attach will be fished to maximum sustainable yield by 2020.  In other words, the scientific research carried out by the Irish Marine Institute and other bodies will inform us as to the size, state and health of stocks and we will then apply the maximum sustainable yield formula in respect of them.  This formula allows the maximum commercial catch to be taken from such stocks while ensuring that they are maintained.  This is a really positive step forward for those in the fishing industry and for fish stocks.  It will mean that there will still be fish in ten years' time and that we will not fish in an unsustainable way.<\/p><p>  The second radical change proposed under the agreement is a move away from discarding fish.  We are going to introduce - on a phased, species-by-species basis - an obligation to land fish.  This means that those in the industry will be obliged to change, quite radically, the way they fish.  They will not be able to simply dump over the side of their vessels fish for which they do not have a quota.  It is perfectly legal to discard fish at present but, more than anyone else, fishermen really resent the fact that current policy requires them to dump, in some cases, 50% to 60% of the fish they catch.  Many of the latter are healthy adult fish that are marketable and valuable and they are dumped over the side for seagulls and other species to eat or else to rot at the bottom of the sea.  Apart from anything else, this is immoral and we are going to change the position.<\/p><p>  A great deal of discussion and negotiation was required with the fishing industry and with politicians in the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council of Ministers in respect of this matter.  My main objective was always to ensure the policy shift to which I refer would be made but in a way to which the fishing industry could adapt and with which it could live.  I am of the opinion that we have achieved that.  There are flexibilities in the system which will allow fishermen to manage this change.  For example, they will have inter-species flexibility in the context of using their quotas.  They will also have inter-annual flexibility in this regard.  If a fisherman is operating in the cod, haddock and whiting fishery in the Celtic Sea, for example, and he has a quota in respect of cod and whiting but not for haddock and he brings on board a large catch of haddock, he can use up to 9% of the quota of his target species to compensate for this.  There will be a cost involved but at least the fisherman in question will be allowed to land the fish and sell it.  If, at the end of the season, a fisherman has caught more fish than he has a quota to land, he can take up to 10% of next year's quota to compensate.  So the figures are 9% for inter-species flexibility and 10% for inter-annual flexibility.<\/p> <p>Those flexibilities are useful.  Then one has what is called a <i>de minimis<\/i>figure, starting at 7% and over a five-year period working down to 5%.  Our fishing fleet will be able to discard up to 5% of what it catches, but only when it proves it cannot avoid catching those fish.  In other words, fishermen have to be able to show they are targeting fish and using modern gear to do that, whether it is Swedish grid to release cod in the Irish Sea when one is catching prawns, escape hatches in the Celtic Sea or mesh size.  If one cannot avoid catching fish and cannot deal with it through inter-species and inter-annual flexibilities, one can have this outlet of a <i>de minimis<\/i>figure spread across the fleet.<\/p><p> We have sensible, practical implementation measures, but the net effect will be dramatic.  At the moment approximately half a million tonnes of fish are discarded in Irish waters each year.  If one thinks about that and the value of it, the fish are being wasted and it is damaging stocks and undermining breeding.  That will end and it is a really good thing for the fishing industry that it will end.  We will have grant aid to help fishermen adapt, to buy the new gear they will need and to become more targeted in terms of how they fish.  We will have to go around the country to explain to fishermen how that will work to make sure they are comfortable with it. They are obviously uncomfortable with it at the moment because they know it is a difficult, radical change.  Generally, change costs money and it is money they do not have.  Much reassurance is needed and we will work hard to provide that.  Points to note are fishing based on scientific advice, ending discards, and making decisions on a regional basis involving the fishing industry, which is something it has been seeking for years.  We have now an agreed model for regional decision making that will allow us make decisions for the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea or the western waters with other countries that are fishing in those areas, rather than having to go back to Brussels and go through a long process to make decisions.<\/p><p> In terms of Irish-specific issues, we have maintained and strengthened the language in regard to the Hague preferences.  We would like to have gone further in terms of enshrining the new Hague preferences in the new CFP as an automatic right to this country every year but that was not possible.  Anybody who says it was is not being realistic.  If we had created a debate around the Hague preferences we could have lost them altogether.  There was the capacity to lose them altogether.  We are the only country in the European Union that would vote in favour of the Hague preferences.  It is possible that Britain would but it is divided on the issue.  Nobody else wants to give Ireland preferential treatment in terms of the allocation of stocks and that is the effect of the Hague preferences.  We have strengthened the wording on the Hague preferences but we have not enshrined them as a right.  As Minister, I still have to make a case in December to ensure we get the benefit from them, but in my view it is still a good result.<\/p><p> In terms of protecting the Irish Box, again, we have enshrined in the regulation the objective of protecting biologically sensitive areas.  The only biologically sensitive area in the European Union is the Irish Box, apart from a small one off one of the Canary Islands somewhere in the Atlantic.  In general, we are encouraging countries to set aside biologically sensitive areas and to implement fishing restrictions there.  Again, that was very much our intention in terms of the protection of the Irish Box.<\/p><p> We had a huge risk at the start of the discussion on the Common Fisheries Policy due to the Commission&rsquo;s wish to introduce what was essentially the privatisation and trading of quotas.  The system was based on single transferable concessions, TFCs.  That part of the proposal has gone and we can maintain public ownership of quota, which we will allocate on the basis of who needs it most.  That is an important win for us.<\/p><p> There is also strong support in the new CFP for the sustainable development of aquaculture.  I ask colleagues around the table to help me develop the sector.  There is much concern and misunderstanding about the aquaculture sector, in particular finfish farming.  We must help people to understand that it will be a future growth area in terms of the extraordinary consumer demand for fish products that simply cannot be met by catching wild fish.  We can do that in a sustainable, safe way and that is what we must do.  We can create literally thousands of jobs by doing it and we can do it right.  The CFP will support us in doing that in terms of some of the money that is available to us.<\/p><p> We are negotiating a fisheries fund for the next seven years to help us pay for the new CFP in terms of the transition that is necessary.  We got a particularly bad deal the last time in terms of the fisheries fund.  Even though the overall fisheries fund is being reduced by 7% in terms of a broad budget cut, this country&rsquo;s allocation might well be increased slightly.  We fought very hard for that and we will know the outcome in September.  I have made a very strong case for an increase in our allocation of fisheries funds that I hope the Commission has taken on board.  I will come back to the committee with a figure when I have it in September.<\/p><p> That is the general theme around fishing.  The key Irish issues are the Hague preferences, regional decision making, maintaining the national ownership of quota and the protection of the Irish Box.  We have won on all of them.  The broader and bigger, radical policy changes that are needed around fishing to maximum sustainable yield, ending discards, being more targeted in terms of how we fish and supporting both freshwater and saltwater aquaculture are all progressive changes.  For me this will be a difficult CFP to implement because it requires a lot of change but it is a really good policy change.  When people look back in years to come at moments of change in big industries such as fishing, this CFP reform will stand out way above the others which were very conservative and did not change a whole lot.  They maintained unsustainable fishing.  In my view this is a really good moment of change in terms of how we conserve fish stocks and from a fishing industry point of view.  If one is a fisherman who wants to bring a son or daughter into the business one can look ahead and anticipate that stocks will grow.  We will have challenges in getting there but we will see less and less of our stocks being unsustainably fished.  That must be good news for everybody and it means that quotas will increase over time rather than getting cut each year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800011#K01000","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374141300,"counter":747,"content":"<p>Three members remain who are interested in fishing.

In fact, many smaller fishermen are somewhat disillusioned, rightly or wrongly, with the sector at the moment and the quota allocation that is available.  While much attention and focus has been placed on discards, regionalisation and the protection of the Hague preferences, the real issue affecting fishermen currently is the lack of quota allocation.  That is an historic problem which has not just developed on the Minister&rsquo;s watch but is a massive issue even in his own part of the country where fishermen fish for cod, haddock and whitefish in Irish waters and are only able to obtain 11% to 12% of the quota while French and Spanish fishermen avail of the rest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800012#L00300","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1374141300,"counter":749,"content":"<p>One must focus on what we can actually change rather than be unrealistic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800012#L00400","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1374141300,"counter":750,"content":"<p>I did say that it did not just happen on the Minister&rsquo;s watch; it happened under the watch of Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers as well.<\/p> <p>I have no problem saying that, but that is the crux of the problem facing the sector.

They feel somewhat isolated in that their views were not taken into consideration in the overall context.  I know the Minister has been extremely busy with the review of the Common Agricultural Policy, the review of the CFP and hosting the Irish Presidency but, none the less, the fishermen believe there was a lack of consultation.  In agriculture, which is the other part of the Minister's brief, solid consultation with farmers took place, and they would acknowledge that.  However, there was a lack of consultation on the fishing side.<\/p><p> On the transfer of quota, I very much welcome that the scientific and technical committees, STCs, are gone.

Did discussions take place on that or is it an issue that could be examined within the framework of the CFP?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800012#L00500","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374141900,"counter":752,"content":"<p>I am sorry if I came across as being irritated at the start of the Senator's contribution, but we all have a responsibility to try to give leadership.  There are certain things I cannot do, even if I want to.  I would love to renegotiate relative stability but to do that I need to get a majority of member states to support me.  There is not a single other member state that would support Ireland in terms of changing relative stability, with the possible exception of Spain, because it wants more from everybody.  For me to start even claiming that I could change Ireland's percentage of quota versus that of other countries is unrealistic.  To be fair, it was the same for previous Ministers.  Ministers get stick on this issue.  This was a deal done years ago.  We can get into the reason that deal happened and the way it happened, or we can concentrate on changing what we can change in terms of getting big allocations of new species such as boarfish.  We can concentrate on building up stocks also.  Even though we have a relatively small percentage, that percentage is increasing year on year.  My focus is on changing the things I can change rather than having this circular debate on trying to take more quota off the Spanish and the French because we gave them too much in the first place, knowing that I cannot do that.  We all have a responsibility to try to explain that to fishermen in terms of what we can and cannot do as a member of the European Union, and be realistic about it.<\/p><p>  On the Hague preferences, I would like to have done more.  The Senator's colleague, Pat The Cope Gallagher MEP, did a very good job in the European Parliament.  I would not pretend that he was not involved in this debate, because he was.  Unfortunately, I read some coverage that was inaccurate in that it stated the Presidency was very unhelpful in regard to the Hague preferences.  I was surprised to read that.  It did not necessarily come from Pat The Cope Gallagher but from other sources.  That was not the case.  We wanted to do as much as we could for the Hague preferences while at the same time avoiding a broad discussion on it because I was nervous about where that discussion would go.  I believe we got the best possible deal.<\/p><p>  In terms of discards in the pelagic sector, that date was to be January 2014 but we pushed it back a year because everybody recognised that there is work to do to prepare for that.  The pelagic sector should not have a huge difficulty in dealing with an obligation to land.  It is already illegal for pelagic vessels to grade fish, for example.  They should land everything they catch, more or less.  This is a fairly clean fishery; therefore, it is about catching small fish, which can be dealt with through mesh size and so on.  I accept it is not quite as simple as that, but already we are speaking to the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, KFO, and to others about the way that will work.  I believe we will make it work.  It is much more complex than the whitefish fishery, particularly when we have mixed fisheries where six or seven species might be caught in the one net, and it is difficult to avoid that.<\/p><p>  On the lack of consultation, I would like to have travelled around the country more in advance of doing this deal, but to say there was not consultation in advance of the CFP would not be true.

That percentage does not change.  As the stock increases, we get our percentage increase.  That is the way it works.<\/p><p>  I omitted to make a point earlier which I should make, and both Deputies present will understand it because they know the fishing industry quite well from a technical point of view.  Currently, we have what are called total allowable catches, TACs, but that is based on what one can land as fish.  In other words, when someone catches haddock and whiting their quota is what they are allowed to legally land on the quayside.<\/p> <p>We are now changing that to a catch quota.  Currently, if one has a quota for 5,000 tonnes but 6,000 tonnes are caught, it means that 1,000 tonnes are dumped over the side and 5,000 tonnes are landed.  Under the new system, if one catches 6,000 tonnes one must land it all.  Therefore the quota is now based on what is caught rather than on what is landed.  That means that the quota will increase overnight when one changes that system.<\/p><p> Currently, the science of landing quotas factors in a 30%, 40% or 50% discard rate - that is, fish being killed - in certain fisheries.  If one is going to land everything, the quota has to increase correspondingly, taking account of the extra fish one is going to catch but cannot discard.  That is excluding the juvenile fish, which one should certainly be able to avoid catching.  Switching from a landing quota to a catch-based quota should therefore result in an increase in the quota for fishermen.  It is good news even though it is a bit more complex for them in that they cannot turf over the side what they do not want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800013#M00800","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374142500,"counter":760,"content":"<p>In simple terms, if I am a fisherman with an annual quota of ten tonnes of cod, does that mean I will have a quota in January 2014 of 14 tonnes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800014#N00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1374142500,"counter":761,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800014#N00300","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1374142500,"counter":762,"content":"<p>Do the 9% quota offset and the 10% offset from next year come into play at that point?

It is quite a complex calculation, but the recommendation on a new quota will have to be based on what a fisherman can avoid, or not avoid, catching.  If half the extra 3,000 tonnes of discarded fish is juvenile fish, it should not be factored into an increasing quota.  However, if the other half is adult fish that one cannot avoid catching, it will be factored in.  We are trying to maintain the mortality rate of stocks, but instead of throwing them into the sea, fishermen will be able to land them.  The calculation is not the amount currently fished plus the current discard equals the new quota.  Catching some of the discarded fish can be avoided.  It depends on the fishery, but what is currently being discarded and cannot be avoided must be factored into the new quota.  It is quite a complex calculation, depending on the stocks, because with some of the fisheries one can avoid catching fish, while with others one cannot.  In some of the mixed fisheries it is also quite complex.<\/p><p>  ISIS will have a much more complex job to do in recommending quotas.  It will have to do two things.  First, the quota must be consistent with maximum sustainable yield.  Second, it must be consistent with a catch quota rather than a landing quota, taking into account what would otherwise have been discarded and what can be avoided through the use of technical measures.  It is quite a complex system, but fishermen will know what we are saying because they throw cod over the side in buckets.  They will know what is required for this calculation, even though it is undoubtedly a complex one.<\/p><p>  The one certain thing is that fish that are currently being sustainably fished will not be subject to a reduction in quota on the basis of moving from landing to catch quota; rather, there will be an increase.  If there is to be a reduction in quota because they are being unsustainably fished at the moment, it will be less of a reduction than it otherwise would have been because it is going to a catch quota rather than a landing quota.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013071800014#N00500","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1374142500,"counter":764,"content":"<p>That is fine.

It is also linked to the science involved, although the fishermen suspect the scientific evidence.  Their evidence at sea is different from what the scientists claim.  The complexity of the rules and regulations will be critical if fishermen are to buy into this scheme in its implementation stage.

An Irish person from the Marine Institute is the current head of ISIS.<\/p><p>  The relationship between scientists and fishermen is better now than it has ever been.  We got a pretty good deal last year and the year before in difficult circumstances for many stocks.  That was on the back of having the Marine Institute with us to make the case to the European Commission on why the cuts should not be as drastic as they could have been and the increases should be greater.  Fishermen now realise the value of having scientists on board, but we can improve the relationship all the time.  There is no question about that. <\/p><p>  I have heard the accusation from our industry that there are large Dutch pelagic vessels off the west coast, essentially grading a lot of fish and pumping them back into the water through underwater systems which are not visible.  I will inquire into that, but obviously we must impose the rules.  I do not want to target one nation as breaking the rules more than anybody else.  Boat by boat, however, we need to ensure that people are not grading and mulching fish and pumping them back into the water as discards.  That is not acceptable and it has to stop.

The Commission would like us to use that option because it sees it as a way of reducing the fleet, but I do not like that because it means fewer and bigger boats, and fishing communities would collapse.

The Chair will allow anyone to make a personal statement at the end of the meeting.<\/p><p>  I invite the Minister to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013071800003#B02900","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1374136200,"counter":806,"content":"<p>To respond immediately to the question about Oberstown, I have received agreement from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for funding for a campus manager.  The position will be advertised this month.  Some legal advice had to be sought on the precise wording of the advertisement, as we will be introducing legislation during the year to provide for one campus.  It is important that a campus manager be in place.  The Commission for Public Service Appointments will be advertising this position shortly and, hopefully, the appointment can be made quickly after that.<\/p><p>  I will bring members of the joint committee up to date on what progress has been made recently on the substantial responsibilities which fall within the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I propose to mention the child and family agency, early childhood care and education, Children First, the area-based response to child poverty and the Irish Youth Justice Service, as well as my Department's youth affairs role in the recent Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  I will be glad to discuss other areas of my Department's work in the subsequent discussion.<\/p><p>  I introduced the Child and Family Agency Bill in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  I acknowledge the assistance provided by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in bringing this particular part of the process to a conclusion.  The establishment of the child and family agency reflects the commitment in the programme for Government to fundamentally reform the delivery of child protection services by removing child welfare and protection from the Health Service Executive, HSE, and creating a dedicated child welfare and protection agency while reforming the model of service delivery and improving accountability to the D&aacute;il.  We are going further, however, than just child welfare and protection.  The new agency will bring together a range of functions relating to children and families which will, in turn, bring a previously unknown level of focus to issues affecting these groups.  The aim is to identify problems and provide supports at the earliest possible stage.  The chief executive officer-designate and most of the agency senior management team are in place.  The Government also approved the appointment of Ms Norah Gibbons as the first chairman of the board of the agency.<\/p><p>  The work involved in ensuring a seamless transition to a new agency should not be underestimated.<\/p> <p>It involves the disaggregation of budget and services for children and families from the HSE, negotiations with unions and overseeing a range of transitional issues relating to the transfer of undertakings.  It is a very large public sector body with 4,000 staff and a budget of more than &euro;570 million.  It is a very ambitious programme.  I pay tribute to the staff of the Department, particularly Jim Breslin, the Secretary General, and Gordon Jeyes for the huge amount of work that has been undertaken in this disaggregation of budget.  Obviously, it is a huge task to separate out the budget and personnel.  Deputies will be interested to learn that in carrying out the disaggregation, we have discovered that the budget lines relating to children were very diffuse and it was not always clear what money was spent on children.  Disaggregation has enabled us to carry out an exercise clarifying that and we have received good co-operation from the HSE.  There is due diligence in place so that at the end of the process, we can go back if there is any doubt or ambivalence or if people want to raise questions and have another look.  <\/p><p> I have already briefed the Chair on the early childhood care and education programme and the extra provision of &euro;11.5 million for the after-school child care scheme to support parents in employment.  A total of 6,000 places will be available when the scheme is fully rolled out.  The Department of Social Protection is responsible for determining eligibility. This funding is expected to increase to &euro;14 million per annum when the scheme is fully rolled out.  I pay tribute to some of the schools who are already doing this and some of the services already providing after-school care.  Clearly, an after-school service is very helpful to parents and in the take up of employment, education and training.  <\/p><p> I have gone into detail about the preschool quality agenda which has been underway for more than a year and which was thrown into stark relief by the \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme on standards in preschools.  The publication on-line of preschool inspection reports has commenced.  All new inspection reports undertaken from 1 July will be published when they are ready.  They take a number of weeks, the provider is given a chance to give feedback and the reports are published as soon as new reports are ready.  In the meantime, the 2,000 older inspection reports are being published on-line.  I emphasise that these are public documents and are available under the freedom of information legislation.  It is absolutely right that they are available on-line and that parents can access them.  Any good provider will make them available to parents when they ask and I would encourage parents and providers to have a discussion about their inspections and for providers to tell parents if they have made changes that are not reflected.  Given recent publicity, any parent will want to know the status of inspections for their preschool service.  In September, we will introduce registration for new services.  It will no longer be enough to notify; one must be registered.  The new national quality standards will be launched in September, will become part of the inspection regime and will replace the current guidance.  We will, therefore, have regulations and the new national quality standards.  Again, I pay tribute to my staff, including Ms Mary McLoughlin, who is here, and the staff of the HSE who have been working on these new quality standards for child care services.  We need different standards, regardless of whether the care is part time, sessional or full time or provided by a childminder.  A huge amount of work has been done and we will ensure that inspections from some point in September will replace the guidance currently available.  The inspections will be more comprehensive and more about the quality of care and the inspectors will be then in a position to continue their inspections but to have far more regard to these new national quality standards than to the previous guidance.  <\/p><p> I have briefed the committee on Children First on a number of occasions.  There are very complex legal issues involved.  I thank the Attorney General who has been very involved with the Department and its legal advisers in doing a huge amount of work in this regard.  Much progress has been made and we are very close to finalising the heads of Bill.  When one is introducing criminal sanctions for people not reporting, many issues arise about what it is intended to report and the responsibilities of organisations.  Again, I thank the committee for the work done by the Chair but it has meant there is a huge amount of legal work to be done in teasing out the precise responsibilities of mandated professionals and organisations.  Good progress has been made and a huge amount of work has been done.  This was promised by previous Governments many years ago.  I have brought it as the heads of a Bill to the committee on one occasion.  We will bring the second heads of Bill to Government as soon as possible.  There will be no delay but we are working on complex issues.   <\/p><p> In respect of the Irish Youth Justice Service, I know the committee had an opportunity yesterday to discuss with the Ombudsman for Children the position relating to Oberstown.  We are having discussions with both trade unions and meetings were held last week.  There was a belief or hope that we would be able to transfer some of the beds currently being used by the girls' section to the boys' section.  That has not proved possible for a variety of reasons.  We are now pursuing a twin-track approach of recruiting permanent staff.  In the meantime, we will see if we can use agency staff to increase the bed space.  If members wish to ask further questions about that, I would be very happy to answer them.  The capital project is going ahead.  I have been in touch with the OPW and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  Obviously, that tender is being completed.  Tenders are always sensitive and I do not wish to comment further except to say that the project is underway and the beds will be available next year.  <\/p><p> I have not had the opportunity up to now to talk about my work during our Presidency.  I will bring the committee up to date with the work I did as a Minister in the Council of Youth Ministers.  My priorities related to the contribution of quality youth work to young people's development, well-being and social inclusion and the potential contribution of youth work to youth employment and the Europe 2020 jobs and growth agenda.  This is particularly important at present given that we have the youth guarantee and funding of &euro;8 billion is becoming available within the EU over the next two years.  Ireland can draw down from that.  It is extremely important that youth work services benefit from that and that they are in a position to put forward proposals aimed at supporting the young people with whom they are in contact - often the most marginalised - to make sure they can access education, training or work.  It is important that the skills young people acquire through youth work be recognised in the work programmes which will get funding under the youth guarantee.  Some of the initiatives that arose as a result of our work during the Presidency include a new EU working group on quality youth work.  There is a better relationship between the Council of Youth Ministers and other Council of Minister configurations.  It is very important to mainstream youth work into the work of other Ministers and Commissioners.  We need to recognise that youth work can make a contribution to the 2020 growth and jobs agenda.  It has a very legitimate place in supporting young people to get back into work.  <\/p><p> We want more co-ordination.  I hosted an EU expert round table in June bringing together the youth sector, employers and business leaders, academics, the European Youth Forum and representatives of member states to explore the contribution of youth work to young people's employability.  We launched what is called the Dublin Declaration, which outlined the principles about which I have been speaking here.  That was very important.  The main point that young people and representatives of youth work organisations made at that meeting was that they had not had the opportunity to meet with people in quite the same way.  That mix of people from business, the academic world and youth work organisations came together to discuss how they can work together.  For example, the National Youth Council of Ireland and representatives of Accenture attended; we brought together business and youth work organisations.   The Dublin Chamber of Commerce recently expressed interest in working with youth organisations.  That type of collaboration could be very important in terms of job creation for young people and making sure the work of our youth services is recognised and valued by employers.<\/p> <p> Much of the work that young people are exposed to during youth work is about skills of confidence, building self-esteem and preparing to re-enter the jobs market.  We also held a conference and consulted with 11,000 people across the EU to ensure the voice of young people was part of the conferences we held during our Presidency.  Greece and Lithuania will continue that work with the theme of social inclusion and trying to further some of the conclusions we reached during our work.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for his continuing co-operation and interest in my Department's area and programme of work.  There is much work to do during the lifetime of this Government and that is continuing.  I look forward to continuing to work towards the very challenging goals for children and youth affairs which have been set out in the programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013071800003#B03000","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374137400,"counter":809,"content":"<p>I was disappointed that Second Stage of the Child and Family Agency Bill concluded yesterday evening.  It was not what had been intended in the D&aacute;il schedule.  Other speakers had expected to be able to continue to make Second Stage statements on the resumption.  It is regrettable and most unfortunate that because of the collapse of an earlier piece of legislation, bringing forward the Second Stage of the Child and Family Agency Bill to begin long before its scheduled time, other Deputies were unprepared to take up the opportunities yesterday.  Due to other responsibilities, I was not able to attend to hear the Minister's closing remarks over a very truncated opportunity of approximately three minutes at the conclusion just before 7.30 p.m.  It is an unfortunate start to the process of the legislation.  My remarks stand.  I welcome the Bill and will fully support its safe passage through the Houses.  I hope the Minister would note those comments.  It is not indicative of any lack of interest in the part of Members that it concluded as it did.<\/p><p>  In a response to a parliamentary question of mine on 4 July, the Minister said, &quot;Only 16 of the certified 24 male bed spaces in Trinity House School are currently available for use due to staffing issues.&quot;  This is a major issue and has been repeatedly highlighted in successive court hearings by well-respected judges.  It is an indictment of the political system that we do not use the full potential of what is already <i>in situ<\/i>.  Why is one third of the capacity of Trinity House school unused?  I would like to know the exact details of the so-called staffing issues.  Let us understand it, because it is vexatious.<\/p><p>  The annual report of Ombudsman for Children painted a very negative picture of the situation in Oberstown.  The Minister must be aware that the staff working there also paint a very negative picture.  The situation is far from ideal.  Is there any measure of the impact of all this on the children detained in Oberstown and Trinity House School?  Yesterday the Ombudsman for Children suggested there was a possible need for the upskilling of staff in certain areas.  I was not able to attend, being in the Chamber with the Minister.  That is a very serious reflection on the situation.  If staff at Oberstown are not properly trained for their responsibilities, there is a major problem that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I do not want to come back in the autumn and have to ask about this.  It must be acted on immediately because of all that is involved.  What are the Minister's plans to ensure upskilling of staff, if it is a requirement as identified?  What is happening regarding that and when will it take place?<\/p><p>  Will the Minister comment on the level of sick leave?  This is a serious matter and is symptomatic of something not being right in Oberstown.  Are there increasing assaults of staff resulting in sick leave and stress-related leave?  That is what I am being told.  This situation poses a major question.  Have we adequate staffing?  Are the skills bases in place?  Why do we have an inordinate level of sick leave, due in the main to stress and assaults?  It is a very serious problem.  When will the Minister publish the McElfatrick report?  Can the members of this committee, spokespersons on children, have access to it?  Why have we not got it already and will the Minister ensure we do?  It is critically important.  Can the Minister give assurances that the capital project at Oberstown will be delivered on time and in budget?<\/p><p>  I welcome the fact that I got my question on violence against children in the home to the Minister because every effort was made to prevent its being put to her, as I explained to her some time ago.  I would like the system to be a bit more reflective of the fact that children's needs, which may cross a number of portfolios, are nonetheless of concern to the Minister - I respect her for that - and to me as a spokesperson on health and children.  There is little information on the measures being taken to address the fact that there is a 55% increase in violence against children in homes where there is violence against another adult present.  Women's Aid has highlighted this and it must be properly addressed.  Is there any analysis of the root causes of this?  What is the HSE's assessment of this situation and what measures is it taking to address it?<\/p><p>  On the comprehensive preschool equality agenda, can the Minister clarify the position on the future need for preschool and cr&egrave;che services to meet the national quality standards as outlined in S&iacute;olta, the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education?  What are the practical implications for preschools and cr&egrave;ches in that regard?  Will the Minister ensure all preschools are inspected?  Will such facilities have a right of appeal in all circumstances?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013071800005#D00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1374137400,"counter":810,"content":"<p>As always, the Minister is very welcome to the committee.  I thank her for outlining all that is happening and for her responses to questions.  I am disappointed that the Children First Bill is still delayed.  I realise the legal difficulties.  This committee had very good hearings on the issue over a year ago so all committee members are aware.  In the absence of Children First, I fear people do not realise the responsibility.  Reporting is the right thing to do, and it is unfortunate that we must legislate for people to do the right thing, but we have seen too many cases where people have not reported.  In the absence of that legislation, is there something we can do as an immediate measure?  Perhaps I might give that more consideration.  We must send a clear message to anybody employed by the State or in receipt of funding from the State that it will be unacceptable and there will be sanctions if they do not appropriately report any concerns about a child's welfare or protection.<\/p><p>  I look forward to welcoming the national child care quality standards, on which the Minister is working.  Will this cover childminders, particularly registered childminders?  I am not talking about an informal arrangement under which I mind my nephews for two hours.<\/p> <p>Rather, I am referring to childminders who are employed.  What of au pairs?  Their situation seems to have fallen between the gaps.  It is meant to be an informal cultural exchange.  When used in that way, it is perfect.

However, there are thousands of good cr&egrave;ches and child care facilities.  I visited a number of them in my former profession.  The children there were engaged, not strapped to chairs.  I want to reassure parents that there is good quality child care.  I welcome the fact that the reports will be published online.

I have a concern about how the situation will improve for children.  I have mentioned it to the Minister previously.  People do not realise the tasks facing child care staff everyday.  They have little if any planning time.  All of their time is contact time with the children.  If there is to be quality, there must be space to develop a plan for the centre, its children and its community, as Deputy Mitchell O'Connor mentioned.  Unfortunately, there is no down time for staff at some private centres in particular to plan and to look after records adequately.  Services that receive funding from the State try to provide that space, but more is necessary.  We do not need nice buildings and equipment - people who have experience of young children know that they often find the greatest joy in the empty boxes, not the toys - but a quality relationship between the carer and the child.<\/p><p>  The new agency's establishment cannot be underestimated.  It is a positive step forward for many families.  It is the type of body that people in the sector have been discussing during their coffee breaks for years but did not believe would come about.

A time of change is a difficult period for staff and service users, but I am confident there will be a good outcome.<\/p><p>  How will we focus on ensuring quality?  This relates to the themes raised by various members who have discussed the new agency and early childhood studies.  How do we know there will be quality and depth to the service?  We should not focus on the number of social workers alone, as people often do.  There can be thousands of workers, but poor quality relationships and practices can do damage.

Such establishments are a lot cheaper than paying for a normal playschool.  Parents must pay between &euro;110 and &euro;120 per week if their child attends a larger playschool five mornings per week up to 12 noon.  If they send their child to a childminder who provides care in their home it will cost substantially less, perhaps &euro;50 or less per week.  I am not talking about the quality of service because people who have a small group of children in their homes are quite capable.

Grandparents across the State are being put under great pressure to mind their grandchildren.  I have seen grandparents in their late 60s and early 70s pushing buggies.  They do so because they want to alleviate the financial pressure on their children or grandchildren.

I hope the Minister has got the message.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013071800007#F00600","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1374138600,"counter":827,"content":"<p>Yes, I understand.  I thank the Deputies and Senator for their comments and questions.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Senator van Turnhout asked about Oberstown.  When I came into office Oberstown was quite under-utilised but had a lot of staff and the beds were not used fully.  As the members will know, many children are now diverted from detention to community placement and supervision.  Crime is also down among that age group, which is welcome.<\/p><p>  Last year there was no problem getting a bed at Oberstown for a 16 year old.  We took the decision to move 16 year olds and I stand by that decision because it was the right thing to do.  No 16 year old has been in St. Pat's for the past year, which is right, and this is due to the decision taken by me and the Government.  We have the opposite problem now at Oberstown because there has been a dramatic increase in referrals in the past three months.  For a range of reasons the courts have sought more places than at any time in previous years when 16 year olds were in St. Patrick's or when they moved initially to Oberstown.  With regard to staffing, Oberstown has 90 care staff, 35 night care staff, 17 management and 45 other staff, and the total is 187.<\/p><p>  I will also outline what I, the staff at Oberstown, the IYJS and the extremely good board are doing.  My appointment of the board members was based on their expertise and what they could bring to the management of Oberstown.  The board is chaired by Mr. Joe Horan.  Many of the board members have expertise in youth justice, which is precisely the reason I appointed them.  There has been no shortage of professional input, and great efforts have been made to deal with many issues.  Oberstown is an historic institution which had, surprisingly, three separate units.  I wonder why it was not under a single management.  No other government put single management in place but the Government is doing so now.  No other government established a roster system that meant that staff could move between three units.  They should have had mobility because they had to deal with young people in detention, mostly young boys and occasionally young girls.  Clearly, staff should have been able to move between units, but it took us two years to reach agreement on movement.  We went to the Labour Relations Commission and got changes made, and a roster has been in operation since February.<\/p><p>  Following an increase in referrals, we have examined ways to create extra beds.  Negotiations took place for a number of weeks on the possibility of changing part of the area designated for young girls to allow boys to use the space.  However, it did not prove practical or desirable in the long run.  Members are right in stating we are still in a situation in which we must make extra beds available.  It appears the only way forward is to hire more staff, in the first place, on an interim basis.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has approved quite a lot of extra staff for next year.  I welcome the agreement to have the extra staff because all of the 16 and 17 year olds will be on-site.  However, we still have not been able to make the extra beds available.  I shall ask my Secretary General to comment on the initiative and efforts that are under way.  We held meetings with the two unions involved, the most recent of which took place last week, to try to ensure that beds would become available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013071800007#F00700","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374138600,"counter":828,"content":"<p>A cross-campus roster has been talked about, but it is not always obvious what that means from a practical point of view.  For example, in our eight-bed unit for girls there are often only two girls, as is the case currently.  Before we had the cross-campus roster, the staff assigned to the girls' unit would stay assigned to it regardless of the number of children in the unit.  Therefore, a unit would be fully staffed even with only one or two girls in residence.  Now we have the ability to deploy staff on a daily basis.  The staffing of individual units is set according to the need and number of children and young people present.  The initiative has opened up operational efficiencies and allowed us to try to be more efficient.<\/p> <p>There are further operational efficiencies to be exploited in that roster.  We put it in place in February.  That does not mean it is ideal.  We are working with staff to try to identify every area we can address within that and iron out any difficulties.  We have had a very good opportunity from 1 July, as the Haddington Road agreement provides for additional hours for every public servant.  It brings all staff on the campus up to 39 hours per week.  We have additional hours within which to staff that roster and that will give us further scope.<\/p><p> The other element the Minister mentioned is that we have staff who are off the payroll.  They may be on long-term sick leave, as sick leave is an issue in Oberstown, or they may have taken a career break, etc.  Currently, we are trying to come up with some solutions which would bring additional staff on to the campus to fill those positions.  We hope to do that in the short term as well as look at some temporary solutions which would bring the staffing numbers up.<\/p><p> All of that is designed to get the Trinity House school up to full operational capacity - that is, eight beds.  Even when we do that, one of the issues with a detention school is that if one provides a number of beds, the beds fill up.  Even with eight beds, it is important that every other alterative to the detention of a child is looked at.  Just because there is a bed there it does not mean it should be filled.  Even when we get to eight, which will provide additional capacity, it might not provide all the capacity in the world.  If we were to keep increasing the capacity, the fear is that we would pull more children into the campus.  We have to get the balance right and make sure all the staff and the resources on the campus are efficiently deployed.  We also have to make sure there are solutions in place which mean we can divert children from having to be detained in the first place.  We have to work on both of those issues and not lose sight of them.<\/p><p> On the question of sick leave, it was, and is, a problem on the campus.  It is not specifically related to the arrival of the 16 year olds and I would not like it to be seen as that.  Sixteen year olds were detained in Oberstown before the Minister made the change, and that was as a result of children being sent in at 15 years of age and remaining there until 16 or 17 years of age if the period of detention was sufficiently long.  I would not ascribe the sick leave issues on the campus to the 16 year olds.  That would be pointing the finger in the wrong direction.  We are seeking to address and reduce sick leave.<\/p><p> Similarly, in regard to training, when I visited Oberstown first, I was heartened by the extent of the qualifications of the staff there.  The reason we want to move children and young people out of St. Patrick's is that we have care staff in Oberstown who are qualified and trained to look after children and young people.  They have very good skills.  We are looking at how we can further address that and further develop policies, procedures and training on an ongoing basis to try to support and help staff.<\/p><p> The board of management, which the Minister mentioned, has been working closely with staff to try to build a vision for Oberstown.  It is looking at the major endorsement it has got from the Government by way of a &euro;50 million capital approval and trying to construct something of which we can be proud in the offering for children and young people who must be detained.  The establishment of the assessment, consultation and therapy service, ACTS, team to deal with children's mental health issues on the campus is further evidence of that.  The type of work involved is to try to build a culture in Oberstown which is very much focused on children and young people.  For example, last year, there was an intensive set of four workshops for the board of management and all of the staff on the campus to try to work on a set of actions that would try to move us towards that vision.  That is continuing to receive attention.<\/p><p> The campus manager is a key post in any service.  The leader sets the tone and to have one unified leader on the campus allows us to start to further break down the barriers between the three schools.  The recruitment and calibre of that person will be very important in trying to build the culture we are trying to build.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013071800007#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Breslin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374139200,"counter":830,"content":"<p>Is the appointment process in train?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013071800008#G00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374139200,"counter":831,"content":"<p>The appointment process is in train and the Public Appointments Service will advertise that post.

An assumption was made by the board and everybody involved in the management of Oberstown that the new roster would provide the flexibility to open and use all of the beds there.  There is much disappointment that it has not proved possible to do that.  Sometimes there are historic practices in place in units which are very difficult to change.<\/p><p>  The work in Oberstown is demanding on staff, but staff must also be flexible and, as the Secretary General said, willing to put children at the centre and make whatever efforts they can.  The appointment of a line manager should greatly facilitate this because, effectively, three different organisations are coming together on the one campus which did not work together before.  It might look easy from the outside to make these changes and to get these flexibilities in the system, but it has not proved that easy.  A huge industrial relations effort was made and a considerable amount of time was spent by staff from the Irish Youth Justice Service and on the board, and those working on the campus, to arrive at what I agree with the Deputy is an unsatisfactory situation - that is, that there are beds which are not open.  We have asked the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to recruit extra people.  I regret that I have had to do that.  It should have been possible to open those beds with roster changes, but it was not.  Every effort has been made.<\/p><p>  Ten staff have been on sick leave for more than a year.  Clearly, there will be assault situations.  When operating a detention system, one is dealing with young people who have very complex issues.  We do everything to give support to the staff.  There is continuous professional training available and there have been staff days.  I have met the staff and I was very impressed with their commitment and the efforts they want to make to do the right thing by the young people there.  I hope this situation can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion as quickly as possible.  It is not for the want of effort by my Department, the IYJS, the board of management and everybody else.  <\/p><p>  I ask that all involved and all staff show the kind of flexibility we need because we are committing &euro;50 million to that campus.  We want to commit &euro;50 million to a campus that works effectively for children and ensures the beds are available.

This is unlike the primary school sector, in which all teachers have the same training and basic knowledge.  One of the challenges in introducing the S&iacute;olta and Aistear programmes in preschool education is how to implement them.  The Department of Education and Skills has responsibility for developing the S&iacute;olta programme and has run a field test with about 130 services.  What it has identified is that giving staff talks on how to implement the programme is not the way to proceed.  The Department identified S&iacute;olta mentors who worked very closely with the services.  That is a model we have seen in other countries and it has been particularly successful in Northern Ireland.  One of the strategies the Minister has identified to make S&iacute;olta and Aistear part of the way the staff work is to build a support network and work directly with services and specifically service by service.  The Department of Education and Skills is looking at bringing S&iacute;olta and Aistear together because there is an issue in that service providers see them as separate and different programmes from which they can choose one or the other, whereas in fact they need to be brought together.  There is a great deal of work going on in trying to develop it.  The voluntary organisations and the county child care committees work very closely with services, but what we need to do is to provide more specific support, service by service, rather than the general support that has been provided to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013071800009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary McLoughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1374139800,"counter":837,"content":"<p>Senator van Turnhout asked about the regulation of childminders and whether the new standards will continue to apply to registered childminders.  The regulations apply to registered children and a particular section of the regulations will apply to childminders.  The Senator also raised the issue of au pairs.  I met representatives from the Migrant Rights association and I discussed their issues of concern.  The issues seem to focus on employment and exploitation and as such would come under the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  I suggested that they link to the child care committees, as I believe they would offer support for au pairs, and if difficulties arise the child care committees would be in a position to support them or make some recommendations about the support they could get.  They said anecdotally that some parents overuse au pairs in childminding, the very point that Senator van Turnhout made.  They are concerned about that.  It highlights the need for a national campaign for young women from around the world who take up these positions so that they can know precisely what they are getting into, get as much information in advance as possible, deal with registered companies and use whatever safeguards are required.  If they find themselves in an unsatisfactory situation, they need to take action and go back to the agency.  Very often, it is an informal arrangement and the au pair ends up feeling he or she is being exploited.<\/p><p>  Senator van Turnhout, in raising the issue of alcohol, made her point extremely well.  I have detailed statistics.  We have heard about other committee reports and other aspects of the debate on alcohol and sponsorship.  I have been very keen to put on record the significant issues we have in Ireland with regard to young people and the need for those taking decisions to be very cognisant of that.  A recent study, for example, shows that Irish students in the 15 and 16 age cohort report drinking a third more on their latest day drinking than the European average.  That is the reality.  In addition, there is a trend for Irish girls to drink as much as boys and sometimes more.  Among the Irish students surveyed, in the 30 days prior to the survey, half - 52% - of the boys had drunk alcohol, 40% had had five or more drinks on a single occasion and 23% had had one or more episodes of drunkenness.  If one looks at anti-social and public order offences by children and young people, one will find alcohol is a factor in 28.9% of these.  There are major issues with regard to alcohol, and this needs to be debated on another day. <\/p><p>  Senator van Turnhout said she could not imagine the agency.  It will take time for people to think about the role of the Child and Family Agency as a separate entity.  If I were to ask who was running child and family services, members might have a problem answering that question.  We want to address that issue by putting a dedicated focus on child and family services.  Gordon Jeyes is working on establishing a national assessment and referral service with referral pathways to child welfare and child protection services.  That will deal with the issues outlined by the Senator.  When the board is in place, the board members will work on a corporate plan that will address the points she makes.<\/p><p>  I thank Deputy Mitchell O'Connor for her comments.  The Deputy asked about standardisation of inspections, and obviously the HSE has been moving towards a standardised process throughout the country.  Previously, this has been dealt with locally and on a regional basis rather than nationally.  To deal with issues nationally, one needs national standards, national inspections and the same format in all of the reports.  All of these issues are being addressed.  The introduction of the standards and the new national qualifications later in the year will help that as well.  There will be training for inspectors.  At present, it is public health nurses and environmental health officers who conduct inspections.  I would like to see people with child care qualifications being part of the inspectorate.  We have many people doing third level degrees in child care and we have a cadre of people who are very interested in developing their skills in the child care area but do not have much opportunity, a matter that can be looked at later.  The regulations were introduced in 1996, but under section 5, the welfare and care of children clearly must be part of any current inspection.  This does not have to wait until the new standards are implemented.  The plan is that when the new standards are finalised in September they will replace the current guidelines and inspectors will then inspect with regard to the new standards.<\/p><p>  Deputy Conway raised the issue of planning.  I agree with the Deputy that all providers should allow time for planning.  It is part of the regulations.  The child care committees and voluntary organisations have been supporting services to develop better planning and it is a very important part of their work.<\/p><p>  It is my intention to introduce a mentoring programme and I am in discussions about the budgetary issues arising from its introduction.  I would like to see a cadre of mentors going to child care services around the country to support the development of the staff and of the services they provide.  I would hope to get support for the programme.<\/p><p>  Deputy Byrne asked about the regulation of childminders.  A childminder must be registered and subject to the regulations when she or he minds three or more children, or children are minded in a preschool setting.  If people know about such services that are not registered they should be reported to the HSE or to the child care committees.  Whether a childminder who looks after fewer than three children in an informal setting should be subject to the same regulations as childminders in the preschool setting is an open question.  In some countries they are regulated, but in others they are not.  The approach in Ireland is that it is the decision of the parent and he or she checks out the childminder.  I would encourage a procedure whereby people register as childminders.  Childminders can register but there has been extremely poor take-up of that option in spite of the tax provision and the other supports that have been given.  Childminders themselves would have more support and greater access to training and the supports of the child care services.  It has not been the tradition in Ireland to register.  Even when the childminders' association, Childminding Ireland, asked people to register, only 1,250 out of a probable 50,000 childminders did so.  Few of the childminders in Ireland register as such because of the informality of the arrangement between the childminder and parents.<\/p> <p>Parents are increasingly asking who is minding their child and want to know about vetting and standards so I think we will see a move towards parents expecting childminders to be registered with child care committees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013071800009#H00300","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374140400,"counter":839,"content":"<p>Did Mr. Breslin say that when St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution closes some of the clients will be going out to Oberstown?

I have been there, done that.  I was so disappointed in the whole process that it took me four years to get a resolution.  Some people say that I have been lucky it only took that long.  I have seven headings in my submission.  I am nervous because this is my first opportunity to address such a gathering.<\/p><p>  My first point is about the length of time it takes for a hearing to be heard.  It took 16 months to get to an appointment with the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  As a result, I was under severe stress.  It was nearly impossible to apply for a job or to get a job during that period because if I was asked at an interview to talk about my situation I would have to say I was waiting for a hearing with the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I know how people react when they hear this and that was the reaction I got.  This created further stress.  All efforts should be made to reduce the waiting time for a hearing.<\/p><p>   My second point is about costs.  The system says that it is an informal, efficient and inexpensive means of getting a resolution to one's situation.  The people I had to fight against were in a position to employ HR people and big legal advisers.  I felt that if I was to go into the ring with these people with my hands hanging I would not have a hope of making my case.  The system says that every effort and assistance will be given by the Employment Appeals Tribunal people to assist a person but, unfortunately, it is very difficult for an ordinary layperson to understand legal jargon and rules and regulations.  As a result, I had to employ legal people to defend me.  The cost in my situation was just short of &euro;2,000, which was just slightly less than half the award I received.  So far as I am concerned, winners in particular are usually awarded costs in all court and tribunal cases.  I think that reasonable costs should be allocated to the claimant in cases before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and in particular to the winner of the claim.<\/p><p>  My next heading is costs to the State.  If a person loses his or her job, their first action is to go the social welfare office.  If one makes a claim while waiting for an appointment for an Employment Appeals Tribunal - which could be 12 months or 16 months - this will cost the State approximately &euro;18,000 for a married man.  In my view if the claimant wins the case the employer should be responsible for that loss to the State and it should be included in the award against the employer.  <\/p><p>  My next heading is the standard formula for awards.  It appears there is no set standard formula for making an award as it is at the discretion of the panel to decide the amount of the award.  I suggest that a standard set of calculations for awards should be implemented.  For example, if a claimant is out of work for 12 months and his previous earnings were  &euro;650 per week, the calculation should be 48 weeks at &euro;650, which is just short of &euro;32,000.  Less the social welfare payment of &euro;18,000, the award would be &euro;14,000 or &euro;13,500 to the claimant, plus, at the discretion of the panel, a payment for stress, hardship or other expenses.<\/p> <p>If a person is unfairly dismissed - as happened in my case - the employer should be held responsible for the payments the State was obliged to make in the interim.  That is my opinion and I believe consideration should be given to it.<\/p><p> The next issue is power of enforcement.  I have studied this matter and I am aware that when the award was made, the employer was given six weeks to appeal.  When those six weeks had elapsed, we spent a further two trying to track him down.  When we located him, he stated that he would be appealing the case.  We were then obliged to return to the Department to discover if an appeal had been lodged.  It emerged that one had not been lodged.  When I eventually tracked down the employer again, he had closed up shop, started up business in a different shed and walked away from his responsibilities.  The tribunal has no powers of enforcement and neither it nor anyone else is in a position to obtain payment from the employer in question.  I am of the view that the legislation should make provision for some power of enforcement which will allow for people to be held responsible if awards are made against them and which will ensure that they will be obliged to pay up within a short period.<\/p><p> In order that problems such as that to which I refer might be overcome, I suggest that employers who wish to contest claims relating to unfair dismissal, redundancy or whatever should be obliged to lodge bonds.  The use of bonds would mean that if an employer acts the cowboy and runs away, there will be something in place against which claims could be made.  These bonds would not require the lodgement of thousands of euro, rather they would take the same form as bail or court bonds.  Essentially, one or two people could guarantee that in the event of a claim being made against a particular employer the bond could be brought into force.  Another option would be for companies to put in place insurance policies to protect themselves and employees against claims of this nature.  It is possible for insurance companies to offer such policies in order that employees and the companies for which they work can be protected.  Again, I believe some form of provision should be made in this regard.<\/p><p> The final matter to which I wish to refer is the appointment of liquidators.  During the course of my pursuit of my claim, I discovered that when the company was liquidated the person appointed as liquidator possessed no qualifications or affiliations.  That person was extremely difficult to contact but I eventually tracked him down by picketing his premises and making life awkward for him by making telephone calls to him and some of his associates.  I obtained the information I required from the Office of Corporate Enforcement and discovered what was happening as a result.  Ultimately, I obtained by reward through the insolvency fund.  However, I felt that this was wrong because the director of the company involved was more or less going around and giving people the fingers.  He walked away from his responsibilities and there was no one there to force him to face up to them.  He continues to be a director of companies and to operate the same type of business in a different building.  What he has basically done is to give the fingers to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  He went through the entire process and he messed me, my family and everyone else involved around.  I spent four years trying to have my claim honoured.<\/p><p> In the end, I was not concerned with obtaining money but rather with getting justice.  That is why I wanted to express my opinions to the committee.  I have been there and done that and I hate to see what I endured happening to other people.  I know that some individuals would not have perseverance and tenacity to track down and persecute someone such as the employer for whom I worked.  Again, I felt it was wrong that the State was obliged to pay my claim from the insolvency fund, that the directors in question walked away scot free and continue to serve as the directors of big companies and that they have not been held responsible.  If a situation such as mine arose in the future, these people would do the same thing again.  For that reason, I am of the view that the Employment Appeals Tribunal should be given powers of enforcement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374138600,"counter":859,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Sullivan and call Mr. John Douglas, general secretary of Mandate and president of the ICTU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800004#D00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374138600,"counter":860,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it to outline our views on this very important issue.  I compliment Mr. O'Sullivan on having the tenacity to continue his fight for justice in respect of his award.  We have a number of members who were employed by Connolly Shoes in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, who had over 100 years' collective service between them and who have been on the streets since 2010 trying to obtain justice against all the odds.  We will continue to pursue their case in the strongest possible manner.<\/p><p>  As members are aware, Mandate is a union which organises workers in the retail and bar sectors.  The type of problem under discussion is not unfamiliar to us, particularly in view of the myriad small businesses and limited companies which operate in both sectors.  Members will also be aware that the Unfair Dismissals Acts offer a system of redress for workers against unfair dismissal, that the Employment Appeals Tribunal - on finding a dismissal unfair - may award reinstatement, re-engagement and\/or compensation to the employee, group of employees or a combination of both.  Hearings are quite formal, with all evidence taken under oath, and parties are permitted to cross-examine each other's witnesses.  While the tribunal was originally set up as a quick and informal route for workers to process claims relating to alleged unfair dismissals, it is clear that in recent years it has become increasingly legal in nature, with parties - particularly employers - often represented by senior counsel and solicitors.  This makes hearings of the tribunal altogether more daunting for workers, particularly those without union or legal representation.  We understand that the relevant Minister is in the process of introducing measures to simplify the process and that these will lead to the Labour Court taking over the function of the tribunal.  Nonetheless, serious concerns remain in respect of a number of matters covered by the legislation.<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Sullivan referred to delays in the processing of claims.  It is not unusual for workers to wait 12 months or more for their claims to be heard.  This results in extended economic hardship on workers and their families, particularly at a time when the level of unemployment is high and when there is little alternative employment is available.  As Mr. O'Sullivan pointed out, these delays also impact on the employability of the claimants in that many employers will not hire a worker who has a claim in progress or in the system.  We hold, therefore, that serious claims such as those relating to unfair dismissals must be heard within a reasonable period in order that claimants will not be penalised twice.  The workers at Connolly Shoes to whom I refer were unfairly dismissed in March 2010.  They receive a favourable award against their employer in December 2011 and they have still not received one cent of this money.  Over &euro;100,000 is due to these four workers who, collectively, gave over 100 years' service to the same employer.  They continue to chase said employer, who has established and closed myriad companies in the interim and changed the names and places of business of these on an almost monthly basis.  He has done all of this in a effort to avoid his responsibilities.  He is protected under the limited liability status relating to directors but our members have been forced onto the dole.<\/p><p>  The enforeability of awards is a serious issue.  On the making of an award by the tribunal, parties have six weeks to decide whether to appeal the decision to the Circuit Court.  Should either party exercise their right of appeal, the matter will then be referred to the Circuit Court.  Again, this will involve further delays and costs.  In the case of Connolly Shoes, the matter was not appealed and we were obliged, on behalf of our members, to seek an enforcement order in the Circuit Court.  If an employer refuses to pay or ignores an award of the tribunal, the claimant or claimants must go to the Circuit Court to seek such an order and bear the resultant costs that arise.  The order is then given to the sheriff to enforce, either by securing the award or by ceasing goods to the value of the award.  If an award is reinstatement, it is extremely difficult to cease goods to the value thereof.  However, this is what the law dictates at present.  The real problem arises in cases where the employer is a limited company, either in dormant status - that is, it is not filing returns to the Companies Registration Office - or has no assets.  Named directors are protected by limited status and this allows them to place their assets beyond the reach of workers.  This means that the rights of workers whose claims have been adjudicated upon by a tribunal of this State cannot be vindicated.<\/p> <p>In such cases the sheriff acting on behalf of the worker will have nothing to cease and no recourse against the directors.<\/p><p> The case of Connolly Shoes in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is a typical example of such a case, where four workers with more than 100 years' service who were unfairly dismissed were awarded over &euro;100,000 in compensation against their employer - MACOW Limited, which later changed to MACOW &amp;amp; Associates Limited, neither of which companies have any assets whatsoever, but the company still continues to file returns to the Companies Registration Office.  The sheriff attended at the trading address of Connolly Shoes in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, only to be informed that MACOW Limited does not own the stock on the shelves nor the premises, which is held by a separate company.<\/p><p> The situation becomes even more stark in cases of dormant limited companies which are abandoned by their directors and it is not possible to enforce orders against them.  In many cases these companies are struck off by the Companies Registration Office for failing to make returns.  It is impossible to enforce an Employment Appeals Tribunal, EAT, award against a company that is struck off as it no longer legally exists.  That means workers who have been adjudged as having their rights infringed by a tribunal of the State are tunnelled down a cul-de-sac with no prospect of achieving the redress awarded.<\/p><p> The final option left to such workers is to petition the High Court to have the said company wound up.  Those costs, on top of the costs of the tribunal and the Circuit Court are in the vast majority of cases prohibitive, as by definition the works are now unemployed and in many cases unemployable.  In the unlikely event of the workers having the means to seek a High Court petition and eventually succeed in winding up the limited company, the awards of the original tribunal can be met by the insolvency fund.  The time and the expense of this process are prohibitive in the vast majority of cases.  Therefore, it would appear from the current enforcement regime that workers who have been either unfairly dismissed or had other labour rights abused have no recourse to enforcement.  Delinquent employers who have infringed the most basic rights of a workers, namely, to earn a living, can hide behind the veil of limited company status.  In the hierarchy of things, a director's rights to the protection of his or her personal assets are put ahead of the worker's rights against unfair and unjust treatment.  The State has clearly taken the side of business over workers.<\/p><p> The situation is most serious and it has become a growing problem across the service sector with which we deal.  Currently, a total of 2,521 companies are tagged for strike-off.  Behind each of those tags lie thousands of workers who will not be able to process their rights and the awards that have been made by a State tribunal.  The matter requires immediate attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800004#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Douglas","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374139200,"counter":862,"content":"<p>I now invite Ms Rhona Murphy and Mr. Loughlin Deegan to make their opening statement on behalf of IBEC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800005#E00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374139200,"counter":863,"content":"<p>We are grateful to be invited to make submissions to the committee this morning.  We will confine the submission to the matters referred to in the invitation from the committee to IBEC.  They do not relate to all of IBEC's concerns on the operation of the employment rights bodies.  We are feeding into the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation separately on those matters.<\/p><p>  We have been provided by the committee with a summary of the petitioner's complaints and suggestions on the EAT.  Unfortunately, it appears that the petitioner is under several misapprehensions regarding the EAT and its operation.  Several of his assertions furnished to us appear to be factually incorrect and several of his suggestions for change would lead to what we perceive as a significant injustice for employers who are already struggling in the current climate.  We deal with the complaints in the sequence provided in the letter we received.<\/p><p>  In response to assertion No. 1, that the cost of bringing a complaint to the tribunal has to be paid by the complainant, that is not correct.  There is no cost to bringing a complaint to the tribunal.  It is free.  It is also free to bring a complaint to a rights commissioner, the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court and the Equality Tribunal.  That causes a significant problem for employers and a large waste of money for the State because many employees take frivolous and vexatious claims against their employers and then do not bother to show up to the hearing.  I do not refer to the case presented by Mr. O'Sullivan but it is our general experience.  It happens hundreds of times each year, especially at the rights commissioner hearings, causing enormous waste of taxpayers' money.<\/p><p>  The jurisdiction of the EAT in unfair dismissal cases is two years' worth of the claimant's salary.  In most cases, that greatly exceeds &euro;38,000, which is the jurisdiction of the High Court.  If a person wants to bring proceedings in the High Court, they must pay a fee of &euro;138.  If they want to bring proceedings in the Circuit Court, they must pay stamp duty of &euro;68.  If they want to bring proceedings to the Small Claims Court, they must pay &euro;25.  In the latter court the cap on awards is in the region of &euro;1,000.<\/p><p>  IBEC has consistently submitted that it should cost the same, at a minimum, to bring a claim to the EAT that it costs to bring one to the Small Claims Court.  We have made representations to that effect as part of the employment rights bodies' reform consultation process initiated by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The introduction of this measure would raise a small amount of money for the State and would reduce the number of frivolous claims by people who have no intention of attending a hearing.  Ireland is an outlier in this regard compared with other countries.  In the UK there is a proposal to introduce staggering of fees to have a hearing before the employment tribunal.  To have a claim heard before the tribunal will cost &pound;1,200 and there will be an issuing fee of &pound;400.  The fee we propose is modest but it would go some way towards reducing what we have experienced as a number of frivolous and vexatious claims, which cause an inordinate amount of trouble for an employer who still has to prepare the case, bring witnesses out of the workplace and defend the proceedings.<\/p><p>  Assertion No. 2 is that the employer is under no obligation to pay the award.  That is not the case.  An employer has a legal obligation to pay an award ordered by the EAT.  That obligation can be enforced through the Circuit Court, which can require interest to be paid on the award.  It is similar to any other legal rights that are exercised in the courts.  That is the process that is universally applied.  Only a tiny number of enforcement proceedings are brought each year, because the great majority of employers comply promptly with EAT awards.  The kind of case which we heard about today is very much in the minority.  It is relatively rare that employees are forced to proceed to enforcement proceedings or to recover from the insolvency fund.<\/p><p>  Assertion No. 3 is that the claimant must then pursue the employer through the courts for payment.  An award by the EAT is the equivalent of a debt which the employer owes to the claimant.  The only appropriate way to pursue unpaid debts is through the courts.  It is the same for a contract debt or any other kind of debt.<\/p><p>  On assertion No. 4, the need for engagement of a legal team by the claimant, neither claimants nor employers need to engage legal teams in the EAT.  From my experience of it I find that where a party appears unrepresented the tribunal makes every effort to facilitate him or her in the running of the case.  The EAT was designed to be \"lawyer free\" but many claimants and employers choose to represent themselves in proceedings.  The EAT is very supportive of unrepresented parties.  The procedures of the EAT are flexible, and particular flexibility is shown to unrepresented parties.  From our observations based on looking at the previous annual report of the Employment Appeals Tribunal it would appear to us that legal representation is used in approximately 50% of cases.  The use of legal representation is approximately the same split between employers and employees, or at least the differentiation is negligible.<\/p><p>  The EAT also facilitates representation of claimants by trade unions, and of employers by employer organisations such as IBEC.  The quality of representation is excellent and such parties do not have to pay for such representation, as it is included as part of their membership subscription.  Some parties choose to retain their own legal representation at the EAT.  That is their absolute right, but if they want such representation, they have to pay for it themselves.<\/p><p>  On assertion No. 5, that there is a lack of power on the part of the tribunal to enforce its judgments, as I mentioned previously, an award by the EAT is the equivalent of a debt which the employer owes to the claimant and the only way to recover that is through the courts.  In terms of the suggestion that an employer should be required to lodge a bond as security, we would fear that would be a charter for employees to bankrupt employers by lodging unlimited numbers of spurious claims.  It would penalise employers before any award had been made against them.  It would be completely unjust and entirely unconstitutional.  Such an approach would render their work almost impossible, in particular in the difficult trading circumstances in which most employers operate at the moment.<\/p> <p>The procedure at the EAT, Employment Appeals Tribunal, is already weighted against employers.  Unlike most civil proceedings where the burden is on the plaintiff to prove his or her case, the EAT operates under a statutory requirement that employers are considered guilty until proven innocent.  This arises from section 6 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977, which requires employer to prove that they did not unfairly dismiss the claimant.<\/p><p> In any case, there is already legislation in place for some time in the form of the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984 which protects employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  The legislation requires that a fund be retained which guarantees payments of outstanding claims of employees in the event of insolvency.  The fund, referred to as the Social Insurance Fund, is financed by employers&rsquo; and employees&rsquo; PRSI.  Employees are entitled to access the fund where there is a debt owed to them arising from one or more of a range of claims specified in the Acts, including those pursued under the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Redundancy Payments Act, the Employment Equality Act, the Payment of Wages Act, the National Minimum Wage Act, the Maternity Protection Act and the Parental Leave Act.<\/p><p> Based on the D&aacute;il debates at the time of the passing of the Act, the definition of insolvency was deliberately broad so as to ensure no worker would be excluded from the protection of the legislation.  IBEC respectfully submits the scheme underpinned by the employers insolvency legislation provides a reliable redress mechanism to employees who find that they are otherwise unable to recover the moneys owed by their employer.<\/p><p> We have no opinion on the appointment of liquidators and their qualifications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rhona Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374139800,"counter":865,"content":"<p>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, thanks the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions for the opportunity to provide observations on the issue of costs associated with taking a case through the EAT.<\/p><p>  There has been much discussion about the shortcomings of the tribunal.  However, it is important to remember from where it came.  It was set out to be a relatively informal and inexpensive way for employees to vindicate their employment rights in certain areas of employment law.  With its transformation from the redundancy tribunal to the EAT, it has, as rightly described by the petitioner, become not all together a friendly place.  As a trade union advocate I know many individual workers who are not members of a trade union being dissuaded from taking their cases to the EAT because the other side has access to better legal resources.  This is very far from what the tribunal was intended to be at its inception.  It was to allow ordinary working people access to a forum without the requirement of legal or, indeed, trade union representation.  As an advocate with the Citizens Information Board, I have seen it turn into a forum with senior counsels and solicitors with stacks of files on the other side of the table.  This might be addressed in the legislation.<\/p><p>  The petitioner has raised his experience of appearing at a tribunal.  There are no costs to workers in accessing the EAT.  Representation costs for trade union members have been paid for through their trade union subscriptions.  The Minister has suggested the possibility of costs attaching to complaints or where referrals or applications are being made to the tribunal into the future, along with the possibility that provision for cost may be included in the workplace reform Bill.  SIPTU, along with other trade union colleagues, is opposed to the introduction of such costs.  We consider such a move anti-worker as it would have the effect of placing unnecessary hardship on workers and act as a deterrent in the vindication of employment rights.  Such a move has been mooted in the UK with fees ranging from &pound;250 to &pound;950 for unfair dismissal cases and &pound;350 for unpaid wages cases.  These are retrograde steps and inconsistent with the tribunal&rsquo;s purpose.<\/p><p>  The cost of enforcing a decision or determination handed down in favour of a worker by the EAT is also met by his or her trade union.  In this regard, the Minister&rsquo;s proposal that enforcement may be possible through the District Court, as opposed to the Circuit Court, is a welcome move in bringing enforcement costs down.  Any measure the Minister introduces to bring costs down brings us closer to the original purpose of the EAT, namely easy access to the vindication of employment rights.  We would like to see the Labour Court playing a role in this in an effort to drive costs down further.<\/p><p>  The retrieval of debts owed and the enforcement of determinations in decisions by third parties against employers who are technically but not legally insolvent remains an issue of grave concern to our members.  Ever since the introduction of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984, there is a gap in this regard.<\/p> <p>In the normal course of events, in order to enforce against any employer who has not paid our member such debt or third party award, we undertake a CRO search to determine that it is the correct legal entity against which we are enforcing, as is required by law.  As a result, we determine not only the correct legal entity but the solvency or otherwise of the company, its annual returns and trading status, as well as that of any associated companies.  This is vital to establish in bringing any such case.  Where there is little or no difficulty with the company's solvency, we are in general successful in enforcing against the company.  My colleague, Ms Deirdre Canty and I and others serve in the membership information support centre in SIPTU which deals with individual cases like this all the time.  Establishing the status of that employer is vital because it can have implications for the prosecution of their case and, more importantly, in realising any award that is made by whatever forum we have been to.<\/p><p> Should we discover that a company has ceased trading and in effect walked away from its outstanding debts to employees, there is no solution available to the workers.  Those may be debts that have accrued in terms of back wages or holiday entitlements.  All those matters are covered under the 1984 Act, as amended.  I beg to differ from the submission made by IBEC.  The 1984 Act, as amended, establishes very narrow criteria against which insolvency can be established for the purposes of accessing the insolvency fund to make good on those debts.  It is a very narrow piece of legislation in that respect.  While the company will technically be insolvent, workers who have paid their social insurance contributions towards the State insolvency fund are not entitled to claim from this fund as the definition of insolvency under the Act, while being capable of, does not cover them for this situation.<\/p><p> That is a gap in the law that has never been closed.  It has been observed to have been a problem for many years.  I recall dealing with a specific company in Donegal in the 1990s on a voluntary basis as the employees were not trade union members.  They came into difficulty.  The company was in the Ballymoon industrial estate in Kilcar in south-west Donegal.  It was a Swedish-owned company that had been grant aided by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  These employees had been left at arm's length in the operation and there was a distanced management.  Employees continued to work without getting paid for a protracted period.  They had been used to periods like this where they might have worked for two or three weeks and some absentee manager would come by and pay them their back wages that had accrued.  There came a point where no manager ever came back either to collect product or to do anything else and no wages were paid.  Due to the fact that the Irish-registered aspect or associate company of the Swedish parent had not been rendered insolvent under the descriptions in the definitions of the 1984 Act, those individuals had no access to recovery of that debt of lost wages, accrued holiday entitlement or anything else.  They tried to continue the business in the good faith that it would continue and were just abandoned.  The Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 had no application because the parent company in Sweden was not insolvent in line with its legislation so there was no place to go.  This has been happening for decades, has never been addressed and is a great disservice to those individuals who find themselves in that situation because they are simply abandoned.  I can understand the type of situation described by our colleague in Mandate based on his experience where the individual might then set up an alternative business in the same town.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800006#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vernon Hegarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374140400,"counter":867,"content":"<p>In the same building.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800007#G00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374140400,"counter":868,"content":"<p>It flies in the face of those with outstanding debts that cannot be accessed and who have no recourse in law to recover those debts.  That is particularly aggravating and degrading to the employees involved.<\/p><p>  Understandably, this comes as a great surprise to workers affected.  The cost of pursuing a company which effectively only exists on paper is prohibitive when balanced against the award they will have received from a third party in respect of unpaid wages - minimum notice, unfair dismissal claims, etc., as outlined.  Many members will also be aggrieved that their employer can start up another company somewhere else, very close by or even in the same building, as has been pointed out.  This contrasts sharply with the situation for redundancy payments as well as for insolvency situations provided for in the Act.  On receiving a payment from the State in these situations, the State stands in the shoes of the worker and can pursue the company for monies owed.  The Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 and the European directive to which the Act give effect both envisage insolvency situations other than those currently provided for under the Act, that is, liquidation, receivership or the death of the employer.  As the Act also provides for the pursuance of employers and companies by the State in an insolvency situation, there does not appear to be an insurmountable barrier in dealing with a company that is insolvent in these situations thereby protecting workers against such behaviour by employers and placing the debt back on the employer where it should properly reside.  We submit that this is the just amendment that needs to be made.  It has been suggested prior to this by ICTU that section 4(2) of the Act empowers the Minister to make just such an amendment by regulation.  That would be the swiftest means by which these workers who have remained without these protections many years could be helped.  If members have any further questions, I would happy to take them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vernon Hegarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1374140400,"counter":869,"content":"<p>I now invite Mr. Niall McCutcheon, assistant secretary, to make his opening statement on behalf of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800007#G00400","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374140400,"counter":870,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting to address the issues raised in Mr. O'Sullivan's petition and for the opportunity to provide an update in respect of the ongoing reform programme currently being undertaken by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to reform the State's existing employment rights and industrial relations structures, to which reference has already been made.<\/p><p>  The Department has already forwarded a submission to the committee prior to this meeting which addresses the specific issues raised by the petitioner and provides an update in respect of the workplace relations reform programme.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to address the issues in such great detail in my opening statement.  However, both I and the other members of the Department's delegation would be happy to address any questions or issues which the committee may wish to raise in respect of the matter.  I will deal with the broader issues raised in this petition which relate to the delays and costs of bringing a complaint before the EAT, the need to employ a legal team, the difficulty of enforcing an award of the tribunal and the qualifications of liquidators. <\/p><p>  I will firstly provide an update in respect of the ongoing reform of the State's existing employment rights and industrial relations structures and will then briefly address the specific issues raised in the petition.  It is essential that we have efficient and effective mechanisms to develop harmonious and productive workplaces and to assist employers and employees to avoid and resolve disputes.  It is clear that the system which has evolved over the past number of decades did not achieve this.  The system was frustrating for employers, employees and professionals representing them.  Notwithstanding the efforts of the EAT and others to reduce backlogs, the Minister believes the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.  <\/p><p>  It is for these reasons that the Minister is undertaking a root-and-branch reform of all five workplace relations bodies.  The reform programme that has commenced aims to deliver a world-class workplace relations structure.  The Minister proposes to establish a two-tier workplace relations structure which means that upon establishment of the new structures, two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five.  We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the workplace relations commission, WRC, and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  All complaints will be dealt with by a single body of first instance where the aim will be to have a hearing within three months from the time the case is lodged.<\/p> <p>The activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, EAT, and the Labour Court will be merged into the new Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  The appellate functions of the EAT will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.<\/p><p> The Minister has already undertaken two public consultation processes and, as the committee will be aware, in July 2012 he submitted the policy document, Legislating for a World-Class Workplace Relations Service, to the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  This document sets out in detailed narrative format the core principles that will be incorporated into the proposed new structures and processes.  The Minister had a positive and very useful engagement with the committee on the proposals, which incorporate many of the positive suggestions and contributions made as part of the consultations.<\/p><p> The purpose of the reform programme is to provide a more efficient and effective system of resolving employment disputes.  Substantial progress has already been made in this regard.  Since the Minister announced his reform proposals we have undertaken two public consultation processes, published two policy documents, created a new website; introduced a single complaint form and single contact portal, and commenced delivery of an early resolution service.<\/p><p> A significant amount of work has also been completed on the legislative programme required to deliver the reform.  The general scheme of Bill has been approved by Government for priority drafting and it was included on the \"A\" list for the Government's summer legislative programme 2013.  Drafting of the Bill has commenced and the Minister is committed to the enactment of the legislation at an early stage with a view to having the proposed new structures in place from 2014.  The Minister intends to progress the reform programme to the next stage with the same determination that has delivered results to date and he intends to continue to progress the reform and bring about further enhancements for users of the services on an administrative basis in the coming months before the enactment of the legislation.<\/p><p> I will briefly address the issues raised in Mr. O'Sullivan's petition which relate to the delays and costs of bringing a complaint before the EAT, the need to employ a legal team, the difficulty of enforcing an award of the tribunal and the qualifications of liquidators.  The EAT was originally designed as a relatively inexpensive and informal forum for dealing with employee-employer complaints.  No fees are charged to any of the parties.  Legal representation is not a requirement of the EAT and efforts are made to ensure that the level of informality is such that representation is not necessary.  Members of the EAT will in practice give any assistance they can to parties appearing before them who are not legally represented.<\/p><p> Some parties engage legal representation and despite the efforts of the members to compensate for this, it is acknowledged that there may be a perception that it may be an advantage to be legally represented and a disadvantage not to be legally represented.  This is one of the reasons why the Minister proposes, in the reformed structure, to provide for a single adjudicator to hold hearings in private, similar to the Equality Tribunal and Rights Commissioner Service rather than the EAT model of a three-person tribunal held in public.  It is the Minister's aim that parties, while retaining the right to be legally represented, will have the confidence to represent themselves should they so wish.<\/p><p> The idea of introducing fees and a bond has been raised in the petition.  Having considered various suggestions on charging fees or putting in place bonds, the Minister does not propose, with one exception, to introduce fees or bonds.  It is the Minister's view that a bond as proposed, binding only one side, the employer, at the initial stage of a case would have the appearance of prejudicing the view of the neutrality and parity of esteem that the opposing sides would expect from the members in carrying out their duties.  The exception the Minister proposes is to charge a fee where a party appealing a decision of a WRC adjudicator failed to attend or be represented at the initial WRC adjudication hearing.  This can be refunded if the person can demonstrate to the Labour Court a valid reason for not attending.  This is based on experience where complaints are taken at a preliminary stage, are not contested, an award is made in favour of the complainant and at that state the respondent lodges an appeal to the Labour Court.  The aim is to ensure the process is cleared, as far as possible, at the lowest tier.<\/p><p> On waiting times, the EAT, like other tribunals, has seen a significant increase in its case load in recent years, as it is one of the front-line services directly impacted upon by the economic downturn.  The largest increase in claims has been in redundancy appeals but other types of claims have also increased.  Regrettably, this has increased the time it takes for a claimant to have his or her case heard.  All appeals are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgment with the tribunal.  The tribunal has been active in ensuring the resources allocated to it are used in an efficient manner and there is an ongoing review of how this is best done.  For example, divisions of the tribunal are sitting longer, hearing more cases per hearing and seeking to manage the case load to maximise efficiency.  This is reflected directly in the increase in the number of cases finalised by the tribunal over the last three years.<\/p><p> The tribunal is actively working to meet this challenge, notwithstanding the high level of claims in recent years and the administrative resources available.  However, as I have already stated, these waiting times are not acceptable and the Minister proposes that the WRC will put in place a target period of three months from the time a complaint is lodged until a hearing date in the new system. <\/p><p> On the enforcement or payment of awards made by the EAT, the tribunal has no role in the enforcement of its own awards.  Such awards may eventually fall to the civil courts for enforcement and in certain circumstances this process may be carried out on behalf of the Minister by the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA.  It is accepted that individuals who have had awards made in their favour by employment rights bodies, including the EAT, can experience difficulties in enforcing those awards where employers fail or refuse to pay such awards.  The Minister believes that any system of employment rights adjudication which is not backed up by an efficient and effective enforcement regime for successful complainants lacks credibility.  If employees who have been denied their statutory entitlements, and their representatives, are to have faith in the proposed new system, an effective, inexpensive and easily-navigated process must be put in place.<\/p><p> For this reason, the Minister is proposing, subject to advice from the Attorney General, to make provision in the workplace relations Bill for a new mechanism for enforcing awards of the WRC adjudicators and Labour Court determinations.  These measures will provide for more proportionate, efficient and effective enforcement of employment law.  If the decision of a WRC adjudication officer at first instance, or a determination of the Labour Court on appeal, remains unimplemented, the complainant may apply, in the former case to the WRC or, in the latter case, to the Labour Court, for a binding and enforceable determination order directing the respondent to comply within a specified period.  A determination order made by the WRC or Labour Court may be enforced by civil proceedings or criminal prosecution, or both.<\/p><p> Civil enforcement proceedings may be brought in the District Court by the employee concerned, his or her trade union or the director of the WRC.  They may apply to the District Court for an order directing the non-compliant employer to comply with the determination order.  If the applicant is granted the order sought by the District Court but the employer concerned continues to fail to comply, it will be open to the applicant - the employee or the director - to apply for an order of attachment and committal of the employer, plus an order for costs.  Criminal prosecutions may be brought by the director of the WRC in the District Court.  A successful conviction should carry an appropriate maximum fine and-or period of imprisonment.  In addition to securing the criminal prosecution, where an amount of money is owed by the non-compliant employer, the director will have the power to seek a compensation order in respect of the moneys due.  Finally, the legislation will make it mandatory, other than in specific exceptional circumstances, for the District Court to award the director&rsquo;s costs in bringing the prosecution.  The Minister is hopeful that the measures he proposes to introduce will provide successful complainants with an accessible and inexpensive means whereby recalcitrant respondents can be compelled to honour the award of the WRC adjudication service or of the Labour Court.<\/p><p> The petitioner has queried whether persons holding themselves out to be liquidators in Ireland are required to hold a particular qualification.  While there are certain disqualification provisions in the existing Companies Acts that apply to persons seeking to be appointed as liquidators, there are no requirements to hold particular professional qualifications or to have previous experience in this field to be appointed.  This unsatisfactory situation will be remedied in the Companies Bill 2012.  The Bill introduces a new qualification regime for liquidators.<\/p> <p>Its introduction is pursuant to the recommendations of the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, in this context, which noted that the intention of this proposed regime was to ensure that, to qualify to act as a liquidator, a person must be appropriately knowledgeable, experienced and generally fit and proper.<\/p><p> The qualification regime envisages five main categories of persons who will be qualified to act as liquidators.  Such a person may be described briefly as a practising member of a prescribed accountancy body; a solicitor holding a practising certificate; a member of a professional body recognised by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA; a person entitled to act as liquidator in another European state; and a person who makes a successful application to the IAASA within two years of the Bill's commencement.  In order to qualify under the final category, the person must demonstrate adequate relevant experience of the winding up of companies, previous employment in relevant work or previous practice in another European state as a liquidator, and be a person who, in the opinion of IAASA after consultation with the Director of the Office of Corporate Enforcement, is fit and proper to act as a liquidator.  When these provisions in the Bill become law, a person who acts as a liquidator without being qualified as I have outlined will be guilty of a criminal offence.  The Bill also requires liquidators to hold appropriate professional indemnity cover, in such terms as prescribed, before they can act as liquidators.<\/p><p> The Companies Bill 2012 passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 25 April 2013 and is due to proceed to Committee Stage in autumn of this year.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for allowing me the opportunity to make this presentation, which I hope has been of assistance.

I thank everybody for their contributions and submissions to this discussion, particularly John O&rsquo;Sullivan.  When his petition came before us it rang bells for many of us because we had seen similar situations occurring elsewhere.  As John Douglas has said, it rang bells for me in respect of the situation in Connolly Shoes in D&uacute;n Laoghaire where, like Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan, people have been fighting this unacceptable situation in which employers seem to be able, with a large degree of impunity, to ignore the decisions made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal at the expense of workers.  Something has to be done about this.<\/p><p>  The big question for me is what precisely can we do and I would like the people who have made proposals to flesh out their suggestions.  On the issue of the bond that Mr. O'Sullivan has proposed, how does he respond to the suggestion that this could become an unfair burden on employers as it creates a presumption of guilt on their part, or an unfair burden, because that is what IBEC seems to be saying?  I would like to hear IBEC respond to this point because I do not believe that there are huge numbers of vexatious complaints.  I do not think that people take complaints willy-nilly, for no reason at all.  Mr. O'Sullivan might give us some evidence to back that up.<\/p> <p>I ask Mr. Hegarty to give the committee some supporting evidence.  I would like to hear the opinions of the trade unions on Mr. O'Sullivan's proposal about the bond or the insurance scheme as against what I think Mr. Hegarty seems to be suggesting that amendments should be made to the Companies Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800011#N00300","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374142500,"counter":880,"content":"<p>No.  The Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Act, deals with those specific situations where individual workers - or groups of workers sometimes - fall without the narrow restrictive definitions of what constitutes an insolvency for the purposes of the application of that Act.  There are so many people outside of that.  There was a specific recommendation that had to do with amending and affording those people to come within the ambit of the Act.  The Deputy's question is how does one address access.  SIPTU and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have proposed that anything in the reformed Bill that adds costs associated to access - whether it be an enforcement or in prosecuting those cases through the various fora - is contrary to the entire premise under which these fora were set up.  As Mr. O'Sullivan rightly pointed out, these are to do with accessibility and its association with costs.  We raise costs at our peril.  We differ from IBEC in that regard and, indeed, with respect, from Mr. O'Sullivan.  We argue against any associated costs because they are a dissuasion from accessibility.  The move to hearing at a District Court level has been mooted and is progressive.  The costs associated with attendance at the District Court are less than a hearing at the Circuit Court.  Referring those enforcement procedures to the Labour Court would be a step better again in achieving the most complete accessibility and that is what we have proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800012#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vernon Hegarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1374142500,"counter":881,"content":"<p>I am interested to hear Mr. O'Sullivan's views on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800012#O00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1374142500,"counter":882,"content":"<p>I propose to take a few questions together before the responses.

Connolly Shoes workers have also raised the point with me.  We change the legislation dealing with the insolvency fund so that means - if I understand Mr. Hegarty correctly - that workers can at least get compensation quickly and it stops that blockage.  However, what about the employers who are getting away with murder?  Should there not be a way to chase them up?  We need to address that point also because it really grates with people.  It is not just a question of money, as Mr. O'Sullivan has said.  I know John Mulpetre from Connolly Shoes would make the same point that it is also about justice and the injustice of the public having to pick up the tab for an employer who just ignores the rules, plays fast and loose with the rules and shows complete contempt for the processes.  We need to look at how to address that and how to deal with companies or directors hiding behind limited liability and using shelf companies.  It is an absolute scandal.  What changes are needed in company law in order to address this situation?  If I remember correctly, the situation is similar to the Vita Cortex case with that boss hiding behind different corporate identities in order to evade his responsibilities.  <\/p><p>  I have a question for the representative from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Have we a slight reason to be concerned that the Department's reforms are just more cuts dressed up as reforms?  That might be my suspicious mind.  It is proposed to merging various bodies.  Like most people I am in favour of streamlining the process.  However, the proposal is that the waiting time will be three months as against the current 12 month and a move from three-person public hearings to one-person, one-to-one, private hearings.  It is proposed that this will be more efficient and a better system and that it will deal with a lot of these problems.  However, I am not quite sure how it could be.  Will it mean fewer resources will be allocated?  How can we be sure the targets will be achieved?  What is the reason for believing the one-to-one hearing is preferable?  I would like to hear more details about the proposals.<\/p><p>  How does the Minister's Department propose to deal with companies hiding behind limited liability and shelf companies?

I do not have a difficulty with a streamlining of the employment rights bodies and making them more effective for the employee and for the employer.  The new single body of first instance and the new appeals body can work well if properly structured.<\/p><p>  When will that Bill be before the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Workers and employers need to have certainty.<\/p><p>  I wish to make some observations and to ask questions arising from Mr. O'Sullivan's contribution and those of the witnesses.  The first three questions relate to penalties for employers who breach employment law sanctions currently in place or perhaps sanctions which are not in place, and the enforcement of awards.  Mr. Niall McCutcheon painted a picture of a service which is very easy to work with and is very worker-friendly.  That is not everyone's experience.  For example, it is not a level playing field for a young worker or any worker in a vulnerable position who takes a court case and is up against an employer's legal team.<\/p><p>  I can give a personal example.  When I was 20 years of age I took a case to one of the employment rights bodies.  I won my case and an award was made.  I had to go to the Circuit Court twice to have the award enforced.  I never received one single penny, despite the fact that the sheriff served notice on the employer.  I was not a member of a trade union at the time, which was my mistake.  I was a victim of that system and nothing much has changed in the past 20 years for the many people who find themselves in a similar situation.  I found it difficult to listen to the contribution from IBEC which referred to frivolous claims by workers.  Perhaps the representatives can give the committee a definition of what is a frivolous claim. <\/p><p>  On the question of costs, there may not be a cost involved in taking a case to an employment body as such, but there is a cost involved in terms of time off work.  Even if the claimant is represented by a trade union this is at a cost to the trade union which is passed on to the members through their subscriptions. People who are not members of trade unions will feel the need to have legal representation.  These are the associated costs.  I hope the new regime will correct some of those points.  The sanctions are certainly not strong enough for some employers who blatantly disregard employment rights law.<\/p> <p>On many occasions, unscrupulous employers simply do not pay their workers overtime, holiday pay, redundancy entitlements or whatever.  They do so in the full knowledge that the worst that can happen to them is that they will be brought before an employment rights body and asked to pay.  That is not good enough.  The sanctions are just not adequate and they do not encourage employers to do the right thing.  I hope this matter will be contemplated by the review that is taking place.  My experience in this regard is that the sanctions are not strong enough.  The enforcement measures certainly are not strong enough because in many instances awards have been made but these were not binding and were never enforced.<\/p><p> I brought forward a Private Members' Bill on informal insolvency.  The legislation in question was very straightforward in nature and would have allowed - in circumstances where a company is, to all intents and purposes, insolvent but where a liquidator has not been appointed - employees to access the insolvency fund.  At present, employees can take cases under the provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Act, they can be given awards and they know exactly that to which they are entitled.  However, they cannot apply for moneys under the insolvency fund and, as such, they find themselves in a legal limbo.  That is grossly unfair.  There is an opportunity, whether by means of the budget, the companies legislation or the proposed workplace relations Bill, to resolve this anomaly.  It simply cannot be allowed to be left unresolved.  If we do not use the budget or the legislation to which I refer in order to deal with this matter, it will be a major mistake on our part.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800012#O00600","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374143100,"counter":886,"content":"<p>I will address the point relating to frivolous and vexatious claims, which has been raised on a number of occasions.  This is an acknowledged problem and it is referenced in pretty much all employment legislation dating back to the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977.  More recently, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation referred to it in its Blueprint to Deliver A World-Class Workplace Relations Service.  In this document, the Department acknowledges that there are cases which are brought where, for whatever reason, the claimant chooses not to show up and prosecute the claim.  The employer is generally not on notice of this and shows up ready to defend the claim with witnesses in tow and he or she may also have retained legal representation at some expense.  In most cases there is no redress for them.  There are also instances where proceedings are brought and where the claimant shows up but where the actual claim is frivolous and vexatious.  I refer, for example, to a claim for a written statement of terms and conditions of employment where such a statement has already been provided.  Anecdotally, I can inform the committee that I have had that experience on a number of occasions.  That to which I refer does happen.  However, I would not state that it happens in the majority of cases but it does happen in a significant minority of them.  It happens often enough that it causes a problem for employers and needs to be addressed.  The point we made in our submission is that if employers are going to be forced to pay bonds prior to going before the EAT or some other forum, this could potentially lock them into an unenviable and invidious financial situation in respect of claims which ultimately will not even proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800013#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rhona Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374143100,"counter":887,"content":"<p>On vexatious cases, it has been my experience that the vast majority of no-shows are on the employers side.  Any workers who have ever attended the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be aware that it is a very daunting experience.  People do not submit claims lightly.  Rather they do so out of pure desperation in order to try to vindicate their rights, which have been abused.  There are huge human and social costs for people who lose their jobs as a result of unfair dismissal.  In the context of cases brought before the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, there are very few no-shows from the point of view of employees and, for all sorts of reasons, quite a number on the employers side.<\/p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the moral hazard of opening the gates to the insolvency fund.  There may very well be a moral hazard in that regard in that bad behaviour on the part of bad employers would be rewarded.  Ultimately, however, both employers and employees contribute to the fund.  If an employer or an employee fails to appeal an award within six weeks - or whatever period is specified - and it the employer fails to honour the award, we are of the view that the employee should not be disadvantaged or penalised any further and that he or she should have direct access to the social fund.  The State should prosecute employers who fail to honour awards.  Limited companies give rise to particular problems.  I refer not only to companies which are dormant and still on the books but also to those which are not dormant but which just refuse to pay.  The State should seek attachment orders in respect of these companies or perhaps it should even consider lifting the veil of limited liability away from their directors and making them personally liable for the payment of awards.  The latter might force directors to wind up their affairs in an orderly way.  In the case of companies which are insolvent, a carrot-and-stick approach must be used to encourage directors to wind them up in this way.<\/p><p>  The books kept by the Companies Registration Office are littered with companies that are dormant.  When these companies do not make returns, they are eventually struck off.  Essentially, this involves directors failing to wind up their business affairs in an orderly fashion and it can cause ongoing problems for employees in the context of vindicating their rights and obtaining awards.  I suggest that when the six-week appeal period has ended and an appeal has not been lodged by an employer and in the event of the employer or the limited company involved not paying the award which has been adjudicated on by the tribunal, the worker should have access to the insolvency fund.  The State should then step in on behalf of the worker and the taxpayer and pursue the directors personally in respect of the matter.  Such directors should have the veil of limited liability lifted away from them.  In such circumstances, directors would think twice about not paying awards or not winding up their business affairs - in the context of liquidations or receiverships - in an orderly manner.  I am of the view that what I have outlined would lead to a big improvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800013#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Douglas"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374143100,"counter":888,"content":"<p>In the context of the points raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett, I am of the view that there is not one single solution.  This is because the problem has different characteristics at different stages when an employee takes his or her complaint forward.  The petitioner is absolutely correct: there are 101 ways in which an employer can frustrate an employee in the context of his or her seeking justice.  In particular, an employer can make navigating the process such a stressful, expensive and difficult experience that the person involved will give up.  Even worse, the experience of such an individual can act as a warning to all other employees of what they will be obliged to face should they come forward to vindicate their employment rights.<\/p><p>  In the context of the expense involved, if a person is not a member of a trade union then he or she will be obliged to retain a legal representative.  The petitioner is again correct in this regard.  An ordinary person facing questions from a senior counsel sometimes 18 months to two years after the event can quite easily be tripped up and can lose his or her case on a technicality.  Provision must be made in order that people who are not represented by trade unions can obtain justice.  Where we differ from the petitioner is that the solution is not to offer costs against the losing party.  If the petitioner had lost his case, he would have been obliged to pay not only &euro;2,000 to his solicitor but also all of the costs incurred by the employer.  Imagine the chilling effect this could have on people, particularly if their dispute relates to one day's non-payment of <i>force majeure<\/i> leave.  While we would differ in terms of the solution, I am of the view that the petitioner is absolutely right in that the worst that will happen to an employer is that he, she or it will be obliged to do what should have been done in the first instance.  He was also right to state that compensation should be paid to the person taking the case in respect of the amount of stress he or she endured in pursing the matter.  The latter should be capable of being taken into account.<\/p><p>  The petitioner's idea with regard to a bond is a good one.  This goes to the second part of the problem, namely, the ease-of-doing-business regime which obtains in Ireland.  There are many benefits to this because it makes it really easy to establish companies.  However, the drawback is that it makes it very easy to establish companies.  Under the regime to which I refer, I could own a small shop on a street in some small town but I might be operating four different companies out of the premises.  These would be completely invisible to the naked eye.  A worker might be of the view that the person for whom he or she is working is his or her employer but this would not actually be the case because that individual is operating four separate companies.<\/p> <p>There are already bond regimes in place, for example, for holiday firms.  If one is bringing people away on holiday one must have a bond should one not be able to bring them home.  Similarly, if one is a company employing people, one is holding onto a month's unpaid wages, so that surely a bond similar to that type is not unreasonable if the company has no assets.  If a firm chooses not to have any assets to substantiate its liabilities against its employees I suggest it is not a ridiculous idea that a bond would be in place similar to the system that exists for holiday companies where people are at risk of having to fund themselves to return home.  A month&rsquo;s unpaid wages could result in someone losing his or her home.  There is a lot in the petitioner&rsquo;s suggestion to look at in terms of the bond.<\/p><p> I will not say much about insolvency because my two colleagues have covered it very well, only to say that the committee could make a suggestion to the Minister for Social Protection to introduce the changes in budget 2014.  She can already do it by means of changing the rules governing access to the fund.  Not allowing access to the fund is contrary to our responsibilities under the relevant EU directive.  I have provided a written note on the matter.<\/p><p> I agree with the petitioner that it is not a fair system that allows an employer to undertake all of this in order to cause frustration over a long period when the only thing they have to do is what they should have done two years previously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800013#P00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Esther Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374143700,"counter":890,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for their kind comments about the petition.  I submitted the petition and got involved in the Employment Appeals Tribunal due to frustration.  I went into the process with the belief that it was an informal, efficient and inexpensive means of finding a solution to my problem and I ended up with four years of total frustration, not on my behalf but on behalf of the employer.  I felt that there were many deficiencies in the system and so many doors closed against my getting justice at the end of the day.  The person who was responsible walked away and gave me, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the country, the fingers.  The person more or less said that having brought me through the process they were walking away and having a bloody good laugh at me.  That was my reason for making the petition, to try to highlight some of the inefficiencies and inadequacies in the system.<\/p><p>  Our friend from IBEC said an award could be made of two years&rsquo; salary.  The wording is that one &ldquo;may be&rdquo; awarded.  I have rarely seen a case of such an award.  The other issue is the time delay involved.  Going through the process has put enormous stress on my life and that of my family.  Only for my own ability and determination I would never have got a resolution.  At the end of the day the Department co-operated with me to find a solution but it was mainly due to the frustration caused by the system and my own ability and belief that I could get a resolution.  I said earlier that it was not about money, it was about justice.  I do not want to see other people going through the same process without having a door open for them.  The system is not in place for them to get a resolution in a quick and efficient way.<\/p><p>  It was said that I could have gone through the courts.  I did go through the courts but the person involved had moved from one door to another and when the sheriff arrived at his door he was told the man did not live there anymore, that he was no longer involved and he could not be touched.  That resulted in more frustration.  I had gone through the legal system.  I could have gone further but did not due to the stress involved and the cost, which is not within the ability of the ordinary person to pay.  The person who has lost a job having been employed for 20 years or 30 years who is fighting such a battle does not have either the finance or, with respect, the intelligence, to pursue the issue.  For that reason I made this representation in the hope that there could be changes in the law so that the onus would be put back on the person who is responsible at the end of the day - let it be the claimant or the employer.  In most cases if an employee is going to fight a case then he or she believes in all honesty that he or she is right.  There has been an insinuation that people do not turn up for cases but if they have genuine cases and believe they will get a quick and efficient response they will go through the process.  However, I hope they will not have to go through what I experienced, namely, four years, to get a solution and at the end of the day the person responsible took no responsibility and was not punished in any way and it ended up that the Government had to pay me my insolvency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800014#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1374143700,"counter":891,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Sullivan.

Deputy Boyd Barrett questioned me on the reason for the exercise and whether it was an exercise in cuts in disguise.  The initiative came very much from those who are involved in dealing with employment rights claims.  Five organisations have overlapping and sometimes completely separate objectives and operations.  Even experienced legal practitioners found the system difficult to comprehend.  Claims were often referred to the wrong forum or under the wrong statute.  Sometimes the claims became statute barred due to the delay.  There is a lack of consistency in some cases between the bodies and sometimes within the bodies regarding the procedures to be followed.<\/p><p>  The system is overly legalistic.  A set of circumstances may arise in respect of a single relationship between an employer and an employee which could give rise to claims within up to four different fora.  The idea is to try to pool the resources we have and to provide a service in which one hearing can dispose of all the disputes between a single employer and an employee.  That in itself is a good thing.  If one pools resources the situation would be more efficient and cost effective but the focus is not on saving money, as such.  The focus is on providing a better service for people such as the petitioner and employers and employees generally.<\/p><p>  Senator Cullinane inquired about the legislation.

Those who face it can lose their confidence in the system when jargon and acronyms are used at a session.  We can all fool ourselves that we are trying to create a system that is easy and accessible when in fact it is a difficult task.  I welcome the proposals on the establishment of a workplace relations commission.<\/p><p>  It is unfair of IBEC to suggest employees are confident in defending themselves.  It is risible to suggest that someone could become an expert in employment law immediately.  The argument it does not cost anything is also risible.  Of course, it costs the minute someone loses their job and has to take advice on how they might take on the apparatus of the State and their employer.

I would be very concerned, as the expression goes, that they would have the confidence to represent themselves.  I am not convinced that what we have seen in respect of this legislation will provide that.  The three months' waiting time is, again, a great aspiration.  Given what representatives from the Department have said about the great backlog for the EAT, without a serious effort to put something in place that would really take on that acknowledged backlog, I am not entirely convinced that we will see any improvement.

I feel we could be more creative rather than just ruling it out and saying \"No\" to a bond.  In its review and drafting of the legislation, could the Department commit to going back to see if there is another version of the bond or bond system?  While IBEC is very keen for employees to pay up-front, it is not so keen for employers to do anything in that regard.  It is encouraging a system whereby employees have to pay for the service.  I am happy that Ireland is an outlier in that matter and believe it should remain so and not charge people to take a case given all the problems that already exist for employees.  <\/p><p>  I am very welcoming of the procedure.

It is a long dent in the family, given one's preoccupation with an effort to achieve justice rather than law.<\/p><p>  I do not buy the claim about frivolous or nuisance appeals.  For example, companies often boast about getting 1,000 applications for one job, none of which are frivolous or nuisances.  People do not always follow up but unless they have submitted their applications, there is no chance of reaching the next step of a just and fair consideration.  I have first-hand experience, as do other members in their wider families, not just of employment appeal tribunals, but of annual assessments of jobs, particularly among trainees in professional services who may spend three or four years on trainee contracts.  Dysfunctional human behaviour in large organisations can be taken out on trainees.  In theory, there is an opportunity to get human relations managers to listen to reports of whatever has transpired.  In reality, the HR departments of large organisations are sanitising divisions for coercive-type behaviour.  I am telling the raw, truthful facts.  I have no ideological position on this matter.<\/p><p>  As organisations grow bigger, the chasm between justice and law grows wider.  We all know in our hearts and souls where justice lies, that being, in principles, not in law.  If principles are clearly set out, as in a family, we know that there is a better chance of having fairness in behaviour.  If there is a plethora of complex, preconditional and post-conditional rules, one will not get much fairness.  It is an illusion that the more complex the rules become by way of legislation, the greater the need for qualified experts to advocate various potential or theoretical positions.  We have seen this in the D&aacute;il in the past few weeks and now in the Seanad in the context of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.  We all know the principles involved, but they are getting lost in the maze of legislation.  If I was on a surgical table for a brain transplant - which my enemies would say I needed anyway - a heart operation or neurosurgery, the last aspect that I would want to insist on would be clarity by way of legislation for the surgeons involved.  Provided the surgeon is well trained, well principled and has the patient's best interests at heart, I am happy.  That is life.<\/p><p>  Similar to law and employment, most of the medicine practised is iatrogenic medicine.  Most people wonder what that is.  It is the medicine that clears up the misdiagnoses and earlier medical procedures of a doctor who dealt with the same patient.  The figure in America is 25%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800018#U00500","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1374145500,"counter":914,"content":"<p>Deputy Mathews has gone off topic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800018#U00600","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1374145500,"counter":915,"content":"<p>The same principles apply to employment situations.

However, employers are usually better resourced unless they have entered into difficulty.  Fairness and principles can still be achieved through just people listening to the facts of cases and eliminating delays.<\/p><p>  I commend Mr. O'Sullivan on his clear, concrete, seven-section document.  It addresses the realities.  With institutions and establishments, the danger is that people get lost in theories and hypothetical, abstract language.  I have nothing against certain personalities.  It is the way that language works.  This is like Leaders' Questions, as the Chairman knows.  Questions are asked in obtuse, obfuscated language in the third person and using the passive tense.  The answers are the same.  There is no engagement on ideas or communication.  Imagine if we used this language across the dinner table at home.  We would get nowhere and there would be rows, resentments, etc.<\/p><p>  The objective is to declutter.  If there are five establishments or institutions, we should knock heads and bring them together.  The people involved are well trained and well qualified.  Some of them have masters, PhDs or professional qualifications.  We should simplify.  For example, there are seven headings in this document.

I mean job loss, employment appeal or tribunal situations and other areas of annual appraisals.  For instance, the young doctors whom we saw on television.  It is absurd that they must work 24-hour non-stop stints.  I would be worried entering an accident and emergency unit if the doctor treating me had worked 24 hours.  Doctors are also under pressure to supply the middle management of the HSE with head count budgets of this and that procedure.  That is wrong, plain and simple.<\/p><p>  With regard to the establishment, I salute Mr. John O'Sullivan who has done his bit.  We must take a leaf from his doggedness, determination, honesty and fairness in what he did.  I know what it is like because I have fought those battles.  It is only when people realise that one is not going to give up and will continue to talk in true and fair terms that eventually turns the heavy iron door of the establishment and one is allowed enter.  Determination, etc., does not always work though in situations that can be replicated in large numbers, for example, making a claim with 25,000 people in similar circumstances.  In that instance the wagons form a circle and the establishment rejects the case until it becomes a major bomb or keg of dynamite with an ever shortening fuse.<\/p><p>  With regard to the defined benefit pension funds, we must be brave and courageous.  We must step up to the plate and describe the material in easily measured categories that are simple to understand.  Every picture of the people can be divided into 12 sections like a jigsaw which is put together to make a picture.  We can do the same for employment, training, appraisals and all of that.  There are everyday ways of making it sensible to measure, describe, discuss and reach agreements.  We should slim down the lever arch files to just six page documents with charts, pictures and bars in order to get a handle on what must be agreed, in principle, and then send the instructions and directions around to put the measures into effect. <\/p><p>  We must remember that the single person represents justice.  The establishment has multiple layers of professional qualifications and multi-head-counts so there will be huge case law.  That means that people will go around and build up costs.  The single individual can, in principle, just show the facts.  They are obvious to people who want to see them but that does not always happen.  There are always obstacles along the way.  The first could be a cost of entry.  There should not be a cost of entry.  One could think that a case did not become a formal complaint and, therefore, the first stage was nuisance, vexatious or frivolous but that would not be the case.  I would expect that way of thinking because people will learn that a claim is a bigger mountain to climb and he or she may have other things to do.  He or she might have had a new baby and will not want to waste four years of their lives banging their heads against the establishment.  <\/p><p>  Also, when people exist in this limbo of uncertainty, with questions all over the place, their peers begin to doubt them, and think they are odd and have a problem.  That is not fair either.  Sometimes there are twisted malevolent people in powerful middle management positions in the public service, private industry or whatever.  Those people are not nice and they are very hard to deal with.  They are malevolent and destructive.  I have outlined the things to watch out for and that is my full contribution with my new status.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800019#V00100","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1374146100,"counter":918,"content":"<p>I must cut the Deputy short and call Deputy Charles Flanagan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800019#V00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1374146100,"counter":919,"content":"<p>The vote I left the meeting to attend was turfing me out of the committee.

We will only do him a service if we conclude the hearing, if not today, or on a future occasion by seeing what progress we can make within the frame of the seven points as raised by Mr. O'Sullivan.<\/p><p>  I wish to bring the debate back to discussing remedies that the committee might pursue or provide for him.  I missed the start of Deputy Boyd Barrett's contribution and he may have raised the following matter.  It is essential that we examine statistics.<\/p><p>  I listened to the exchange between Ms Murphy and Mr. Douglas on frivolous claims, no-shows and non-compliance.  Surely the Department has a list of all of the cases and is in a position to say how many of them have been frivolous.  I do not mean those that are lodged with a frivolous objective.  I mean cases that have been ruled frivolous by a commissioner or a hearing conducted by the employment appeals tribunal.  We should also know the percentage of no-shows.  Are there no-shows on the part of the employer?  Are there no-shows on the part of the employee?  I am surprised that people have speculated about them and adopted positions.  We should know whether it was the employer or the employee.  These are matters of fact so lets have the details.  <\/p><p>  I wish to comment briefly on the difficult matter of costs.  I am anxious to see how the Department handles costs under the new regime.  It seems to me, in spite of what Ms Murphy has said, an employee may go to a hearing and be met by a senior counsel with tomes of law books and case law so he or she just does not stand a chance.  In the district court one does not have a senior counsel so it seems bizarre for senior counsel to appear at an employment appeals tribunal.  Does it happen?  I would say not.  However, the delegation is engaged in such appeals and has told me that it does happen.  It is a pretty poor show, in terms of justice, that somebody with no representation is pitted again senior counsel.  That is so unfair.  It would get an appeal off to a bad start and deters people lodging an appeal in the first instance.  <\/p><p>  I wish to make a brief point on bonds.  I have not been convinced by the argument made by the Minister that a bond is either ridiculous or introduces a lack of parity to the system.  I am not so sure that there is parity in the system <i>ab initio<\/i>.  What about a motor care situation?  The driver of the motor car is obliged to have insurance, the vehicle is obliged under law to be covered but that does not mean that the passenger needs insurance.  I remain unconvinced by the Minister's argument for the bond and Mr. O'Sullivan has made a good case.  The committee should follow up the matter.  The arguments put forward by the Minister are not watertight.  <\/p><p>  With regard to lifting the veil on incorporation and limited liability, Mr. Padraig Dooley mentioned an exemption.  Has the Department plans to expand and develop it further in the context of the company law review group?  I am sure the matter was referred to in terms of corporate responsibility as distinct from individual responsibility.  This is a huge issue because it strikes at the heart of the corporate entity.  If there is a way in which the Department feels it might be reasonable, in the circumstances, to expand and develop it regarding employee's rights and entitlement then we should examine the matter.<\/p><p>  It is good to see that a number of Mr. O'Sullivan's grievances have been dealt with under the new legislation.  For example, the appointment of the liquidators, the timing of the hearing in terms of the delay and the standard formula of awards.  It would be difficult to put the latter in standard form but I am sure that reference will be made, in the context of the legislation, to how the awards are formed in terms of the hearing. <\/p><p>  I wish to make a final point.  The issue here is not justice but the evasion of justice.  The law and the new legislation is based on justice.  It goes without saying that the law should be just, fair and reasonable.  What happens when one of the parties decides to opt out?  What sanctions will be applied?  How can we, as legislators, be assured that parties will play within the system at all times?<\/p> <p>The evasion of justice is the issue here and what this new Bill does to ensure that justice will not be evaded on a widescale basis.  <\/p><p> I again thank Mr. O'Sullivan who has done a service not only to himself and his fellow employees but has done some service to the system, having regard to the fact that his petition has been brought to us just as the new legislation is between Second Stage and Committee Stage.  This committee might keep an eye on it.  The legislation will not come before this committee but Committee Stage will be dealt with in an adjoining room.

This is a very interesting exposition not just of employment law but of company law, how it operates and how Mr. O'Sullivan and others like him have been affected.  Some of what he said will resonate with many people who find themselves in his situation.  They may not have looked into it as much as he has but none the less, he raises very interesting points.  I also welcome the other witnesses.<\/p><p>  Employment law is relatively recent compared to other areas of law, such as property law.  For the most part, employment law is about the rights of employees and creating those rights.  We have been brought up to speed since 1972 and our involvement in Europe, especially in the areas of equality between the sexes, pay and so on, and it has developed from there.<\/p><p>  A frustration has been expressed here in regard to the very technical nature of employment law.  There are reasons for that and there are broad principles underlining the whole employment law area based fundamentally, I suppose, in contract and then modified after that to avoid these broad principles constantly having to be interpreted in courts.  We have quasi-judicial bodies, such as the Employment Appeals Tribunal and rights commissioners, to examine a codified piece of legislation to establish rights.  That gets down to the nuts and bolts of things.  The demand is there for this level of detail in that these laws did not come about by accident.  We are not all suddenly here wondering why we have such a technical area of law.  It is there because of pressure to make the rights of employees clearer.<\/p><p>  Ms Murphy is here representing IBEC.  However, the vast majority of businesses in this country are SMEs and from my experience, many of them are as overwhelmed as Mr. O'Sullivan in dealing with the whole area of employment law.  These people may employ one person or two people.  Whether employers or employees, one can have rotten apples in both camps and I certainly have encountered that.  I practise as a solicitor and, to some extent, have seen it from both sides.  Many of these small businesses feel very oppressed by the obligations on them.  Even if one has an employee who is useless - excuse the word - at his or her job, it is very hard to get rid of him or her.  Obviously, that is not from where Mr. O'Sullivan is coming but it is the truth.  It takes up so much time and in the meantime one is trying to run one's business.  This is not an easy area.<\/p><p>  In partial defence of Ms Murphy, in terms of her language, we are always being reprimanded here for language and how politically correct-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800020#W00300","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1374146700,"counter":923,"content":"<p>Most of those elected to the D&aacute;il are intemperate from time to time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800020#W00400","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1374146700,"counter":924,"content":"<p>Exactly.  It does no harm.<\/p><p>  We also see frivolous cases being taken under the planning code, which can hold up projects.  That goes with the territory.  I would have to agree with Senator O'Keeffe in that regard.  It is daunting for employers.<\/p><p>  We are getting into all sorts of conundrums trying to protect against this situation.  Let us face it, we are not just talking about employees here.  We are talking about people who hide behind the corporate veil and do all sorts of things, which they seem to get away with.  People set up limited companies for no other reason than the fact they could trade in whatever way they liked.  There are laws that require them to conduct themselves in a certain way but we know that does not happen.<\/p><p>  Yesterday, we dealt with the Construction Contracts Bill and it is the same story.  People traded recklessly, to say the least, and left disaster in their wake.  I understand the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i> for company law.  All capitalist societies need to have it and we want to encourage people to speculate and be risk takers but there comes a point when we must acknowledge that the cost of that is externalised.  It is externalised for  Mr. O'Sullivan, for subcontractors who do not get paid and for the State which must trump up money from an insolvency fund but people get away with it.  It is not that many of these people who abuse the corporate veil are left destitute.  They are not left destitute because they are clever enough to have their assets transferred to a spouse or otherwise.  We see that happening.  <\/p><p>  As we evolve as a society, it is a challenge for us to lay down the gauntlet.  Our company law, in particular, has been responsible for cultivating a mind-set of recklessness, no more than the financial recklessness which went on in this country.  The larger the profile of the person, the harder it is to get him or her.  I welcome the comments that some of these things will be tackled, which is definitely overdue.  <\/p><p>  We are all very familiar with the painful stories of people who are in debt and who made the wrong decision about buying.  Many people bought their houses at wrong time and now face personal insolvency but they are taking responsibility for their actions.  It is not right for employers to act recklessly and think somebody else will pay the price for their adventures in business.  If we can curb that sort of thing, we are doing society a justice.  It costs time, money and effort when it is entertained.  We need to rethink this.<\/p><p>  Companies have been protected for too long by the corporate veil, which not pierced enough.  The Statute Book covers fraud, etc., and there is a fine line there but in terms of calibrating the rights and learning from the mess of the Celtic tiger, I hope this will be addressed in the company law legislation.  Dialogue is needed about responsibility in the broader sense.  <\/p><p>  I refer to some of the points raised by Mr. O'Sullivan, including damages and the concern that people are simply doing what they should have been doing in the first place.  I wonder about punitive or aggravated damages in this context.  The complaint was that there is not a standard formula which, I presume, leaves some discretion towards punitive-type damages.  There is only so far one can go with de-formalising these things because one is talking about somebody asserting a legal right.  There must, therefore, be a forensic examination of evidence to arrive at a well-grounded decision that somebody's rights have been breached.<\/p> <p> People have rights but they must be able to access them.  We are dealing with the issue of accessibility to rights.  From my experience of appearing before the Employment Appeals Tribunal compared to the District Court or the Circuit Court, it is a more relaxed format as the panel would encourage and draw out evidence from the person.   I do not discount for one moment that it may be traumatic at times for a lay litigant to appear before the EAT.  There must be a certain formality in the process.  I would have concerns if we move too far away from decisions being made in public.  We are already moving away from that in family law.  We know there is a downside to that.  Justice must operate in public.  The EAT is a quasi-judicial body that must conduct its hearings in public.  We need to know what is happening for a myriad of reasons.  I do not think we will ever get away from the formality, but there is an important reason for it.  No matter what aspect of the law one deals with, be it employment law or family law, if somebody does not want to help and wants to be awkward, they will succeed.  Under due process, time and space is allowed for litigants.  Litigants are allowed to make excuses.  I do not know how one would get away from it unless there is an ideal world, in which people do not employ those types of tactics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800020#W00500","speaker":"1070","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374147300,"counter":926,"content":"<p>Senator O'Keeffe had to leave for a vote, so I will allow Senator O'Keeffe and Deputy Mathews to ask questions only.<\/p><p>  I thank the witnesses for their patience.

I think companies have limited liability in place to deal with transactions and trading, so that if they go bad it does not expose the owners of the business to personal liability.

One is acting as an agent for that person or company.  It is a more complex relationship.  That must be mirrored in any thinking around fairness in this area.  When a person takes a case it brings major challenges to him or her because he or she is open to exposure at multiple levels, not just in the person's employment record but his or her personal situation comes under scrutiny as does everything about him or her.  It takes a great act of bravery and courage to go into this arena.  That must be expressly recognised.  Who wants to go before an Employment Appeals Tribunal?

I thank the Deputies for taking time from their busy schedule to come in to listen to our stories.<\/p><p>  I hope the committee will indulge me for about two minutes to refer to Deputy Mulherin's comment on special damages.  We have had a very good discussion about the problems and I hope the officials will bring back to the relevant Ministers the very serious problems that are being caused to ordinary citizens as workers in pursuing their rights, particularly when those rights have been adjudicated to be abused.  There is a man in the Visitors Gallery who is a member of Mandate trade union and he is lucky that we have the resources to prosecute his claim as far as necessary.  Mr. John Mulpeter went to work in Connolly Shoes in D&uacute;n Laoghaire 38 years ago.  He is not unusual in that three other members of staff had 38 years service.  His employer sacked all four staff on the one day back in 2010, without any reason whatsoever.  John has an excellent employee record.  He had never been on strike and had never had any disciplinary decisions against him but found himself unemployed.  Eventually in 2011 John Mulpeter ended up before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  He and the other three staff were represented by the Mandate trade union.  Mr. Mulpeter was awarded &euro;1,600.  His colleague with the same amount of service was awarded &euro;53,295 for unfair dismissals.  Both were sacked and had the same length of service, so one would ask why was there such a discrepancy?  The reason was this was a question of special damages. Mr. John Mulpeter suffered a heart attack due to the stress of being sacked and being on the picket line.  John was not therefore adjudicated by the trade union to be available for work, so therefore he suffered no loss.  Not only was he penalised by losing his job but because he suffered a heart attack due to the stress of losing his job, his award was more or less wiped out.<\/p><p>  Mr. Mulpeter is still picketing that store one day a week.  We can get neither his &euro;1,600 award nor the &euro;53,295 for the other three members of staff, Mr. Pat Byrne, Damian Keegan and Susan Tighe.  As far as Mr. Mulpeter and his fellow workers were concerned, they worked for Connolly Shoes but when we lifted the veil of corporate secrecy behind those companies, we discovered there were five companies.  John Mulpeter and his colleagues worked for a company with no assets, which still makes an annual return every year to the Company Registration Office, with a return of zero in trading and the same list of directors.  It is not insolvent, it has not been placed in insolvency, so therefore Mr. Mulpeter has no access to his rights.  We have an enforcement order on behalf of Mr. Mulpeter and his colleagues.  The Sheriff has been down to the shop.  The employer picks out a receipt and shows that the stock on the shelves is owned by the company named on the receipt, the premises is owned by a different company and the order the sheriff has is against a company which has not assets.  The only thing that remains for the trade union to do on Mr. Mulpeter's behalf is to go to the High Court, at great expense, but we will do it, to wind that company up to give Mr. Mulpeter and his colleagues access to the insolvency fund.<\/p><p>  Why should bad behaviour be rewarded?  Why should the State not put a charge on that company and its directors?  Why should those directors not be banned from ever serving as a company director again?  There are associated companies all over the place linked to that company to which the assets have been moved.<\/p> <p> This is about the little person, the worker.  Workers should have access to address their concerns and to right wrongs.  If workers, who are not members of unions or do not have the means, as the vast majority do not, to employ barristers and solicitors and go to the Circuit or High Courts to get enforcement orders, it is a sad day.  I ask the officials who are here today to consider this in the review of any legislation.  This is not frivolous.  John Mulpeter is not frivolous.  He has put his health, his well-being and family on the line for the past three years trying to prosecute his rights.  He has been run into a cul-de-sac by the legislation.  That legislation can be opened up so that he can get his entitlement.  No other worker, in this building here, or anywhere else, should have to suffer what he had to suffer.  I ask that the message from this committee and the Department officials back to the relevant Ministers is a strong one, that this practice be opened up and that this veil of protection for corporate directors in limited liability companies be removed immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800021#X00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Douglas","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374147900,"counter":933,"content":"<p>The workers are not little people.

The Rights Commissioner hearings at the moment are all in private.  There is a good reason for that.  In many of these cases we want to maintain the relationship between the employer and employee which is an ongoing relationship.  The type of approach there should involve mediation and getting to an agreed solution, exactly the type of thing about which we have been talking.  There is a strong argument that this happens better in a private rather than a public, adversarial arrangement.  All appeals should be in public.<\/p><p>  The big change we have seen in recent years is Google.  It used to be that if one took a case against one&rsquo;s employer that information would not go very far and would not appear on every search that every employer in the future did on one.  No matter whether the person wins or loses a case an employer will say the person is trouble and will not want to employ him or her.  There are new developments and existing practices, both of which happen in private.

Unfortunately, we do not have those figures.  We looked for them but they do not seem to be captured by any of the annual reports that we searched.  We did find insight into the level of legal representation that occurs in the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  As I mentioned briefly earlier, that is approximately 50% and interestingly, the split is relatively even between employers and employees choosing to have legal representation.<\/p><p>  I would also like to thank the committee for the opportunity to be here and to present IBEC&rsquo;s views on the issues raised.  We have heard some difficult individual stories and cases but in the vast majority of cases employers attend these fora.  In the event that an award is made against them most of the time it is paid.  I do not accept the suggestion that HR departments are sanitising divisions for coercive behaviour.  Most of the time they are just paying people&rsquo;s wages, advising them of their maternity protection rights, looking out for their health and safety, paying their pensions.  The notion that this is a routine thing is absolutely wrong.  I ask that this be borne in mind before we rush to action on issues such as piercing the corporate veil and the chilling effect that would have on employment.  The presentation of bonds would be an issue too, as would punitive damages.  All of these things have an impact on other people within their place of employment.  I urge caution and balance before any decisions like that are made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800022#Y01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Rhona Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374147900,"counter":947,"content":"<p>I thank all the people who have participated in this discussion.

We would welcome any suggested amendments to be considered in the context of those Bills.<\/p><p>  In response to the specific questions about the time it takes to process cases and the target in the Minister&rsquo;s plan of three months between receipt of a complaint and the scheduling of a hearing, it is a challenging target but it has already been achieved in the Rights Commissioner hearings.  There has been huge progress there.  At one stage not that long ago it took eight months to get an acknowledgement of a complaint being lodged to the Rights Commissioner service.  At the beginning of this year this was down as low as five days.  Significant productivity gains have been made and will continue to be made.  It will be a challenging target but it is necessary for people to know in order to have confidence in the system that they will get an early hearing of their complaint.<\/p><p>  I would also like to emphasise the option of alternative dispute resolution and mediation which will be open to all complaints under this system.  At the moment this provides a very quick process in the Equality Tribunal which has had mediation for ten years.  Mediations are scheduled within three months.  It provides a completely confidential process in which all the issues can be put on the table.  The outcome is a confidential agreement which is legally binding and enforceable.  It provides, from the points of view of both the reasonable employer and the employee, an opportunity to resolve their differences and to repair the relationship without going into a more legal forum.  We find in the Equality Tribunal that 50% of cases that go to mediation end there. They are resolved at mediation or the party taking the complaint realises that they do not have a strong case and withdraws.  Sometimes the parties meet outside the mediation room and resolve the matter between themselves directly.  I strongly recommend that all parties seriously consider the option of mediation or alternative dispute resolution which will be available under all headings of employment law under the new structure. <\/p><p>  On the bond issue we will take all the points that have been raised here back to the Minister for consideration, including the proposals that the petitioner made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013071800022#Y01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall McCutcheon"},{"type":"speech","time":1374147900,"counter":948,"content":"<p>In light of the fact that the figures are not captured, as IBEC has told us, is there a way in which that might now be done?

I regret any difficulties which may have arisen for the committee in the context of our unavailability for the other proposed dates for this meeting.<\/p><p>  CIE is continuing to experience extreme difficulties from a financial perspective.  These difficulties can be categorised into two areas, namely, cash and financial losses.  In early 2012 the cumulative effect of five years of reducing demand for public transport, reductions in public service obligation payments, the increased cost of fuel, significant losses from operations and other economic factors led to a serious cash shortage in the group.  As a result, CIE, working closely with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and building on existing cost reduction programmes, implemented a range of actions during the period to address this situation.  These included: obtaining an advance on public service obligation payments and the acceleration of Exchequer grants claims process; strengthening the board's oversight of cash management; and the establishment of a centralised disbursement policy.  We particularly strengthened the cash management processes and procedures.  These actions, together with the sale of our interest in Spencer Dock and the provision by Government of an additional &euro;36 million in funding in 2012, stabilised the cash position.  At the same time, we engaged in discussions on securing renewed banking facilities.  I am pleased to inform the committee that those discussions have concluded and that renewed and extended banking facilities are now in place.  However, these facilities do not solve the totality of our financial difficulties - far from it.<\/p><p>  The availability of the funding is dependent on our fulfilling financial covenants in respect of the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation, EBITDA.  The latter is a normal process in the context of the banks.  The four financial institutions with which we have arranged banking facilities require us to meet key performance benchmarks in respect of growing revenue and reducing costs, particularly those relating to payroll, and returning a projected EBITDA from our operations.  To put it simply, if we fail to meet the targets contained in the covenants, there will be less funding available to us and we will return to the crisis we faced last year.  Obviously, this is something we wish to avoid at all costs.<\/p><p>  The company has incurred ongoing financial losses in recent years, including a &euro;31 million operating loss in 2012.  While the cost base has been reduced by &euro;133 million since 2008, this has been insufficient in the context of offsetting the cumulative effect of reductions in subvention and revenue.  The CIE Group must continue to implement a range of corrective actions to reduce its costs and increase revenue.  To this end, the current pay and productivity proposals being progressed within the three operating companies are essential to our ongoing financial sustainability.  Given that these proposals are currently being negotiated or balloted upon, I hope the committee will understand that it would be inappropriate to comment on them at this time.  We are also in the process of reviewing the strategies for all three companies and the group to meet the challenges ahead and to increase our revenues.<\/p><p>  There are some grounds for cautious optimism.  Revenue and passenger numbers, which had been falling since the onset of the economic crisis, stabilised in 2012.  Modest growth in revenue has been recorded, as well as stability in passenger numbers, since the latter half of last year.  As with all enterprises operating in the Irish economy, a return to growth and stability would have a direct beneficial impact on revenues.<\/p><p>  From a service delivery perspective, I am pleased to advise the committee that we continue to maintain a comprehensive network of services to communities and that significant improvements have been made across all of the companies.<\/p> <p>I will leave it to the individual CEOs to outline those improvements.<\/p><p> Overseas, CIE Tours International continues to be the largest single generator of inbound tourism from the key market of North America.  It saw a 9.3% increase in visitor numbers in 2012 and 2013 looks on target to be a bumper year for CIE Tours International.  The CIE Group as a whole is supporting The Gathering by offering tourists tickets for three days and seven days.<\/p><p> Looking to the future, with the measures we have outlined we are on target to reduce our operating losses in 2013 and the group has a clear plan to extricate itself from the difficulties in 2013 and 2014.  We have the support of the Minister, the Department, the banks and staff.<\/p><p> Overall, the challenges facing CIE continue to be significant.  Nobody should underestimate the task ahead to ensure that the CIE group returns to financial stability.  However, I am confident that all the stakeholders working together, taking the necessary and at times difficult actions needed, can achieve stability for the benefit of staff, customers and communities for whom our public transport service is essential to their daily lives.  I wish to hand over to Mr. Paddy Doherty, CEO of Dublin Bus, to talk about some of the improvements that have been made in the bus company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071800003#B01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Vivienne Jupp","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374154800,"counter":977,"content":"<p>I am conscious that the contributions were circulated to all members prior to the meeting.

Our losses compared to 2011 reduced from &euro;18 million to &euro;9 million and after the additional subvention that was further reduced to &euro;3.8 million.  There was also good progress in terms of passenger numbers, which stabilised and started to grow towards the latter end of the year.  I will outline some of the major contributors to that. The completion of Network Direct was a huge project and we finished it during 2012.  It has radically transformed the bus network in Dublin.  Some of the attributes of the new network are outlined in the written submission.  I will not go through them but the new network is a significant contributor to the changed trends in passenger numbers.<\/p><p>  In terms of the contract with the National Transport Authority, NTA, we met all the customer service targets set in the NTA contract throughout the year.  They are independently audited and verified.  We got 80 new buses last year and many of their new features are outlined in the written submission.  We also achieved what was a major milestone for the company in reaching 100% accessibility.  We have probably one of the best equipped fleets in Europe in terms of accessibility for people with disabilities.<\/p><p>  Real time information was also a big boon which was introduced at the start of the year.  It is now available on apps and on the web at approximately 500 stops around the city.  Anyone who uses buses will agree that it has transformed the entire experience of using them.  The system is progressing this year.<\/p><p>  The Leap card was introduced last year.  It is part of a major development programme which will come together towards the end of this year.  Towards the end of the year we were getting 200,000 journeys per week on Leap.  We promoted all of that and it has contributed to a stabilisation of our numbers and growth into 2013.<\/p><p>  Moving into 2013, as I said, passenger numbers have stabilised.  The last few periods are showing good growth and there is strong positive evidence.  Revenues are strong.  We are behind on expenditure at the moment because, as the chairman outlined, we are finalising a cost reduction programme.  That will contribute to an outturn this year of a &euro;2.8 million operating loss.  We have had a very steady year-on-year financial programme.<\/p><p>  In terms of customer service for 2013, we are continuing with many of the positive initiatives I have mentioned and we are meeting our targets.  We will get a further 80 buses this year.  A total of 400,000 real time passenger information, RTPI, apps have now been downloaded.  The NTA has introduced a journey planner which makes it easier to figure out the new network.  Leap cards continue to expand.  We intend to have Wi-Fi on all of our buses by the end of the year which, again, is a big plus for the customer.  We are also developing interior announcements, both audio and video.  The NTA is keen on traffic signal priority for buses, as are we, which again will provide a time benefit for passengers.  It will be a big challenge for us to work with the NTA and Dublin City Council on the Luas cross-city project and make sure that all of the benefits are maintained through the programme.<\/p><p>  Looking forward into 2014, it is our target to break even and to make a small profit.  We will do that through the continuation of the programmes I have outlined.  Our objective is the retention of the NTA contract and the retention of our role as a pivotal part of Dublin city.  We must work through the Luas cross-city development and make sure we achieve all our objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071800004#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Doherty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374154800,"counter":981,"content":"<p>I will summarise my contribution.  I was here in October when I gave a comprehensive briefing of the company&rsquo;s financial position and an overview of the national coach and bus market.<\/p><p>  I am happy to update the committee on those matters.  Everyone will know that Bus &Eacute;ireann not only provides a public service in provincial cities but also provides the school transport system and the inter-city commercial services.  Last year we had more than 77 million passenger journeys across 6,300 routes in the State.  In recent years, due to the efforts of all of our employees, we have improved our services, which has resulted in a high level of customer satisfaction and a return to growth in customer numbers.  Our financial situation reflects the reduction in State funding, continued economic stagnation, increased fuel costs and growing inter-city competition.  We recorded a loss of &euro;6.2 million in 2012.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that in 2009 the Government&rsquo;s value for money report said that we were as efficient as our European counterparts.  Since then our subvention has been reduced by 30%, passenger numbers have dropped by more than 20% and fuel costs have increased by &euro;14 million.  We have reacted to the situation by reducing our cost base by more than &euro;35 million while managing to largely protect service levels.  We are implementing a plan to save a further approximately &euro;20 million, including our recent agreement with the trade unions.  That will bring ongoing efficiencies which will result in us breaking even by the end of the year.  Separately, we have also delivered more than &euro;25 million in savings to the Department of Education and Skills on the school transport scheme.  That has been reinvested largely in services, particularly for special needs.<\/p><p>  We have seen improvements in Wi-Fi, and new vehicles on city, commuter and inter-city services.  We have rolled out networks in the provincial cities, resulting in greater passenger usage, and introduced the RTPI in provincial cities.  We started our Leap card journey in the greater Dublin area and we will roll it out to Cork.  Our apps and social media are up and running and we also have a large loyalty scheme that offers regular discounts to encourage travel.<\/p><p>  I will quickly go through the inter-city market.  It is important to note there is no State funding in the inter-city market, which is subject to significant competition.  The competitors operate a limited-stop service that bypasses locations served by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  In response, the company has had to continue to make changes on those routes to meet the demand from the majority of our inter-city customers for shorter journey times and a limited number of stops.  We have kept commercial services going in many locations for many years despite the low levels of use, but given the economic situation in the country, the new motorway network and cherry-picking of the profitable element of routes by competitors, unfortunately, that is no longer possible in some cases.  We are working with the NTA to offer alternatives but there is limited State funding available for such services.<\/p><p>  As a result of the work outlined above, we are starting to see more and more people using our services.  In 2012, overall passenger numbers were up.  City usage was up 2% and inter-city customer numbers increased by 4%.  So far this year the growth in customer numbers has continued.  We will meet all performance targets for the NTA and we will also deliver on all of the value for money review findings for the school transport scheme.<\/p><p>  There is no doubt the past few years have been challenging for the company, with reduced State funding, increased costs and greater competition.  However, despite that, we have maintained as many services as possible, particularly in areas where there is no alternative for people.  While we are still facing significant challenges, with our cost agreement now in place, a continued strong focus on reducing costs and increasing passenger numbers and greater commercial freedom to make the necessary changes on our inter-city services, the company is now in a much stronger position and its target is to come close to breaking even by the end of the year and returning to profitability in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071800004#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1374155400,"counter":982,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nolan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071800005#D00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374155400,"counter":983,"content":"<p>In 2012 Irish Rail recorded an operating loss of &euro;22.5 million, and that was after the supplementary Exchequer payment that was made.  In the past five years, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has had its subvention levels reduced by one third, &euro;64 million.  At the same time, during the very difficult economic situation in Ireland, we have seen passenger revenues drop by almost &euro;35 million, a fall of 16%.  To address this combined income shortfall of almost &euro;100 million, we have been working with our staff to reduce costs.  We have successfully reduced these by almost &euro;67 million.  This has more than compensated for the fall in the passenger revenues but it has not been nearly enough to deal with the large reduction in subvention.  Despite this very difficult financial position, we have maintained the majority of services.  Examples of the measures we have taken include a voluntary severance programme, which has reduced the workforce by almost 25% since 2008.  We now employ just fewer than 3,800 people, compared with 6,000 ten years ago.  We have agreed efficiency measures with our staff and negotiated reductions in overtime levels, allowances and leave benefits.  We have also taken action to reduce one of our other big cost areas, fuel consumption, which of course yields environmental benefits.  We have re-tendered major contracts to achieve cost reductions from suppliers.<\/p><p>  The committee will be aware that proposals are being balloted among our staff, which will deliver further efficiency measures, including reductions in basic pay, with the underlying principle that those who earn the most will contribute more.  A successful outcome is critical to achieving our financial goals and the requirements of our banks, not only in 2013 but up to 2017, when our projections will show we aim to break even.<\/p><p>  We have seen fare increases.  These have been balanced by promotional activity, including advance-purchase discounts and special offers for students and families.  The introduction of the Leap card and Taxsaver products has also resulted in large discounts for customers.  It is good to note that according to our most recent customer satisfaction survey, these offers have helped to drive a significant improvement in the value for money score, which is up ten percentage points.<\/p><p>  Despite the current funding environment, we remain ambitious about the future of the rail network and the role it can play in meeting the economic and mobility needs of the country.  To that end, further significant intercity journey time improvements are a key priority for us.  The economic benefits of these have been clearly identified by the AECOM study carried out on behalf of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2011.  Other priorities for us include the DART expansion projects, including the DART underground line, the electrification of the Maynooth, Hazelhatch and northern lines and the opening of a DART airport link.  We would welcome the committee's support for each of these projects as the Government prepares to assess its investment priorities in 2015.<\/p><p>  In summary, we have been through an era of significant change.  We have an upgraded network, one of the youngest fleets in Europe and new customer facilities.  We are running more trains with a reduced workforce while at the same time delivering record punctuality.  However, our financial position remains extremely challenging and must be addressed.  We must continue to improve our services if we are to compete effectively with the improved motorway network.  The cost-reduction measures are crucial to ensuring that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann plays the strongest possible role in delivering a high-quality public transport network for Ireland and most of all for our customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071800005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Franks"},{"type":"speech","time":1374155400,"counter":984,"content":"<p>I thank the delegations for their presentations and for articulating the many issues they are dealing with and the challenges they face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071800005#D00400","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1374155400,"counter":985,"content":"<p>I welcome the three chief executives.

There was much concern last year when CIE came back to the Government looking for an additional &euro;35 million outside the profile that existed and that had been presented by way of a budget for the year.  The Department was able to find it within its overall budget but it was an unsavoury situation.<\/p><p>  The reason we issued this invitation several weeks ago was to ensure the same was not on the horizon again.  I am deeply disappointed it took so long for the witnesses to attend the committee.  There has been a very good working relationship between this committee and the three companies within CIE and the overall board of CIE.  I have sat on this committee since 2002 and this is the first time we have had any difficulty with CIE in terms of coming before the committee.  We often had issues before but they were dealt with to the best of everybody's ability.<\/p><p>  Will Ms Jupp indicate the projected deficit for CIE in 2013?  What will the reduction in the subvention do to the overall integrated network situation?  Has CIE devised a plan to present to the Government to show how it intends to protect the entire network as it exists, recognising the reduction in subvention?  Has it made any appeals to the Government with regard to the necessity of increasing subventions in line with the reduction in its fare-box and commercial activity, notwithstanding Mr. Doherty&rsquo;s indication that there seems to be an upward trajectory in that regard?<\/p><p>  In terms of the company's negotiation with the unions, which is clearly an exceptionally important element in recalibrating the cost base, has Ms Jupp met any of the trade union leaders?  Have any of the chairmen of the three companies met the trade unions in an effort to build a consensus around cost reduction while at the same time protecting the integrated network that exists between the three companies?<\/p><p>  It is clear that the future viability of CIE as a public transport company hangs in the balance.  There is nothing particularly new about that statement.  What actions has the company taken to try to ensure its viability?  There has been some talk in the media about the potential sale of the Expressway service.  Can Ms Jupp indicate what discussions it has had with Government about that?  There is talk about part-privatisation of 10% to 15% of Dublin Bus routes.  Will Ms Jupp indicate how she thinks that will improve the viability of the company?  There is also talk about Bus &Eacute;ireann, in an open tendering environment, having to tender for some of the public service obligation, PSO, routes.  Will Ms Jupp indicate how that might improve the financial viability of the Bus &Eacute;ireann wing of the company?  It is clear that the missing piece of the jigsaw is the subvention.  We have various reports from the companies over several years of a progressive approach to cost reduction, which is welcome.  However, I am not so sure that CIE is fighting the battle to the extent it should with the Government around demanding an increased subvention to meet the needs of retaining an integrated public transport system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071800005#D00700","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374156000,"counter":988,"content":"<p>First, let me say that I regret any difficulties we caused the committee.  On the various dates that were proposed, at least one of this group was unavailable.  I also had concerns about the discussions that were ongoing with our unions at this particular time.  I spoke to the Acting Chairman and he understood those concerns and we were able to attend today.  I asked the CEO of Dublin Bus to rearrange some leave so he could be here today.  I will put that on the record by way of background.<\/p><p>  In respect of the financial position of CIE, many things have contributed to where we are today and there are many things we are doing to extricate ourselves from that.  The overall economic situation has a major impact on us and our business generally tracks consumer spending.  As it goes down, spending on public transport also goes down.  We then had the reduction in the PSO, and one can see around the garages at the moment that fuel prices have gone up again.  These are all very difficult things for us to negotiate our way through but we have done a significant amount in taking costs out of the business.  As everybody said, they have been able to match broadly the reduction in revenue, but on top of that we have had the PSO reduction and the fuel price increases.  Obviously, we understand the overall situation the Government is in and so we have been making our point about the impact of the reduction in subvention in the context of the broader picture.  We must understand where we sit versus everything else and the decisions made at that level.  <\/p><p>  In terms of the actions we are taking, our goal is to continue to provide a comprehensive service to our customers and communities around the country.  We continue to work on that.  Given the capacity we have, our focus is to try to drive extra passengers onto all of our service offerings.  Many measures have been put in place which we are highlighting to our customers to encourage them to come back to public transport.  There are apps on all mobile phones that can tell one when a bus or train is due, which is a great advantage to people.  Wi-Fi internet connections are broadly available, which means that when one is sitting on a train or bus, one can do some work.  We are making our customers aware of that and in the past six to nine months we have seen an improvement in the passenger numbers and, therefore, in revenue.  <\/p><p>  In respect of union negotiations, it would probably be fair to ask the individual companies that take prime responsibility for negotiating with our unions to outline their comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071800006#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Vivienne Jupp"},{"type":"speech","time":1374156000,"counter":989,"content":"<p>To clarify matters, I asked whether Ms Jupp or any of the chairpersons of the individual companies has had any meetings with the unions.

From June 2013, we will look at the service profile, demand, anticipated revenue, fares and expenditure.

We have heard how each company is hoping to break even by 2014 or 2015.  A return to profitability was mentioned.  Was the PSO part of that profitability?  The PSO was higher in the past.  In Bus &Eacute;ireann it has been cut by 30%.  It is not a level playing field in the sense that there was a different PSO.  Will the witnesses comment on that?<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, recently said 10% of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann routes would be put out to private tender.  We have already had cherry picking of some of the very viable routes.  With Dublin Bus we have also seen many areas without a bus service, including in my area, where we have no buses going from Finglas village to the north of Finglas.  That probably means we will see more of the same and many places will have services cut.  I am very concerned about that.  Is it realistic to say we will break even without a proper PSO on an ongoing basis?  Will we eventually get rid of the PSO or are we stuck with it?  Most countries operate that way.<\/p><p>  The school transport system was cut by &euro;25 million.  Now we are told rural transport is to be reviewed.  A value-for-money review of school transport proved that it was highly efficient.  If there are any further cuts in that area, it will have a massive impact across the country.  I do not know whether there has been any input from the witnesses in regard to the Minister's comments about re-examining rural transport.<\/p><p>  There have been massive strides in the area of wheelchair accessibility in Dublin, particularly in Dublin Bus.  Does that reflect the rest of the country, such as Cork and Limerick?  I would like to get an overall picture of how they are faring compared to Dublin.  Dublin has almost 100% accessibility with Dublin Bus.  Do Bus &Eacute;ireann and other companies pay tolls?  If so, how much do they cost?  I assume reimbursement of fuel is on the agenda because it is a significant issue.  I hope the Minister would allow a cut, as has been done for the road haulage industry, on the cost of fuel.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on that.  Will Dublin Bus incur losses as a result of the construction of the cross-city Luas, which is coming up?  How do we plan to address that?  Is it factored into our thoughts?<\/p><p>  There have been many short-term sell-offs, which the witnesses mentioned.  Are they camouflaging the figures?

The deficits in both of these schemes increased hugely during 2012 as the discount rate used to value future the pension liabilities of these schemes fell in line with bond yields in the market.  This decrease in bond yields increased the future costs of these liabilities.  We have submitted our funding proposal to meet the minimum funding standard and that has gone to the Pensions Board.  We await a response from the Pensions Board to the proposals we have put forward.<\/p><p>  In regard to the other questions the Deputy asked, I will ask Mr. Franks to talk about revenue protection officers and their role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013071800010#J01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Vivienne Jupp"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1374158400,"counter":1038,"content":"<p>One of the key initiatives I have implemented since I joined Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is to put a real focus on trying to collect the revenue due to us.

We brought in an international study group and it found we were as efficient as any of our peers.  Since then, our subvention has gone down by 30%.  The private operators are more commercial and more business-oriented.  The inter-city business shows that up.  We still go into the towns and villages at no additional cost to the State and we try to do that as much as we can.  Some of the rot is caused by our acting in the national interest.  The private operators are serving the larger population centres so we need to do that as well, and that will cause us to bypass locations.  We need that commercial freedom because we cannot run a loss-making service against other providers that do not get funds from the State.<\/p><p>  Private bus operators have various groupings.

We started off with approximately 170 individual route numbers and we have reduced it to something of the order of 115.  It does not mean we have taken out routes or services.  As the Deputy will know, we had duplicated areas and we amended and redesigned so that, by and large, we cover the same catchment and population.  We provide a service across the whole community but it is a lot more simple now.
