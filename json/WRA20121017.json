The numbers are horrifying &ndash; more than 19,000 killed in the violence, 2.5 million people in Syria in desperate need of assistance, over 1.2 million Syrians displaced within their own country and over quarter of a million Syrians now refugees in neighbouring countries.  Recent reports have described indiscriminate shelling of densely populated areas, excessive use of force and random targeting of innocent civilians.  There is urgent need for additional food, medical care and shelter as we face into the harsh winter months.  Particular concern has been expressed for the 500,000 Palestinian and 100,000 Iraqi refugees living in Syria. <\/p><p>  My colleague Minister of State, Joe Costello visited the region in August to witness firsthand the humanitarian consequences of this devastating crisis.  In Za&rsquo;atari refugee camp, 80 kilometres north of the Jordanian capital Amman, close to the Syrian border, he heard directly from Syrians who had recently fled the violence. <\/p><p>  The Minister also saw how the staff of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the agency responsible for the camp, was struggling with limited resources to provide even the most basic services such as shelter, food and water.<\/p><p>  In meetings with the Jordanian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Nasser Judeh, the Jordanian Minister for Planning and International Cooperation, Dr. Jafar Hassan, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, Minister Costello was briefed on how this refugee burden is placing huge pressure on their country &ndash; one with a high pre-existing refugee population coupled with severe resource constraints. <\/p><p>  As early as March this year, Ireland provided &euro;500,000 in emergency funding to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the UNHCR and the World Food Programme to provide life saving assistance inside Syria and in the neighbouring region. <\/p><p>  Informed by the Government&rsquo;s visit to Jordan, in August we were able to mobilise an additional &euro;1.6 million of humanitarian assistance to the International Committee of the Red Cross, UNHCR, the World Health Organisation and the International Rescue Committee.<\/p><p>  In advance of the approaching winter, Ireland has allocated an added &euro;150,000 in non-food items for the UNHCR from our Rapid Response stocks in Dubai.  Since March this year Ireland has therefore provided &euro;2.25 million in humanitarian assistance. <\/p><p>  Even if the reality on the ground is disheartening, we must continue to promote a peaceful settlement with the ultimate aim of political transition in Syria. Ireland is fully supportive of the newly appointed UN\/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, and his efforts to negotiate a ceasefire and chart a political path ahead.  <\/p><p>  In parallel, international pressure needs to be maintained to bring an end to the violence and compel the Syrian regime to stop its bloody repression. Ireland, along with our international partners, has been advocating for a strong UN Security Council Resolution.  I believe that this is now long overdue. There is a need for effective leadership and action on the part of the Security Council, imposing sanctions on those who continue to wage war on innocent civilians and who fail to meet their international obligations.  <\/p><p>  It is very clear that, while this is a humanitarian crisis, it is driven by politics and will only be solved with a political solution.  From the beginning, Ireland has recognised this, striving to respond to the humanitarian needs of the populations affected by the violence whilst working simultaneously for a sustainable political solution, based on accommodating the legitimate democratic aspirations of the Syrian people.  I can ensure you we will continue to maintain these efforts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700062#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Visits","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700063#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[44910\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700063#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the recent visit of the President and the Minister of State to South America and the estimated impact on relations and trade between Ireland and Chile, Brazil and Argentina; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":19,"content":"<p>President Michael D.

The visit provided a valuable opportunity to build upon existing links with these three countries.  The busy schedule included comprehensive meetings with the Presidents of each country visited, as well as contacts with Irish communities, and business engagements.  <\/p><p>  In all contacts, President Higgins and Minister Costello availed fully of opportunities to promote Ireland as a stable and desirable investment, business and education partner.  In Chile, a business network event was hosted by the Embassy of Ireland and was attended by Irish companies and their local partners.  The programme in Argentina also had a business component with the Irish State Agencies and Irish companies participating in a business event hosted by Enterprise Ireland.  <\/p><p>  Brazil, now the world&rsquo;s sixth largest economy, is a priority market under the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy.  President Higgins&rsquo;s visit, and the accompanying Enterprise Ireland mission of 42 companies and third level institutions led by Minister Costello, raised Ireland&rsquo;s profile in this key high growth market.  A number of agreements with Brazilian partners were finalised, including announcements of export contracts secured by Irish companies and agreements signed between third level education institutions.  Another key event was the launch of the participation of Irish third-level institutions in a Brazilian scholarship programme that focuses on Science and Technology.  Under this programme, we look forward to up to 4,000 Brazilian students studying in Ireland at under-graduate level over the next four years, as well as up to 1,500 post-graduate students.<\/p><p>  The President&rsquo;s programme included other opportunities to build Ireland&rsquo;s profile in South America.

President Higgins also addressed a seminar in Chile organised in connection with next January&rsquo;s European Union &ndash; Community of Latin American and Caribbean States Summit, and was the keynote speaker at a seminar in Buenos Aires on migration from Ireland to Argentina.  The programme also recognised the commitment to human rights protection and promotion that Ireland and these three countries share.<\/p><p>  I look forward to bilateral contacts increasing with Chile, Brazil and Argentina.  I am confident that such links will include greater business ties but will also encourage deeper political and cultural contacts as well as a wide-range of people-to-people connections.

The recent UN report &lsquo;Gaza in 2020&rsquo; only reinforces these messages. I visited Gaza myself in January this year, to see conditions for myself.  The blockade makes it impossible for local authorities or international organisations to keep pace with the need for basic services in a rapidly growing population. The UN report underlines this. Schools in Gaza already work on double shifts, and there is presently a demand for an additional 250 schools.   In recognition of these problems, Ireland has provided &euro;12m to UNRWA since 2010 to provide basic education, health and social services to Palestinian refugees, and a further &euro;500,000 to UNRWA&rsquo;s food aid programme in Gaza.

My Department has always played an important and active role in promoting Ireland as a tourist destination, in particular through our Embassy Network, and we are working very closely with the Department of Tourism, Transport and Sport and Tourism Ireland to promote The Gathering. In some cases dedicated events have been organised to launch the initiative: just last week, for example, President Higgins and Minister of State Costello launched The Gathering in Argentina at an Embassy organised event. In many other cases Embassy events are being leveraged to promote the initiative and, where suitable, speaking engagements and media\/radio interviews are also being used to support the scheme.    Along with the Taoiseach and Minister Varadkar, I launched The Gathering in Dublin Castle on 11 May 2012. Following on from this launch we sent a joint letter to all Global Irish Network Tourism Advocates on 14 May.

Such violence is totally unacceptable.  The disturbances in Carrick Hill\/Carlisle Circus resulted in injuries to 65 PSNI officers.  I condemn those involved in violence against the police service and I am pleased to note that charges have been brought in a number of cases.  These riots caused serious concerns regarding community relations in advance of the parades commemorating the centenary of the signing of the Ulster Covenant, which took place on Saturday 29   September. In the event, the parades, which involved 208 bands and over 30,000 marchers, passed off without violence, following extensive behind-the-scenes efforts, although several breaches of the Parades Commission determinations were reported to the authorities. <\/p><p>  I commend the First Minister and Deputy First Minister for moving quickly to defuse the situation and using their offices to liaise with the various interested parties, as well as the efforts of MLAs, Councillors, the churches and community representatives.   <\/p><p>  Respect is the key to preventing and resolving violence related to parades and sectarianism, and I applaud efforts to facilitate dialogue between residents and parade organisers. I have discussed this matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on a number of occasions since she took up office, and we agreed to work together to support efforts to address division and sectarianism and to help promote the shared future agenda.<\/p><p>I would like to welcome the apology provided by the Royal Black Institution for the incident outside St Patrick&rsquo;s Church in Carrick Hill on 25   August, and hope that this will clear the way for further progress in relation to parades in Belfast.  <\/p><p>  Irish Government officials monitored events leading up to the Covenant parade closely and used every opportunity to underline the importance of dialogue and respect. They remained in regular contact with local residents and clergy in advance of the parade, as efforts were made to address residents&rsquo; concerns. At the request of the residents, the feeder parades were monitored on the ground by my officials. Both the Taoiseach and myself were fully briefed as the situation evolved, and I was heartened that the parade passed off peacefully. <\/p><p>  It must be recognised that the Parades Commission also played a key role in working to promote a peaceful outcome to the Covenant parade. It continues to work to address the parades issue in a very challenging environment, and it is essential that the determinations of the Parades Commission are respected and upheld as the rule of law.<\/p><p>  The scenes of rioting in early September made international headlines and underlined the urgent need to address the root causes of division and sectarianism in Northern Ireland. They also underlined the potential for sectarian acts to destabilise the situation generally and for new flashpoints to emerge. In the absence of a clear strategy to address the causes of division in Northern Ireland, events such as those we have seen in recent weeks risk damaging community relations in general, undermining economic regeneration strategies for Belfast and tarnishing Northern Ireland&rsquo;s improving international reputation for stability and political progress. <\/p><p>  These events underline the importance and urgency at this time of the Northern Ireland Executive delivering on and implementing an agreed Strategy for Cohesion, Sharing and Integration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700063#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"World Trade Negotiations","counter":32,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700063#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[44640\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700063#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the progress that has been made on bilateral economic partnership agreements between the EU and third countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":34,"content":"<p>Since 2002, the EU has been negotiating a series of new Economic Partnership Agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States.

The World Bank Group supports developing countries in their fight against poverty by providing the financial and technical assistance needed to promote trade and investment. In 2011, the Department of Finance provided &euro;18 million to the International Development Association, one of the five agencies within the World Bank Group, which in turn provides grants and long term, zero interest loans to the world&rsquo;s poorest countries. In addition Irish Aid contributes to a number of global and programme country trust funds managed by the Bank Group focusing on the fight against hunger, the provision of basic needs, private sector development, and fragile and conflict affected states.<\/p><p>  Minister Costello discussed the strong relationship between Irish Aid and the World Bank, over a wide range of our development priorities including hunger, nutrition and agricultural productivity. The Bank provided him with a valuable update on its work in fragile and unstable States.  He was in a position to brief senior officials on the findings of his recent visit to Jordan where he saw at first hand the scale of the refugee crisis as a result of the conflict in Syria.<\/p><p>  The Minister also discussed Ireland&rsquo;s forthcoming EU Presidency role, and especially our focus on facilitating substantive discussions on the EU&rsquo;s approach for the formulation of the framework for global development after 2015.

He briefed the Bank on the development of the new Africa Strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and discussed the opportunities for Irish business in Africa in the context of increasing two way trade between Ireland and Africa.  <\/p><p>  We look forward to further meetings at Ministerial level with the World Bank and to developing a closer working relationship on development and on economic and trade issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700063#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Peace Process","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700063#WRB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[44807\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700063#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will consider proposing to the EU Foreign Affairs Council the exclusion from the EU of products from illegal Israeli settlements; if in the absence of an EU agreement, he will also consider introducing an unilateral ban on Israeli settlement goods entering Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>External trade policy and controls are an EU competence, not a national one.

On that occasion, the Russian delegation met the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Joe Costello T.D. who subsequently led an Enterprise Ireland Trade Mission to Moscow from 18-22 June. During this Mission, Minister of State Costello participated in a large number of business engagements organised by the Embassy and State Agencies, as well as in high-level political meetings.<\/p><p>  I believe that through this combination of high level contacts and work on the ground on a daily basis by our Embassy and the State Agencies, our trade relations with Russia will continue to strengthen.

Strong levels of export growth have continued into 2012 with merchandise exports of &euro;401m for the first 8 months of the year, an increase of 15% over the same period in 2011.

Alongside its foreign policy, diplomatic and consular functions, the Embassy Network is a key platform for the promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s trade, investment and tourism objectives. A significant part of my Department&rsquo;s contribution to national economic recovery has centred on using the Embassy Network to disseminate the Government&rsquo;s economic message and help restore our international reputation.    The transfer of certain trade promotion functions to my Department on 1 June last year was in one sense a formal recognition of the trade promotion work carried out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and its diplomatic and consular missions over many years. The most significant institutional innovation was establishment under the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Export Trade Council, which I chair, and which oversees coordination and implementation of the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Trade Strategy sets out concrete targets in trade, tourism and investment to be met by 2015 as well as a programme of actions conducive to achieving these targets. The responsible Ministers and Heads of State Agencies are members of the Export Trade Council as are senior representatives of certain other Departments and, importantly, a number of private sector individuals with relevant experience. The Council has met three times, most recently on 20 September. Earlier this year, I reported to Government on progress in implementing the Strategy in 2011. <\/p><p>  The Trade and Promotion Division of my Department supports the work of the Export Trade Council. This involves regular engagement at Headquarters with Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland, Culture Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland as well as other Departments in order to build a Team Ireland approach both at home and abroad. The Division also acts as the interface between the Embassy Network and other relevant Government Departments, the State Agencies and the private sector. Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relations, economic as well as political, with other countries are the responsibility of geographical Divisions and Units of my Department. Trade and Promotion Division liaises with them, particularly with respect to the priority countries identified under the Trade Strategy. <\/p><p>  Local market teams, chaired by Ambassadors with State Agency participation, are in place in all these priority countries. The local teams&rsquo; market plans for 2012 were reviewed by the Export Trade Council in February, their mid- year progress reports in September. On foot of guidance from the Council, we aim to further increase the value of mid- and end-year progress reports by sharpening their focus on the impact of actions taken on the realisation of agreed objectives. The local market teams are gradually becoming better coordinated and it is notable that shared effort is not confined to standout promotional occasions such as St Patrick&rsquo;s Day and high level visits. All concerned understand that it is imperative that optimum use is made of State resources in support of the objectives of the Trade Strategy.  <\/p><p>  Another area where progress has been made since my Department assumed certain trade promotion functions is the annual programme of Minister-led Enterprise Ireland Trade Missions.  In December, Enterprise Ireland now submits a draft programme for the following year to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and to me. The programme is agreed between our two Departments and presented to the Export Trade Council. My Department manages the missions led by the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Mr. Joe Costello TD., and by me. This year, we have led Enterprise Ireland Trade Missions to Turkey, Russia, the UK and Brazil; before the end of the year, Minister Costello will also lead missions to Italy and to South Africa.  <\/p><p>  Finally, my Department now co-ordinates the Joint Economic Commissions with a number of high growth and emerging countries. Following my co&ndash;Chairmanship of the Ireland Russia Joint Economic Commission in Moscow in November 2011, a delegation of Russian officials, including co chairs of the sectoral working groups established in areas of mutual interest, met their Irish counterparts here in May and agreed a work programme. The China-Ireland JEC will meet here on Friday, preceded by a first meeting of a Joint Investment Promotion Working Group. On 30 November, the Irish side will host the Joint Economic Commission with South Korea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700064#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700064#WRC01750"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[44878\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700064#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the actions he has taken on the issue of the undocumented Irish in the USA; if he has discussed the E-3 Visa amongst members of Congress and the White House; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>The welfare of the Irish abroad is a very important priority for the Government.

Their advice to us remains that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which this can be achieved. <\/p><p>  With a view to building some positive momentum around immigration issues, we have focused our efforts on enabling Irish people to apply for E-3 temporary U.S. work visas.

The E3+3 Foreign Ministers met at the General Assembly session in New York last month to consider how to proceed.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the EU, along with its other partners, is doing everything it can to put pressure on Iran to change its course and to negotiate seriously so to address the major concerns which exist regarding its nuclear programme.  Regrettably, it has been necessary to impose several rounds of EU sanctions as part of this.   A further round of sanctions was agreed at the Foreign Affairs Council which I attended on Monday.<\/p><p>  The E3+3 have shown both great patience and creativity in exploring every avenue for agreement.

I agree with the Commission&rsquo;s assessment.  Whether a date for opening accession negotiations with Serbia can be set during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council in 2013 is dependent on a number of factors. In the first instance, Serbia will have to fulfil the requirement of an improvement in relations with Kosovo.

We have put in place the rescue packages and mechanisms for Member States in difficulties which were needed to stabilise matters in the immediate context &ndash; we didn't have these when the crisis began.<\/p><p>  We have tightened the rules and our ability to enforce them through steps such as the six-pack of the legislation adopted last year and through the Fiscal Treaty.  We have strengthened our coordination and governance arrangements through the Europe 2020 process, the Euro Plus Pact and the European Semester.<\/p><p>  We are improving our ability to anticipate where problems may arise, including through the two-pack of legislation which I hope will be adopted as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>  At the end of June, we adopted a Compact for Growth and Jobs to help advance that vital agenda.  It sets out an ambitious programme of work at national and European level. Driving it forward will be an important priority of the Irish Presidency in the first half of next year. <\/p><p>  Importantly, at the end of June, Heads of State or Government also agreed to break the vicious circle between sovereign and bank debt and we are now working through the steps needed to secure that outcome. This will help to address one of the key brakes on Europe's recovery.<\/p><p>  Every step of the way we have seen the European Institutions &ndash; the Commission, the Council, the European Council and European Parliament &ndash; have worked together to seek common solutions to shared problems.  <\/p><p>  It is clear, however, that we need to give careful thought to whether the Economic and Monetary Union we now have, including these new arrangements put in place since the crisis broke, is sufficient to meet the needs and the challenges of the future.  In June, President of the European Council was to examine this question, in close cooperation with the Presidents of the Commission, ECB and Eurogroup.  He will present an interim report to the European Council on 18\/19 October and a final one by the end of the year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700065#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Agreements","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700065#WRD00450"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[44821\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700065#WRD00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the peace deal signed between the Philippine Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front; his views on whether it is a positive development; if he will be making a statement on the matter and if he has explored whether, in view of Ireland's own experiences, we might be in a position to offer any assistance to the Government of the Philippines.","asker":"1066","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>I am aware of the recent successful conclusion of the negotiations on the Framework Peace Agreement in Manila on 7 October between the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.

It has now become broadly accepted by almost all parties as the goal which must be achieved if this conflict is to be settled.   Regrettably, progress towards this goal has been much less satisfactory.   The EU acts supportively in a number of ways.   First and foremost, we seek to encourage and press both parties into engaging in serious direct negotiations, because we recognise that this is the only way to reach a comprehensive agreement and to end the occupation.

The testimonies indicate a frequent use of violence that requires urgent investigation within the Israeli state structures over and above the limited actions taken to date.  Former soldiers testify to feeling afraid to speak up to protect detainees.   Police and soldiers must feel that their actions will be called to account.  Serious abuses are not just contrary to human rights law but, I believe, contrary to the genuine interests of Israel, as they only serve to deepen divisions between Israelis and Palestinians.<\/p><p>The report by a delegation of British lawyers on the treatment of Palestinian children under the Israeli occupation reveals in particular the disparity between the treatment afforded to Palestinian children under military law and that afforded to Israeli children under civilian law.  This mirrors a more general pattern of injustice under the occupation.   I believe that in any society there should be equal treatment of children, irrespective of religion, race or ethnicity.   I therefore welcome the steps recently introduced by Israel, such as increasing the age of majority for Palestinian children from 16 to 18, to bring military law governing juvenile justice more into line with civilian law. However, it is clear that a   more comprehensive reform programme is required, most urgently in the rules governing the interrogation process. <\/p><p>  The UK report highlights a failure to meet international norms in describing how children are interrogated without the protective presence of a parent or guardian and often suffer physical violence during interrogation.  I believe the most effective safeguard would be the audio-visual recording of interrogations.  This would protect Palestinian children against mistreatment while also providing protection to Israeli officials against vexatious allegations.  A further problem is that the location of many police stations and detention centres within Israeli settlements means that parents can be unable to see their children in detention for extended periods.<\/p><p>  These are not new or insoluble issues.  Police forces all over the developed world, including in these islands, have had to modernise their methods and increase their safeguards for detainees, because these kinds of abuses can become endemic if allowed.  Methods and standards which Israelis rightly regard as unacceptable for use in relation to their own children should not be employed on Palestinian children.<\/p><p>  My officials have raised the issue of violence during detention directly with the Israeli authorities, most recently in a meeting earlier this month.  We have urged that effective investigations be carried out into any allegations of mistreatment of children during detention.  I have asked my officials to raise this issue again tomorrow in a meeting which they will be having with the Israeli Foreign Ministry and to relay my concern that urgent reform of the rules governing interrogation is required. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700065#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid Provision","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700065#WRD02050"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[44909\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700065#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the total funding allocated to the end of September 2012 under overseas development aid; the specific programmes funded; the allocation to each non governmental organisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"976","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":125,"content":"<p>For 2012, the Government has allocated and estimated &euro;639 million to Ireland's Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme.

We expect that the attendance will include US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov.    The Ministerial meeting is a significant opportunity to showcase Ireland to Ministers and delegates from over sixty countries, including from the EU, North America, Russia and Central Asia. <\/p><p>  Ireland's Chairmanship of the OSCE has provided us with a unique opportunity to provide leadership in the search for solutions to some of the world's most intractable conflicts.  In sharing our own experience of successful conflict resolution, we have been able to make a tangible contribution to this vital part of the OSCE's work.   We hope that the forthcoming Dublin Ministerial meeting will crown our efforts with a number of important decisions across the full range of OSCE interests and activities.   Our OSCE Chairmanship has necessitated close and sustained engagement with major international players.   I believe that it has served to enhance significantly our international profile and that the benefits of this will endure long beyond our Chairmanship year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700065#WRD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":130,"content":"<p>Question No. 50 was answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700066#WRE00250"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[44810\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700066#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the recent peace talks between the FARC and the Colombian Government; and if in view of the Irish experience in conflict resolution processes, if any support, public or private will be given, to help develop or enhance these discussions.","asker":"1102","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>The agreement reached by the Government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) during exploratory talks in Havana earlier this year to engage in official peace negotiations is a positive development that I warmly welcome.

My colleague, Minister of State Joe Costello  <font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> T.D., met with UN Deputy General Secretary, Mr. Jan Eliasson, during his visit to the UN earlier in September and had a wide- ranging exchange of views on development issues, including progress on the MDGs.<\/font><\/p><p><br \/>  The Millennium Development Goals were agreed by world leaders at the United Nations in 2000 as the framework for international development policy up to 2015.

The Goals are central to Ireland&#8217;s overseas development programme and to the Government&#8217;s development policy.  <\/p><p><br \/>  At a global level, the UN issues a report each year outlining progress in meeting the MDGs and identifying areas and regions which are lagging behind.  The most recent report was issued in June 2012.  Three of the MDGs have already been reached.  These are the goals of halving the extreme poverty rate, halving the proportion of people without access to clean drinking water and significantly improving the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers.  In addition, considerable progress has been made in relation to education.  Parity in primary school enrolment for boys and girls has been reached and overall school enrolment rates have increased significantly, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.  There has been substantial progress in addressing HIV and AIDS , with the number of people in developing countries accessing retroviral therapy increasing from 5.1 million in 2009 to 6.5 million in 2010, the largest year on year increase ever recorded.  However, the global targets on maternal health, access to sanitation and reducing hunger, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, remain well off track.<\/p><p><br \/>  When the EU Development Ministers met in Luxembourg earlier this week, Ireland emphasised the importance of maintaining international efforts to achieve the MDG targets by 2015. <\/p><p><br \/>  An MDG Special Event is scheduled to be held at the UN in New York in September 2013.

Because of the development challenges that many of the resource-rich African countries still face, and given that many of these resources are non-renewable, it is vital to ensure that revenues generated are fully transparent, are used to improve the lives of the poor and that resources are extracted in a manner that protects the environment. <\/p><p>  We know and we have seen that the so-called &lsquo;natural resource curse&rsquo; can be avoided with the right institutions and policies, nationally and internationally.

They also complement the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) initiative, which has been developed under the EU-Africa Governance Partnership.<\/p><p>  Ireland has also been very supportive of efforts by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to promote the accountability, transparency and effective management of natural resources, for example through the recently updated OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

yesterday the 16th October 2012 [34339\/12 (137), 42928\/12 (145) and 42808\/12 (151) ], the Government is committed to making Jobs and Growth the central focus and thematic approach to the Irish Presidency. To successfully deliver on that objective we need to tackle the ongoing financial crisis, and restore stability to the Eurozone, but the focus must be on generating growth in the EU economy and getting Europe back to work.  <\/p><p>  During the Presidency the Government will deliver on its ambitions through a range of policy and legislative measures that cut across a broad range of policy areas which will push forward the growth and jobs agenda.  As an export-driven economy, Ireland has reaped the benefits of the European Single Market, but the global economy has evolved.  One of the aims of the Single Market Act II, which was published by the European Commission on 3 October, will be to respond to changes in the economy, particularly by exploiting the potential of the digital economy for business and consumers.  <\/p><p>  As Presidency Ireland will work to underpin and stimulate research and innovation across the EU for the coming decade by advancing agreement on the Horizon 2020 framework programme which can play an important role in boosting the EU economy, generating smart and sustainable growth and jobs, and strengthening the Union&rsquo;s global competitiveness.  The Presidency will deliver a major effort in the field of research and innovation with a range of thematic events planned and a commitment to advance decisions on key legislation in this rapidly growing area where the EU can become a global leader.  <\/p><p>  Ireland will make significant advances in the external trade agenda during its Presidency and will hold a meeting of Trade Ministers in Ireland during the Presidency which will focus on the EU-US trade relationship.  <\/p><p>  The Presidency will make special efforts to address the problem of youth unemployment across the EU and will work closely with partners to seek solutions to tackle this fundamental challenge.  <\/p><p>  Europe&rsquo;s economy can only grow if there is stability and confidence in the EU economy.  For this reason, the Irish Presidency will work to ensure the effective implementation of recent economic governance measures, and to make progress on the Banking Union proposals.  The third main priority of the Irish Presidency will be the EU&rsquo;s future budget to underpin growth and to sharpen Europe&rsquo;s global competitiveness.  The Irish Government supports the Cyprus Presidency in its efforts to reach agreement on the MFF and stands ready to take forward the necessary implementing legislation to ensure that the EU has a budget to support programmes that are of major economic importance to Member States such as CAP, CFP and Horizon 2020 (the EU's future framework programme for research and innovation) for the 2014-2020 period.  These programmes can play a key role in spurring economic growth and creating employment.  <\/p><p>  Work on the Irish Presidency is a top priority across all Departments as the Presidency nears.  The Government met with the College of Commissioners on 3 October in Brussels and the President of the European Parliament also visited Dublin on 3-4 October.  We were pleased with the outcomes of the both meeting which confirmed that there is broad agreement between the Government and partners on the main priorities and objectives that we have identified at this stage of planning for our Presidency.  Issues discussed at the meetings will feed into the drafting of the Presidency programme which will be published in December.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700067#WRF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Peace Process","counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700067#WRF01150"},{"type":"question","counter":172,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[45231\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700067#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which directly or in conjuction with his EU colleagues, he expects to be in a position to address the ongoing problem of Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories; if his attention has been drawn to further damage done to any peace prospects by the continuation of this policy; if particular issues have emerged as a means of solution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":173,"content":"<p>I have made clear my view that the continuing Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territory, and the ongoing settlement construction project, are now the major obstacles to a lasting peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours, including the Palestinians.    Settlement construction is not only illegal under international law, but it inherently involves injustice to Palestinians and further erosion of their rights and freedoms. Furthermore, settlement construction undermines the ability of Palestinian leaders to pursue negotiations with Israel, and increasingly makes it difficult for such negotiations to be successful, by making the creation of a viable Palestinian state increasingly hard to achieve on the ground. <\/p><p>  It is unambiguous EU policy that the relentless construction of settlements in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) is undermining the viability of a future Palestinian state, and is an obstacle to peace. This is a clear message that Ireland and our EU partners relay to the Israeli authorities at every appropriate opportunity.<\/p><p>  Recognising that developments on the ground are threatening to make a two-state solution impossible, the Foreign Affairs Council in May adopted Conclusions that restated, and in many respects advanced, EU positions on issues such as the Palestinian depopulation of Area C and evictions and demolitions in East Jerusalem. Many of these issues are part and parcel of the settlement project. I have suggested that the EU will need to revisit this issue in the near future to review developments and ascertain what, if any, measures the EU could adopt that might encourage Israel to halt the expansion of settlements.  The possible exclusion from the EU of settlement products is one option for consideration in that regard. <\/p><p>  Ultimately, only the achievement of a comprehensive peace agreement will resolve the issues of the occupation and settlements, and the pursuit and support of the Middle East peace process remains a major priority of the EU and the international community, despite the many frustrations this has entailed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700067#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":174,"content":"<p>Question No. 69 answered with Question No. 37.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":176,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[45233\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700067#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which he expects to be in a position to mobilise the wider global community towards bringing about ongoing peace talks in the Middle East with particular reference to the setting up of a forum in which grievances or issues arising can be aired; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":177,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 46 on today&rsquo;s Order paper, which was as follows: &ldquo;The EU has a clear and long-standing policy that the solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or Israeli-Arab conflict must be a two-state solution, involving a sovereign state of Palestine co-existing peacefully with Israel.  Ireland has made a strong contribution from the outset to the development of this policy.  It has now become broadly accepted by almost all parties as the goal which must be achieved if this conflict is to be settled.   Regrettably, progress towards this goal has been much less satisfactory.<\/p><p>  The EU acts supportively in a number of ways.  First and foremost, we seek to encourage and press both parties into engaging in serious direct negotiations, because we recognise that this is the only way to reach a comprehensive agreement and to end the occupation.  Frankly, we have been very disappointed by the inability to get talks restarted.  The reasons are complex but primarily there has been little real engagement by the Israeli Government in the process.<\/p><p>  The EU is also active in relation to specific issues on the ground which we believe are having a negative effect and threaten to make a peace agreement based on a two-state solution impossible to achieve.   The Foreign Affairs Council in May issued strong Conclusions, to which Ireland actively contributed, which highlighted these issues, many of which revolve round Israeli settlement building, and which called for urgent changes in policy.   I am pressing for a follow-up Council discussion within the next couple of months.<\/p><p>  Finally, on the Palestinian side the EU is the major provider of humanitarian support for refugees and technical support and capacity-building for the Palestinian administration.  Ireland plays an active role in all of these strands of engagement, including through support provided by Irish Aid.&rdquo;<\/p><p>  Further to that reply, I do not think there is any lack of a forum for the parties to express their grievances, rather the opposite. I know the idea of a secretariat has been suggested occasionally in the Oireachtas, but I have to say that in my meetings with the parties both in the region and elsewhere, no-one has ever suggested this to me. There are already permanent representatives and staffs operating in the field on behalf of the EU, the US, the UN and the Quartet. The problem is not one of a lack of structures, but a lack of political will to use them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700067#WRF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":178,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700067#WRF01650"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[45234\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700067#WRF01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding the treatment of academics or opposition activists in Iran; if any progress has been made to facilitate prison visits by families and friends of those incarcerated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":180,"content":"<p>As I have previously stated, the human rights situation in Iran is profoundly disturbing, and the period since the Presidential election of 2009 has been characterised by an intensification of human rights abuses on many fronts. Although it is difficult to gain reliable statistics and information on human rights abuses in Iran, there are a number of reputable and thorough sources and reports such as the reports of the UN Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran through which governments can monitor the human rights situation in Iran. It is clear from these sources that the deterioration of the human rights situation in Iran continues to be a grave concern.   The Iranian authorities continue to deny civil and political rights in Iran, including in relation to freedom of expression and assembly, arbitrary arrest, and torture and other cruel treatment in detention. This highly targeted repression has been particularly stringent against not only academics but also members of Iran&#8217;s religious and ethnic minorities, political activists, journalists and bloggers, human rights defenders and members of the legal profession in Iran who represent clients detained by the authorities. These actions are in clear violation of Iran's international obligations under the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights, of which Iran is a signatory. I would also condemn the ongoing detention under house arrest of the two leading opposition politicians, Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who contested the 2009 presidential election against President Ahmadinejad.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am particularly concerned by the overall high level of executions and the widespread practice of executions after unfair trials, without the right of appeal, and for offences which according to international standards should not result in capital punishment. I am also concerned about the continuing imposition of the death penalty against minors in violation of Iran&#8217;s obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the practice of secret executions in Iran which has been highlighted by the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran.<\/p><p><br \/>  The international community continues to speak out against such abuses. EU High Representative Ashton, in statements issued on 21 June and 5 January this year, has expressed her concerns regarding Iran&#8217;s repressive policies towards minorities and the worrying increase in executions contrary to the worldwide trend towards the abolition of the death penalty. I fully support her calls on Iran to abandon discriminatory policies, to halt all pending executions and to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty. In this regard I welcome the decision by the Iranian authorities to acquit and release Pastor Yousef Nadarkhani on 28 September, who was sentenced to death for apostasy and had been detained for three years. <\/p><p><br \/>  The EU has also repeatedly raised human rights issues in contacts with the Iranian authorities and adopted a travel ban and asset freeze against those responsible for grave human rights violations in April last year, further extended to additional persons last October. This sends an important political signal to those in the judicial system and elsewhere in the Iranian regime who perpetrate human rights abuses. I fully support the strong Conclusions on human rights in Iran issued by the Foreign Affairs Council on 10 October last year. Ireland will continue to be active at EU level in pressing for stronger EU action in relation to the human rights situation in Iran. <\/p><p>At UN level, Ireland co-sponsored a General Assembly resolution in October last year expressing the international community&#8217;s deep concern at the human rights situation in Iran, and calling upon the Government of Iran to take a number of specific and urgent steps to improve the situation, including providing unfettered access to the Special Rapporteur appointed last year to examine Iran&#8217;s human rights situation. <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">On March 22, Ireland co-sponsored the UN <\/font>Human Rights Council&#8217;s R<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">esolution on <\/font>Iran<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> which <\/font>  welcomed the report and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran and expressed serious concern at the developments noted in that report as well as the lack of access permitted to the Special Rapporteur. The Council extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for one year and called upon Iran to cooperate fully and permit access to the country.<\/p><p><br \/>  At a bilateral level, my Department engages in ongoing dialogue with the Iranian Ambassador and his Embassy on these issues. My officials regularly hold meetings with the Ambassador to convey our grave concerns at the human rights situation in Iran.

Yet we remain conscious of the serious obstacles that must be overcome if Africa is to enjoy a stable and prosperous future.  Ireland attaches high importance to the development of relations with the countries of Africa, to supporting economic and social development and to responding to the needs of people affected by war and natural disasters.  Through our humanitarian and development engagements, Ireland is active in addressing the causes and consequences of conflict and hunger in the continent, and in ensuring that aid workers deployed to deliver assistance and capacity building support in African countries are free to do so without undue interference.  <\/p><p>  Africa is the main geographic focus for Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, with 80 per cent of the aid budget devoted to the objective of ending extreme poverty and hunger, especially in the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa.  Our missions in Africa monitor developments, report to the Government, and manage our political and economic relations and humanitarian and development programmes.  Ireland also has excellent relations with its NGO partners which are a direct and reliable source of information regarding the level of humanitarian risk African countries face at any particular time.  My Department regularly reviews these various sources of information and ensures that key messages are given voice at an international level where the opportunity arises. <\/p><p>  In the Horn of Africa, a year on from the devastating famine which resulted in the deaths of many  thousands of people, the humanitarian situation remains extremely fragile.  The region was affected by one of the worst droughts in decades, where an estimated 12.4 million people were reported to be in urgent need of food.  While a huge relief effort, followed by good rains last autumn, saved hundreds of thousands of lives, the crisis forced many more from their homes, devastated their livelihoods and left them vulnerable to future hunger shocks.  At present the total number of food insecure people in the Horn of Africa is approximately 8 million people, with the majority of those in need of humanitarian assistance in Somalia.<\/p><p>  Ireland will chair the Council Working Party on Humanitarian Aid and Food Assistance during our EU Presidency in the first half of 2013.  We will continue to engage actively in pushing for a strongly coordinated approach to the humanitarian requirements in the Horn.  <\/p><p>  I recognise the skilled and often courageous work undertaken by Ireland&rsquo;s aid workers. They work in environments of food insecurity, poverty, protracted conflict, environmental degradation, weak government capacity, severe infrastructural weaknesses and poor governance. During my visit to Somalia last July I witnessed at first hand the excellent work being carried out on the ground.  Supporting democratic change across Africa is helping to improve the conditions in which Irish aid workers operate. Our national approach in the continent is guided by the Africa Strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which was launched in September 2011.  It sets out a framework for our policies in the political, development and economic areas in order to ensure that our engagement is as comprehensive, coherent and effective as possible.  A fundamental principle of our approach is an emphasis on the promotion of political progress including the resolution of conflict, the strengthening of democracy, and respect for human rights and the rule of law.<\/p><p>  Africa faces many challenges. Nevertheless, the continent is showing real progress towards sustainable change. In order to maintain this positive momentum and avoid losing the positive gains from development investment over the years, Ireland will continue to work in partnership with African countries to respond quickly to humanitarian challenges when they occur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700067#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[45237\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which basic human rights remain available to the former Prime Minister of the Ukraine Yulia Tymoshenko; if in the course of her incarceration she has had regular visits from international monitors on a regular basis; if she has set out any specific requirements in recent times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":188,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the case of former Prime Minister of Ukraine, Yulia Tymoshenko, is a matter of deep concern to Ireland, the European Union and the wider international community.

I have repeatedly condemned the unacceptable human rights violations and brutality which are now estimated to have claimed well over 20,000 lives since the conflict first erupted in March 2011.    There is no doubting the widespread international revulsion generated by the conflict over the last 20 months and in particular by the violence and killings associated with the repressive actions of the Syrian regime.  The international community has been prompt to express its indignation and to compel the Syrian regime to change course, notably through the adoption of a series of resolutions on the human rights situation in Syria by the UN General Assembly Resolution in February and by the UN Human Rights Council, in March, June and September. <\/p><p>  The UN Human Rights Council has also initiated a process of inquiry through the establishment in August 2011 of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry.  Mandated to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law in Syria since the beginning of the conflict, and, where possible, to identify those responsible, the Commission, in its 15 August 2012 report, concludes that Government forces and its affiliated militia have committed crimes against humanity, war crimes and gross violations of human rights, all pursuant to a State policy. The report also found reasonable grounds to believe that serious abuses had been committed by anti-Government armed groups, although these did not reach the gravity, frequency and scale of violations committed by Government forces. This report may well pave the way for the situation in Syria to eventually be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC), a course called for by UN Human Rights Commissioner Pillay and which Ireland has long supported. We are also highly supportive of efforts underway at the UN that aim at building up cross-regional support for formal referral to the ICC by the UN Security Council.  <\/p><p>  The European Union has, of course, also reacted to the human rights violations in Syria.  It has adopted a series of robust economic, political and diplomatic measures to compel the Syrian regime to cease its reprehensible attacks against its own people.  While actively supporting the efforts of the UN\/Arab League Joint Special Representative Ladhkar Brahimi to achieve a ceasefire and mediate some sort of peaceful settlement, the EU has continued to impose tough sanctions targeted on the Assad regime and those who support the repression.  Last Monday&rsquo;s Foreign Affairs Council which I attended adopted additional restrictive measures to step up the pressure on the Syrian regime to change course and halt its unacceptable violence and repression. <\/p><p>  In saying all this, we must also acknowledge that the current paralysis of the international community is a major impediment to stopping the daily abuses suffered by ordinary Syrians. The UN Security Council need to step up to its responsibilities and give a lead in the international community&rsquo;s efforts to halt the violence. Ireland, for its part, will continue to call for a strong UN Chapter VII resolution that would impose robust sanctions and notably a comprehensive arms embargo which is now long overdue in the current circumstances prevailing in Syria. <\/p><p>  Ultimately, such a Resolution and united action on the part of the Security Council represents the best opportunity for ending the conflict and ongoing human rights violations and setting in train a process of urgently needed political reform and transition in Syria.

many automatic border control machine systems in operation around the world with different criteria required to use these machines.  Some systems operate on the basis of a trusted traveller programme where pre-registration is required.  Others incorporate pre-registration with other requirements.  In the case of US Global Entry, access is limited to US citizens, lawful permanent residents, Dutch citizens, South Korean citizens and Mexican nationals.  A further series of systems operates on the basis of biometric technology.  IRIS in Britain makes use of the fact that the pattern of the iris in each person's eye is unique.  A registered passenger looks into a special camera at the IRIS barrier in the immigration arrival hall and the system compares his or her iris pattern with others stored in a secure database.  Another series of systems works by using facial recognition technology to compare a person's face to the photograph recorded on the chip in his or her e-passport.  Over the past year, the UK Border Agency has installed ePassport gates at London Heathrow, London Gatwick, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, East Midlands, Luton, Manchester and Stansted.  Irish ePassports meet the current criteria to use the ePassport gates in the UK.  ePassports have been issued in Ireland since October 2006 and are distinguished by a chip symbol which appears at the bottom of the front cover of the passport book.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRH00300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRH00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Exemptions","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRH00350"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[44968\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRH00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the cost to the Exchequer should primary and post primary schools that qualify for the capitation grant be made exempt from value added tax when paying for service utility and service charges.","asker":"984","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[44969\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRH00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the cost to the Exchequer should primary and post primary schools that implement the DEIS&rsquo;s recognised curriculum be made exempt from value added tax when paying for service utility and service charges.","asker":"984","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[44970\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the cost to the Exchequer should primary and post primary schools be made exempt from value added tax when paying for school text books.","asker":"984","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[44971\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRH00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the cost to the Exchequer should the 3,305 primary schools and 4,034 second level schools aided by the DEIS be made exempt from value added tax when paying for service utility and service charges.","asker":"984","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[44972\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRH00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there are EU regulations that prohibit the introduction of amendments to existing legislation that would exempt primary and secondary schools from paying VAT.","asker":"984","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[44973\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRH00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the cost to the Exchequer should DEIS band one and two schools be made exempt from value added tax when paying for service utility and service charges.","asker":"984","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 to 86, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  Paragraph 4(3) of Schedule 1 to the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 provides an exemption from VAT for the provision of children or young people&rsquo;s education by establishments recognised by the State.  Irish VAT law is guided by the EU VAT Directive, with which it must comply, and this provision mirrors Article 132, paragraph 1(i) of the VAT Directive, which provides that EU Member States must exempt from VAT such education.  VAT exemption in this context means that schools do not charge VAT on the services they supply but cannot recover VAT on the goods and services that they purchase.  As such, schools cannot claim back the VAT paid by them for service utilities or service charges.  VAT law relates to particular goods and services.  In this respect, the VAT exemption for education must apply to all providers of school education.  It is not possible to distinguish between the various forms of school providing that education.  As it is not possible under Irish or EU VAT law to exempt schools from paying VAT on their inputs, the various costings outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s questions cannot be provided.  However, I would point out that a 0% VAT rate applies to the supply of books and as such there is no VAT charged on school text books being purchased by schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRJ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[44992\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRJ00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will level the playing field by instituting betting tax reform to be fair and equitable and to capture all betting and gaming streams; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":219,"content":"<p>It was announced in Budget 2011 that the necessary arrangements are being made to ensure that bets placed on the internet by domestic punters are subject to the same level of betting duty as applies to high street betting shops. This will serve to broaden the tax base and increase betting duty receipts.   The Finance Act 2011 provides for the taxation of bets that remote bookmakers enter into with persons in the State. This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged. In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licences. <\/p><p>  The Betting (Amendment) Bill, which was published in July, will establish the regulatory framework for these licences.

However, I wish to advise the Deputy that, under section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, a company can claim allowances for capital expenditure incurred on the provision of intangible assets for the purposes of its trade. These allowances apply to expenditure on a broad range of assets (e.g. patents, copyright, trademarks, know-how) that are recognised as intangible assets under generally accepted accounting practice.  The allowances, in providing relief for this expenditure, are intended to encourage companies to manage and develop the intellectual assets of their business. <\/p><p>  Allowances for an accounting period are computed by reference to the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of amortisation of the intangible asset relative to its cost. Companies can alternatively opt for a write-down of expenditure over 15 years at a rate of 7 per cent per annum and 2 per cent in the final year. As the expenditures concerned - and, accordingly, the allowances - can be for very substantial amounts, the set-off of the allowances against the related income is restricted. In particular, the aggregate amount of allowances and deductible interest on borrowings, if any, in respect of intangible assets may not exceed 80% of trading income (before the set-off of allowances and any such interest) related to those intangible assets. This ensures that at least 20% of the relevant income will continue to be chargeable to corporation tax in an accounting period. Any unused allowances and interest can be carried forward to subsequent accounting periods for offset against trading income related to the intangible assets (subject to the 80% restriction)  .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Availability","counter":238,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRJ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":239,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[45262\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the tax reliefs available to a person who has their jeep adopted with a swivel chair to allow access by a person with a disability with the work done by a HSB recommended person; and if where the jeep was originally purchased has any bearing on the entitlement to relief.","asker":"1028","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":240,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 134(3) of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended) and Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 (Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 (as amended) provide for permanent relief from the payment of specified maximum amounts of VAT and VRT for persons registered under the scheme.

The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience. It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment. The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors. <\/p><p><br \/>  The JobBridge Scheme has made significant progress to-date since it came into operation on the 1<sup>st<\/sup> July 2011. 11,010 internships have commenced to date with 5,082 participants currently on an internship as at 11<sup>th<\/sup> October 2012 and 2,253 opportunities presently advertised on<i><\/i><i><\/i>.<\/p><p><br \/>  As you are aware given the success of the programme, I asked my Department to review the criteria for availing of the programme to ensure that the scheme gives opportunities to as many as possible so that they can benefit from the success of the programme. As part of this broader review process the scheme criteria were widened to include One Parent Family Payment and Disability Allowance recipients who have been eligible to participate on JobBridge as of the 28<sup>th<\/sup> May 2012.<\/p><p><br \/>  Currently, the JobBridge Scheme requires that an internship should not be part of a training contract (e.g. as part of a training course for a professional qualification from the Law Society or one of the Accountancy Bodies or Architects). In addition, the programme currently limits access to full time third level education during the time they are with the host organisation.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The rationale behind this approach is that such training contracts with professional bodies come with terms and conditions including remuneration. In such circumstances, it is not appropriate to use an initiative such as the JobBridge scheme when training contracts are in place.  <\/p><p><br \/>  However, it must also be articulated that the Scheme is open to Host Organisations to provide internship opportunities for qualified architects. Furthermore, I can advise that existing terms and conditions of the Scheme including eligibility criteria will be re-examined as part of the independent evaluation of the Scheme currently being undertaken by Indecon International Economic Consultants. <\/p><p><br \/>  This evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme, it will provide details of the nature of the work experience of the participants; a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market and progression into employment.

Given the scale of the fiscal crisis and because spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure, you will appreciate that savings have to be found in the social welfare system.<\/p><p>  As social structures in Ireland are changing rapidly, the structures of our social support need to change to accommodate this and the changes to State pension have been made in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives. This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision given that the period for which a pension will be paid will be greater than the current time period.  <\/p><p>  In addition to the budgetary imperative, there is an important long-term policy context for the proposed changes to State pension, which includes reform of pension rate bands and gradual increases in age of retirement for State pension There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.<\/p><p>  The State pension is a very valuable benefit. Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  Recent changes to State pension supports the direct link between contributions made and the rate of pension received which underpins State pension policy.  By aligning the rate of pension paid with the contribution made ensures that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.  <\/p><p>  The change in relation to State pension (contributory) introduced in legislation from 1st  September 2012 set out a wider graduation of yearly average bands and corresponding pension rates. The aim of this change is to ensure that the rate of pension entitlement is more closely related to the level of social insurance contributions a person has paid (including credited contributions, where applicable) over their working lives. <\/p><p>  Overall, there are currently 308,752 State pension (contributory) claims in payment, at maximum and reduced rates. Of this number, there are 107,549 State pension (contributory) claims in payment at a reduced rate, where the claimants have a contributions yearly average of between 10 and 47. Everyone in receipt of a State pension (contributory) has a contributions yearly average of at least ten paid contributions as this is one of the qualifying criteria.<\/p><p>  The changes introduced from 1  September 2012 only affected those who qualified for State pension (contributory) after that date and who had an average of between 10 and 39 contributions per year. The maximum rate of pension remains unchanged and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year also remains unchanged.  However, those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  This change moves somewhat closer to the total contribution approach where those who pay more, benefit more. Since 1 September 2012, 1,800 claimants have been awarded a pension below the 98 per cent maximum rate.<\/p><p>  It is important in assessing any rates of payment that we focus on the real impact of social welfare payments. In this regard, it should be noted that older people do not experience the levels of poverty that existed in the past. This can be clearly seen in a wide range of data such as the significant reduction in the &lsquo;risk of poverty&rsquo; rate from 27.1% in 2004 to 9.6% in 2010. The consistent poverty rate over the same period also declined from 3.9% to 0.9%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRQ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Applications","counter":458,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRQ00650"},{"type":"question","counter":459,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[45221\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRQ00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason relocation assistance is not available for people on jobseeker's allowance; if relocation assistance is available to people who wish to go abroad to take up a job offer.","asker":"988","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":460,"content":"<p>An unemployed person may qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.

Additionally, there are no plans to introduce an assistance payment for persons who wish to go abroad to take up a job offer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRQ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":461,"content":"<p>Question No. 175 answered with Question No. 159.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Live Register Numbers","counter":462,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRQ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":463,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[45284\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRQ01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will direct the jobs facilitator at a location (details supplied) to provide details of the numbers of persons currently on the live register living in different districts of Dublin Central; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1007","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":464,"content":"<p>According to the most recent statistics available to my Department, which are based on addresses provided by people making a claim for an unemployment payment, there are currently approximately 392 persons who state that they reside in the East Wall area of Dublin and who are signing on the Live Register.<\/p><p>  Should additional information be required the organisation concerned should contact the Manager of the Social Welfare Local Office at Kings Inns St, Dublin 1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRQ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts","counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRQ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":466,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[45303\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRQ01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide details in tabular form for the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012 the total amount of expenditure on consultancy by her Department, any body under her aegis or State agency for which she has responsibility; the names of the consultancy companies awarded contracts; the nature of the work concerned; the fees paid to each consultant; if the matter was advertised for competitive tender","asker":"1008","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":467,"content":"<p>My Department engages a range of consultants (individuals or organisations) to provide intellectual or knowledge based services (expert analysis and advice).<\/p><p>Total expenditure on the engagement of consultants by my Department for the years 2008 to the end of September 2012 is set out below and consultancies involved are detailed in the following tables.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>2008 (Outturn)<\/th><th>&#8364;1,919,600<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2009 (Outturn)<\/td><td>&#8364;1,145,917<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010 (Outturn)<\/td><td>&#8364;596,663<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011 (Outturn)<\/td><td>&#8364;893,056<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012 (to end of September)<\/td><td>&#8364;593,669<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The majority of expenditure on consultancy expertise is to support the Department in implementing a multi-annual service delivery modernisation programme to enhance the efficiency and quality of delivery of services to customers.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage, including thatched buildings, by including them on the Record of Protected Structures. Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future. In the first instance, therefore, the owner of a thatched property should refer to the relevant local authority to ascertain if the property is included in the Record of Protected Structures.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department, with the assistance of an Expert Advisory Committee representing key stakeholders, is currently concluding a review of the operation of Part IV of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012. The review will consider the need, in the light of current economic circumstances, for alternative ways of supporting the conservation of protected structures.<\/p><p><br \/>  While the overall number of thatched roofs declined in the second half of the 20th century, increased legislative protection for the architectural heritage and heightened awareness of this part of our national heritage has meant that this decline has stabilised.<\/p><p>There are a number of State financial supports currently available to owners\/occupiers of thatched structures. In 2012 my Department is providing &#8364;500,000 in grant-aid assistance through a <i>Structures at Risk Fund<\/i> administered by local authorities to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012 and, in certain cases, works to structures within Architectural Conservation Areas. I have approved offers of funding for the conservation of two thatched structures in 2012 under this scheme, which is administered by the local authorities. The closing date for applications for 2012 has now passed.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, also administers a Heritage Management Grant Scheme under which applications for the conservation of thatched structures are considered. However, I understand that the closing date for applications for this scheme for 2012 has also passed.<\/p><p>In partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Heritage Council also administers a grants scheme to REPS 4 participants on the conservation and repair of traditional farm buildings called the <i>Traditional Farm Buildings Grant Scheme,<\/i> which is now open for applications. Grants are available under this scheme to carry out approved conservation works to the exterior of farm outbuildings, including roofs.<\/p><p><br \/>  I further understand that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government administers a grant scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs of owner-occupied houses.<\/p><p><br \/>  The level of funding available in 2013 and future years for these schemes will be subject to the normal Budgetary and Estimates processes. As the Deputy can appreciate, the scope for additional funding for the conservation of the built heritage is constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances.<\/p><p>Finally, as part of an Architectural Advice Series, my Department plans to publish an advice book on thatching in 2013, which will include further practical advice and guidance on aspects of conserving and restoring thatched structures.  The nine previously published booklets in the series cover areas such as roof and energy efficiency for traditionally built buildings and the full series is accessible on my Department&#8217;s website at .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRR02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":505,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRR02800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":504,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRR02700"},{"type":"question","counter":505,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[45014\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRR02800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide in tabular form, in respect of 2011, the number of payments issued by his Department and each agency within the remit of his Department to suppliers in respect of the supply of goods and services; splitting the payments between those issued within 30 days of receipt of the invoice; between 30 and 60 days of receipt of the invoice; between 60 and 90 days of receipt of the invoice; between 90 and 120 days of receipt of the invoice; and in excess of 120 days of receipt of the invoice.","asker":"993","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":506,"content":"<p>My Department aims, in its dealings with suppliers of goods and services, to pay all invoices as soon as possible after the goods and services have been satisfactorily delivered and the supporting documentation necessary to enable the payment has been received by my Department.

Such interventions are always subject to EU State Aid clearance to ensure no unacceptable level of market distortion takes place.<\/p><p>  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive affordable broadband provision.  In total, there were 102 applications from persons living in County Westmeath (including 21 from the general area of Ballynacargy) who consented to receive offers of service from Internet Service Providers participating in the Scheme. Offers of service were made to all of these applicants during the period from April to the end of July this year.<\/p><p>  The response to date by industry suggests that virtually all eligible applicants under the Scheme are capable of obtaining a broadband service from a supplier using one of the available technology platforms i.e. DSL, fixed or mobile wireless, cable or satellite.  Obviously, where a commercial service is shown to be available, the State cannot intervene with a subvention for alternative services as to do so would be a breach of State Aid rules.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;Digital Agenda for Europe&rdquo; target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.<\/p><p>  The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published recently, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically: 70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; at least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and a minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of the Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.<\/p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including areas such as Ballynacargy, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRS01700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":530,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRS01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Charges","counter":529,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRS01750"},{"type":"question","counter":530,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[44982\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRS01800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has considered exempting primary and post primary schools from paying water charges.","asker":"984","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":531,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[44983\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRS01900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has considered reducing the cost of water charges to primary and post-primary schools.","asker":"984","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":532,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 and 202 together.  <\/p><p>  I refer to the reply to Question No. 439 of 16 October 2012.

These Regulations require that a Certificate of Destruction is issued on the deposit of a vehicle, falling within the scope of the regulations, at the authorised treatment facility concerned.

I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review process.<\/p><p>  In this context a comprehensive review of venues has recently been completed, the purpose of which was to establish a general framework within which venues could be considered for closure taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced.<\/p><p>  The Service has advised that the identification of venues as part of the review process does not conclusively mean that the identified venues will close.

Integration Agency (RIA), an operational unit of the Irish Naturalisation &amp; Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department, is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers under the Direct Provision system.  As of 7 October, 2012, RIA is accommodating 4,955 persons in 36 accommodation centres located in 17 counties throughout the country. Details of all of these centres are available on its website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie<\/i>.  I am regularly briefed and kept informed on all matters relating to immigration and asylum including the Direct Provision System as well as, of course, the linked matters of finance and budgets.<\/p><p><br \/>  The matter raised by the Deputy centres around the Value for Money Report and Policy Review - Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme, published in 2010, which was laid before the Oireachtas and is available on the Oireachtas website and RIA's website  <i>www.ria.gov.ie<\/i>  .   In this report, the VFM group accepted that it is not possible for RIA to achieve 100% occupancy of its accommodation - due to family configuration, sickness requiring isolation, and so on - and recommended that RIA strive for an occupancy rate of 90% or less of its available capacity.  This is a guideline and at any point in time spare capacities can be above or below this figure.  It is therefore an incorrect premise that capacity above 10% at a particular point in time is an 'excess' which can be quantified in monetary terms.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are three reasons for this. Firstly, the ebb and flow of asylum seekers requiring RIA accommodation is such that it is impossible to predict with 100% certainty that the numbers requiring accommodation will result in a spare capacity of exactly 10% or less at any one point.<\/p><p><br \/>  Secondly, contracts which RIA has with service providers are deliberately 'staggered' throughout the year to account for this ebb and flow.  Indeed, generally contracts are now for between 12 and 18 months in duration and this allows RIA to engage or disengage from contracts as required having regard to current accommodation needs.  Given the current downward trend in asylum seekers requiring accommodation, when a contract comes up for renewal a decision has to be made to seek to reduce its capacity, including adjusting capacity across a group of related centres, or to close it.  RIA makes every effort to keep family centres open, preferring instead to reduce contracted capacities. But a reduction of capacity by, say, 15% does not mean a commensurate reduction in cost and the closure of a centre may be the only economic option for the contractor.  It is simply not possible, taking into account the logistics involved in either reducing capacities or closing centres, to achieve a spare capacity of 10% at all times. This can only be achieved over a period of time taking into account projected fluctuations in demand.<\/p><p><br \/>    Thirdly, the recommendation in this respect was one of a number of inter-linked recommendations. Among the recommendations of the VFM report was the introduction of a mix of &#8216;contracts for capacity&#8217; and &#8216;contracts for availability and occupancy&#8217; as well as a 'more open' tendering system in respect of the commercially owned and operated centres in the RIA portfolio.  Preparatory work has begun on devising a more open tendering process for the commercially owned centres which could only have taken place following the recent completion of the tender competition for the management of RIA's seven State owned centres. This will be a difficult and complex exercise as the tender process will have to take account of &quot;non-money&quot; issues such as access to social, educational and health services as well as adherence to long standing Government policy on dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country so that no one region is disproportionately burdened in relation to service provision, as well as a recognition that other State agencies may have already committed resources in a particular region or area.<\/p><p><br \/>  An illustration of the complexities involved in taking actions to achieve the recommendations of the VFM report is the recent decision by RIA to close down the Lisbrook centre in Galway city.  This operation was in progress when I received a number of representations, including from the Deputy&#8217;s own party on the matter.  I instructed that the operation be suspended until the decision had been reviewed. The review concluded that the closure was necessary, particularly in view of the need to reduce bed capacity in RIA centres thereby reducing expenditure. This decision, of course, is entirely in keeping with the recommendation of the Value for Money Report and will yield a cost reduction of approximately &#8364;2 million.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the period 2009 (when significant downsizing of the RIA portfolio began) to date, a total of 23 centres have been closed.  When Lisbrook House is closed in a few weeks, that will bring the number up to 24 and will have yielded an overall reduction in capacity of 2,671.  Arising from these closures and reductions in capacity, as well as other cost saving measures introduced by RIA, the cumulative savings overall on the Direct Provision system from the end of 2008 to the end of 2012 will amount to over &#8364;67 million.<\/p><p><br \/>  Since August 2012, RIA has closed one centre - Viking Lodge in Dublin 8 (55 bed spaces) and is currently in the process of closing Lisbrook House in Galway City (284 bed spaces). Taking the closures indicated above as well as reductions in capacities on other contracts into account, RIA expects to have a capacity of 5,460 at 31 December, 2012.  Taking current occupancies rates as a base, this would represent a spare capacity of 9.2%, well within the VFM recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRU02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts","counter":601,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRV00250"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[45301\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRV00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide details in tabular form for the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012 the total amount of expenditure on consultancy by his Department, any body under his aegis or State agency for which he has responsibility; the names of the consultancy companies awarded contracts; the nature of the work concerned; the fees paid to each consultant; if the matter was advertised for competitive tender; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":603,"content":"<p>The annual spend on consultancy by my Department in each of the years 2008-2011 and to date in 2012 is as follows:<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year<\/div><\/th><th><div>Department<\/div><\/th><th><div>Agencies<\/div><\/th><th><div>Total<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>2008<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;687,678<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;1,243,317<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;1,930,995<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2009<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;184,490<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;269,829<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;454,319<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2010<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;93,388<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;141,162<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;234,550<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2011<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;33,888<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;45,260<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;79,148<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2012  to Date<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;199,541<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;50,731<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;250,272<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>My Department operates within the legal framework of EU procurement directives and the guidance of the Department of Finance for procurements under EU thresholds - as required.

On the 8th   of November last, I launched an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  The Atlas, compiled and produced by the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the support of Irish Industry, outlines a range of potential measures to help reduce discarding.<\/p><p>  This was the first publication of its kind and places Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards. The atlas will inform the process to achieve real change and a significant reduction in discarding within the new Common Fisheries Policy, identifies where action needs to be taken, and the potential measures that could be adopted. <\/p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major priority issue for me. It is all the more poignant as it is a major principle of the new reform of the CFP. Since taking up office as Marine Minister, I have worked tirelessly to influence and drive a change in policy which will ultimately lead to an end to discarding. <\/p><p>  I am conscious that any solution must be practical for fishermen and with that in mind I have worked closely with Commissioner Damanaki, my fellow Fisheries Ministers and members of the European Parliament in addition to consulting with our industry at home to ensure that proposals in the Common Fishery Policy to tackle discards would be workable and take account of the practical realities that would face fishermen at sea.  <\/p><p>  At the Council of Fisheries Ministers in June this year, I helped broker a general agreement among fisheries Ministers on the way forward for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy including innovate measures to tackle the discard problem. <\/p><p>  Discarding was the most contentious element of those discussions and threatened to block the Council&rsquo;s efforts to reach agreement. A compromise approach which I tabled for consideration setting down a definitive timetable for the elimination of discards on a phased basis, offered a practical and progressive solution on the issue which was accepted by fellow Ministers.  <\/p><p>  I will prioritise securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on the CFP during the Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":638,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRW00725"},{"type":"question","counter":639,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[45006\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRW00750","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment of a forestry grant will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":640,"content":"<p>There were a number of technical difficulties with the application these are in the course of being resolved.

My Department is represented on the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee which is a Sub-Committee of the Health and Safety Authority.  The Committee advises the Board on the direction the HSA should take in relation to farm safety.  My Department is very strongly committed to promoting Farm Safety in collaboration with the HSA and has taken a number of steps over the past year in tandem with some of the other State and industry organisations to both raise awareness of the problem and educate farmers and their families on the dangers of working in this industry.   <\/p><p>The most recent measure taken by my Department was the inclusion of a Farm Safety message with the Single Payment application packs, which were distributed in March of this year to over 130,000 farmers.  This was a joint initiative between my Department, the Health and Safety Authority and the Farm Safety Partnership Committee and led to each of those farmers receiving an individual reminder of the importance of farming safely, and the potentially fatal consequences of not doing so.<\/p><p>  The HSA produced an excellent DVD earlier this year containing testimonials from 6 individual farmers who provide an emotional telling of their experiences on farm which led to either fatalities or serious injury.  This DVD has been widely circulated is included in all training courses undertaken by my Department. <\/p><p>  My colleague Minister of State McEntee made the opening address at the National Farm Safety Conference in June. The National Farm Safety Conference is one of the highlights of the Farm Safety calendar and my Department is fully committed to helping raise the profile of this Conference among farmers so that the farm safety message remains high on everyone&rsquo;s agenda. <\/p><p>  Other actions by my Department include: <\/p><p>  -\tThe provision to all farms of a Code of Practice aimed at reducing farm accidents.<\/p><p>  -\tThe inclusion of Health and Safety Guidelines in all Building Specifications drawn up by my Department.<\/p><p>  -\tThe inclusion of Farm Safety in all REPS Training Courses.<\/p><p>  -\tA dedicated area on the DAFM website outlining the requirements on Farm Safety and practical advice on Safety on Farms.<\/p><p>  -\tMy Department has asked Teagasc to include a farm safety element in the Dairy Discussion Groups participating in the Dairy Efficiency Programme 2010-2012.<\/p><p>  -\tRegular Press Statements drawing attention to Farm Safety agenda.<\/p><p>  There is no single action or organisation that can solve this difficult problem that impacts so horrendously, on so many lives, each year. Since taking office, I have continuously strived to increase awareness of safety issues among farmers which I believe is the key to changing the way we all think about farm safety on Irish farms.  We must all work together with the single goal of preventing farm accidents and therefore saving lives and minimising serious injuries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts","counter":695,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRY01150"},{"type":"question","counter":696,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[45290\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRY01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide details in tabular form for the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012 the total amount of expenditure on consultancy by his Department, any body under his aegis or State agency for which he has responsibility; the names of the consultancy companies awarded contracts; the nature of the work concerned; the fees paid to each consultant; if the matter was advertised for competitive tender; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":697,"content":"<p>My Department uses private contractors, consultants and agencies to provide certain services when such proves to be more cost effective and Department staff are not available.

I am informed that no explicit need in terms of land committed to energy crops has been established.  The actual amount required will depend on a number of factors such as the market price for bioenergy, the availability of other sources, particularly forest biomass and also the availability of imports.<\/p><p><br \/>  Estimates made by SEAI in relation to renewable energy targets depend on a range of assumptions about the future, including demand projections, the impact of energy efficiency policy and the extent of co-firing in peat powered stations.  In this context the SEAI has stated that the outcome of their analysis is a scenario rather than a forecast.  For example, one such scenario developed in the SEAI publication of December 2011 <i>Energy Forecasts for Ireland to 2020<\/i>  suggests that in terms of biomass contribution to renewable electricity, meeting the requirement with domestic resources could need up to 30,000 hectares of land from energy crops.  This scenario is presented by SEAI merely to show the scale required in the event that the only available resource is domestically grown energy crops.  This figure assumes no imports and no contribution from forestry.  The reality is that the vast bulk of the biomass contribution to reaching 2020 targets will come from the forestry sector.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy may be aware that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has announced his intention to publish a National Bioenergy Strategy in the coming months.

In line with Government Decision No. S29296 of 19 May 2009, every effort, consistent with proper financial procedures, is being made to ensure that all suppliers are paid within 15 calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice.  My Department publishes quarterly reports on prompt payments on our website and the reports for 2011 can be viewed at www.doh.ie.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the HSE,  I can assure the Deputy that the Executive is committed to standard payment terms of 30 days. However, given the multitude of processing centres across the HSE, and indeed within its individual units, in order to meet a 15 day period, it would require the introduction of a single financial and procurement system. Whilst there are plans in this regard, it will be some time before this is in place. Taking into account that over 7,000 invoices are received daily by the Executive across a multiplicity of service delivery units, it has consistently been my Department's view that it is not logistically possible to apply the 15 day payment rule to the HSE at this time. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding this, the introduction of Prompt Payments legislation and the refinancing arrangements introduced and overseen by this Department have seen the HSE comprehensively address the issue of late payment. It should be noted that as a result of the improvement in payments, the HSE only paid &euro;324,000 in prompt payment interest in 2011, which was just one third of 1% of its non-pay budget for that year.<\/p><p>  As regards the other agencies under the aegis of my Department, work is underway to redesign their IT systems to capture the appropriate data in order to publish this information on their websites in line with the Government Decision.  It should be acknowledged that many of these agencies receive either minimal or no funding from my Department, and in all cases, the vast majority of invoices are paid within the terms of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRAA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Fluoridation","counter":757,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRAA01750"},{"type":"question","counter":758,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[45029\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRAA01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of pollution incidences that have occurred from fluoride facilities that have resulted in the uncontrolled discharge of fluoride chemicals into the environment since 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":759,"content":"<p>My Department has no responsibility in regard to the incidence of pollution at water treatment plants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRAA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Administration","counter":760,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRAA01950"},{"type":"question","counter":761,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[45042\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRAA02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when an appointment will be arranged at Waterford Regional Hospital in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Wexford.","asker":"1096","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":762,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRAA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Fluoridation","counter":763,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRAA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":764,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[45046\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRAA02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if either he or management within the Health Service Executive have read the history of fluoridation provided by BBC Journalist Christopher Byson's in his book The Fluoride Deception; in view of the fact that the Fluoride Deception was published in 2005, his views on whether the continued practice of water fluoridation here constitutes negligence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":765,"content":"<p>The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which was established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.

The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.  The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways:<\/p><p>- Health-funded rehabilitative (life skills) training;<\/p><p>- Health-funded day services;<\/p><p>- F&Aacute;S-funded vocational training;<\/p><p>- Approval to extend education placement for a specified time.<\/p><p>  The demand for services for school-leavers continues to grow. In 2012, the number of school-leavers who require services is almost 700, and the position in 2013 is expected to be similar. Budgetary constraints and the moratorium on staff recruitment give rise to challenges in service provision. In addition the physical capacity to provide further services may not be present in all agencies. However both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of available resources in a creative and flexible manner to be as responsive as possible to the needs that present. While the HSE makes every effort to provide day services to people over 18 on leaving school, this has always been dependant on the availability and location of appropriate places coupled with the needs of the individual school-leaver. The HSE is currently reviewing the outcomes for 2012 school leavers in terms of placements achieved and scoping out the likely requirements for  2013.<\/p><p>  There is evidence that an accelerated move towards a new model of individualised, person-centred service provision in the community can help to achieve efficiencies, particularly in relation to services for those with mild or moderate intellectual disability. The HSE has established an implementation project team to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the national working group for the review of HSE funded adult day services. The report, published in February 2012,  titled 'New Directions' proposes that day services in the future take the form of a menu of 12 individualised, outcome-focussed  supports which will provide adults with disabilities with the support necessary to live a life of their choosing in accordance with their own wishes, aspirations and needs. The guiding principle for the future is that supports will be tailored to individual need and will be flexible, responsive and person-centred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRBB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":773,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRBB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":774,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[45071\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRBB00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the plans that have been put in place to ensure Saorview will be available in all Health Service Executive residences and public nursing homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":775,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":776,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRBB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":777,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[45078\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WRBB00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has received the expert group report regarding the abc case; if not, when he expects to receive the report and respond to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":778,"content":"<p>The Expert Group has met nine times and is making good progress towards finalising its report.

However, there are other sources of stem cells including bone marrow.  The benefit of stem cells in the  treatment of a range of medical conditions is being explored by scientists around the world.  In addition, many potential benefits of stem cells are at an early stage of investigation. <\/p><p>  When clinically indicated by a consultant overseeing care, collection of cord blood for donation to an identified family member in high risk families (known as &quot;directed&quot; harvesting of cord blood stem cells) is facilitated by HSE hospitals in collaboration with the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  In addition, where an identified clinical need arises, Ireland has access to cord blood stem cells through international stem cell banks and registries and this is also arranged by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  <\/p><p>  &quot;Undirected&quot; harvesting of cord blood may also take place to provide an individual with a personal store of stem cells in case the need arises for these in the future.  &quot;Undirected&quot; harvesting of cord blood is not provided publicly in Ireland at present.  The HSE does not prohibit &quot;undirected&quot; harvesting of cord blood under contract with private companies.  It is open to hospitals wishing to accommodate staff who are directly employed by third party commercial companies to undertake the procurement of cord blood at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE, provided they ensure that a service level agreement is in place between the third party commercial entity and the hospital concerned.  <\/p><p>  However, staff employed at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE cannot undertake the collection of cord blood on behalf of third party commercial entities, as this activity would not be covered under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme.  A number of hospitals have advised their clinical staff about the indemnity issues arising in this regard. <\/p><p>  Hospitals and their maternity service teams face significant challenges in ensuring that a safe and high quality maternity care system is provided to mothers and their babies within available resources.  The HSE will continue to ensure that evidence-based, safe, effective and high quality care is provided to patients and their families.

There are currently\u00a0six shipping lines providing passenger services,\u00a0with approximately 500 sailings\u00a0weekly between Ireland and Britain and continental Europe depending on the time of year.\u00a0  The Irish passenger ferry market also played a vital role in keeping Ireland's foreign transport passenger networks open during the Volcanic Ash crisis in 2010, when it carried an additional 150,000 passengers over this period.<\/p><p>  While the vast majority of our overseas visitors arrive in Ireland by air,\u00a0 836,000 visitors came to Ireland by sea in 2011. Research has shown that visitors coming to Ireland by car are very important to\u00a0our\u00a0tourism industry as they tend to stay longer, they tend to tour around more (with consequential benefits for regional tourism) and they tend to spend more than those arriving by air. Accordingly, the state tourism agencies have continually targeted this segment and\u00a0undertake co-operative marketing activity with ferry providers.<\/p><p>  In terms of price differentials in northern European ferry routes, all ferry companies servicing\u00a0routes to and from Ireland\u00a0are independent commercial companies who operate in an open and\u00a0competitive market.\u00a0 Strong competition on a route is the most effective way to ensure consumers get the best value for money.  Therefore, my Department through its agency, the Irish Maritime Development Office, works closely with all existing operators as well as\u00a0promoting Ireland as a location for new services.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that the fares charged by ferry companies are influenced by a number of factors.\u00a0The length of journeys and\u00a0fuel costs are the most significant factors contributing to the difference in cost between routes. For example, the distance between Dover to Calais is about\u00a041kms while that between\u00a0Liverpool to Dublin is nearly 220 km and Rosslare to Pembroke is about\u00a0123 kms. This means that, for example, three to four times more fuel is burned on routes on the Irish Sea than on the Dover to Calais route. The exact costs of fuel used by a vessel is also dependent upon a number of variables such as volatility of the fuel market, currency fluctuations, length of journey, speed, prevailing winds, weather, engines specification, type of vessel, age of vessel, the mix of HGV, car and foot passengers, etc. In 2011, oil prices rose sharply with Bunker prices increasing by 40% over the course of the year, adding\u00a0significantly to costs borne by\u00a0ferry operators. To remain competitive ferry companies also offer promotional fares at various times during the year, which might influence price comparisons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WREE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Museum Projects","counter":877,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WREE01150"},{"type":"question","counter":878,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[45372\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WREE01200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on the establishment of a sports museum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"968","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":879,"content":"<p>I believe\u00a0that a sports museum\u00a0would be an excellent addition to Ireland's sporting and cultural experience and\u00a0 has the potential to attract widespread public interest.\u00a0A committee has been established\u00a0to examine the feasibility of developing a Museum of Irish Sport.\u00a0The committee, which\u00a0is being chaired by Minister of State Michael Ring, is scheduled to hold its\u00a0first meeting\u00a0next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"The Gathering Expenditure","counter":880,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WREE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":881,"qnumday":321,"qnumall":"[45162\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700068#WREE01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide an update on the Gathering project 2013; if he will provide details of the way local community groups can get involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":882,"content":"<p>I am pleased to report continued good progress in\u00a0the\u00a0preparations\u00a0for \"The Gathering Ireland 2013\" which will be Ireland's biggest ever tourism initiative.<\/p><p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is the lead agency for the implementation of\u00a0 the initiative and has put in place a Project Executive\u00a0Team to implement it.\u00a0 Tourism Ireland\u00a0has specific responsibility for promoting The Gathering\u00a0in overseas markets and has also provided staff for the Project Team.<\/p><p>The\u00a0St. Patrick's day festivities were used for the overseas launch while a major domestic launch took place on Friday 11th May 2012 in Dublin Castle.

In the case of US Global Entry, access is limited to US citizens, lawful permanent residents, Dutch citizens, South Korean citizens and Mexican nationals.  A further series of systems operates on the basis of biometric technology.  IRIS in Britain makes use of the fact that the pattern of the iris in each person's eye is unique.  A registered passenger looks into a special camera at the IRIS barrier in the immigration arrival hall and the system compares his or her iris pattern with others stored in a secure database.  Another series of systems works by using facial recognition technology to compare a person's face to the photograph recorded on the chip in his or her e-passport.  Over the past year, the UK Border Agency has installed ePassport gates at London Heathrow, London Gatwick, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, East Midlands, Luton, Manchester and Stansted.

Irish VAT law is guided by the EU VAT Directive, with which it must comply, and this provision mirrors Article 132, paragraph 1(i) of the VAT Directive, which provides that EU Member States must exempt from VAT such education.  VAT exemption in this context means that schools do not charge VAT on the services they supply but cannot recover VAT on the goods and services that they purchase.  As such, schools cannot claim back the VAT paid by them for service utilities or service charges.  VAT law relates to particular goods and services.  In this respect, the VAT exemption for education must apply to all providers of school education.  It is not possible to distinguish between the various forms of school providing that education.  As it is not possible under Irish or EU VAT law to exempt schools from paying VAT on their inputs, the various costings outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s questions cannot be provided.

However, I wish to advise the Deputy that, under section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, a company can claim allowances for capital expenditure incurred on the provision of intangible assets for the purposes of its trade. These allowances apply to expenditure on a broad range of assets (e.g. patents, copyright, trademarks, know-how) that are recognised as intangible assets under generally accepted accounting practice.  The allowances, in providing relief for this expenditure, are intended to encourage companies to manage and develop the intellectual assets of their business. <\/p><p>  Allowances for an accounting period are computed by reference to the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of amortisation of the intangible asset relative to its cost. Companies can alternatively opt for a write-down of expenditure over 15 years at a rate of 7 per cent per annum and 2 per cent in the final year. As the expenditures concerned - and, accordingly, the allowances - can be for very substantial amounts, the set-off of the allowances against the related income is restricted. In particular, the aggregate amount of allowances and deductible interest on borrowings, if any, in respect of intangible assets may not exceed 80% of trading income (before the set-off of allowances and any such interest) related to those intangible assets. This ensures that at least 20% of the relevant income will continue to be chargeable to corporation tax in an accounting period. Any unused allowances and interest can be carried forward to subsequent accounting periods for offset against trading income related to the intangible assets (subject to the 80% restriction)  .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700070#WRJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Availability","counter":927,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700070#WRJ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":928,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[45262\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700070#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the tax reliefs available to a person who has their jeep adopted with a swivel chair to allow access by a person with a disability with the work done by a HSB recommended person; and if where the jeep was originally purchased has any bearing on the entitlement to relief.","asker":"1028","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":929,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 134(3) of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended) and Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 (Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 (as amended) provide for permanent relief from the payment of specified maximum amounts of VAT and VRT for persons registered under the scheme.

Additionally, in the case of a qualifying passenger, the cost of the modifications must amount to at least 10% of the tax free cost of the vehicle.

To date this has resulted in the delivery of in excess of 150,000 lecturing hours annually.  Based on the most conservative figures for hourly pay rates, the total cost if these extra hours had to be paid for would be &euro;13.25 million annually.<\/p><p>  These arrangements, which have been fully implemented in both sectors since the start of the 2011\/12 academic year, allow universities and IOTs to cope with the reduction in staff numbers while dealing with an increase in the student population.

The funding arrangements made by my Department for post primary schools reflect the sectoral division of our second-level system.  At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.

The Deputy may wish to note that Circular 48\/2009 clarifies issues relating to the allocation of funding to voluntary secondary schools.

It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals at all skills levels. The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience. It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment. The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors. <\/p><p><br \/>  The JobBridge Scheme has made significant progress to-date since it came into operation on the 1<sup>st<\/sup> July 2011. 11,010 internships have commenced to date with 5,082 participants currently on an internship as at 11<sup>th<\/sup> October 2012 and 2,253 opportunities presently advertised on<i><\/i><i><\/i>.<\/p><p><br \/>  As you are aware given the success of the programme, I asked my Department to review the criteria for availing of the programme to ensure that the scheme gives opportunities to as many as possible so that they can benefit from the success of the programme. As part of this broader review process the scheme criteria were widened to include One Parent Family Payment and Disability Allowance recipients who have been eligible to participate on JobBridge as of the 28<sup>th<\/sup> May 2012.<\/p><p><br \/>  Currently, the JobBridge Scheme requires that an internship should not be part of a training contract (e.g. as part of a training course for a professional qualification from the Law Society or one of the Accountancy Bodies or Architects). In addition, the programme currently limits access to full time third level education during the time they are with the host organisation.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The rationale behind this approach is that such training contracts with professional bodies come with terms and conditions including remuneration. In such circumstances, it is not appropriate to use an initiative such as the JobBridge scheme when training contracts are in place.  <\/p><p><br \/>  However, it must also be articulated that the Scheme is open to Host Organisations to provide internship opportunities for qualified architects. Furthermore, I can advise that existing terms and conditions of the Scheme including eligibility criteria will be re-examined as part of the independent evaluation of the Scheme currently being undertaken by Indecon International Economic Consultants. <\/p><p><br \/>  This evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme, it will provide details of the nature of the work experience of the participants; a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market and progression into employment.

It is at this stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the Scheme.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is worth noting that there are eight architect internship vacancies currently advertised on the JobBridge website <i><\/i>.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700076#WRP02900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Income Supplement Applications","counter":1130,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700076#WRP03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1131,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[45146\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700076#WRP03100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if, in view of the very considerable delays in relation to processing claims for family income supplement, she will consider processing all new claims as a priority and leaving ongoing claims in payment until such time as her Department has time to review these; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1132,"content":"<p>The Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.

Given the scale of the fiscal crisis and because spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure, you will appreciate that savings have to be found in the social welfare system.<\/p><p>  As social structures in Ireland are changing rapidly, the structures of our social support need to change to accommodate this and the changes to State pension have been made in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives. This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision given that the period for which a pension will be paid will be greater than the current time period.  <\/p><p>  In addition to the budgetary imperative, there is an important long-term policy context for the proposed changes to State pension, which includes reform of pension rate bands and gradual increases in age of retirement for State pension There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.<\/p><p>  The State pension is a very valuable benefit. Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  Recent changes to State pension supports the direct link between contributions made and the rate of pension received which underpins State pension policy.  By aligning the rate of pension paid with the contribution made ensures that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.  <\/p><p>  The change in relation to State pension (contributory) introduced in legislation from 1st  September 2012 set out a wider graduation of yearly average bands and corresponding pension rates. The aim of this change is to ensure that the rate of pension entitlement is more closely related to the level of social insurance contributions a person has paid (including credited contributions, where applicable) over their working lives. <\/p><p>  Overall, there are currently 308,752 State pension (contributory) claims in payment, at maximum and reduced rates. Of this number, there are 107,549 State pension (contributory) claims in payment at a reduced rate, where the claimants have a contributions yearly average of between 10 and 47. Everyone in receipt of a State pension (contributory) has a contributions yearly average of at least ten paid contributions as this is one of the qualifying criteria.<\/p><p>  The changes introduced from 1  September 2012 only affected those who qualified for State pension (contributory) after that date and who had an average of between 10 and 39 contributions per year. The maximum rate of pension remains unchanged and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year also remains unchanged.  However, those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  This change moves somewhat closer to the total contribution approach where those who pay more, benefit more. Since 1 September 2012, 1,800 claimants have been awarded a pension below the 98 per cent maximum rate.<\/p><p>  It is important in assessing any rates of payment that we focus on the real impact of social welfare payments. In this regard, it should be noted that older people do not experience the levels of poverty that existed in the past. This can be clearly seen in a wide range of data such as the significant reduction in the &lsquo;risk of poverty&rsquo; rate from 27.1% in 2004 to 9.6% in 2010. The consistent poverty rate over the same period also declined from 3.9% to 0.9%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700077#WRQ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Applications","counter":1147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700077#WRQ00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1148,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[45221\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700077#WRQ00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason relocation assistance is not available for people on jobseeker's allowance; if relocation assistance is available to people who wish to go abroad to take up a job offer.","asker":"988","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1149,"content":"<p>An unemployed person may qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.

Additionally, there are no plans to introduce an assistance payment for persons who wish to go abroad to take up a job offer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700077#WRQ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1150,"content":"<p>Question No. 175 answered with Question No. 159.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Live Register Numbers","counter":1151,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700077#WRQ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1152,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[45284\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700077#WRQ01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will direct the jobs facilitator at a location (details supplied) to provide details of the numbers of persons currently on the live register living in different districts of Dublin Central; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1007","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1153,"content":"<p>According to the most recent statistics available to my Department, which are based on addresses provided by people making a claim for an unemployment payment, there are currently approximately 392 persons who state that they reside in the East Wall area of Dublin and who are signing on the Live Register.<\/p><p>  Should additional information be required the organisation concerned should contact the Manager of the Social Welfare Local Office at Kings Inns St, Dublin 1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700077#WRQ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts","counter":1154,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700077#WRQ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1155,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[45303\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700077#WRQ01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide details in tabular form for the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012 the total amount of expenditure on consultancy by her Department, any body under her aegis or State agency for which she has responsibility; the names of the consultancy companies awarded contracts; the nature of the work concerned; the fees paid to each consultant; if the matter was advertised for competitive tender","asker":"1008","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1156,"content":"<p>My Department engages a range of consultants (individuals or organisations) to provide intellectual or knowledge based services (expert analysis and advice).<\/p><p>Total expenditure on the engagement of consultants by my Department for the years 2008 to the end of September 2012 is set out below and consultancies involved are detailed in the following tables.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>2008 (Outturn)<\/th><th>&#8364;1,919,600<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2009 (Outturn)<\/td><td>&#8364;1,145,917<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010 (Outturn)<\/td><td>&#8364;596,663<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011 (Outturn)<\/td><td>&#8364;893,056<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012 (to end of September)<\/td><td>&#8364;593,669<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The majority of expenditure on consultancy expertise is to support the Department in implementing a multi-annual service delivery modernisation programme to enhance the efficiency and quality of delivery of services to customers.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage, including thatched buildings, by including them on the Record of Protected Structures. Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future. In the first instance, therefore, the owner of a thatched property should refer to the relevant local authority to ascertain if the property is included in the Record of Protected Structures.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department, with the assistance of an Expert Advisory Committee representing key stakeholders, is currently concluding a review of the operation of Part IV of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012. The review will consider the need, in the light of current economic circumstances, for alternative ways of supporting the conservation of protected structures.<\/p><p><br \/>  While the overall number of thatched roofs declined in the second half of the 20th century, increased legislative protection for the architectural heritage and heightened awareness of this part of our national heritage has meant that this decline has stabilised.<\/p><p>There are a number of State financial supports currently available to owners\/occupiers of thatched structures. In 2012 my Department is providing &#8364;500,000 in grant-aid assistance through a <i>Structures at Risk Fund<\/i> administered by local authorities to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012 and, in certain cases, works to structures within Architectural Conservation Areas. I have approved offers of funding for the conservation of two thatched structures in 2012 under this scheme, which is administered by the local authorities. The closing date for applications for 2012 has now passed.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, also administers a Heritage Management Grant Scheme under which applications for the conservation of thatched structures are considered. However, I understand that the closing date for applications for this scheme for 2012 has also passed.<\/p><p>In partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Heritage Council also administers a grants scheme to REPS 4 participants on the conservation and repair of traditional farm buildings called the <i>Traditional Farm Buildings Grant Scheme,<\/i> which is now open for applications. Grants are available under this scheme to carry out approved conservation works to the exterior of farm outbuildings, including roofs.<\/p><p><br \/>  I further understand that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government administers a grant scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs of owner-occupied houses.<\/p><p><br \/>  The level of funding available in 2013 and future years for these schemes will be subject to the normal Budgetary and Estimates processes. As the Deputy can appreciate, the scope for additional funding for the conservation of the built heritage is constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances.<\/p><p>Finally, as part of an Architectural Advice Series, my Department plans to publish an advice book on thatching in 2013, which will include further practical advice and guidance on aspects of conserving and restoring thatched structures.  The nine previously published booklets in the series cover areas such as roof and energy efficiency for traditionally built buildings and the full series is accessible on my Department&#8217;s website at .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700078#WRR02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":1194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700078#WRR02800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700078#WRR02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1194,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[45014\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700078#WRR02800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide in tabular form, in respect of 2011, the number of payments issued by his Department and each agency within the remit of his Department to suppliers in respect of the supply of goods and services; splitting the payments between those issued within 30 days of receipt of the invoice; between 30 and 60 days of receipt of the invoice; between 60 and 90 days of receipt of the invoice; between 90 and 120 days of receipt of the invoice; and in excess of 120 days of receipt of the invoice.","asker":"993","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1195,"content":"<p>My Department aims, in its dealings with suppliers of goods and services, to pay all invoices as soon as possible after the goods and services have been satisfactorily delivered and the supporting documentation necessary to enable the payment has been received by my Department.

This situation necessarily requires my Department to procure specialist external professional advice notably in legal, financial and technical areas to enable it to discharge its responsibility to deliver quality services and protect the interests of the State and the taxpayer.  Projects for which my Department is responsible include the intensive and nationwide campaign on Digital Switchover, strategic review of oil refining capability, complex telecommunications contracts such as the MANs and the National Broadband Scheme, and oversight of compliance with the Corrib consent conditions (the cost of which is recouped from the developer).<\/p><p>In addition the very limited in&ndash;house technical resources in areas such as geoscience, energy and telecommunications makes it imperative to have recourse to a certain amount of external professional services in these areas.

In procuring these specialised services, my Department always seeks to ensure value for money and the keeping of expenditure to the minimum necessary.

Such interventions are always subject to EU State Aid clearance to ensure no unacceptable level of market distortion takes place.<\/p><p>  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive affordable broadband provision.  In total, there were 102 applications from persons living in County Westmeath (including 21 from the general area of Ballynacargy) who consented to receive offers of service from Internet Service Providers participating in the Scheme. Offers of service were made to all of these applicants during the period from April to the end of July this year.<\/p><p>  The response to date by industry suggests that virtually all eligible applicants under the Scheme are capable of obtaining a broadband service from a supplier using one of the available technology platforms i.e. DSL, fixed or mobile wireless, cable or satellite.  Obviously, where a commercial service is shown to be available, the State cannot intervene with a subvention for alternative services as to do so would be a breach of State Aid rules.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;Digital Agenda for Europe&rdquo; target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.<\/p><p>  The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published recently, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically: 70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; at least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and a minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of the Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.<\/p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including areas such as Ballynacargy, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRS01700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":1219,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRS01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Charges","counter":1218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRS01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1219,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[44982\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRS01800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has considered exempting primary and post primary schools from paying water charges.","asker":"984","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":1220,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[44983\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRS01900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has considered reducing the cost of water charges to primary and post-primary schools.","asker":"984","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1221,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 and 202 together.  <\/p><p>  I refer to the reply to Question No. 439 of 16 October 2012.

Under the Regulations, a wide range of obligations are imposed on vehicle producers, authorised treatment facilities, vehicle owners and local authorities. <\/p><p>  Certificates of Destruction are issued by authorised treatment facilities as prescribed in article 19 of the Regulations. These Regulations require that a Certificate of Destruction is issued on the deposit of a vehicle, falling within the scope of the regulations, at the authorised treatment facility concerned. Article 22(1)(a) of these Regulations also requires authorised treatment facilities to notify the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Section of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport based in Shannon in County Clare of Certificates of Destruction issued.

I am informed that no decision will be taken on an individual venue without prior consultation with local stakeholders and I understand that this consultation will be undertaken at an early stage in the assessment process so that all views can be fully reflected in the decision making process.  It should be noted that the final decision will be a matter for the Courts Service Board.  Under the statute I have no role or function in the matter.<\/p><p>  The Courts Service has informed me that the cost savings will be calculated as part of the detailed assessment of each individual venue.  It is anticipated that the annual cost savings per venue closed will be in the region of &euro;10,000.  It should be emphasised, however, that savings alone are not the objective and the intention of the proposed consolidation is to achieve operational efficiencies and a greater throughput of cases combined with providing an appropriate level of service to court users.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRU00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":1270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRU00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1271,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[45003\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRU01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1219 of the 18 of September 2012, the options available to a person (details supplied) in County Kildare since they have not done a degree course, and has not done one for five years; if he will outline if a further higher education course may be undertaken in this instance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1272,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my reply to D&aacute;il Question 1219 of 18 September 2012, which sets out the position in respect of the person concerned.

Integration Agency (RIA), an operational unit of the Irish Naturalisation &amp; Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department, is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers under the Direct Provision system.  As of 7 October, 2012, RIA is accommodating 4,955 persons in 36 accommodation centres located in 17 counties throughout the country. Details of all of these centres are available on its website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie<\/i>.  I am regularly briefed and kept informed on all matters relating to immigration and asylum including the Direct Provision System as well as, of course, the linked matters of finance and budgets.<\/p><p><br \/>  The matter raised by the Deputy centres around the Value for Money Report and Policy Review - Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme, published in 2010, which was laid before the Oireachtas and is available on the Oireachtas website and RIA's website  <i>www.ria.gov.ie<\/i>  .   In this report, the VFM group accepted that it is not possible for RIA to achieve 100% occupancy of its accommodation - due to family configuration, sickness requiring isolation, and so on - and recommended that RIA strive for an occupancy rate of 90% or less of its available capacity.  This is a guideline and at any point in time spare capacities can be above or below this figure.  It is therefore an incorrect premise that capacity above 10% at a particular point in time is an 'excess' which can be quantified in monetary terms.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are three reasons for this. Firstly, the ebb and flow of asylum seekers requiring RIA accommodation is such that it is impossible to predict with 100% certainty that the numbers requiring accommodation will result in a spare capacity of exactly 10% or less at any one point.<\/p><p><br \/>  Secondly, contracts which RIA has with service providers are deliberately 'staggered' throughout the year to account for this ebb and flow.  Indeed, generally contracts are now for between 12 and 18 months in duration and this allows RIA to engage or disengage from contracts as required having regard to current accommodation needs.  Given the current downward trend in asylum seekers requiring accommodation, when a contract comes up for renewal a decision has to be made to seek to reduce its capacity, including adjusting capacity across a group of related centres, or to close it.  RIA makes every effort to keep family centres open, preferring instead to reduce contracted capacities. But a reduction of capacity by, say, 15% does not mean a commensurate reduction in cost and the closure of a centre may be the only economic option for the contractor.  It is simply not possible, taking into account the logistics involved in either reducing capacities or closing centres, to achieve a spare capacity of 10% at all times. This can only be achieved over a period of time taking into account projected fluctuations in demand.<\/p><p><br \/>    Thirdly, the recommendation in this respect was one of a number of inter-linked recommendations. Among the recommendations of the VFM report was the introduction of a mix of &#8216;contracts for capacity&#8217; and &#8216;contracts for availability and occupancy&#8217; as well as a 'more open' tendering system in respect of the commercially owned and operated centres in the RIA portfolio.  Preparatory work has begun on devising a more open tendering process for the commercially owned centres which could only have taken place following the recent completion of the tender competition for the management of RIA's seven State owned centres. This will be a difficult and complex exercise as the tender process will have to take account of &quot;non-money&quot; issues such as access to social, educational and health services as well as adherence to long standing Government policy on dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country so that no one region is disproportionately burdened in relation to service provision, as well as a recognition that other State agencies may have already committed resources in a particular region or area.<\/p><p><br \/>  An illustration of the complexities involved in taking actions to achieve the recommendations of the VFM report is the recent decision by RIA to close down the Lisbrook centre in Galway city.  This operation was in progress when I received a number of representations, including from the Deputy&#8217;s own party on the matter.  I instructed that the operation be suspended until the decision had been reviewed. The review concluded that the closure was necessary, particularly in view of the need to reduce bed capacity in RIA centres thereby reducing expenditure. This decision, of course, is entirely in keeping with the recommendation of the Value for Money Report and will yield a cost reduction of approximately &#8364;2 million.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the period 2009 (when significant downsizing of the RIA portfolio began) to date, a total of 23 centres have been closed.  When Lisbrook House is closed in a few weeks, that will bring the number up to 24 and will have yielded an overall reduction in capacity of 2,671.  Arising from these closures and reductions in capacity, as well as other cost saving measures introduced by RIA, the cumulative savings overall on the Direct Provision system from the end of 2008 to the end of 2012 will amount to over &#8364;67 million.<\/p><p><br \/>  Since August 2012, RIA has closed one centre - Viking Lodge in Dublin 8 (55 bed spaces) and is currently in the process of closing Lisbrook House in Galway City (284 bed spaces). Taking the closures indicated above as well as reductions in capacities on other contracts into account, RIA expects to have a capacity of 5,460 at 31 December, 2012.  Taking current occupancies rates as a base, this would represent a spare capacity of 9.2%, well within the VFM recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRU02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts","counter":1290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRV00250"},{"type":"question","counter":1291,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[45301\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRV00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide details in tabular form for the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012 the total amount of expenditure on consultancy by his Department, any body under his aegis or State agency for which he has responsibility; the names of the consultancy companies awarded contracts; the nature of the work concerned; the fees paid to each consultant; if the matter was advertised for competitive tender; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1292,"content":"<p>The annual spend on consultancy by my Department in each of the years 2008-2011 and to date in 2012 is as follows:<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year<\/div><\/th><th><div>Department<\/div><\/th><th><div>Agencies<\/div><\/th><th><div>Total<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>2008<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;687,678<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;1,243,317<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;1,930,995<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2009<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;184,490<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;269,829<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;454,319<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2010<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;93,388<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;141,162<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;234,550<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2011<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;33,888<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;45,260<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;79,148<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2012  to Date<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;199,541<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;50,731<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;250,272<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>My Department operates within the legal framework of EU procurement directives and the guidance of the Department of Finance for procurements under EU thresholds - as required.

On the 8th   of November last, I launched an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  The Atlas, compiled and produced by the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the support of Irish Industry, outlines a range of potential measures to help reduce discarding.<\/p><p>  This was the first publication of its kind and places Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards. The atlas will inform the process to achieve real change and a significant reduction in discarding within the new Common Fisheries Policy, identifies where action needs to be taken, and the potential measures that could be adopted. <\/p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major priority issue for me. It is all the more poignant as it is a major principle of the new reform of the CFP. Since taking up office as Marine Minister, I have worked tirelessly to influence and drive a change in policy which will ultimately lead to an end to discarding. <\/p><p>  I am conscious that any solution must be practical for fishermen and with that in mind I have worked closely with Commissioner Damanaki, my fellow Fisheries Ministers and members of the European Parliament in addition to consulting with our industry at home to ensure that proposals in the Common Fishery Policy to tackle discards would be workable and take account of the practical realities that would face fishermen at sea.  <\/p><p>  At the Council of Fisheries Ministers in June this year, I helped broker a general agreement among fisheries Ministers on the way forward for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy including innovate measures to tackle the discard problem. <\/p><p>  Discarding was the most contentious element of those discussions and threatened to block the Council&rsquo;s efforts to reach agreement. A compromise approach which I tabled for consideration setting down a definitive timetable for the elimination of discards on a phased basis, offered a practical and progressive solution on the issue which was accepted by fellow Ministers.  <\/p><p>  I will prioritise securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on the CFP during the Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":1327,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRW00725"},{"type":"question","counter":1328,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[45006\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRW00750","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment of a forestry grant will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1329,"content":"<p>There were a number of technical difficulties with the application these are in the course of being resolved.

My Department is represented on the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee which is a Sub-Committee of the Health and Safety Authority.  The Committee advises the Board on the direction the HSA should take in relation to farm safety.  My Department is very strongly committed to promoting Farm Safety in collaboration with the HSA and has taken a number of steps over the past year in tandem with some of the other State and industry organisations to both raise awareness of the problem and educate farmers and their families on the dangers of working in this industry.   <\/p><p>The most recent measure taken by my Department was the inclusion of a Farm Safety message with the Single Payment application packs, which were distributed in March of this year to over 130,000 farmers.  This was a joint initiative between my Department, the Health and Safety Authority and the Farm Safety Partnership Committee and led to each of those farmers receiving an individual reminder of the importance of farming safely, and the potentially fatal consequences of not doing so.<\/p><p>  The HSA produced an excellent DVD earlier this year containing testimonials from 6 individual farmers who provide an emotional telling of their experiences on farm which led to either fatalities or serious injury.  This DVD has been widely circulated is included in all training courses undertaken by my Department. <\/p><p>  My colleague Minister of State McEntee made the opening address at the National Farm Safety Conference in June. The National Farm Safety Conference is one of the highlights of the Farm Safety calendar and my Department is fully committed to helping raise the profile of this Conference among farmers so that the farm safety message remains high on everyone&rsquo;s agenda. <\/p><p>  Other actions by my Department include: <\/p><p>  -\tThe provision to all farms of a Code of Practice aimed at reducing farm accidents.<\/p><p>  -\tThe inclusion of Health and Safety Guidelines in all Building Specifications drawn up by my Department.<\/p><p>  -\tThe inclusion of Farm Safety in all REPS Training Courses.<\/p><p>  -\tA dedicated area on the DAFM website outlining the requirements on Farm Safety and practical advice on Safety on Farms.<\/p><p>  -\tMy Department has asked Teagasc to include a farm safety element in the Dairy Discussion Groups participating in the Dairy Efficiency Programme 2010-2012.<\/p><p>  -\tRegular Press Statements drawing attention to Farm Safety agenda.<\/p><p>  There is no single action or organisation that can solve this difficult problem that impacts so horrendously, on so many lives, each year. Since taking office, I have continuously strived to increase awareness of safety issues among farmers which I believe is the key to changing the way we all think about farm safety on Irish farms.  We must all work together with the single goal of preventing farm accidents and therefore saving lives and minimising serious injuries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts","counter":1384,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRY01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1385,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[45290\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRY01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide details in tabular form for the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012 the total amount of expenditure on consultancy by his Department, any body under his aegis or State agency for which he has responsibility; the names of the consultancy companies awarded contracts; the nature of the work concerned; the fees paid to each consultant; if the matter was advertised for competitive tender; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1386,"content":"<p>My Department uses private contractors, consultants and agencies to provide certain services when such proves to be more cost effective and Department staff are not available.

I am informed that no explicit need in terms of land committed to energy crops has been established.  The actual amount required will depend on a number of factors such as the market price for bioenergy, the availability of other sources, particularly forest biomass and also the availability of imports.<\/p><p><br \/>  Estimates made by SEAI in relation to renewable energy targets depend on a range of assumptions about the future, including demand projections, the impact of energy efficiency policy and the extent of co-firing in peat powered stations.  In this context the SEAI has stated that the outcome of their analysis is a scenario rather than a forecast.  For example, one such scenario developed in the SEAI publication of December 2011 <i>Energy Forecasts for Ireland to 2020<\/i>  suggests that in terms of biomass contribution to renewable electricity, meeting the requirement with domestic resources could need up to 30,000 hectares of land from energy crops.  This scenario is presented by SEAI merely to show the scale required in the event that the only available resource is domestically grown energy crops.  This figure assumes no imports and no contribution from forestry.  The reality is that the vast bulk of the biomass contribution to reaching 2020 targets will come from the forestry sector.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy may be aware that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has announced his intention to publish a National Bioenergy Strategy in the coming months.

In line with Government Decision No. S29296 of 19 May 2009, every effort, consistent with proper financial procedures, is being made to ensure that all suppliers are paid within 15 calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice.  My Department publishes quarterly reports on prompt payments on our website and the reports for 2011 can be viewed at www.doh.ie.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the HSE,  I can assure the Deputy that the Executive is committed to standard payment terms of 30 days. However, given the multitude of processing centres across the HSE, and indeed within its individual units, in order to meet a 15 day period, it would require the introduction of a single financial and procurement system. Whilst there are plans in this regard, it will be some time before this is in place. Taking into account that over 7,000 invoices are received daily by the Executive across a multiplicity of service delivery units, it has consistently been my Department's view that it is not logistically possible to apply the 15 day payment rule to the HSE at this time. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding this, the introduction of Prompt Payments legislation and the refinancing arrangements introduced and overseen by this Department have seen the HSE comprehensively address the issue of late payment. It should be noted that as a result of the improvement in payments, the HSE only paid &euro;324,000 in prompt payment interest in 2011, which was just one third of 1% of its non-pay budget for that year.<\/p><p>  As regards the other agencies under the aegis of my Department, work is underway to redesign their IT systems to capture the appropriate data in order to publish this information on their websites in line with the Government Decision.  It should be acknowledged that many of these agencies receive either minimal or no funding from my Department, and in all cases, the vast majority of invoices are paid within the terms of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRAA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Fluoridation","counter":1446,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRAA01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1447,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[45029\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRAA01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of pollution incidences that have occurred from fluoride facilities that have resulted in the uncontrolled discharge of fluoride chemicals into the environment since 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1448,"content":"<p>My Department has no responsibility in regard to the incidence of pollution at water treatment plants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRAA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Administration","counter":1449,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRAA01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1450,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[45042\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRAA02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when an appointment will be arranged at Waterford Regional Hospital in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Wexford.","asker":"1096","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1451,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRAA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Fluoridation","counter":1452,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRAA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1453,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[45046\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRAA02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if either he or management within the Health Service Executive have read the history of fluoridation provided by BBC Journalist Christopher Byson's in his book The Fluoride Deception; in view of the fact that the Fluoride Deception was published in 2005, his views on whether the continued practice of water fluoridation here constitutes negligence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1454,"content":"<p>The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which was established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.

The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.  The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways:<\/p><p>- Health-funded rehabilitative (life skills) training;<\/p><p>- Health-funded day services;<\/p><p>- F&Aacute;S-funded vocational training;<\/p><p>- Approval to extend education placement for a specified time.<\/p><p>  The demand for services for school-leavers continues to grow. In 2012, the number of school-leavers who require services is almost 700, and the position in 2013 is expected to be similar. Budgetary constraints and the moratorium on staff recruitment give rise to challenges in service provision. In addition the physical capacity to provide further services may not be present in all agencies. However both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of available resources in a creative and flexible manner to be as responsive as possible to the needs that present. While the HSE makes every effort to provide day services to people over 18 on leaving school, this has always been dependant on the availability and location of appropriate places coupled with the needs of the individual school-leaver. The HSE is currently reviewing the outcomes for 2012 school leavers in terms of placements achieved and scoping out the likely requirements for  2013.<\/p><p>  There is evidence that an accelerated move towards a new model of individualised, person-centred service provision in the community can help to achieve efficiencies, particularly in relation to services for those with mild or moderate intellectual disability. The HSE has established an implementation project team to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the national working group for the review of HSE funded adult day services. The report, published in February 2012,  titled 'New Directions' proposes that day services in the future take the form of a menu of 12 individualised, outcome-focussed  supports which will provide adults with disabilities with the support necessary to live a life of their choosing in accordance with their own wishes, aspirations and needs. The guiding principle for the future is that supports will be tailored to individual need and will be flexible, responsive and person-centred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRBB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":1462,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRBB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1463,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[45071\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRBB00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the plans that have been put in place to ensure Saorview will be available in all Health Service Executive residences and public nursing homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1464,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":1465,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRBB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1466,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[45078\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WRBB00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has received the expert group report regarding the abc case; if not, when he expects to receive the report and respond to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1467,"content":"<p>The Expert Group has met nine times and is making good progress towards finalising its report.

However, there are other sources of stem cells including bone marrow.  The benefit of stem cells in the  treatment of a range of medical conditions is being explored by scientists around the world.  In addition, many potential benefits of stem cells are at an early stage of investigation. <\/p><p>  When clinically indicated by a consultant overseeing care, collection of cord blood for donation to an identified family member in high risk families (known as &quot;directed&quot; harvesting of cord blood stem cells) is facilitated by HSE hospitals in collaboration with the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  In addition, where an identified clinical need arises, Ireland has access to cord blood stem cells through international stem cell banks and registries and this is also arranged by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  <\/p><p>  &quot;Undirected&quot; harvesting of cord blood may also take place to provide an individual with a personal store of stem cells in case the need arises for these in the future.  &quot;Undirected&quot; harvesting of cord blood is not provided publicly in Ireland at present.  The HSE does not prohibit &quot;undirected&quot; harvesting of cord blood under contract with private companies.  It is open to hospitals wishing to accommodate staff who are directly employed by third party commercial companies to undertake the procurement of cord blood at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE, provided they ensure that a service level agreement is in place between the third party commercial entity and the hospital concerned.  <\/p><p>  However, staff employed at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE cannot undertake the collection of cord blood on behalf of third party commercial entities, as this activity would not be covered under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme.  A number of hospitals have advised their clinical staff about the indemnity issues arising in this regard. <\/p><p>  Hospitals and their maternity service teams face significant challenges in ensuring that a safe and high quality maternity care system is provided to mothers and their babies within available resources.  The HSE will continue to ensure that evidence-based, safe, effective and high quality care is provided to patients and their families.

There are currently\u00a0six shipping lines providing passenger services,\u00a0with approximately 500 sailings\u00a0weekly between Ireland and Britain and continental Europe depending on the time of year.\u00a0  The Irish passenger ferry market also played a vital role in keeping Ireland's foreign transport passenger networks open during the Volcanic Ash crisis in 2010, when it carried an additional 150,000 passengers over this period.<\/p><p>  While the vast majority of our overseas visitors arrive in Ireland by air,\u00a0 836,000 visitors came to Ireland by sea in 2011. Research has shown that visitors coming to Ireland by car are very important to\u00a0our\u00a0tourism industry as they tend to stay longer, they tend to tour around more (with consequential benefits for regional tourism) and they tend to spend more than those arriving by air. Accordingly, the state tourism agencies have continually targeted this segment and\u00a0undertake co-operative marketing activity with ferry providers.<\/p><p>  In terms of price differentials in northern European ferry routes, all ferry companies servicing\u00a0routes to and from Ireland\u00a0are independent commercial companies who operate in an open and\u00a0competitive market.\u00a0 Strong competition on a route is the most effective way to ensure consumers get the best value for money.  Therefore, my Department through its agency, the Irish Maritime Development Office, works closely with all existing operators as well as\u00a0promoting Ireland as a location for new services.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that the fares charged by ferry companies are influenced by a number of factors.\u00a0The length of journeys and\u00a0fuel costs are the most significant factors contributing to the difference in cost between routes. For example, the distance between Dover to Calais is about\u00a041kms while that between\u00a0Liverpool to Dublin is nearly 220 km and Rosslare to Pembroke is about\u00a0123 kms. This means that, for example, three to four times more fuel is burned on routes on the Irish Sea than on the Dover to Calais route. The exact costs of fuel used by a vessel is also dependent upon a number of variables such as volatility of the fuel market, currency fluctuations, length of journey, speed, prevailing winds, weather, engines specification, type of vessel, age of vessel, the mix of HGV, car and foot passengers, etc. In 2011, oil prices rose sharply with Bunker prices increasing by 40% over the course of the year, adding\u00a0significantly to costs borne by\u00a0ferry operators. To remain competitive ferry companies also offer promotional fares at various times during the year, which might influence price comparisons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WREE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Museum Projects","counter":1566,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WREE01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1567,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[45372\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WREE01200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on the establishment of a sports museum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"968","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1568,"content":"<p>I believe\u00a0that a sports museum\u00a0would be an excellent addition to Ireland's sporting and cultural experience and\u00a0 has the potential to attract widespread public interest.\u00a0A committee has been established\u00a0to examine the feasibility of developing a Museum of Irish Sport.\u00a0The committee, which\u00a0is being chaired by Minister of State Michael Ring, is scheduled to hold its\u00a0first meeting\u00a0next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"The Gathering Expenditure","counter":1569,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WREE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1570,"qnumday":321,"qnumall":"[45162\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700079#WREE01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide an update on the Gathering project 2013; if he will provide details of the way local community groups can get involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"948"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":1573,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRT00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Household Charge","counter":1572,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRT00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1573,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[45085\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRT00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding the non principal private residence charge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1574,"content":"<p>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on non-principal private residences.

Under the Regulations, a wide range of obligations are imposed on vehicle producers, authorised treatment facilities, vehicle owners and local authorities. <\/p><p>  Certificates of Destruction are issued by authorised treatment facilities as prescribed in article 19 of the Regulations. These Regulations require that a Certificate of Destruction is issued on the deposit of a vehicle, falling within the scope of the regulations, at the authorised treatment facility concerned. Article 22(1)(a) of these Regulations also requires authorised treatment facilities to notify the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Section of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport based in Shannon in County Clare of Certificates of Destruction issued. There is no payment recoverable by the operator of an authorised treatment facility from my Department or any agency operating under the aegis of my Department for issuing Certificates of Destruction. <\/p><p>  Under article 9 of the Regulations, producers are required to establish national collection systems for the appropriate treatment and recovery of end-of-life vehicles of their particular brands. As a minimum and in accordance with the proximity principle, each producer&rsquo;s national collection system is required to have at least one authorised treatment facility in each city and county council area that will provide free take-back for vehicles of that producer&rsquo;s brand. In order to fulfil their obligations under this article, producers have entered into contractual agreements with authorised treatment facilities operating in the functional area of each local authority. Subject to compliance with all relevant provisions of the Regulations, it is a matter for producers and authorised treatment facilities alike to determine the financial conditions of such contracts. It should be further noted that given the current high value of scrap metal, there are very few end-of-life vehicles with a negative value at present. <\/p><p>  An examination of all aspects of the end-of-life vehicle system is currently being conducted by my Department as part of a wide ranging review of the producer responsibility initiatives in operation in Ireland. This review will provide recommendations on how to improve the funding and reporting structures and environmental outputs of the end-of-life vehicle system in order to enable Ireland to operate successfully in meeting our domestic and EU environmental obligations in the medium to long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts","counter":1593,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRT01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1594,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[45296\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRT01600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide details in tabular form for the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012 the total amount of expenditure on consultancy by his Department, any body under his aegis or State agency for which he has responsibility; the names of the consultancy companies awarded contracts; the nature of the work concerned; the fees paid to each consultant; if the matter was advertised for competitive tender; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1595,"content":"<p>Annual expenditure on consultancies by my Department over the period in question is as follows:<\/p><p><table><tr><th><\/th><th><div><br \/>2008 <br \/><\/div><\/th><th><div>2009 <br \/><\/div><\/th><th><div>2010 <br \/><\/div><\/th><th><div>2011 <br \/><\/div><\/th><th><div>2012 (to date) <\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Consultancy Expenditure <\/td><td><div>&#8364;5.594m <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364; 2 .051m <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;0.994m <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;0.323m <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;0.369m <\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The awarding of consultancy contracts in my Department is carried out in accordance with Guidelines for the Engagement of Consultants and Other External Support by the Civil Service, published by the Department of Finance.<\/p><p>Details of consultancy expenditure for each year are set out as follows.

I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review process.<\/p><p>  In this context a comprehensive review of venues has recently been completed, the purpose of which was to establish a general framework within which venues could be considered for closure taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced.<\/p><p>  The Service has advised that the identification of venues as part of the review process does not conclusively mean that the identified venues will close.  I am informed that no decision will be taken on an individual venue without prior consultation with local stakeholders and I understand that this consultation will be undertaken at an early stage in the assessment process so that all views can be fully reflected in the decision making process.  It should be noted that the final decision will be a matter for the Courts Service Board.  Under the statute I have no role or function in the matter.<\/p><p>  The Courts Service has informed me that the cost savings will be calculated as part of the detailed assessment of each individual venue.

I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that the Courts Service, in common with all other public sector organisations, is obliged to ensure that resources are deployed to best effect to ensure continuity of service with reduced budgets and resources.  Greater flexibility in the deployment of available resources will be critical in maintaining the delivery of front line court services.<\/p><p>The Courts Service has informed me that the impact of vacancies on the provision of services varies between court offices depending on the number of vacancies and the skill sets available in each office.  The Service has put in place contingency plans customised to meet the needs of individual offices.  These plans include technical skills training to address the skills and knowledge deficit resulting from vacancies.  In addition, the Courts Service has indicated to applicants that they may lodge probate applications with the Probate Registry in Dublin, if they wish to do so.  The Service has also put in place a series of work force planning measures over the last three years to ensure that available resources are deployed to best effect including the centralising of processes, creation of multi-jurisdictional combined court offices, rationalisation of court venues and offices, rationalisation and standardisation of processes and an ongoing review of resource allocation including redeployment to front line services.<\/p><p>The table below sets out the current position in each office:<\/p><p><table><tr><th><br \/><div>Circuit Court Office\/ Combined Office<\/div><\/th><th><br \/><div>**Total staff <br \/>currently serving<\/div><\/th><th><br \/><div>Number <br \/>of Vacancies<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>*Mayo<\/td><td><br \/><div>10<\/div><\/td><td><br \/><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>*Cavan<\/td><td><br \/><div>3<\/div><\/td><td><br \/><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>Tipperary<\/td><td><br \/><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><br \/><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>Cork<\/td><td><br \/><div>28<\/div><\/td><td><br \/><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>Louth<\/td><td><br \/><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><br \/><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>*Galway<\/td><td><br \/><div>11<\/div><\/td><td><br \/><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>*Kilkenny<\/td><td><br \/><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><br \/><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>Donegal<\/td><td><br \/><div>11<\/div><\/td><td><br \/><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>Limerick<\/td><td><br \/><div>13<\/div><\/td><td><br \/><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>*Westmeath<\/td><td><br \/><div>7<\/div><\/td><td><br \/><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>Sligo<\/td><td><br \/><div>7<\/div><\/td><td><br \/><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>Kerry<\/td><td><br \/><div>7<\/div><\/td><td><br \/><div>5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>*Waterford<\/td><td><br \/><div>15<\/div><\/td><td><br \/><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>Wexford<\/td><td><br \/><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><br \/><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/>Total<\/td><td><br \/><div>138<\/div><\/td><td><br \/><div>23<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>*These are now combined court offices.<\/p><p>** The number of staff in each court office responsible for all aspects of court work not exclusively probate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRU01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Seeker Accommodation","counter":1628,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRU01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1629,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[45285\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRU01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of accommodation centres closed by the Reception and Integration Agency since August 2012, and the decreased number of asylum seekers spaces taken out of the system as a result of the closures;

Integration Agency (RIA), an operational unit of the Irish Naturalisation &amp; Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department, is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers under the Direct Provision system.  As of 7 October, 2012, RIA is accommodating 4,955 persons in 36 accommodation centres located in 17 counties throughout the country. Details of all of these centres are available on its website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie<\/i>.  I am regularly briefed and kept informed on all matters relating to immigration and asylum including the Direct Provision System as well as, of course, the linked matters of finance and budgets.<\/p><p><br \/>  The matter raised by the Deputy centres around the Value for Money Report and Policy Review - Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme, published in 2010, which was laid before the Oireachtas and is available on the Oireachtas website and RIA's website  <i>www.ria.gov.ie<\/i>  .   In this report, the VFM group accepted that it is not possible for RIA to achieve 100% occupancy of its accommodation - due to family configuration, sickness requiring isolation, and so on - and recommended that RIA strive for an occupancy rate of 90% or less of its available capacity.  This is a guideline and at any point in time spare capacities can be above or below this figure.  It is therefore an incorrect premise that capacity above 10% at a particular point in time is an 'excess' which can be quantified in monetary terms.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are three reasons for this. Firstly, the ebb and flow of asylum seekers requiring RIA accommodation is such that it is impossible to predict with 100% certainty that the numbers requiring accommodation will result in a spare capacity of exactly 10% or less at any one point.<\/p><p><br \/>  Secondly, contracts which RIA has with service providers are deliberately 'staggered' throughout the year to account for this ebb and flow.  Indeed, generally contracts are now for between 12 and 18 months in duration and this allows RIA to engage or disengage from contracts as required having regard to current accommodation needs.  Given the current downward trend in asylum seekers requiring accommodation, when a contract comes up for renewal a decision has to be made to seek to reduce its capacity, including adjusting capacity across a group of related centres, or to close it.  RIA makes every effort to keep family centres open, preferring instead to reduce contracted capacities. But a reduction of capacity by, say, 15% does not mean a commensurate reduction in cost and the closure of a centre may be the only economic option for the contractor.  It is simply not possible, taking into account the logistics involved in either reducing capacities or closing centres, to achieve a spare capacity of 10% at all times. This can only be achieved over a period of time taking into account projected fluctuations in demand.<\/p><p><br \/>    Thirdly, the recommendation in this respect was one of a number of inter-linked recommendations. Among the recommendations of the VFM report was the introduction of a mix of &#8216;contracts for capacity&#8217; and &#8216;contracts for availability and occupancy&#8217; as well as a 'more open' tendering system in respect of the commercially owned and operated centres in the RIA portfolio.  Preparatory work has begun on devising a more open tendering process for the commercially owned centres which could only have taken place following the recent completion of the tender competition for the management of RIA's seven State owned centres. This will be a difficult and complex exercise as the tender process will have to take account of &quot;non-money&quot; issues such as access to social, educational and health services as well as adherence to long standing Government policy on dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country so that no one region is disproportionately burdened in relation to service provision, as well as a recognition that other State agencies may have already committed resources in a particular region or area.<\/p><p><br \/>  An illustration of the complexities involved in taking actions to achieve the recommendations of the VFM report is the recent decision by RIA to close down the Lisbrook centre in Galway city.  This operation was in progress when I received a number of representations, including from the Deputy&#8217;s own party on the matter.  I instructed that the operation be suspended until the decision had been reviewed. The review concluded that the closure was necessary, particularly in view of the need to reduce bed capacity in RIA centres thereby reducing expenditure. This decision, of course, is entirely in keeping with the recommendation of the Value for Money Report and will yield a cost reduction of approximately &#8364;2 million.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the period 2009 (when significant downsizing of the RIA portfolio began) to date, a total of 23 centres have been closed.  When Lisbrook House is closed in a few weeks, that will bring the number up to 24 and will have yielded an overall reduction in capacity of 2,671.  Arising from these closures and reductions in capacity, as well as other cost saving measures introduced by RIA, the cumulative savings overall on the Direct Provision system from the end of 2008 to the end of 2012 will amount to over &#8364;67 million.<\/p><p><br \/>  Since August 2012, RIA has closed one centre - Viking Lodge in Dublin 8 (55 bed spaces) and is currently in the process of closing Lisbrook House in Galway City (284 bed spaces). Taking the closures indicated above as well as reductions in capacities on other contracts into account, RIA expects to have a capacity of 5,460 at 31 December, 2012.  Taking current occupancies rates as a base, this would represent a spare capacity of 9.2%, well within the VFM recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRU02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts","counter":1636,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRV00250"},{"type":"question","counter":1637,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[45301\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRV00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide details in tabular form for the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012 the total amount of expenditure on consultancy by his Department, any body under his aegis or State agency for which he has responsibility; the names of the consultancy companies awarded contracts; the nature of the work concerned; the fees paid to each consultant; if the matter was advertised for competitive tender; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1638,"content":"<p>The annual spend on consultancy by my Department in each of the years 2008-2011 and to date in 2012 is as follows:<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year<\/div><\/th><th><div>Department<\/div><\/th><th><div>Agencies<\/div><\/th><th><div>Total<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>2008<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;687,678<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;1,243,317<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;1,930,995<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2009<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;184,490<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;269,829<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;454,319<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2010<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;93,388<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;141,162<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;234,550<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2011<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;33,888<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;45,260<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;79,148<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2012  to Date<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;199,541<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;50,731<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;250,272<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>My Department operates within the legal framework of EU procurement directives and the guidance of the Department of Finance for procurements under EU thresholds - as required.

On the 8th   of November last, I launched an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  The Atlas, compiled and produced by the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the support of Irish Industry, outlines a range of potential measures to help reduce discarding.<\/p><p>  This was the first publication of its kind and places Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards. The atlas will inform the process to achieve real change and a significant reduction in discarding within the new Common Fisheries Policy, identifies where action needs to be taken, and the potential measures that could be adopted. <\/p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major priority issue for me. It is all the more poignant as it is a major principle of the new reform of the CFP. Since taking up office as Marine Minister, I have worked tirelessly to influence and drive a change in policy which will ultimately lead to an end to discarding. <\/p><p>  I am conscious that any solution must be practical for fishermen and with that in mind I have worked closely with Commissioner Damanaki, my fellow Fisheries Ministers and members of the European Parliament in addition to consulting with our industry at home to ensure that proposals in the Common Fishery Policy to tackle discards would be workable and take account of the practical realities that would face fishermen at sea.  <\/p><p>  At the Council of Fisheries Ministers in June this year, I helped broker a general agreement among fisheries Ministers on the way forward for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy including innovate measures to tackle the discard problem. <\/p><p>  Discarding was the most contentious element of those discussions and threatened to block the Council&rsquo;s efforts to reach agreement. A compromise approach which I tabled for consideration setting down a definitive timetable for the elimination of discards on a phased basis, offered a practical and progressive solution on the issue which was accepted by fellow Ministers.  <\/p><p>  I will prioritise securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on the CFP during the Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":1673,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRW00725"},{"type":"question","counter":1674,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[45006\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRW00750","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment of a forestry grant will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1675,"content":"<p>There were a number of technical difficulties with the application these are in the course of being resolved.

The Committee advises the Board on the direction the HSA should take in relation to farm safety.  My Department is very strongly committed to promoting Farm Safety in collaboration with the HSA and has taken a number of steps over the past year in tandem with some of the other State and industry organisations to both raise awareness of the problem and educate farmers and their families on the dangers of working in this industry.   <\/p><p>The most recent measure taken by my Department was the inclusion of a Farm Safety message with the Single Payment application packs, which were distributed in March of this year to over 130,000 farmers.  This was a joint initiative between my Department, the Health and Safety Authority and the Farm Safety Partnership Committee and led to each of those farmers receiving an individual reminder of the importance of farming safely, and the potentially fatal consequences of not doing so.<\/p><p>  The HSA produced an excellent DVD earlier this year containing testimonials from 6 individual farmers who provide an emotional telling of their experiences on farm which led to either fatalities or serious injury.  This DVD has been widely circulated is included in all training courses undertaken by my Department. <\/p><p>  My colleague Minister of State McEntee made the opening address at the National Farm Safety Conference in June. The National Farm Safety Conference is one of the highlights of the Farm Safety calendar and my Department is fully committed to helping raise the profile of this Conference among farmers so that the farm safety message remains high on everyone&rsquo;s agenda. <\/p><p>  Other actions by my Department include: <\/p><p>  -\tThe provision to all farms of a Code of Practice aimed at reducing farm accidents.<\/p><p>  -\tThe inclusion of Health and Safety Guidelines in all Building Specifications drawn up by my Department.<\/p><p>  -\tThe inclusion of Farm Safety in all REPS Training Courses.<\/p><p>  -\tA dedicated area on the DAFM website outlining the requirements on Farm Safety and practical advice on Safety on Farms.<\/p><p>  -\tMy Department has asked Teagasc to include a farm safety element in the Dairy Discussion Groups participating in the Dairy Efficiency Programme 2010-2012.<\/p><p>  -\tRegular Press Statements drawing attention to Farm Safety agenda.<\/p><p>  There is no single action or organisation that can solve this difficult problem that impacts so horrendously, on so many lives, each year.

I am informed that no explicit need in terms of land committed to energy crops has been established.  The actual amount required will depend on a number of factors such as the market price for bioenergy, the availability of other sources, particularly forest biomass and also the availability of imports.<\/p><p><br \/>  Estimates made by SEAI in relation to renewable energy targets depend on a range of assumptions about the future, including demand projections, the impact of energy efficiency policy and the extent of co-firing in peat powered stations.  In this context the SEAI has stated that the outcome of their analysis is a scenario rather than a forecast.  For example, one such scenario developed in the SEAI publication of December 2011 <i>Energy Forecasts for Ireland to 2020<\/i>  suggests that in terms of biomass contribution to renewable electricity, meeting the requirement with domestic resources could need up to 30,000 hectares of land from energy crops.  This scenario is presented by SEAI merely to show the scale required in the event that the only available resource is domestically grown energy crops.  This figure assumes no imports and no contribution from forestry.  The reality is that the vast bulk of the biomass contribution to reaching 2020 targets will come from the forestry sector.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy may be aware that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has announced his intention to publish a National Bioenergy Strategy in the coming months.

However, I can assure the Deputy that both my Department and the agencies under its aegis make every effort to comply with the terms set out in the Prompt Payments of Accounts Act, 1997.<\/p><p>  My Department is committed to making every effort to pay its suppliers promptly.  In line with Government Decision No. S29296 of 19 May 2009, every effort, consistent with proper financial procedures, is being made to ensure that all suppliers are paid within 15 calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice.  My Department publishes quarterly reports on prompt payments on our website and the reports for 2011 can be viewed at www.doh.ie.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the HSE,  I can assure the Deputy that the Executive is committed to standard payment terms of 30 days. However, given the multitude of processing centres across the HSE, and indeed within its individual units, in order to meet a 15 day period, it would require the introduction of a single financial and procurement system. Whilst there are plans in this regard, it will be some time before this is in place. Taking into account that over 7,000 invoices are received daily by the Executive across a multiplicity of service delivery units, it has consistently been my Department's view that it is not logistically possible to apply the 15 day payment rule to the HSE at this time. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding this, the introduction of Prompt Payments legislation and the refinancing arrangements introduced and overseen by this Department have seen the HSE comprehensively address the issue of late payment. It should be noted that as a result of the improvement in payments, the HSE only paid &euro;324,000 in prompt payment interest in 2011, which was just one third of 1% of its non-pay budget for that year.<\/p><p>  As regards the other agencies under the aegis of my Department, work is underway to redesign their IT systems to capture the appropriate data in order to publish this information on their websites in line with the Government Decision.  It should be acknowledged that many of these agencies receive either minimal or no funding from my Department, and in all cases, the vast majority of invoices are paid within the terms of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRAA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Fluoridation","counter":1792,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRAA01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1793,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[45029\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRAA01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of pollution incidences that have occurred from fluoride facilities that have resulted in the uncontrolled discharge of fluoride chemicals into the environment since 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1794,"content":"<p>My Department has no responsibility in regard to the incidence of pollution at water treatment plants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRAA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Administration","counter":1795,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRAA01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1796,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[45042\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRAA02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when an appointment will be arranged at Waterford Regional Hospital in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Wexford.","asker":"1096","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1797,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRAA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Fluoridation","counter":1798,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRAA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1799,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[45046\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRAA02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if either he or management within the Health Service Executive have read the history of fluoridation provided by BBC Journalist Christopher Byson's in his book The Fluoride Deception; in view of the fact that the Fluoride Deception was published in 2005, his views on whether the continued practice of water fluoridation here constitutes negligence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1800,"content":"<p>The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which was established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.

The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.  The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways:<\/p><p>- Health-funded rehabilitative (life skills) training;<\/p><p>- Health-funded day services;<\/p><p>- F&Aacute;S-funded vocational training;<\/p><p>- Approval to extend education placement for a specified time.<\/p><p>  The demand for services for school-leavers continues to grow. In 2012, the number of school-leavers who require services is almost 700, and the position in 2013 is expected to be similar. Budgetary constraints and the moratorium on staff recruitment give rise to challenges in service provision. In addition the physical capacity to provide further services may not be present in all agencies. However both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of available resources in a creative and flexible manner to be as responsive as possible to the needs that present. While the HSE makes every effort to provide day services to people over 18 on leaving school, this has always been dependant on the availability and location of appropriate places coupled with the needs of the individual school-leaver. The HSE is currently reviewing the outcomes for 2012 school leavers in terms of placements achieved and scoping out the likely requirements for  2013.<\/p><p>  There is evidence that an accelerated move towards a new model of individualised, person-centred service provision in the community can help to achieve efficiencies, particularly in relation to services for those with mild or moderate intellectual disability. The HSE has established an implementation project team to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the national working group for the review of HSE funded adult day services. The report, published in February 2012,  titled 'New Directions' proposes that day services in the future take the form of a menu of 12 individualised, outcome-focussed  supports which will provide adults with disabilities with the support necessary to live a life of their choosing in accordance with their own wishes, aspirations and needs. The guiding principle for the future is that supports will be tailored to individual need and will be flexible, responsive and person-centred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRBB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":1808,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRBB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1809,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[45071\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRBB00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the plans that have been put in place to ensure Saorview will be available in all Health Service Executive residences and public nursing homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1810,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":1811,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRBB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1812,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[45078\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WRBB00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has received the expert group report regarding the abc case; if not, when he expects to receive the report and respond to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1813,"content":"<p>The Expert Group has met nine times and is making good progress towards finalising its report.

However, there are other sources of stem cells including bone marrow.  The benefit of stem cells in the  treatment of a range of medical conditions is being explored by scientists around the world.  In addition, many potential benefits of stem cells are at an early stage of investigation. <\/p><p>  When clinically indicated by a consultant overseeing care, collection of cord blood for donation to an identified family member in high risk families (known as &quot;directed&quot; harvesting of cord blood stem cells) is facilitated by HSE hospitals in collaboration with the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  In addition, where an identified clinical need arises, Ireland has access to cord blood stem cells through international stem cell banks and registries and this is also arranged by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  <\/p><p>  &quot;Undirected&quot; harvesting of cord blood may also take place to provide an individual with a personal store of stem cells in case the need arises for these in the future.  &quot;Undirected&quot; harvesting of cord blood is not provided publicly in Ireland at present.  The HSE does not prohibit &quot;undirected&quot; harvesting of cord blood under contract with private companies.  It is open to hospitals wishing to accommodate staff who are directly employed by third party commercial companies to undertake the procurement of cord blood at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE, provided they ensure that a service level agreement is in place between the third party commercial entity and the hospital concerned.  <\/p><p>  However, staff employed at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE cannot undertake the collection of cord blood on behalf of third party commercial entities, as this activity would not be covered under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme.

The HSE will continue to ensure that evidence-based, safe, effective and high quality care is provided to patients and their families.

There are currently\u00a0six shipping lines providing passenger services,\u00a0with approximately 500 sailings\u00a0weekly between Ireland and Britain and continental Europe depending on the time of year.\u00a0  The Irish passenger ferry market also played a vital role in keeping Ireland's foreign transport passenger networks open during the Volcanic Ash crisis in 2010, when it carried an additional 150,000 passengers over this period.<\/p><p>  While the vast majority of our overseas visitors arrive in Ireland by air,\u00a0 836,000 visitors came to Ireland by sea in 2011. Research has shown that visitors coming to Ireland by car are very important to\u00a0our\u00a0tourism industry as they tend to stay longer, they tend to tour around more (with consequential benefits for regional tourism) and they tend to spend more than those arriving by air. Accordingly, the state tourism agencies have continually targeted this segment and\u00a0undertake co-operative marketing activity with ferry providers.<\/p><p>  In terms of price differentials in northern European ferry routes, all ferry companies servicing\u00a0routes to and from Ireland\u00a0are independent commercial companies who operate in an open and\u00a0competitive market.\u00a0 Strong competition on a route is the most effective way to ensure consumers get the best value for money.  Therefore, my Department through its agency, the Irish Maritime Development Office, works closely with all existing operators as well as\u00a0promoting Ireland as a location for new services.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that the fares charged by ferry companies are influenced by a number of factors.\u00a0The length of journeys and\u00a0fuel costs are the most significant factors contributing to the difference in cost between routes. For example, the distance between Dover to Calais is about\u00a041kms while that between\u00a0Liverpool to Dublin is nearly 220 km and Rosslare to Pembroke is about\u00a0123 kms. This means that, for example, three to four times more fuel is burned on routes on the Irish Sea than on the Dover to Calais route. The exact costs of fuel used by a vessel is also dependent upon a number of variables such as volatility of the fuel market, currency fluctuations, length of journey, speed, prevailing winds, weather, engines specification, type of vessel, age of vessel, the mix of HGV, car and foot passengers, etc. In 2011, oil prices rose sharply with Bunker prices increasing by 40% over the course of the year, adding\u00a0significantly to costs borne by\u00a0ferry operators. To remain competitive ferry companies also offer promotional fares at various times during the year, which might influence price comparisons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WREE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Museum Projects","counter":1912,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WREE01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1913,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[45372\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WREE01200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on the establishment of a sports museum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"968","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1914,"content":"<p>I believe\u00a0that a sports museum\u00a0would be an excellent addition to Ireland's sporting and cultural experience and\u00a0 has the potential to attract widespread public interest.\u00a0A committee has been established\u00a0to examine the feasibility of developing a Museum of Irish Sport.\u00a0The committee, which\u00a0is being chaired by Minister of State Michael Ring, is scheduled to hold its\u00a0first meeting\u00a0next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"The Gathering Expenditure","counter":1915,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WREE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1916,"qnumday":321,"qnumall":"[45162\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700080#WREE01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide an update on the Gathering project 2013; if he will provide details of the way local community groups can get involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"948"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":1919,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700081#WRU00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rent Reviews","counter":1918,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700081#WRU00250"},{"type":"question","counter":1919,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[45369\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700081#WRU00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the agreed lease on the main premises of An Bord Plean&aacute;la at Marlborough Street, Dublin 1, is subject to an upwards only review clause; if he will confirm that a new lease was recently agreed on the premises; if so, if the new lease contains the same upwards only review clause; if he will provide the full financial cost of renting the premises per year since it has been occupied by An Bord Plean&aacute;la; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1920,"content":"<p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la entered into a 25 year lease on 22 January 2002.

Integration Agency (RIA), an operational unit of the Irish Naturalisation &amp; Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department, is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers under the Direct Provision system.  As of 7 October, 2012, RIA is accommodating 4,955 persons in 36 accommodation centres located in 17 counties throughout the country. Details of all of these centres are available on its website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie<\/i>.  I am regularly briefed and kept informed on all matters relating to immigration and asylum including the Direct Provision System as well as, of course, the linked matters of finance and budgets.<\/p><p><br \/>  The matter raised by the Deputy centres around the Value for Money Report and Policy Review - Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme, published in 2010, which was laid before the Oireachtas and is available on the Oireachtas website and RIA's website  <i>www.ria.gov.ie<\/i>  .   In this report, the VFM group accepted that it is not possible for RIA to achieve 100% occupancy of its accommodation - due to family configuration, sickness requiring isolation, and so on - and recommended that RIA strive for an occupancy rate of 90% or less of its available capacity.  This is a guideline and at any point in time spare capacities can be above or below this figure.  It is therefore an incorrect premise that capacity above 10% at a particular point in time is an 'excess' which can be quantified in monetary terms.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are three reasons for this. Firstly, the ebb and flow of asylum seekers requiring RIA accommodation is such that it is impossible to predict with 100% certainty that the numbers requiring accommodation will result in a spare capacity of exactly 10% or less at any one point.<\/p><p><br \/>  Secondly, contracts which RIA has with service providers are deliberately 'staggered' throughout the year to account for this ebb and flow.  Indeed, generally contracts are now for between 12 and 18 months in duration and this allows RIA to engage or disengage from contracts as required having regard to current accommodation needs.  Given the current downward trend in asylum seekers requiring accommodation, when a contract comes up for renewal a decision has to be made to seek to reduce its capacity, including adjusting capacity across a group of related centres, or to close it.  RIA makes every effort to keep family centres open, preferring instead to reduce contracted capacities. But a reduction of capacity by, say, 15% does not mean a commensurate reduction in cost and the closure of a centre may be the only economic option for the contractor.  It is simply not possible, taking into account the logistics involved in either reducing capacities or closing centres, to achieve a spare capacity of 10% at all times. This can only be achieved over a period of time taking into account projected fluctuations in demand.<\/p><p><br \/>    Thirdly, the recommendation in this respect was one of a number of inter-linked recommendations. Among the recommendations of the VFM report was the introduction of a mix of &#8216;contracts for capacity&#8217; and &#8216;contracts for availability and occupancy&#8217; as well as a 'more open' tendering system in respect of the commercially owned and operated centres in the RIA portfolio.  Preparatory work has begun on devising a more open tendering process for the commercially owned centres which could only have taken place following the recent completion of the tender competition for the management of RIA's seven State owned centres. This will be a difficult and complex exercise as the tender process will have to take account of &quot;non-money&quot; issues such as access to social, educational and health services as well as adherence to long standing Government policy on dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country so that no one region is disproportionately burdened in relation to service provision, as well as a recognition that other State agencies may have already committed resources in a particular region or area.<\/p><p><br \/>  An illustration of the complexities involved in taking actions to achieve the recommendations of the VFM report is the recent decision by RIA to close down the Lisbrook centre in Galway city.  This operation was in progress when I received a number of representations, including from the Deputy&#8217;s own party on the matter.  I instructed that the operation be suspended until the decision had been reviewed. The review concluded that the closure was necessary, particularly in view of the need to reduce bed capacity in RIA centres thereby reducing expenditure. This decision, of course, is entirely in keeping with the recommendation of the Value for Money Report and will yield a cost reduction of approximately &#8364;2 million.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the period 2009 (when significant downsizing of the RIA portfolio began) to date, a total of 23 centres have been closed.  When Lisbrook House is closed in a few weeks, that will bring the number up to 24 and will have yielded an overall reduction in capacity of 2,671.  Arising from these closures and reductions in capacity, as well as other cost saving measures introduced by RIA, the cumulative savings overall on the Direct Provision system from the end of 2008 to the end of 2012 will amount to over &#8364;67 million.<\/p><p><br \/>  Since August 2012, RIA has closed one centre - Viking Lodge in Dublin 8 (55 bed spaces) and is currently in the process of closing Lisbrook House in Galway City (284 bed spaces). Taking the closures indicated above as well as reductions in capacities on other contracts into account, RIA expects to have a capacity of 5,460 at 31 December, 2012.  Taking current occupancies rates as a base, this would represent a spare capacity of 9.2%, well within the VFM recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700081#WRU02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts","counter":1947,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700082#WRV00250"},{"type":"question","counter":1948,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[45301\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700082#WRV00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide details in tabular form for the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012 the total amount of expenditure on consultancy by his Department, any body under his aegis or State agency for which he has responsibility; the names of the consultancy companies awarded contracts; the nature of the work concerned; the fees paid to each consultant; if the matter was advertised for competitive tender; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1949,"content":"<p>The annual spend on consultancy by my Department in each of the years 2008-2011 and to date in 2012 is as follows:<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year<\/div><\/th><th><div>Department<\/div><\/th><th><div>Agencies<\/div><\/th><th><div>Total<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>2008<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;687,678<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;1,243,317<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;1,930,995<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2009<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;184,490<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;269,829<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;454,319<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2010<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;93,388<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;141,162<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;234,550<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2011<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;33,888<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;45,260<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;79,148<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2012  to Date<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;199,541<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;50,731<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;250,272<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>My Department operates within the legal framework of EU procurement directives and the guidance of the Department of Finance for procurements under EU thresholds - as required.

On the 8th   of November last, I launched an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  The Atlas, compiled and produced by the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the support of Irish Industry, outlines a range of potential measures to help reduce discarding.<\/p><p>  This was the first publication of its kind and places Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards. The atlas will inform the process to achieve real change and a significant reduction in discarding within the new Common Fisheries Policy, identifies where action needs to be taken, and the potential measures that could be adopted. <\/p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major priority issue for me. It is all the more poignant as it is a major principle of the new reform of the CFP. Since taking up office as Marine Minister, I have worked tirelessly to influence and drive a change in policy which will ultimately lead to an end to discarding. <\/p><p>  I am conscious that any solution must be practical for fishermen and with that in mind I have worked closely with Commissioner Damanaki, my fellow Fisheries Ministers and members of the European Parliament in addition to consulting with our industry at home to ensure that proposals in the Common Fishery Policy to tackle discards would be workable and take account of the practical realities that would face fishermen at sea.  <\/p><p>  At the Council of Fisheries Ministers in June this year, I helped broker a general agreement among fisheries Ministers on the way forward for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy including innovate measures to tackle the discard problem. <\/p><p>  Discarding was the most contentious element of those discussions and threatened to block the Council&rsquo;s efforts to reach agreement. A compromise approach which I tabled for consideration setting down a definitive timetable for the elimination of discards on a phased basis, offered a practical and progressive solution on the issue which was accepted by fellow Ministers.  <\/p><p>  I will prioritise securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on the CFP during the Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700083#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":1984,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700083#WRW00725"},{"type":"question","counter":1985,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[45006\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700083#WRW00750","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment of a forestry grant will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1986,"content":"<p>There were a number of technical difficulties with the application these are in the course of being resolved.

My Department is represented on the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee which is a Sub-Committee of the Health and Safety Authority.  The Committee advises the Board on the direction the HSA should take in relation to farm safety.  My Department is very strongly committed to promoting Farm Safety in collaboration with the HSA and has taken a number of steps over the past year in tandem with some of the other State and industry organisations to both raise awareness of the problem and educate farmers and their families on the dangers of working in this industry.   <\/p><p>The most recent measure taken by my Department was the inclusion of a Farm Safety message with the Single Payment application packs, which were distributed in March of this year to over 130,000 farmers.  This was a joint initiative between my Department, the Health and Safety Authority and the Farm Safety Partnership Committee and led to each of those farmers receiving an individual reminder of the importance of farming safely, and the potentially fatal consequences of not doing so.<\/p><p>  The HSA produced an excellent DVD earlier this year containing testimonials from 6 individual farmers who provide an emotional telling of their experiences on farm which led to either fatalities or serious injury.  This DVD has been widely circulated is included in all training courses undertaken by my Department. <\/p><p>  My colleague Minister of State McEntee made the opening address at the National Farm Safety Conference in June. The National Farm Safety Conference is one of the highlights of the Farm Safety calendar and my Department is fully committed to helping raise the profile of this Conference among farmers so that the farm safety message remains high on everyone&rsquo;s agenda. <\/p><p>  Other actions by my Department include: <\/p><p>  -\tThe provision to all farms of a Code of Practice aimed at reducing farm accidents.<\/p><p>  -\tThe inclusion of Health and Safety Guidelines in all Building Specifications drawn up by my Department.<\/p><p>  -\tThe inclusion of Farm Safety in all REPS Training Courses.<\/p><p>  -\tA dedicated area on the DAFM website outlining the requirements on Farm Safety and practical advice on Safety on Farms.<\/p><p>  -\tMy Department has asked Teagasc to include a farm safety element in the Dairy Discussion Groups participating in the Dairy Efficiency Programme 2010-2012.<\/p><p>  -\tRegular Press Statements drawing attention to Farm Safety agenda.<\/p><p>  There is no single action or organisation that can solve this difficult problem that impacts so horrendously, on so many lives, each year. Since taking office, I have continuously strived to increase awareness of safety issues among farmers which I believe is the key to changing the way we all think about farm safety on Irish farms.

The actual amount required will depend on a number of factors such as the market price for bioenergy, the availability of other sources, particularly forest biomass and also the availability of imports.<\/p><p><br \/>  Estimates made by SEAI in relation to renewable energy targets depend on a range of assumptions about the future, including demand projections, the impact of energy efficiency policy and the extent of co-firing in peat powered stations.  In this context the SEAI has stated that the outcome of their analysis is a scenario rather than a forecast.  For example, one such scenario developed in the SEAI publication of December 2011 <i>Energy Forecasts for Ireland to 2020<\/i>  suggests that in terms of biomass contribution to renewable electricity, meeting the requirement with domestic resources could need up to 30,000 hectares of land from energy crops.  This scenario is presented by SEAI merely to show the scale required in the event that the only available resource is domestically grown energy crops.  This figure assumes no imports and no contribution from forestry.  The reality is that the vast bulk of the biomass contribution to reaching 2020 targets will come from the forestry sector.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy may be aware that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has announced his intention to publish a National Bioenergy Strategy in the coming months.

In line with Government Decision No. S29296 of 19 May 2009, every effort, consistent with proper financial procedures, is being made to ensure that all suppliers are paid within 15 calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice.

Whilst there are plans in this regard, it will be some time before this is in place.

The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.  The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways:<\/p><p>- Health-funded rehabilitative (life skills) training;<\/p><p>- Health-funded day services;<\/p><p>- F&Aacute;S-funded vocational training;<\/p><p>- Approval to extend education placement for a specified time.<\/p><p>  The demand for services for school-leavers continues to grow. In 2012, the number of school-leavers who require services is almost 700, and the position in 2013 is expected to be similar. Budgetary constraints and the moratorium on staff recruitment give rise to challenges in service provision. In addition the physical capacity to provide further services may not be present in all agencies. However both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of available resources in a creative and flexible manner to be as responsive as possible to the needs that present. While the HSE makes every effort to provide day services to people over 18 on leaving school, this has always been dependant on the availability and location of appropriate places coupled with the needs of the individual school-leaver. The HSE is currently reviewing the outcomes for 2012 school leavers in terms of placements achieved and scoping out the likely requirements for  2013.<\/p><p>  There is evidence that an accelerated move towards a new model of individualised, person-centred service provision in the community can help to achieve efficiencies, particularly in relation to services for those with mild or moderate intellectual disability. The HSE has established an implementation project team to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the national working group for the review of HSE funded adult day services. The report, published in February 2012,  titled 'New Directions' proposes that day services in the future take the form of a menu of 12 individualised, outcome-focussed  supports which will provide adults with disabilities with the support necessary to live a life of their choosing in accordance with their own wishes, aspirations and needs. The guiding principle for the future is that supports will be tailored to individual need and will be flexible, responsive and person-centred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700088#WRBB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":2119,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700088#WRBB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":2120,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[45071\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700088#WRBB00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the plans that have been put in place to ensure Saorview will be available in all Health Service Executive residences and public nursing homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2121,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700088#WRBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":2122,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700088#WRBB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":2123,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[45078\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700088#WRBB00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has received the expert group report regarding the abc case; if not, when he expects to receive the report and respond to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2124,"content":"<p>The Expert Group has met nine times and is making good progress towards finalising its report.

However, there are other sources of stem cells including bone marrow.  The benefit of stem cells in the  treatment of a range of medical conditions is being explored by scientists around the world.  In addition, many potential benefits of stem cells are at an early stage of investigation. <\/p><p>  When clinically indicated by a consultant overseeing care, collection of cord blood for donation to an identified family member in high risk families (known as &quot;directed&quot; harvesting of cord blood stem cells) is facilitated by HSE hospitals in collaboration with the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  In addition, where an identified clinical need arises, Ireland has access to cord blood stem cells through international stem cell banks and registries and this is also arranged by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  <\/p><p>  &quot;Undirected&quot; harvesting of cord blood may also take place to provide an individual with a personal store of stem cells in case the need arises for these in the future.  &quot;Undirected&quot; harvesting of cord blood is not provided publicly in Ireland at present.  The HSE does not prohibit &quot;undirected&quot; harvesting of cord blood under contract with private companies.  It is open to hospitals wishing to accommodate staff who are directly employed by third party commercial companies to undertake the procurement of cord blood at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE, provided they ensure that a service level agreement is in place between the third party commercial entity and the hospital concerned.  <\/p><p>  However, staff employed at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE cannot undertake the collection of cord blood on behalf of third party commercial entities, as this activity would not be covered under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme.  A number of hospitals have advised their clinical staff about the indemnity issues arising in this regard. <\/p><p>  Hospitals and their maternity service teams face significant challenges in ensuring that a safe and high quality maternity care system is provided to mothers and their babies within available resources.  The HSE will continue to ensure that evidence-based, safe, effective and high quality care is provided to patients and their families.  To this end the HSE and my Department will keep the emergence of the clinical benefits of cord blood banking under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700090#WRDD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Services","counter":2193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700090#WRDD01175"},{"type":"question","counter":2194,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[45357\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700090#WRDD01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the date on which the new Accident and Emergency Department in the Mater Hospital, Dublin, will be opened; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2195,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700090#WRDD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":2197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700090#WRDD01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety","counter":2196,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700090#WRDD01350"},{"type":"question","counter":2197,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[44994\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700090#WRDD01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to introduce measures to promote the safety of motorcycles here.","asker":"1019","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2198,"content":"<p>Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I.

There are currently\u00a0six shipping lines providing passenger services,\u00a0with approximately 500 sailings\u00a0weekly between Ireland and Britain and continental Europe depending on the time of year.\u00a0  The Irish passenger ferry market also played a vital role in keeping Ireland's foreign transport passenger networks open during the Volcanic Ash crisis in 2010, when it carried an additional 150,000 passengers over this period.<\/p><p>  While the vast majority of our overseas visitors arrive in Ireland by air,\u00a0 836,000 visitors came to Ireland by sea in 2011. Research has shown that visitors coming to Ireland by car are very important to\u00a0our\u00a0tourism industry as they tend to stay longer, they tend to tour around more (with consequential benefits for regional tourism) and they tend to spend more than those arriving by air. Accordingly, the state tourism agencies have continually targeted this segment and\u00a0undertake co-operative marketing activity with ferry providers.<\/p><p>  In terms of price differentials in northern European ferry routes, all ferry companies servicing\u00a0routes to and from Ireland\u00a0are independent commercial companies who operate in an open and\u00a0competitive market.\u00a0 Strong competition on a route is the most effective way to ensure consumers get the best value for money.  Therefore, my Department through its agency, the Irish Maritime Development Office, works closely with all existing operators as well as\u00a0promoting Ireland as a location for new services.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that the fares charged by ferry companies are influenced by a number of factors.\u00a0The length of journeys and\u00a0fuel costs are the most significant factors contributing to the difference in cost between routes. For example, the distance between Dover to Calais is about\u00a041kms while that between\u00a0Liverpool to Dublin is nearly 220 km and Rosslare to Pembroke is about\u00a0123 kms. This means that, for example, three to four times more fuel is burned on routes on the Irish Sea than on the Dover to Calais route. The exact costs of fuel used by a vessel is also dependent upon a number of variables such as volatility of the fuel market, currency fluctuations, length of journey, speed, prevailing winds, weather, engines specification, type of vessel, age of vessel, the mix of HGV, car and foot passengers, etc. In 2011, oil prices rose sharply with Bunker prices increasing by 40% over the course of the year, adding\u00a0significantly to costs borne by\u00a0ferry operators. To remain competitive ferry companies also offer promotional fares at various times during the year, which might influence price comparisons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700091#WREE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Museum Projects","counter":2223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700091#WREE01150"},{"type":"question","counter":2224,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[45372\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700091#WREE01200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on the establishment of a sports museum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"968","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2225,"content":"<p>I believe\u00a0that a sports museum\u00a0would be an excellent addition to Ireland's sporting and cultural experience and\u00a0 has the potential to attract widespread public interest.\u00a0A committee has been established\u00a0to examine the feasibility of developing a Museum of Irish Sport.\u00a0The committee, which\u00a0is being chaired by Minister of State Michael Ring, is scheduled to hold its\u00a0first meeting\u00a0next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700091#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"The Gathering Expenditure","counter":2226,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700091#WREE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":2227,"qnumday":321,"qnumall":"[45162\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101700091#WREE01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide an update on the Gathering project 2013; if he will provide details of the way local community groups can get involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2228,"content":"<p>I am pleased to report continued good progress in\u00a0the\u00a0preparations\u00a0for \"The Gathering Ireland 2013\" which will be Ireland's biggest ever tourism initiative.<\/p><p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is the lead agency for the implementation of\u00a0 the initiative and has put in place a Project Executive\u00a0Team to implement it.\u00a0 Tourism Ireland\u00a0has specific responsibility for promoting The Gathering\u00a0in overseas markets and has also provided staff for the Project Team.<\/p><p>The\u00a0St. Patrick's day festivities were used for the overseas launch while a major domestic launch took place on Friday 11th May 2012 in Dublin Castle.
