I welcome the opportunity to provide an update on recent developments at St. Loman's Hospital, Mullingar.  The HSE tells me that the hospital no longer has any patients resident within the old main buildings as a result of a programme of relocation undertaken by the HSE.  Most of the patients have been relocated to the new acute admissions unit on campus, which has a maximum capacity of 44 patients.  Other patients have been rehoused in high-support and medium-support hostels in the community.  The patients from St. Brigid's and St. Marie Goretti wards in the building have been relocated to St. Brigid's and St. Marie Goretti wards in the new 100-bed Cluain Lir community nursing unit on the campus of St. Mary's Hospital in Mullingar, which was built and made ready for occupation some time ago.  Together, these wards have a maximum capacity of 42.  The HSE has progressed the proposed renovation of St. Brigid's block on the St. Loman's campus to accommodate the remaining staff who are currently in the main building in St. Loman's, along with other administrative staff, and this project has now progressed to tender.  These renovation works, when complete, will enable the relocation of all remaining staff in the main building.  Once the main building is vacated, the HSE will consider the disposal of the main building but will retain the remainder of the campus, which is in use.  This disposal of the main building will be undertaken in line with established HSE protocol for the disposal of surplus property.  The executive is obliged at all times to obtain value for money when disposing of surplus property assets.<\/p> <p>I understand from reports that the Committee of Public Accounts will consider inviting Console to account for itself in light of what we have heard.

The Leas-Chathaoirleach will recall that I raised concerns last week regarding the failure to advance a primary care centre for Crumlin and Drimnagh.  Despite it having been announced in 2012, I told the House that the days of Ministers and Departments making announcements for the purpose of spin and as public relations exercises must come to an end.  Yesterday, with regard to the DART underground, the Minister told the committee:<\/p><blockquote>There is every intention of its being a project.  It is being designed and kept alive and will certainly be eligible for EU funding.<\/blockquote> <p>The estimated cost of the project when it was first envisaged was in the region of &euro;3 billion.  With regard to metro north, the Minister also stated:<\/p><blockquote>We must not lose sight of that project, along with metro north and others.  If funds became available, the timetable for that and the DART underground should be looked at anew because they are so important.<\/blockquote> <p>Looking at old Estimates, the cost of completing metro north was estimated to be in the region of &euro;2.5 billion.  Like many Dubliners, I am extremely frustrated by the levels of congestion in the city.  I welcome the prospect of the DART underground being built.  I also welcome the Minister's comments on metro north.  However, I have concerns about whether it is realistic that the projects will proceed.  What are the real prospects of these projects being delivered, given the enormous amount of funding that is required?<\/p><p>The Minister earmarked two projects which he should examine if funds become available.  The total cost of those projects, based on old projections, is well in excess of &euro;2 billion.  I absolutely support the prospect of those projects proceeding and believe they would have a massive impact on the capital, transforming the way those living in the capital, and visitors, travel.  However, I sincerely hope this is not a case of a Minister making grandiose statements about the prospects of these projects now being back on the cards aimed at garnering positive media coverage, with neither of the projects having a real prospect of proceeding in the near future given their massive cost.<\/p><p>I call on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to urgently produce an action plan for dealing with transport-related issues in the capital that will ease the pressure experienced by those living in the capital on a daily basis.  It should contain practical measures that are cost effective.  The Minister must also clarify if the metro north or DART underground projects receiving the necessary funding are likely to proceed.  The Minister said he will discuss with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform the possible allocation of additional capital investments for projects of this nature.  I call on the Minister, Deputy Ross, to inform the people of Dublin of the outcome of those discussions and whether he and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will find the necessary funding to proceed with these projects.  If they cannot find the funding, then the Minister must provide an honest and realistic projection of when they may get Government support to proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#G00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Will the Leader inquire of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice and Equality when the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act will be commenced?

There has been a new twist in that story this morning.  There has been considerable debate on Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta with the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, and he has acknowledged that he was at the meeting with the refuse companies a number of weeks ago with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, but that they did not discuss the issues for 37% of the users in west Galway who use bags or tags.

The outcome is that when the shared tendering process happens, UK companies are winning it hands down.

A librarian from Mayo who contacted me said that the change in the new system means that where previously they could have a book on the library shelves within 30 minutes, it is now six weeks.  If a library wishes to buy a local history book, it must go through the shared procurement system.  It might not even be in print in the UK, which means further delay.

Technology has moved on immensely since then and costs have come down.  The latest metro system built in Spain was a single bore tunnel.

It has been covered in all the media this morning.  Ongoing issues have been a factor there since 2014.  A whistleblower made very serious allegations under the various provisions of the whistleblowing legislation which I do not intend to repeat in this House.  The NMBI is charged with the protection of the public by supporting nurses and midwives and to maintain practice standards in the health service.  We know it is involved in the registration of nurses and midwives in Ireland and it also deals with fitness to practice and various issues in that regard, including safety in relation to public health.  The NMBI is a critically important body with statutory functions and it works in close co-operation with the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>A whistleblower raised concerns about operations within the NMBI with the Department of Health in 2014 and they were documented and confirmed by the then Minister.  The whistleblower was protected under the disclosure provisions set down under whistleblower legislation.  Others have now come forward and reiterated major concerns in relation to the NMBI.  Consultants appointed by the body itself undertook a report into the organisation and identified huge shortcomings.  The NMBI&rsquo;s own report paints a picture of an organisation rife with dispute, internal conflicts and significant challenges.<\/p> <p>I ask that the Minister for Health comes to the House because we need to ask serious questions of the organisation.  I will not make any additional statements because from documents I have seen today, the Minister is fully aware of the situation, following the consultant&rsquo;s report and member nurses and midwives of the organisation that have given me a certain amount of information.  The Minister must come to the House and reassure not only the Seanad and D&aacute;il but the public that he has every confidence in the organisation.  I respectfully ask the Leader to organise a meeting very early next week.

It was a major offensive by British and French armies on the German lines, beginning on 1 July 1916.  The action continued until November 1916.  Six Meath men were killed on the opening day of the major offensive.  Edward Chambers of Trim was serving as a second lieutenant with the Lancashire Fusiliers when he was killed at 9.40 a.m. on the morning of 1 July.  His regiment advanced and met German machine gun fire.  Leading the first wave of men, Chambers was hit by a bullet in the forehead and killed instantaneously.  Serving alongside Chambers was the Ulster Division, which also made its advance through the woods.  The Battle of the Somme was one of the largest battles of the First World War, which resulted in more than 1.5 million casualties.  In all, nearly 60,000 men died on the first day on the British side.<\/p><p>I wish to remember my great uncle also.  He was born in Ballinrobe, County Mayo and emigrated to the USA in 1908.

It is essential that if the parties are serious about reform, they would at least agree to provide time to discuss one of the first motions laid before the current Seanad.  The crux of the motion is to establish a time-limited committee on Seanad political reform.  The motion acknowledges the work and progress made by the Seanad reform working group and the resulting report would provide the framework of the work of the committee we suggest but the committee would not be limited by the constraints which applied to the working group in that it would examine the constitutional change that may be required to implement any recommendations.  We accept that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges can and will play a very important part in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Seanad but we fail to accept that setting up a six-week committee to give voice to many new Senators to come back to the House with recommendations cannot be done.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The intent of the motion is to instill a sense of urgency into the Seanad reform process through the establishment of a sub-committee with a similar remit to the one that was constituted to implement D&aacute;il reform.  Surely it would be possible to look at the terms of reference of the sub-committee on D&aacute;il reform and use what is applicable for the Seanad sub-committee.  The all-party sub-committee on D&aacute;il reform met regularly under the stewardship of the Ceann Comhairle and, in a three-month period, was able to produce a report that formed the basis of significant procedural reform that has since been adopted into Standing Orders.  There is no reason a Seanad sub-committee could not achieve similar aims.  It could meet during the summer recess and work in close conjunction with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, to ensure the existing Seanad reform proposals are progressed as quickly as possible.  If we have to wait until the CPP establishes a sub-committee, it will likely delay the process well into the autumn recess.  We acknowledge and concur with the Bill tabled by the Independent Senators, led by Senator Michael McDowell.  The Sinn F&eacute;in motion in no way impedes the processing of this Bill.  In fact, it brings additionality that can only serve to enhance the real, long-lasting and inclusive reform led by this House.

Because of various initiatives, including the 9% VAT rate and targeted marketing by our State agencies Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland of The Gathering, the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and so on, more tourists than ever are coming to Ireland.  That trend has continued, according to the figures for the first quarter, which showed an increase of 17%.  It has been the best ever quarter for tourism.  There are 220,000 people employed in the sector, with 35,000 to 40,000 new jobs coming on stream in the past few years.  Tourism amounts to 4% of GDP.  However, two issues are emerging.  We have almost reached a tipping point, with accommodation and hotel prices, particularly in urban areas, going through the roof, especially when events are taking place in the cities concerned.  Our competitiveness, which was our strength in the past five years, could become our greatest weakness.  There is also the Brexit issue and the fall in sterling.  There was a 17% increase in the number of UK tourists in the first quarter figures.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come to the House to explain how the agencies will deal with this issue in the short term, because we do not want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.

Given those figures, it is difficult to understand the reason for increased insurance premiums.  The Government needs to take urgent action and establish a task force similar to that set up in the early 1990s.  The the motor insurance advisory board was set up with a view to exploring and tackling the ever-increasing premiums at that time.

The increasing traffic in Dublin and other urban areas is a real sign of our economic recovery - a recovery that we want spread to every household.  As I mentioned the other day when discussing Brexit on the Order of Business, the issue is a great challenge, but there are opportunities.  It makes connectivity from Dublin airport into town all the more important.  One study showed an increase of 40,000 per annum in the number of cars coming into the city in the coming years.  There is a wonderful opportunity to avoid all that if metro proceeds expeditiously.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, was mentioned.  As the previous Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport he gave a commitment that work on metro would commence by 2021.  I can understand the Senator's sense of urgency around both of these big projects - they are massive - but they have to be done properly.  There are procurement orders, planning issues and many other logistical and legal issues to be resolved.  Much of the work has been done but a new order had to be achieved to take the new route and to reduce the cost.  I believe this is a critical piece of infrastructure, particularly given Dublin Airport's plans to provide accommodation for businesses that want to locate here.  It had one building and refurbished one floor, but ESB International came along and took the entire building.  There is huge demand and appetite for developments in this area.  Fingal County Council has the largest green area in the city, with plenty of land rezoned to afford opportunity for further development.

Their pay was to be reviewed under the Haddington Road agreement but this has been consistently stymied by the Department of Finance.  There is no working mechanism for industrial relations within the Garda.  Its members' pay has been reduced time and again and has never been restored.  New recruits are denied rent allowances, there are fewer garda&iacute; with more tasks required and they are subjected to increasingly violent assaults.  I strongly support the garda&iacute;.

The majority of people with dementia live at home and want to remain there but they need support to do so.  For too long, home care has been simply a solution to the hospital crisis and not an integral, long-term part of dementia care.  Appropriate home care can keep people well in the community and out of hospital and long-term residential care.  It is also vital in supporting family carers who provide the vast majority of home based care for people with dementia.  Every week public representatives talk to families and carers.

On behalf of Senator Kelleher, I ask the Minister and Leader of the House to address this issue and, hopefully, we will get some agreement on it.<\/p> <p>I also support Senator Boyhan in drawing attention to the report of the NMBI.

I know he has served on Cork County Council, but I have served on Cork City Council.  I believe there is a need for a comprehensive review of the areas covered by local authorities.  There has been a debate on whether there should be just one local authority or whether we should leave it as it is but with a larger area for the city.  A review was conducted by the five people appointed, but the process did not bring people together.  This is an extremely important matter for the region.  More than 550,000 people live in Cork county and city.  It is a huge area that needs proper planning and, thus, we need a proper local authority structure.<\/p> <p>We need to deal with some major issues.  For instance, new port facilities have been developed at Ringaskiddy, but we need road infrastructure to be put in place.  On the northern side of Cork city, we need a new northern ring road on the outskirts so that more urban development can take place.  <\/p> <p>In terms of the overall national context, the growth of Dublin city is a problem.  We need to identify three or four key hubs for major growth that will be located outside of Dublin.  I am talking about the south, the west, the north west and the south east.  We also need to make sure we have a long-term comprehensive strategy and that it is not done on a piecemeal basis.  In the southern area, in Cork, we must ensure we have a local authority structure that can deal with future planning in a comprehensive and long-term manner.  I ask the Leader to invite the relevant Minister to come to the House to outline how he will reform local authorities in Cork city and county.  It is important that we do not make the same mistakes that were made 12 and 18 months ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#M00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I second the motion tabled by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  I also commend and welcome the comments made by Senator Murnane O'Connor.<\/p> <p>Last week we had a robust debate.  I think all of us across the Chamber understood that charges were going to be frozen and that people would not have increases imposed on them.  It would be very good and commendable if all of us could agree on this point now: this is not the case.  I know from my contacts with the Greyhound company that people are in uproar about bin charges.  We also know there have been 1,300 calls from the west.  Let us get agreement on this issue.  We must invite the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter and, hopefully, we can do something right and helpful for all the people in the country.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise an international issue.  Yesterday, several of us stood and called on the Irish Government to demand the release of Ibrahim Halawa, who is imprisoned in Egypt.  Today, I call on the Government to demand the release of Bilal Kayed, a 34-year old Palestinian activist who was imprisoned by the Israeli military occupation authority.  He was imprisoned for being a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, an organisation banned by Israel.  He was sentenced to 14 years in prison for simply attending a protest and expressing his right to free speech.  Earlier this month, on 13 June, he was set for release.  However, the Israeli military occupation authority has now sentenced him to a further six months' imprisonment without trial.  In protest against this disgraceful violation of international law, Bilal Kayed has entered a hunger strike.  More than 65 fellow Palestinian prisoners have followed his example and declared an open-ended hunger strike in solidarity.  Right now more than 715 Palestinians are imprisoned under what the Israeli authority calls administrative detention.  This number includes several members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, who are democratic representatives of the Palestinian people.  This corrupt policy is used by the Israeli authorities to charge and detain Palestinians without trial and is a violation of the fourth Geneva Convention and international laws that guarantee fair trial standards.<\/p> <p>Israel's overarching policy in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is to crush and fragment Palestinian society and drive Palestinians out of their homeland.  The Israeli authorities are engaging in mass detentions, violating the human rights of Palestinian citizens and constructing new settlements.  More than 600,000 Israeli settlers now occupy the West Bank.  We want the Irish Government and the international community to stand up and publicly condemn Israel's use of so-called administrative detention, to demand that the Israeli authorities comply with international laws on human rights, and to respect the fundamental rights and dignity of the Palestinian people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#M00300","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#M00400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I ask the Leader to invite the relevant Minister here for a debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#M00500","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I welcome to the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery Mr. Shaoquett Moselmane from the Legislative Council of New South Wales in Australia, where he is the Opposition Whip.

Yesterday I attended an enlightening briefing, but what was aired to the telecoms providers was mostly frustrations.  I was struck by the fact that despite the investment by the industry of &euro;2.5 billion in network infrastructure over the past five years, several rural areas still lack broadband coverage or have none whatsoever.  This problem affects not only rural areas but certain urban areas.  Many broadband black spots that existed ten years ago are still in existence today.  How are small businesses supposed to survive in a competitive environment without basic broadband?<\/p> <p>Broadband providers seem to attribute part of the blame to the fact that Ireland has one of the lowest population densities in Europe.  Sweden has 100% coverage even though it has a much lower population density than Ireland.  Broadband providers must change their mindset.  If not, I propose that legislation be introduced to prevent broadband providers from cherry-picking the areas where they provide coverage.  Let us not beat about the bush and declare that it is commercial reality that dictates which areas get broadband coverage.  Providers do not care, for the most part, what part of the country gets coverage as long as they fulfil their licence requirements.  That is completely unacceptable and the situation has gone beyond a joke.  We need to arrange a debate with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to discuss the matter and to allow him to outline the strategy to provide full broadband coverage around the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#M00900","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#M01000","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I want to speak about Console, which was raised several times yesterday.

First, it would put the Cathaoirleach in a position where he would have to name the people to be appointed, which he cannot do.  Second, it refers to 20 other Members of the Seanad, which is one third of the membership and twice the size of the committees currently being formed within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Third, the Senator is asking for a timeframe which is within two weeks of the Seanad being constituted and which has already expired.  To be fair to Senator Conway-Walsh, I am sure she will understand my bona fides on this issue.  I am not against Seanad reform.  Yesterday, at the meeting of Leaders and Whips, a discussion took place with former Senators Maurice Manning and Joe O'Toole on the Manning report and how reform might be implemented.  One may not agree with the content of their report but it provides a roadmap for the future.  There will be a Second Stage debate in the House on Senator McDowell's Bill on 13 July.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges will be established, I hope, next week.  We can use that committee to drive reform, if needs be, on how the House operates and how we do our business.  I have tried, in an open and constructive way, to engage with Senators on all sides.  I do not have anything to hide with regard to how I do my business and how this House does its business.  I try to facilitate all sides.  Sometimes one cannot get agreement on the sitting arrangement between Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in, at other times one can do so.  The overarching zeal for reform is a matter in respect of which I hope we can work together.  I ask the Senator not to put her motion to a vote and divide the House because I do not want her to be seen to obstruct reform or to oppose Government reform at a time when we all want reform.  I hope the Senator understands the spirit of my remarks.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the second amendment to the Order of Business, I ask Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh rather than divide the House to withdraw the amendment.

This Government, like that which preceded it, is committed to unfolding the FEMPI legislation.  Thankfully, 280,000 public servants have signed up to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  A process is under way.

This is about building new bridges and a new world.  I concur with Senator Burke on his remarks and hope we can do that. <\/p><p>Senator Martin Conway raised the issue of dementia and the Alzheimer's strategy and also spoke about libraries.  We should have a debate on these issues.  The implementation of the dementia strategy should be put on the agenda for future discussion and the issue of books and reading is one we also need to pursue. <\/p><p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue about the pay-by-weight system.  Senator Tim Lombard and Senator Colm Burke raised the important issue of the proposed merger of Cork city and county councils.  This is about the biggest county and the second city having a proper local government structure.  There are differing viewpoints.  To be fair to the Minister, he was probably asked a question by a journalist, but it is important that we have clarity and I am happy to ask the Minister to come to the House with regard to the issue.<\/p><p>Senator Victor Boyhan and another Senator - I cannot read my notes - raised the issue about the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI.  There is an ongoing issue here that needs to be addressed.  As the Chairman of the last health committee, I can tell the House that we had representatives from the board in before the committee.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed and I agree fully with the Senators who raised it.  This concerns not just registration but also process and ensuring the system is working to maximum effect.  We should have a debate on it and I am happy to arrange it.<\/p><p>Senator John O'Mahony raised the issue of tourism and the need for a debate on it.  I hope the Minister will come before the House to discuss it.<\/p><p>Senator Robbie Gallagher raised the issue of motor insurance.  As we have discussed on previous occasions during the Order of Business, it is important that the Minister for Finance, who is engaged in a series of talks on it, would bring about a resolution to the issue of the high cost of travel and motor insurance. <\/p><p>Senator Devine also raised the important issue of the dementia strategy and spoke on behalf of Senator Kelleher who has done Trojan work in her role as chief executive of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  Senator Devine also spoke about the NMBI.  We need to have a debate on both of those matters.<\/p><p>Senator Paul Gavan raised the issue of Ibrahim Halawa.  A request was made yesterday and, as I said earlier, in terms of the new politics, if I can do it I will do it.  The Minister will be before the House today at 3.15 p.m.<\/p><p>Senator Catherine Noone has rightly raised the ongoing issue of the mobile phone network infrastructure and coverage.  As a nation, we need to urgently address the issue, especially in the context of the vote last week.  We will now be the only English speaking country in the European Union, so we need to have a mobile and broadband infrastructure that is in pristine condition.  Sadly, in places where one would expect it to be in that condition - I am not speaking about the side of a mountain or parts of rural Ireland - there is a huge deficit.  The national broadband strategy and the way mobile phone carriers do their business and provide service to customers need to be urgently reviewed and acted upon.  <\/p><p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell raised the issue of Console.  We had lengthy contributions on the Order of Business yesterday on this matter.  There are two parts to the story.  Console is providing a service on behalf of the HSE and other State agencies to people in genuine and urgent need of care.  A gentleman from Cork spoke this morning on \"Morning Ireland\" about how counsellors such as he were treated in terms of late payments.  That they are still offering their services speaks volumes about the quality of the people working in Console.  However, Senator O'Donnell's fundamental point concerns governance.  Rather than prejudice any further case, and in the interests of the charity sector and the staff, clients and those who fundraise on behalf of Console, he is right that the CEO should stand aside and resign his position to safeguard and protect the organisation.<\/p><p>To conclude, I am happy the Minister will come to the House-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#N02500","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Will the Leader come back and brief the House as to when he will come?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#O00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I hope it will be at 4.30 p.m. after we do our business.

I am sorry to disappoint them but in the context of delivering sustainable full employment, the results of the referendum are extremely important.  They present challenges, but also a few opportunities.<\/p><p>In the run up to the referendum, a small minority of commentators, such as David McWilliams, claimed that a Brexit would be a good development that Ireland could capitalise on for economic gain, despite the warnings of chaos and turmoil that are now starting to occur.  They have got their wish.  Writing in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>this week, former Minister and MEP Gay Mitchell put it well when he stated:<\/p><blockquote>Britain will look after its own interests.  It is our duty to ensure we put our best foot forward and that we maximise the benefits for Ireland, while minimising the fallout.<\/blockquote> <p>Ireland's place in Europe and the wider world is vital to delivering sustainable full employment, and that place has drastically changed in just a week.<\/p><p>As Senator James Reilly mentioned in the House on Tuesday, since 1999 Ireland has been the only English speaking country in the eurozone, and by 2018 it is likely that we will be the only English speaking country left in the EU, pending events in Scotland.  It is important to emphasise that Ireland will continue to be an EU member, with full access to the Single Market and retaining all of our advantages for inward investment.  We are committed to working within the EU to achieve the jobs and growth that are vital to deepening and broadening our economic recovery.  I am heartened to hear that the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, has already held a meeting with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to discuss contingency plans and that she, together with the enterprise agencies and the Ministers of State under her remit, will also be working to ensure that businesses, investors and potential investors in Ireland are fully informed of Ireland's continued commitment to the EU.<\/p><p>Already we have heard that both Morgan Stanley and HSBC are looking to move up to 3,000 employees from their offices in London to alternative European cities.  According to a report in May, Brexit could push about &pound;6 billion of investment into Ireland's financial services sector.  One bank that has already moved some operations to Ireland is Switzerland's Credit Suisse, which said in December that it would make Dublin its primary hub for servicing hedge funds in Europe and move staff from London to here.<\/p><p>Ireland has an excellent global reputation in the financial services and financial technology sectors and I ask the Minister and the agencies under her remit to set up a special unit solely charged with trying to lure businesses looking to move from London to Ireland.  Dublin in particular offers exiled bankers the English language and a similar legal system, and it is already home to back-office and servicing divisions for many international banks.  The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has already visited London as part of the advance contingency planning and I welcome his and the Government's vision to ensure Ireland is recognised as a global location of choice for specialised international financial services, building on our strengths in talent, technology, innovation and excellent client service while focusing on capturing new opportunities in a changing market and embracing the highest forms of governance.<\/p><p>Central to attracting more companies to Ireland and encouraging existing companies to expand their operations here is our corporate tax rate.  When the UK eventually leaves the EU, we will be losing a great ally in the fight against efforts by the European Commission and other member states like France to bully Ireland into increasing this rate or to join in a harmonised European corporate tax rate.  No one should forget that Ireland has a veto in this area and that there will be no move to alter that rate under this Fine Gael-led Government.<\/p><p>A report from Bloomberg earlier this week compared Dublin with Paris, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Amsterdam and even Edinburgh as possible destinations for financial institutions now looking to relocate from London in a post-Brexit world.  A glowing recommendation brought just two negative concerns to light: a relative lack of office space and high personal tax rates.  Our top line personal tax rate of 52% is much higher than the 45% rate in London or Paris or the 42% rate in Frankfurt.  When it comes to office space, Dublin is on the back foot but there is scope to improve that with interesting and ambitious plans for a strategic development zone at the former Irish Glass Bottle Company site, while work continues apace in Cherrywood.<\/p><p>If office space is a concern, housing is a far bigger one.  While the average monthly rent in Dublin compares very favourably to London or Paris, every one of us knows that there is a shortage of suitable housing in Dublin, especially to rent but also to buy.  I welcome commitments by the Government to provide local authorities in Dublin with additional resources to deliver housing units, which will in turn alleviate the pressure on the private rental market, but more must be done to remove the barriers that are preventing private developers to proceed with plans on already zoned sites.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister again for taking the time to engage with the Seanad on this vital issue.  Bearing in mind the events of the past week in the UK, I encourage everyone not to leave it solely to the Minister, IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland.  We should all shout out loud and clear that Ireland is open for business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#Y00400","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I omitted at the outset to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Breen.

There is a scandal in terms of low pay in this country on which a light needs to be shone, and I am conscious that the debate is on sustainable employment because much of what passes for employment today is simply not sustainable.<\/p> <p>I want to focus in particular on the hospitality industry, which we have heard a good deal about, particularly from this side of the House.  It is an industry that for some time has enjoyed a generous tax break in terms of a reduced VAT rate of 9%, costing taxpayers &euro;650 million a year.  We know that the hotels industry is booming, with record levels of room occupancy, but that stands in stark contrast to the terms of conditions of workers in that sector.  We know that of the 137,000 workers employed in accommodation and food services, more than 50% earn less than &euro;400.  Some 17% of all employees in the sector only earned the national minimum hourly wage, while 41% of workers are part-time and 59% are full-time.  The weekly average wage is &euro;697, while in the hospitality sector the average wage is &euro;324.86, which is less than half that amount.<\/p> <p>Recent research from TASC described the sector as characterised by what are effectively zero hour contracts.  I have examples of these contracts which I will read into the record of the House.  The first is from one of the most prominent hotels in Limerick.  It states: \"Given the nature of the hotel business, the hotel cannot be specific on the number of hours each member of staff will be required to work each week.\"<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Another states:<\/p><blockquote>Your hours will be assigned on a roster basis and will normally include working weekends.  It is your responsibility to check the roster to ascertain when you will be required to work.  <\/blockquote><p>A contract from McDonalds in Limerick states:<\/p><blockquote>Your hours of work cannot be permanently guaranteed, because the number of staff we can employ depends on how busy the restaurant is.  However, you have indicated that your availability for work is as follows.<\/blockquote><p>They get the employee to fill in boxes as to when they are available.  It is taking a contract of employment and turning it on its head.  It is outrageous.  None of these contracts, which are the new norm for the hospitality sector, gives any guarantees on hours of work, no matter how long one is working there which leaves tens of thousands of workers each week in a state of complete financial insecurity not knowing from one week to another what hours they will get.  Would the Minister of State be happy working with a clause such as that in his contract?  Would he like his son or daughter to work under those conditions with no guarantee of hours or income from one week to the next?  Does the Minister of State think it is acceptable or that these people are lucky to have a job?  Will he recognise that this is a modern day throwback to the hiring fairs of old where the employer got to pick and choose each week who would work and for how long?<br\/><br\/>Is the Minister of State happy that the Irish Hotels Federation refuses to engage with industrial relations statutory bodies, such as the Workplace Relations Commission and Labour Court, on establishing a new joint labour committee for the sector?  What message is the Department sending to the Irish Hotels Federation by continuing the &euro;650 million subsidy in the face of this disgraceful stance by employers in this sector?  The message from the Department is &quot;You're grand lads, work away.&quot;  What is doubly frustrating is that there has been a report sitting in the Department for eight months telling it that these problems exist and giving clear guidelines on the legislative changes that are needed.  I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Nash, for the very good work he did on this issue.  When will the Department implement the recommendations of the University of Limerick report on the prevalence of zero-hour contracts?<br\/><br\/>Another key point all members in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are concerned about is when the Department will introduce a statutory instrument to provide for a fair transposition of the EU public procurement directives in line with the provisions of Article 18.2.  Will the Department ensure there are proper social clause provisions in place requiring companies that tender to recognise trade unions and pay a living wage?<br\/><br\/>I raise the issue of TTIP and last month's European Commission study on the agreement, which only confirms my party's worst fears.  TTIP will cause significant competition between Ireland and the US, a country which compared to the EU has much lower labour standards and trade union rights.  It is, therefore, expected that the Irish economy will see a severe decline in food standards, workers' rights and the agricultural sector.  Considering there is such a potential for TTIP to reduce workers' rights in Ireland, Sinn F&eacute;in will oppose TTIP under its current mandate.  Very few people really understand the dangers of TTIP.  I appeal to everyone in the Chamber to address this issue, particularly those of us on the left.  It is time for us all to speak out because if we do not, this will be imposed on us.  It is an example of the very worst aspects of the EU which probably explains why people are now feeling so alienated by the European project.  It is totally in contrast to the ideals of the 1980s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#Y00600","speaker":"1389","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1467279000,"counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#Z00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I propose to amend the Order of Business to change times to allow statements on the Ibrahim Halawa case to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2, the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2016, and to conclude within one hour, and for statements on waste disposal charges to be taken on the conclusion of No. 3.

It is no doubt a very challenging one but also a very exciting one to be involved in.  Once we have jobs, we can provide services.  I welcome and commend the future targets and ambitions set out in the programme for a partnership Government.  A commitment is made to reduce the unemployment rate to 6% and to increase the number at work by 200,000 by 2020, 135,000 of those people will be outside Dublin.  It is particularly important to specify that jobs will be created outside of Dublin.  There has been a lot of frustration in many parts of the country because growth was predominantly in the large urban centres.  There are figures showing that the areas outside the big urban centres are coming along.  When recovery happens, it is expected to take place in the big urban centres first.  The job now is to shunt that out and make sure every area receives appropriate investment, growth and support and that we work on the opportunities and unique selling points of all the different regions around the country.<\/p> <p>In the west and County Mayo where I am from, we were hit particularly hard by the collapse of the construction industry.  That has not gone away, even though we have had economic recovery, some of which we can see on the ground.  I am mindful of the figures which show that at the time of the collapse, one in four men was working in construction in the west compared to one in five in the rest of the country.  Many people working in construction may also have had small subsistence farms and needed off-farm income to support families.  Much of the west is still reeling from the construction industry collapse and needs help and support.  If we do not push out development, investment and jobs everywhere, we will exacerbate the problems with housing, shortage of schools and public services in the big urban centres.  It will only get worse.  One thing we can say in many of these rural areas in the west is that we can offer a great standard of living and quality of life but people cannot live on fresh air.  That is why we have emigration.  The challenge in reducing the unemployment rate to 6% by 2020 will be to make sure it is equally reflected in the regions.<\/p> <p>I welcome the action plan for jobs for the west region and all the regional action plans.  Based on the good work of the national action plan for jobs, it gives us hope that there is a formula to produce those results in job creation and investment.  If I was to suggest one important measure for growing small businesses, it would be continued support for the local enterprise offices.  If one wants to see results on the ground, the local enterprise offices are closest to the people interested in job creation and who want to grow their businesses on a smaller scale.  They can deliver on the Government objective if they are properly funded and supported.  They work in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.  We have an excellent local enterprise office in Mayo and similar offices around the country are doing good work.  One issue I am aware of, which I ask the Minister of State to look at in the context of the forthcoming budget, is the funding of local enterprise offices.  If we do not support them, we are not looking after start-up, small businesses with between one and ten employees.  That is when Enterprise Ireland kicks in.  They need to be supported because they will, hopefully, lead to further jobs and growth.  When someone comes forward with a business proposition, they have business plans and a sustainable proposition and are well vetted.  In my area, strides are being made in the food industry and in light engineering and manufacturing.  There is definitely scope for more growth if the correct support is given.<\/p> <p>Mayo local enterprise office's subvention budget from Enterprise Ireland under measure one is &euro;215,000 for the year.  I was quite shocked to hear that.  It is money to support jobs and capital investment in micro-industry but it has already been spent and people are already looking for more money.  Surely that cannot be the case but it seems it is.  The local enterprise office has &euro;200,000 for training.  It would seem that the way in which funding is given out does not reflect levels of demand or local economic activity.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michelle Mulherin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Where there is a demand there does not seem to be a provision that they are automatically going to get more money or make a business case for more.  I understand that there is a historical process whereby funding is apportioned and it is only slightly weighted for bigger counties.  I believe this situation seriously needs to be addressed, especially with regard to the shortfall in their funding.  Their money is spent and we have not even hit the half-year market, although we are very close to it.<\/p><p>I would like to see more support for jobs.  On the ground I can already see the jobs that have been supported, and more that can come, but they cannot do it without that funding.  It does not mean anything to the ordinary small business that money is being given to Enterprise Ireland and to IDA Ireland.  This is a very real way to see benefits on the ground and to fulfil our ambition - and the Minister's ambition - to achieve more economic activity and growth in the region.  I ask the Minister of State to take this up and I would appreciate if he could get in contact with me about that particular concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#Z00600","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I invite Senator Grace O'Sullivan to speak for the Civil Engagement group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#AA00200","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>A week is a long time in politics, and events over the last few days have certainly proven that old saying.  Only one week ago I was considering the new optimism in the air.  There was much talk in the media - and indeed in this neck of the woods - of the so-called turnabout in the economy, the abundance of jobs already created, jobs soon to be created and even so-called sustainable jobs.  Folk in certain political quarters were giving themselves lots of pats on the back and there was something of an air of celebration creeping about.  I do not wish to be the bearer of bad tidings but, fellow Senators, it is high time we took a reality check.  With the most obvious impacts of Brexit and the resulting shockwaves across the international money markets, it has become a little more obvious that we cannot be complacent about our own apparent economic recovery.<\/p><p>Only two weeks ago the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, visited this Chamber.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister when I say that her visit was a little bit like the annual school visits from the local mayor that I experienced as a child.  In her address to the House the Minister spoke of the Government's goal of achieving sustainable full employment.  She said: <\/p><blockquote>This Government's goal is to achieve sustainable full employment.  We want all people to have the opportunity to enjoy rewarding work.  We want to ensure that all people can participate and contribute their full potential to the economy and society.<\/blockquote> <p>This is all very laudable.  The Minister went on:<\/p><blockquote>The Low Pay Commission will make its next recommendations on the national minimum wage for 2017 in July.  Its recommendations must be evidence based.  We want a minimum wage that is both fair and sustainable.  We want to assist as many low-paid workers as is reasonably practicable without creating significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.<\/blockquote> <p>I repeat the Minister's words: &quot;We want to assist as many low-paid workers as is reasonably practicable without creating significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.&quot;  In other words, the Government might do something for those who need it most but only if it does not cost anything for those who have the most.  Does it take a commission to tell us that people living under the current circumstances of the economy cannot survive on the minimum wage?  The cost of living is going up and extra charges are creeping in left, right and centre, with the latest fiasco being the bin charges controversy - yet another mismanaged shambles.  I wonder about the use of the word &quot;sustainable&quot;.  It must be asked whether the word, and the concept of it, is open to interpretation?  It clearly is - and a very loose interpretation.  If the concept of sustainable work was applied according to my understanding, we would be living in a society where employment is moving in a very different direction.  As far as I am concerned, a sustainable job is one that would actually sustain a person and a family.  A sustainable job is one in which social, environmental and economic needs are addressed and met.  A sustainable workforce is one in which people are employed in jobs that not only pay a wage but have their psychological and economic well-being included in the package.  A sustainable job is one in which the needs of the employee and his or her family come first.  These are pretty basic tenets of sustainability.  However, I do not hear much reference to these concepts being bandied about along with the new favourite catchphrase, &quot;sustainable jobs&quot;.  The sad reality for so many people in this country is that the idea of a sustainable job, or indeed any job, is beyond them.<\/p><p>Consider my home town of Waterford.  A recent damning report prepared by two lecturers at Waterford Institute of technology, Dr. Ray Griffin and Dr. Cormac O'Keeffe, shows that Waterford and the south east are at an economic crisis point.  Unemployment in the region continues to rise after 25 years of government neglect.  Unemployment in the south east is one and a half times higher than the national average, with a stark figure of 1,200 fewer people in employment than six months ago.  This is in the wake of the high-profile Action Plan for Jobs, which was launched by the Government last year.<\/p><p>We live in a country in which, increasingly, politics is at a disconnect from the citizens of the land.  It is a land where the aspirations, whitewashing and rose-tinted pictures painted by our silver-tongued elected representatives bear no resemblance to the reality faced by so many in this country as they try to cope with the challenge of battling through the slog that is daily survival - the day-to-day and hour-to-hour struggle that is just getting by.  We need to bring politics and some sense of real hope back into people's lives.  It is our job to represent the citizens of this country.  That is our job, folks, so let us get on with it, roll up our sleeves and get it done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#AA00300","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#AA00400","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>The 30 seconds was meant to be one minute, so I will only need 30 seconds of the remaining time available to our group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#AA00500","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I did not receive any indication of time sharing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#AA00600","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Would it be possible?

I wish him the very best of success for the future.<\/p> <p>Full employment is the goal that the country must aspire to.  Full employment can be defined as a situation in which all those willing and able to work are in employment.  In 2006, at the height of the Celtic tiger, Ireland had full employment, with the unemployment rate standing at just 4.3%, according to CSO figures.  However, at the same time, the construction industry - to which I know Senator Mulherin has already referred - accounted for approximately 20% of GDP, along with being a significant source of employment.  We are now aware that the construction industry in Ireland was overextended.  Following the economic crisis of 2008-2009 and the sharp rise in unemployment, particularly amongst construction workers, we know that this level of unemployment was unsustainable.  Yes, progress has been made, but the May 2016 figure of 169,700 is far too high.  Overall competitiveness must be maintained in the global economy if we are to avoid the mistakes of the past.<\/p> <p>Within the overall statistics are a number of problems which, I am glad to say, the Government's Action Plan for Jobs has recognised and prioritised, backed by the OECD.  It plans to create 200,000 jobs by 2020.  This will reduce the overall unemployment rate to 6%.  The proposal to create 135,000 of these jobs outside Dublin is of paramount importance if the regions are to develop and prosper.  Also, the encouragement of 70,000 of our diaspora to return home is to be commended.  Male unemployment, especially amongst the over 50s, is a serious problem.  As a result of the recession, a large number of people who had worked for many years found themselves without a job and with limited prospects of finding another.  They want to work and we must invest in skills and training required to encourage them to come back into the workforce.<\/p> <p>High rates of taxation have a detrimental effect on job creation.  The success of the Irish economy and the large-scale expansion of employment in the 1990s were due to a reorientation of government policy that lowered general taxation in order to promote jobs and investment.  I welcome the commitment in the programme for a partnership Government to a continued reduction in the USC in consultation with the Oireachtas.  Reducing excessive tax rates for middle earners is important in order to promote full and sustainable employment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maria Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=30\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> As of May 2016, the unemployment rate for males aged 20 to 74 stood at 9.2% and it was 6.2% for women.  I am also concerned about the high level of youth unemployment rate of 15% in May 2016, which continues to be above the national average.  The aim must be to create an environment where worthwhile employment is available to the many young people leaving the education system.  Otherwise the very considerable investment in their education will either benefit another country or languish and dwindle away as the unemployed can so easily become unemployable.  It is incumbent on the Government and the relevant Government Departments to put considerable resources into tackling the scourge that is youth unemployment.  This also applies to the long-term unemployed, which is a European-wide problem.  It leads to social exclusion and the creation of poverty traps.  In the words of Professor Hugh Frazer from Maynooth University, \"It adds up to an erosion of human and social capital over time.\"  The creation of jobs throughout all regions is vital in addressing this problem, as well as tackling the pockets which exist in many urban areas.  I look forward to the day when all our citizens who wish to remain at home will be able to find well-paid, sustainable employment and many who have been forced to emigrate can return and bring with them valuable experience and skills they have acquired.  I know that the Minister of State is totally committed to tackling and solving this major problem area which has caused so much suffering and hardship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#AA01000","speaker":"1384","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, on his appointment.  I know that he will do an exceptional job and will be extremely committed to advancing the agenda of full employment for Ireland and its citizens, not just full employment but fair employment as well, as articulated by my colleague, Senator Gavan, and others.<\/p><p>If we pursue the correct policies we will and can have full employment in this country by 2018.  That is my ambition and it is the ambition of the Labour Party.  I take great personal pride and satisfaction in the role that I played, as super junior Minister in the last phase of the last Government, in setting out a policy agenda to move unemployment below 8% for the first time since the economic crash.  When the last Government took office the number of unemployed was heading towards 500,000 and there was a stench of fear and hopelessness across the country.  Those who had lost jobs were not aware and did not know when they might secure a job again and those who had jobs were fearful that their jobs might be lost within a day or a week.  We are now on track to have about 2 million people at work very shortly and that is a record for this State.  Things are now very different compared with the horrendous mess that the previous Administration inherited in 2011.  <\/p><p>I make no apologies for being entirely obsessive about the dignity of work and the idea that working people should have their dignity in the workplace guaranteed, protected and secured.  Job growth in every economic sector is growing at a decent pace.  We will continue to see an uplift in areas where the pace of recover has not been as strong as might have been the case in other sectors.  Construction is a good example.  While the construction rates of recovery are decent there is more to be done.  With the &euro;4 billion housing package, initiated by the last Government and the uplift in private housing construction, which is so necessary for society, we can get more construction workers back to work.  It is a sector of society that was badly damaged by the nature and extent of the economic crash.  <\/p><p>The lessons that we have learned from the economic crash need to always be at the forefront of our considerations of economic policy and our approach to job creation.  That is why I think it is crucial that the philosophy and the approach that we adopted, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>An Action Plan for Jobs, is retained and remains at the core of the Minister of State's work, his Minister's work and that of the entire Government.  The action plan has a cross-departmental agenda and the system and approach have been proven to work.  We should never again see our employment profile excessively dependent on one or two sectors at the expense of other sectors.  We should not take the view that it will be &quot;all right on the night&quot; for society provided the coffers are full and Exchequer revenues continue to grow.  We should be concerned about the mix in our economy and ensure that proper policies in terms of structure in the economy should be pursued.  <\/p><p>Neither should our trajectory towards full employment be characterised by the notion that a job at any price will do.  That is not right and it is not something we should support.  Our recovery needs to be wage-led.  We have to create an economic and jobs model that ensures protection in the workplace and provides for improvements in pay, hours, terms and conditions.  <\/p><p>By 2018, we should have sustainable full employment in this country and, importantly, it should be employment that will sustain households.  As my colleague, Senator Gavan, articulated earlier, too many people here go to bed on a Sunday night not knowing what amount of hours they will have to work in that given week and whether they will have a job that will enable them to simply make ends meet.  That is an unacceptable scenario in this day and age.  That is why we need to end the abuse of if-and-when contracts.  I look forward to seeing the Minister's proposals emerging shortly.  I can reassure the House that the Labour Party will not be found wanting in terms of filling the existing vacuum because those who have if-and-when contracts can no longer afford to wait for a solution.<\/p><p>Working people caught up in the half light of if-and-when contracts cannot afford to wait for a solution, neither can their families nor society.  We should aim to provide decent work and not a job at any price.  There is no dignity in workers being permanently dependent on the family income supplement to top up their wages.  Work should always pay.  That is why we established the Low Pay Commission last year and increased the national minimum wage.  In July, I hope to see decent increases and further increases in the national minimum wage when the Low Pay Commission issues its second statutory report on the rate of the national minimum wage for 2017.<\/p><p>Ireland must move towards providing a living wage.  Good employers pay decent wages.  Despite the protestations of some ideologues on the opposite end of the political spectrum, there is a clear business case to be made for a firm paying its staff a living wage quite apart from the social considerations.<\/p><p>In order to back businesses, the risk takers who employ the vast bulk of Irish workers need to have a functioning banking system and alternative finance opportunities if we are to reach our goal of full employment.  I am pleased to see that the amended credit guarantee scheme is operating, that there have been improvements in Microfinance Ireland and that the facilities available from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland are working well to support the SME sector.  As the Minister of State will know, the availability of credit is the lifeblood of the economy.  We must always be conscious of the fact that 90% of Irish jobs are in the SME sector.<\/p><p>I agree that sustainable full employment also means rewarding hard work.  That is why I strongly believe that the Government should continue to ensure there is an equalisation of the tax system for the self-employed.  They are the ones who take the risks, develop their ideas and employ people in good decent jobs across the country.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I agree with Senator Mulherin that we need to properly resource local enterprise offices.  I am proud of the role that I played in helping the local enterprise office idea to evolve and bed down over the past couple of years.  LEOs are a one-stop-shop, a first-stop-shop and a signposting service for not just new SMEs but also existing companies that want to grow and expand.  Clearly, the relationship between the local enterprise office and Enterprise Ireland is extremely important.  We must ensure, particularly with the very uncertain international economic situation in which we find ourselves, that Enterprise Ireland is properly resourced so that small companies are properly resourced and advised in ways to access foreign markets and supply Irish goods, products and services.  There is a big job of work for Enterprise Ireland to do and it is only too capable of doing so in terms of helping Irish companies diversify into other markets, given the uncertainties in the UK for obvious reasons at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#BB00200","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I can give one minute of my time to Senator Higgins if she wishes, with the permission of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#CC00100","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#CC00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, on his elevation to Minister of State in this portfolio.  I have no doubt he will do a great job on jobs because he has first-hand knowledge of what is required from his work as a Deputy and as Chair of the committee in the last D&aacute;il dealing with the development of the western region and the Shannon area.  I have no doubt that he is pretty <i>au fait<\/i>with what is required to bring jobs to the regions and Ireland and, as previous speakers have said, to bring full employment to the country by 2019 or whenever.<\/p><p>A number of important points have been raised by a number of Senators today and on the last occasion we had this debate.  It is an important debate, especially given what has happened in the UK.  We should be more proactive than we are and use this as an opportunity to bring more international companies and jobs to the country.  We should use whatever means possible to do that.  <\/p><p>Senator Mulherin raised an important question on local employment offices.  Those offices are looking after the development, nurturing and fostering of jobs in SMEs with up to ten employees.  These SMEs are the lifeblood of, in particular, rural areas.  It takes enormous effort on the part of an employer to create ten jobs and it is much more difficult for a small employer to create ten jobs than it is for a large employer to create 500 jobs.  This is well known to the vast majority of Members.  There are so many obstacles in a small employer's way.  Small employers have to get over so many hurdles and also face the challenge of a huge pay bill every Friday.  There should be a bigger focus on delivering jobs, particularly in rural areas. <\/p><p>Given the current Government situation, which may be in place for the foreseeable future, responsible and autonomous regional development has to come into play.  The Government and Parliament should examine the possibility of regionalising government and deploying more resources to the regions.  The Western Development Commission plays a very important role in our region and similar commissions could be rolled out in other areas such as the Munster and Leinster regions.  Such commissions should be strengthened and given more autonomy.  Every week small businesses have to endure VAT, PAYE, PRSI, insurance costs, rates, water charges, development charges, bank fees and the cost of safety reports as well as the fees of accountants and lawyers.  This is a huge task for the small business person.  <\/p><p>IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are to be congratulated for the job they are doing internationally.  However, I would be much happier if Enterprise Ireland had a higher failure rate.  I do not mean that I wish for companies to fail, but a higher failure rate would mean more companies on the verge are getting into the system.  The rules are too stringent and off-putting to an awful lot of companies that are on the verge and trying to get their businesses across the line.  Will the Minister of State carry out a survey of all the companies that avail of Enterprise Ireland funding as well as those that do not avail of such funding and those that were not successful when applying for funding?<\/p><p>The system is too cumbersome.  People tell us that they would much prefer to go it alone without the hassle of Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland is a great brand and gives recognition all over the world.  It is involved in so many companies and opens up so many opportunities.  However, given the paperwork and hassle involved, the vast majority of people find it off-putting.  Given the situation with the UK, we should relax some of the rules.  Some of the people who are not getting in but are on the verge should be getting in.  The difference between success and failure can be very small and some of the finest businesses have failed, be it for whatever reason.  Perhaps it was for want of funding or support.  Some of the greatest ideas did not get across the line because of being bogged down in paperwork or not getting the support needed at the time.  The Minister of State should carry out a survey of this area and examine the feedback.  He should go to those people and see what are the problems.  I have no doubt he has spoken to many of those people over his time in the western and Shannon regions.  <\/p><p>I will give the last of my time to Senator Higgins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#CC00300","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I am very grateful to Senator Burke and thank the Minister of State for joining us.  I will be brief.  There are three issues I wish to highlight and I would really appreciate the thoughts of the Minister of State and I would love to engage further with him on them.<\/p> <p>There are many tens of thousands of qualified adults in Ireland, predominantly women, who do not feature on the live register or in unemployment figures, although they are underemployed.  In many cases, they are in jobless households.  Will the Minister of State address how he plans to encourage and provide voluntary access to back-to-education, training or job supports and activation schemes to these qualified adults?  In many cases these people are not just distant from the jobs market but, having little rights in it, have become distant from the social protection system too.  I urge the Minister of State to work closely with his counterpart in the Department of Social Protection to address the question of how we recognise, for example, care credits and ensure that the many tens of thousands of women who fall out of the system maintain their access to job, training and employment opportunities. <\/p> <p>Care should be a quality area of employment.  It is potentially one of the largest and highest density employment areas with a high ratio of staff.  It should be an area of quality employment but, unfortunately, it is not.  The sector needs to be developed and deepened.  It is unfortunate that many child care workers and early years education workers employed by the State will now enter a period of three months of unemployment as the early childhood care and education, ECCE, schemes end because they are still nine-month schemes.  In terms of sustainability, surely this should be a year-round area and an area with a strong progressing path.<\/p> <p>The low pay-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#CC00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Thank you, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016063000002#CC00500","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1467279000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I lost my line but I will just say that, in terms of the Low Pay Commission, I welcome and will be scrutinising the commitment and looking to the commission to address the gender pay gap and in-work poverty.  I remind the Minister of State that the IMF, in research over 30 years in 170 countries, has shown that GDP rises when the income of the bottom 20% in society is increased.  This is not a concession to those looking for higher wages in the lowest bracket.

I welcome  her commitment in her address this morning to that and all the regions in the future.  When she left the expo, she visited the one unit in Mullingar Business Park.  This is a prime example of how that region, along with all the other regions, has been neglected.  I hope this will change.
