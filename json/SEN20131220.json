This Bill addresses the issue of inter-country adoptions, specifically the concerns of some people who have been unable to continue with the process of adopting a child from Russia because of an unexpected amendment to Russian adoption legislation that took effect earlier this year.<\/p><p>  The Adoption Act 2010 provides, <i>inter alia<\/i>, for inter-country adoptions between states that have ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  Ireland ratified the Hague Convention on 1 November 2010.  While Russia has been a signatory to the convention since 1992, it has not ratified it.  During the drafting of the 2010 Act, a considered and detailed transitional measure was put in place to deal with the change from previous adoption legislation.  This measure, provided for in section 63 of the Act, allowed those persons who held a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability before the Act's commencement to continue the process of adoption from a non-Hague state for a maximum of three years.  It is worth remembering that the majority of Irish people who have adopted during the past ten years have done so from non-Hague countries.  Approximately 910 children from Russia were adopted between 2004 and 2010, but signing the Hague Convention immediately led to difficulties with adoptions from non-signatories.  Many European countries continue to allow adoptions from non-Hague countries that apply Hague standards.  Uniquely, we have introduced strict legislation requiring a bilateral agreement.  This led to the dramatic decrease in the number of adoptions despite a high level of demand.<\/p><p>  Under the 2010 Act, applicants who held a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability before its commencement were afforded an additional three-year period to complete their adoptions from non-Hague countries.  They were required to have completed the process by 31 October 2013.  By their very nature, transitional provisions are time limited and three years was considered a reasonable amount of time.<\/p><p>  A particular difficulty has arisen with the expiry of the transitional provision provided for in section 63 in so far as a small number of people could not finalise adoptions in Russia before their existing declarations of eligibility and suitability expired.  Without a valid declaration, the adoption of a child cannot proceed.  This situation arose primarily because of a change in Russian adoption legislation, which itself is undergoing a great deal of change.  The Russians are moving towards a position of encouraging internal adoptions.  There is a new sensitivity to the situations experienced by children in their institutions.  Russia is moving towards promoting foster families in a way that it did not previously.  We have held good discussions with the Russians regarding these changes.<\/p><p>  Russia amended its legislation, changing the period that a child needed to be on the national adoption database before becoming eligible for inter-country adoption from six months to one year.  This is in line with the principle of subsidiarity in adoption legislation, that is, every effort must be made to have the child adopted in his or her own country before being placed on an inter-country database.<\/p><p>  Since the amendment to the Russian legislation and the consequences for the number of Irish people involved in adoption processes, approximately 23 families, were brought to my attention, I have pursued extensive diplomatic efforts.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste, who has been engaged intensively on the diplomatic front in Russia, and our ambassador in Moscow, who has had meetings with Russia's Department of education and relevant people.  I have held meetings with staff from the Russian Embassy in Ireland to resolve the issue diplomatically.<\/p><p>  Applicants from other countries have also been affected.  It was hoped that some administrative or legislative solution could be found in Russia to deal with the families caught up in this process.  Many had already met the children in question and were close to finalising their adoptions.  Despite everyone's best efforts, however, it has not been possible to resolve this issue diplomatically or to achieve an administrative solution within Russia.  The matter has become urgent for those people whose declarations of eligibility and suitability expired on 31 October and who wish to finalise adoptions in Russia.  The adoption of a child in Russia cannot proceed without a valid declaration.<\/p><p>  In order to resolve this situation, I propose that an amendment to the 2010 Act be made to extend the period of validity of a declaration of eligibility and suitability to allow those affected by the change in Russian legislation additional time to complete their adoptions.  I am confining the amendment to persons who, on 31 October 2013, held declarations of eligibility and suitability that were specific to the Russian Federation.<\/p><p>  Many Irish families that have adopted from non-Hague countries, for example, Ethiopia, would like it to be possible to continue such adoptions.  Due to our legislation and a lack of bilateral agreements with those countries, however, this is not possible.<\/p><p>  We have had a great deal of contact with the Adoption Authority of Ireland and a considerable amount of background work has been done.  The amendment may look simple, but one must consider the consequences for other groups and our international obligations under Hague.  The Adoption Authority has informed my Department that, on 31 October 2013, 23 prospective adoptive parents held declarations of eligibility and suitability for adoption from the Russian Federation.  I propose that the period of validity of those declarations be extended to 31 October 2014.  The proposed amendment to the Act is limited to declarations in respect of the Russian Federation.  In all circumstances, this is a necessary and appropriate amendment and helps the families involved.  No one has a right to adoption, but this amendment is primarily targeted at serving the best interests of the children in question, those being, the chance to family life and a second chance.<\/p><p>  Throughout the process of preparing the legislation, my Department and I have been mindful of our international obligations under the Hague Convention and our commitment to adhering to its standards.  The Adoption Authority constantly puts adoptions from non-Hague countries through under the transitional arrangements, but it applies the Hague standards, those being, informed consent and subsidiarity.  As pointed out in the D&aacute;il yesterday, we must also be conscious that, when considering adoptions in the broader context, we must be sensitive to some of the risks involved.  A number of situations arose that were unsatisfactory, where the best interests of the children were not considered primarily and where unscrupulous people became involved.  One must be constantly vigilant about standards in adoptions and countries' adherence to same.<\/p><p>  The implementation of the 2010 Act is evidence of the State's dedication to those standards.  While I reiterate our commitment to the Hague Convention, many children who are in institutions around the world need a second opportunity.  Sometimes, their countries do not have central authorities or the types of procedures that allow Ireland to have bilateral agreements with them, yet those children still need families and placements.  From a legal perspective, we must determine how to achieve flexibility so that the standards can be maintained while the children still get second chances.<\/p> <p> Many of the countries that cannot sign the Hague Convention are those in which children are most in need, including Haiti and Ethiopia.  This is an ongoing challenge to the Hague Convention and from a legal perspective.  As stated, some countries have taken a more flexible approach to this than Ireland.  The implementation of the 2010 Act has meant that Ireland is now significantly better equipped than it was prior to 2010 to deal with the many complex issues that arise in intercountry adoption.  As a signatory to the Hague Convention, which is a mechanism for improving standards, we are determined to ensure that child centred adoption is at the core of all the elements of the adoption process.  <\/p><p>I will now address the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 provides that a declaration of eligibility and suitability in respect of the Russian Federation that had been issued to a prospective adoptive parent, and which was valid on 31 October 2013, shall be extended from that date for a period of one year and shall expire on 31 October 2014.  It further provides that any such declaration extended under this proposed legislation shall not be amended to specify any State other than the Russian Federation as the State to which the declaration applies.  Section 2 provides for the Short Title and citation.<\/p><p>I have brought this amending Bill forward as a matter of urgency.  I thank Senators for agreeing to take all Stages of the Bill today.  I commend it to the House and look forward to hearing the views of the Senators on this proposed legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000003#B00400","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387534200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Yesterday morning on the Order of Business I congratulated the Minister on her magnificent efforts in achieving what is proposed in this Bill.  Our purpose as politicians is to bring about change in society.  Many times in the past I have had difficulty with Fianna F&aacute;il listening to the civil servants surrounding them rather than make its own political decisions.  I am not casting any aspirations on the civil servants currently in the Seanad.  I have been elected three times to the Seanad, twice when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government, during which time I was aware of the delays in certain things being done.  <\/p><p>I have known the Minister for many years.  As far as I am concerned, as a politician her name is carved in stone.  The Minister has had the courage and passion to address this issue, often having to overcome many hurdles in doing so.  I do not have adequate words to describe the pain, anguish and yearning of the families waiting to adopt these children.  I am so impressed with what the Minister has done.  She was a brilliant leader of the Opposition in the Seanad.  I am not surprised she was appointed a Minister in this Government.  She was an outstanding leader for the Opposition in the Seanad and has now delivered the goods in terms of the changes in this area.  We need more of that.<\/p><p>I was asked by two members of the families concerned, Lisa Fennessy and Pamela O'Reilly, to express their gratitude and appreciation to the Minister and the many others involved in this issue.  Lisa told me yesterday that when she asked her son, Lee, if he would like to have a little brother called Alex the joy and excitement in his little eyes immediately melted away all the stress and hardship endured by her family over the past six months.  She asked me to thank the Minister for her courage, bravery and compassion in bringing forward this legislation.  She and Pamela also asked that I thank Senator Feargal Quinn, whom I note is in the House, Senator Maurice Cummins, Leader of the House and Senators John Gilroy, C&aacute;it Keane and Paul Bradford for their work on this issue.  <\/p><p>I take this opportunity to acknowledge on the record the help provided in this regard by, among others, Deputies Gerry Adams, Helen McEntee, Paudie Coffey, David Stanton, John Deasy, Robert Troy, Anthony Lawlor, Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Mattie McGrath, Michael Lowry, Ciara Conway, Gerald Nash.  Pamela O'Reilly from Stepaside asked that I thank most sincerely all concerned for their support and understanding throughout the long and difficult journey in this extension being obtained so that she could complete the adoption of her little girl.  <\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is a five star politician.  She has served a long apprenticeship.  Despite the ups and downs along the way she has delivered what she promised.  That is what politics is about.  It is our job to change and improve the quality of life of our people and not to waffle on here about irrelevant issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000004#C00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1387534200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>On behalf of Fine Gael, I share Senator White's remarks about the Minister.  In fairness to the Senator she was the friendly opposition when her party was in government.  I recall that when I was a councillor and she criticised Fianna F&aacute;il I admired her.  It is not an organisation that is easily criticised, in particular when in government and one is a Senator representing that party.  The Senator's remarks about this Bill are appropriate.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This Bill is necessary as a result of what happened in Russia which, again, was something out of our control.  For the first time in the history of this State we have a senior ministry with responsibility for children.  It has a huge programme of work to do.  As a result of the children's referendum children are now at the centre of our Constitution, which brings with it huge responsibilities and a huge programme of work.  When situations arise which are out of our control, such as that which is addressed in this legislation, they add to that programme of work but are extremely important.  This matter had to be addressed to ensure certainty and a future for the 23 Irish families who were in the process of adopting children from Russia.  It is hoped that following enactment of this Bill their situations will be regularised, allowing them to have a happy and peaceful Christmas in the knowledge that 2014 will bring certainty to their situations.<\/p><p>I listened with great interest to Senator White's remarks in respect of two of the families involved.  It is our responsibility to ensure that families in this country are protected.  In spite of what happens internationally, we will always do our best to ensure that our laws reflect what is best practice and the right and appropriate thing to do.  It is appropriate that the Seanad would meet on this Friday morning before Christmas to ensure that this emergency legislation is brought over the line.<\/p> <p>Any piece of legislation must be proofed and the consequences for others as a result of legislation being introduced must also be examined.  I commend the Minister and her officials on ensuring we can have this legislation as quickly as we are getting it and giving certainty to those 23 families.  If the legislation is proofed, it will not have a ripple effect on other scenarios, which is also important.<\/p><p>The agenda of children in this country is something that successive previous Governments on all sides have neglected.  In this Administration we have started to put children to the fore by having a Minister in the Cabinet.  I hope the foundation built with having Deputy Frances Fitzgerald as Minister will by 2016 lead to us setting international standards and best practice in the protection of the welfare of children.  Many people in both Houses are really passionate about the issue and believe that Ireland can come from the dark ages, where we have been over the last number of decades, to a new scenario where every child in the country is cherished the way we all want to see them cherished.  This is an example of what can be done, and I am not confident that any previous Administration would have been able to react appropriately to this issue in the time limit in which the Minister and officials have done.  It is heartening to hear the all-party support for these types of initiatives.  Children are not party political but the issue is still political and, as such, as professional politicians we have a responsibility to ensure that the right politics prevails to protect children in our society and ensure that they are allowed to develop as we would like them to.<\/p><p>I have nothing more to say on this important legislation.  The sooner we get it over the line, the better.  I wish the Minister and her officials a very happy Christmas.  What is happening today and what happened in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann yesterday evening is a good day's work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000004#C00300","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387534800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I add to the welcome and say that the Minister has had an outstanding year, from the children's referendum to the establishment of the child and family agency in two weeks, as well as all that has gone on in between.  The Minister and her colleagues have clearly outlined the scenario that has led us to the need for the legislation.  It is evident that the Minister, her officials and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have sought resolution through other channels and at every level but it has proven impossible.  Changes to Russian family court laws have had serious implications in conjunction with existing Irish legislation for prospective adoptive parents.<\/p><p>  That brings us to the legislation before the House today.  It is tightly drafted, with added limitations, and it will address the calls received from approximately five prospective adoptive parents.  However, it also opens up any unused Russian declarations as of 31 October 2013 which the Minister has clarified is a maximum of 23 prospective adoptive parents.  Anyone who has talked to or met the prospective parents appreciates the heartbreak and emotional roller-coaster of the journey that they have had and so I realise that for them today is a good day.  I will not oppose the Bill and I do not want to frustrate the resolution to this particular issue.  However, I am duty bound to raise my general concerns and some specific questions about how we approach adoption in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Ireland has a very chequered history when it comes to adoption.  In 2010, we incorporated the<i><\/i>Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  It protects children and their families against the risks of illegal, irregular, premature or ill-prepared adoptions abroad.  This convention reinforces the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, specifically article 21, and seeks to ensure that intercountry adoptions are made in the best interests of the child and with respect for his or her fundamental rights.<\/p><p>  Let us not forget that whereas Ireland signed the Hague Convention in 1993 we had to be dragged kicking and screaming to incorporate it into our law.  When we brought in the Adoption Act in 2010 we were the last EU country to ratify and over 55 countries ratified before us.  We need to fundamentally reconsider how we approach adoption in Ireland and our system of closed adoptions is not always in the best interest of the child.  A closed adoption is the process by which an infant is adopted by another family and the record of the biological parent is kept sealed.  Open adoption is a form of adoption in which the biological and adoptive families have access to varying degrees of each other's personal information and have an option of contact.  In my experience, children can cope and distinguish, and it is us adults who tie ourselves in knots.<\/p><p>  It is my sense that some people misunderstand that the rationale behind adoption is the right of couples who cannot conceive to have a child.  It is not.  Adoption is about, where needed, finding alternative family arrangements for a child and fundamentally it is about the best interests of the child.  I am keenly aware that as we stand here today there are approximately 50,000 adopted people in Ireland who have no automatic legal right to their birth certificate, their medical information or history, or to tracing information about their identity.  We will be able to partly address these issues via legislation but aspects of this matter will need to be addressed at constitutional level, as I noted last October when we were discussing the children&rsquo;s referendum Bill in this House.  I realise that information and tracing is complex but we have to start moving on where change is possible.  There is a clear lack of a legal framework.  Is the State collecting and ensuring that it has access to important and vital records relating to children&rsquo;s identities?  For example, have the religious orders handed over records to the State that will help when the necessary legislation is in place?<\/p><p>  Moving to the Bill before us, I say well done to the drafters who have worked hard to produce a clear, tightly constructed Bill.  As I stand here I am thinking that in less than 18 years these children will be adults.  Will they have access to information on their identity?  We saw the fall of communism 14 years ago and the rush for adoptions so will Ireland over the coming years have issues to deal with?  I think of Ireland&rsquo;s history with adoptions and how many &quot;went to America&quot; or in reality were sold to so called &quot;good Catholic families&quot; for a better life.  Nobody who saw the movie &quot;Philomena&quot; was not touched and conflicted by her story.  We do not want to create scenarios today that will be the films of tomorrow.<\/p><p>  Are we setting a precedent today?  The adage &quot;hard cases make bad law&quot; springs to mind.  Will we change the law for other groups of people who are not in line with our law and the Hague Convention?  Does this not open the gates for other &quot;one-off&quot; fixes?  We have all heard the understandably emotional calls from the four or five prospective adoptive parents but let us remember the law today will extend the period for up to 23 prospective adoptive parents.  When a country ratifies the Hague Convention we have seen again and again how the number of children eligible for adoption dramatically falls.  This happens because the children were never legitimately available for adoption and often have fallen foul to criminal activity, including corruption and the sale or trafficking of children.  Can we be assured that in any one or more of these cases significant money has not and will not change hands?  I ask these questions now because one or more of these children, upon turning 18, may have the same difficult questions for their parents.  Will we be able to give answers?<\/p><p>  It is critical that a rigorous verification process be put in place for all adoptions.  In ending, may I wish each of the children who are to be adopted and to their prospective parents a really happy and fulfilling life.  Nevertheless lets us not forget that adoption is the right of a child, not of adults, and we must ensure that this is not lost sight of.  If anything is to be learned from the Ryan and Murphy reports, it is how crucial it is to have adequate systems in place to protect vulnerable children.  We need to re-examine our approach to adoption so let us lead and show that we really have learned from our chequered past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000005#D00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1387534800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, to the House, and commend her on introducing this Bill.  As the Minister and others have said, it is a narrowly focused Bill with a specific purpose, which is amending a provision of the Adoption Act 2010.<\/p> <p>However, as Senator van Turnhout and others have said, it raises much bigger issues surrounding adoption.  This is a very difficult issue and one on which we have had a very difficult past.  When the Adoption Bill was being debated in this Chamber, both the Minister and I were very involved in that debate as Opposition Senators.  At that point we discussed some of these bigger issues that are quite correctly being raised now.  Even then, there were concerns about what would happen to families who were in the process of adopting from non-Hague Convention countries, and section 63 was the interim or transitional provision.  It is welcome that we can facilitate the very small number of families who are at a very advanced stage of the process through this legislation.<\/p><p>It is tightly drawn legislation.  The two specific restrictions in it are welcome.  I agree with the Minister's approach to confine the measure.  It only applies to those families where a declaration of eligibility and suitability was already in force on 31 October this year, and it is further restricted in that it will only extend those declarations for one further year.  That is very welcome for the 23 families involved.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste has been intensely involved in this, as has the Irish diplomatic service and the ambassador in Moscow.  As the Minister said, this is due to changes in Russian adoption legislation.  Those changes reflect overall changes in adoption patterns worldwide.  As Russia and other countries become more wealthy and put more supports in place, there is a greater move towards adoptions within those countries and smaller numbers of adoptions as women have more choice and can keep their babies.  As we know from our sad history, it is in the best interests of the child when there are supports available to families so they can keep the baby.  In a relatively short period Ireland has moved from being a country where there were no supports and where children were in institutional care, with terribly sad cases such as that featured in the &quot;Philomena&quot; film regularly occurring, to being a country whose people are now adopting from abroad, from countries where vulnerable families are open to exploitation.  The Minister and other Senators mentioned Ethiopia, Haiti and other countries where there would be concerns about families being put under pressure to put children up for adoption.  The best interests of the child and child protection must of course be our foremost concern.  All of us recall the high profile case of the Irish family which engaged in an inter-country adoption which did not go well.  There was a very unfortunate outcome for the child.  We must be conscious of that.<\/p><p>I am proud that we have signed and ratified the Hague Convention and that we adhere to its standards, which are clearly developed in the best interests of the child.  Senator van Turnhout is correct that we must consider the rights of adopted children into the future and the right to information and tracing.  The Minister and the Department are doing a great deal of work on that.  Work has begun on bringing the records together to ensure that when the children are adults they will be entitled to the information.  Indeed, it is important to point out that those families that have adopted children from Russia and elsewhere are far more conscious now of cultural sensitivities and the need for the child to be aware of their background.  There is a Russian adoption society and the families regularly bring children to Russia.  Generally, there is essentially a much greater move towards what Senator van Turnhout speaks of as open adoption.<\/p><p>It is also important to refer to other changes in families in terms of family structure and family formation and the way people now deal with difficulties with reproduction, for example, through surrogacy.  There is a growing need to regulate surrogacy and I am glad the Government is going to move on that and to regulate assisted human reproduction generally.  That is now what many families will look to, whereas in the past they might have adopted when it was easier to adopt and when, perhaps, the rights of the child were not as clearly protected in international law.<\/p><p>All of these developments are generally positive.  We are much more sensitive to the best interests of the child and more conscious that the rights of the child are to the forefront.  As Senator White and others have said, this is not about the right of parents to adopt.  It must never be seen in that light.  This is about the right of a child to a second chance and the need to ensure that children's rights are protected.  The children who have been in institutional care in Russia - under the new change children must be in institutional care for a year before they may be eligible for inter-country adoption - deserve a second chance and many families in Ireland are very happy and keen to offer them that chance.<\/p><p>This is welcome legislation.  It is narrowly focused and, for many of us, it raises much bigger and more fundamental questions.  In the past I have represented many survivors of institutional abuse in Ireland and I am aware of the ongoing trauma into adulthood that comes from being taken from the birth family and being placed in institutional care at a time when there were no supports available from the State to facilitate birth families keeping their children.  We have moved very rapidly from that system to a system where, happily, we are far more supportive of single parents.  As a result, the rate of internal adoption has dropped to almost nothing.  That is the bigger context in which this legislation is being introduced.<\/p><p>This is very welcome for the families involved.  It is a nice Christmas present for them and particularly for the children who are deserving of the second chance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000005#D00300","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387535400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The Minister is dressed today in Santa Claus colours and she looks very well, if I may say so.

It is important to introduce amending legislation that will support families who have worked hard to adopt only to have their efforts frustrated.

Many records are being transferred and now they will have one assembly point which is important.<\/p><p>Records are also interesting in terms of foster care.  I am aware of a case where two people were put into foster care many years ago, one woman is now 79 years old and the other woman is 71 years old.  It took a daughter of the 71-year old woman two years to find her mother's records so that she could track down family.  The sad part is that I knew both of the women for over 25 years but never knew they were connected.  Eventually they met when one was 71 years and the other was 79 years.  Both women had been put into foster care at a very young age.  I was surprised that it took so long for a child of one of the women to get records in order to trace family. <\/p><p>Another side of the story was that one woman was involved in the Fine Gael party and the other was involved in Fianna F&aacute;il.  If both women had been involved in the same political party they might have met at an earlier date.

We must not forget about them.<\/p> <p>Many people were put into foster care 45 or 50 years ago.  I am not too sure how the record-keeping process was dealt with after that.

Ba mhaith linn m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an mBille seo agus taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt d&oacute;.  We welcome the timely introduction of this Bill, which extends the period of declarations of eligibility and suitability which apply to the Russian Federation for one year to 31 October 2014 for those prospective adoptive parents who held such declarations on 31 October last.  I hope it will provide some relief for the small number of families that are affected by the heartbreaking consequences of the changes in Russian law.  As soon as those consequences became apparent, a concerted campaign was entered into by the individuals affected and the Russia-Ireland adoption group to explore all possible avenues of possible resolution.  I understand that high-level discussions with the Russian authorities and the Russian departments of education and science, and foreign affairs took place in an effort to address the impasse.<\/p><p>The changes to Russian family code laws that came into effect in that country on 3 July last had serious implications for a number of prospective adopters in Ireland when taken in conjunction with existing Irish legislation.  The changes related to the length of time a child must spend on the federal registry in Russia before being available for foreign adoption.  As a result, a 31 October deadline loomed for many prospective adopters with pre-2010 declarations.  A small number of prospective adopters who had intended to have their adoptions completed by this deadline were now clearly unable to complete their adoptions in the required timeframe.  This was through no fault of their own but as a result of the unexpected changes in Russian family law.  Some of these people, including Pamela O'Reilly and Lisa Fennessy, have been in direct contact with my colleague, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  They are very far down the road - they have been to Russia and have met and formed a bond with the children they plan to adopt.  The human and personal stories involved in this situation, some of which we have heard this morning, are emotive, honest and heartfelt.<\/p><p>The Bill before the House, which amends the Adoption Act 2010, will provide more time for the finalisation of adoptions that are already in progress.  I welcome the Minister's approach.  I ask her to keep the situation under constant review to help ensure positive outcomes for all involved.  I join Senator van Turnhout in raising concerns about other aspects of this matter.  I am sure the Minister is aware them.  I will not go back over them.  We have had a good year.  I believe the Minister is doing a good job.  She is working hard for the rights of children.  She knows that the treatment of children in direct provision is my own bugbear.  I have raised that issue with her previously and I intend to do so again after Christmas.  Our concerns about those children, as well as some issues relating to adoption here in Ireland, remain to be resolved.  The introduction of this legislation is a positive move.  This is a happy day for the families in question.  As someone who has friends who have experienced the joy of foreign adoption, after the initial heartbreak of not being able to have children themselves, I have an appreciation of what this means to families and to the children themselves.  Perhaps Senator Leyden should consider that the less said about the links of Fianna F&aacute;il politicians with Russia, the better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000008#G00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1387536600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I can tell the Senator that Fianna F&aacute;il has a proud trade record as far as Russia is concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000008#G00300","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1387536600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>What about all the exports and the work of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000008#G00400","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1387536600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>It might be more appropriate for Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh to stick to the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000008#G00500","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1387536600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000008#G00600","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1387536600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>We can start talking about history if the Senator likes.

I note the great care they have taken in their responses to the families that have been in touch with them.  I pay tribute to the serious way in which Senators have approached the situations in which these families find themselves.  They have approached this legislation in the same manner.  I welcome the comprehensive nature of this debate.  When we talk about adoption, it is important that we look at it in the round.  It has been pointed out this morning that this country has some obvious historic issues with regard to adoption.  We have to be sensitive to the possibility that those issues could be applying in other countries at present.  When I was drafting this legislation, I had to be cognisant of our obligations under the Hague Convention.  The key question of standards arises in this context.  We are aware that a lack of informed consent has done some damage in the past.  As a result, many Irish people are now searching for their identities, which can be quite difficult.  We are bringing the records together.  We are doing our very best.  However, I have received very strong legal advice to the effect that we will not be able to bring in retrospective legislation with regard to the issue of identity.  It seems that the mother's right to privacy is stronger than the right to identity.  Nevertheless, we will do as much as we can with the legislation in question.  I look forward to the debate on it.<\/p><p>Some issues changed dramatically as a result of the 2010 Act.  It enabled us to sign up to the Hague Convention.  It led to a dramatic change in the opportunities for Irish couples to adopt in other countries.  Unlike other countries, we have to negotiate bilateral agreements.  We are trying to negotiate such an agreement with Russia at present.  I have been to Moscow and had detailed discussions.  We are trying to do that.  Bilateral agreements are very complex instruments.  Our legislation says that if families are to adopt from non-Hague countries, we must have a bilateral agreement with that country.  I would welcome informed discussion on that when we are reviewing the adoption legislation.  I think there are real issues about whether the needs and best interests of children who are available for adoption are being met.  I refer to children who do not have parents, or have been abandoned completely, and are facing life in institutions.  I have seen abandoned children in such institutions in a number of countries in the last year.<\/p><p>We have to examine the international instruments that may or may not inhibit or help the adoption process.  I think we should examine the insertion of bilateral agreements in the 2010 Act.  I have an open mind on it.  I understand that protection is necessary.  Equally, I believe that if we are seriously thinking about putting the best interests of the child at the centre of this process - if we believe they should be given a second opportunity for family life - we have to look at national and international instruments, particularly those that are built into the 2010 legislation.  Having said that, it is right to abide by the Hague standards.  Countries can abide by those standards without the need for bilateral agreements.  That is a topic for another day.  I am putting it on the table for discussion at a future point.  We have had detailed engagement with a number of countries.  Now that we have an agreement with Vietnam, for example, adoptions from that country will start to come through very shortly for the first time.<\/p> <p>Some 200 couples on the list have been waiting to adopt from Vietnam and there have been many disappointments along the way.  <\/p><p>Inter-country adoption is changing and the number of such adoptions is in dramatic decline in Europe, whereas surrogacy is on the rise.  Inter-country adoption is a complex and difficult process.  Other countries are facing issues that we faced in the past.  Circumstances are changing and the agencies which were previously in a position to support adoptive parents because of the number of adoptions being completed are no longer financially viable.  A similar process is under way in this country.  All of these factors are playing a role and the review of the Adoption Act will provide an opportunity to discuss many of these issues. <\/p><p>A number of Senators asked about the timeframe.  While I acknowledge what has been said about long delays in assessments, the position is changing.  The small number of children available for adoption means, however, that notwithstanding quicker assessments, the problem persists.  It is very sad to meet many parents who have been in the adoptive process for long periods.  Some of them are ageing out, as it were.  Practice is not as it should be in terms of the ageism that applies in this area.  Having taken advice, we believe one year should be sufficient to allow the families concerned to complete their adoptions.<\/p><p>The adoption process is changing and the purpose of this legislation is to facilitate families who have been caught up in the process and impacted by the change in Russia.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland will have an implementation plan and will provide advice on its website to ensure couples are able to make an informed decision on whether to proceed with adoption.  I thank Senators for their co-operation and interest in this issue.  It is appropriate that we had such a wide-ranging debate because changes of this nature make a statement, rest on certain assumptions and impact on other issues.  We have stated we wish to remain within the Hague Convention and the standards therein. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000008#G01700","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387537200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2013: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1387537200,"counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000009#H00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387537200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387537200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387537200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment and received for final consideration.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387537200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill do now pass.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1387537200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Most people, including politicians, do not realise that Ministers seeking to implement serious change must display great skill in drawing together the various groups and Departments involved.

I like many others here have served within the local government system, on both town councils, or urban district councils as they were, and county councils.   The experience of many who served in that dual capacity would be that where town councils were properly empowered, they were an effective and efficient organ of the governance system.<\/p> <p> The county councils always had a tendency to assume the powers of the urban district councils.  Now the Department is assuming powers that the county councils should have.  It is small-scale empire building, in which nobody wants to cede power but in consequence the system is totally centralised.<\/p><p>Does it serve the people well that there are town councils in 15 towns with a population of fewer than 2,000 while several with a population over 10,000 do not?  No.  The solution is not to abolish them all but to ensure that those with a population in excess of 10,000 are given the status of a town council, with appropriate powers.<\/p><p>Why do residents living inside a boundary line have a town council, while those in the suburbs of the same town, but outside an outdated boundary, must deal with the county council?  That arose out of changes made in 1994 in the run-up to town council elections when arbitrary boundaries were set.  Unfortunately, many people in my town, and I am sure elsewhere, who wanted to play their part, to exercise their franchise, were deprived of the possibility of doing so.  That was not done by the councils but by the Department of the Environment and the Minister of the day.

It is rather like trying to abolish the Seanad.  The idea that reform means dismantling the process and replacing it with nothing is totally misguided from the point of view of local government.  If anything, the economic collapse of the past five years has taught us that our political system is not up to meeting the challenges of these difficulties when they come along.  There were dissenting voices in this House and within the D&aacute;il, where all the parties, including those in Opposition, complained that not enough money was being spent, that public expenditure was not high enough, that salaries and social welfare and everything else should have been increased.  The mind-set is that everybody follows the herd.  Unfortunately, what we are doing here will remove voices from the system which were very accountable at local level, particularly through urban councils.  That will be a significant reduction in our democratic structures.<\/p><p>Does it make sense that town councils operate like islands, separate from their wider hinterlands?  There is a thrust towards urbanisation in our society.  These growing urban areas will be part of a conglomerate county council which will not be as effective.  The Minister pointed out yesterday, they will deal exclusively with policy.  Most of the representations that the Minister and other Members of these Houses receive are not about policy but about the delivery of services and in many instances the failure to deliver services satisfactorily to citizens.  That is why we have such a strong representative role within these Houses.<\/p><p>Does it serve a purpose that some town councils, which owe their existence to 160 year old legislation, have virtually no functions?  It does not.  That goes back to the old town commissioner situation, which could also easily have been rectified by giving those town commissions the same status and powers as town and urban district councils.   There is also a reference to transferring territory and resources from the county council to the town, thereby weakening the county councils.  That is not the case.  The growth in infrastructure in County Louth shows how dynamic that council is.

There is no real fairness, ability to pay consideration or progressive nature to the rates system in this State, and that is wrong.<\/p><p>The amendments also seek to empower the municipal districts in respect of their rates in municipal district areas.  The Minister spoke earlier of powers being given to the new municipal districts that are being set up, but that is not the case.  To take the Waterford example, Waterford city has its own city council - its own autonomy - and now a new municipal district will be set up that will not have the ability to set a rate.  That will be the prerogative of the new merged authority.  The Minister is taking power away from some of those areas to which he said he will giving power.  Some of these amendments seek to allow the municipal district areas to set rates.  The Minister has trumpeted this new municipal districts and put them up on a pedestal as the great part of the reform element of this document and he is giving them new powers and we have heard how great they will be, yet they do not even have the power to set rates.

We are talking about the rates issue, and the Minister said earlier that the powers of the town councils will now be exercised at the municipal district level, then the most fundamental power is the power to raise revenues.  If that is not going to be applied at district level, which it is not under this Bill, and that is the reason we tabled this amendment, then what the Minister has said is incorrect.  The municipal authorities will be no more than just what the area committees or the district committees are now.  We have had those in Wexford since 1979.  They are a very effective way of looking not at policy but at the administration of services.  That is what we apply them for and officials came before us and were accountable whether it was for water services delivery, domestic refuse, roads or housing.  All the areas for which the council had responsibility for the delivery of service functions within those districts were discussed with the local councillors in that area and it worked very effectively for us.<\/p><p>I was glad that when the Local Government Bill was enacted in 2001 it took that as best practice and applied it across the country.  The Minister will have to accept that by not allowing it to happen at municipal level, he is removing a very significant function that applied to town councils.  The town council rates in my county, and it is probably true across the country, are pitched at much lower levels than the county council rate.<\/p> <p>That is the case in my county and it is probably true across the country.  They are pitched at much lower levels than the county council rate.  If, as will happen under the new legislation, there is a tendency over a period to have all the rates increased to the county council rate, that will overburden small businesses and small retail operators who are struggling.  Many of them that have gone out of business will not be affected but others are struggling in the current economic situation.  The system evaluation, about which many people complain, is totally antiquated.  The Minister referred to the local government system going back 160 years but the rates system is totally antiquated and is based on theoretical valuations.  There is a need for the entire area to be examined.  With the introduction of the property tax which is now being applied to every household, perhaps there was an opportunity to have a root and branch review of the commercial rates system.  Undoubtedly, as we try to tackle the high unemployment rate, there is a need to incentivise small and medium businesses, in particular retailers and small businesses on the outskirts of towns or in urban areas to continue to benefit from the lower rate and, if anything, to reduce it rather than increase it.  The proposal is counter-intuitive to everything the Government should do in terms of job creation.  It will have an adverse effect.  I know it is of concern to chambers of commerce and business organisations in towns.<\/p><p>I hope it will not be the case that every amendment we propose is rubbished.  That is tantamount to the totalitarianism we have seen in the past three years and it should be taken into account.  Perhaps it is time to review the approach given the rebuffing the Government received from the electorate in a number of recent referenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000014#O02200","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387540800,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Senator Walsh should produce his policy document.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000015#P00200","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1387540800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Members who have spoken will be pleased to hear I agree in principle with them on some points made on the valuation process.  In my contribution on Second Stage I indicated that valuation should come under one Department rather than two.  It is regrettable that is the case currently.  Committee Stage of the Valuation (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill will come before the House early in the new year.<\/p><p>It has been stated that in many instances towns have lower rates than counties.  What will happen in Waterford based on the Minister&rsquo;s proposal is that the rate will be harmonised downwards so one will have the lowest rate.  I commend the Minister on providing the finance in order to do that.  The downwards not upwards harmonisation will put people on a level playing field.  Senator Cullinane and others have called for higher rates for larger industries and businesses.  That has happened in many instances through the revaluation process.  Dublin and Waterford are the only two counties that have been completed to date.  I fully admit that the increases outlined by the Valuation Office will present major difficulties in particular for small shops in the retail sector.  Many valuations are under appeal.  In other cases valuations for small businesses have gone down but we do not hear about them.  We only hear about the ones that have gone up.  It is understandable that people are concerned about increases.<\/p><p>The Minister is doing everything possible in the rates area in which he has jurisdiction to reduce rates downwards.  It is a matter for each council to decide as councils have autonomy and it is up to them to decide where to allocate additional moneys.  It will probably be the case that we will have a major debate on rates during Committee Stage in the new year, and in particular, on the valuation process which is taking place.  Given that Dublin and Waterford are the only counties that are completed I expect we will hear much more when the rest of the country has been completed and people will find themselves in difficulty in large cities and towns.  That is a debate for another Bill in the valuation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000015#P00300","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1387540800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  On a more general principle, I would love at some stage for us to have a fundamental root and branch look at the way we raise funds for the activities of our democracies.  I am a social democrat at heart.  I am a great believer in people who have more money paying more taxes than people who have less money and people that make more money making a bigger contribution than people who make less, but I am troubled by the way we assess rates in the first place, the whole idea that somebody puts an arbitrary value on one&rsquo;s business or premises and assesses how much tax one should pay on that regardless of the income, turnover or revenue involved.  Somebody could have a terribly loss-making business but because someone has arbitrarily and subjectively valued it as being valuable, the person concerned has to pay a large amount of tax.  I just do not get it.<\/p><p>Will this section enhance or remove a part of the latticework of accountability which is so crucial in the way we spend public money?  The trouble is that when one reduces levels of democracy one increases levels of bureaucracy and when one does that, bureaucracies tend to misidentify narrow sectional interests as in fact being public interests.  For that reason, while we in Seanad &Eacute;ireann believe very much in harmony, I am not so sure that harmonisation is its own end.  I am not sure there is something particularly valuable about harmonising for the sake of harmonisation.  The lack of accountability, the attempt to homogenise everything and the development of bureaucratic structures can lead to substantial pathologies.  In one situation a large amount of public money, probably tens or hundreds of thousands, was spent by a body which had no local authority representatives on it, which it should have done, in pursuit of a cover-up of financial fraud.  That was in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group ten years ago when a large amount of public money was spent trying to defend the absurd contention that the hospital was not aware that a very large research programme existed, as it was the only way it could justify a very substantial and deliberate mis-billing of money from the Voluntary Health Insurance and other insurers.  In the process it spent many tens of thousands of public money in pursuit of the cover-up.  I am troubled by many aspects of the Bill and I hope that at some stage we can have a look at the way we raise the necessary revenues for our local authority activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000015#P00400","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1387540800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I wish to make one or two comments on rates.  From my experience rates on premises do the rounds to some extent.  When businesses are going well, the rate remains the same and is not proportionate to the profit of the business.  At such a time the multiple of costs on the business are lower, and when businesses are going badly, the multiple and percentage of the overall costs of running the business increase because there is no correlation or proportionality between the two.  That is one of the reasons progress has not been made in the area over many years.<\/p><p>The second reason for the lack of progress is what Senator Walsh described as the antiquated system for devising a rate on a building.  There are obvious winners and losers.  Some months ago when the Valuation Office visited Waterford city I was there with a colleague on a Saturday morning.<\/p> <p>His head was nearly taken off his shoulders by businesspeople who had been affected by an upward rates review yet as we continued along the street he met another person who told him that he did a great job on the rates.  The system is desperately imperfect.  I know work is ongoing on the new rates valuation Bill but will the Minister comment on the need for some linkage between income and expenditure and revenue of a business to the cost of the rate?  Should the rate vary depending on how well the business is doing or other wise?  That is the first question.<\/p><p>Second, many discussions were held with the Minister prior to the Bill being drawn up, one of which was about the out-of-town supermarkets that got free parking as part of their planning permission and that were sucking the traffic out of town centres.  People were shopping with their feet, so to speak, and the town centres were struggling.  A number of Members suggested to the Minister that such premises should be required to pay an extra rate or tax; I believe it is called the Tesco tax in Northern Ireland or England.  Does the Minister believe that is feasible?  He will probably tell me that is an issue for the other legislation but I ask him to comment on it because it is all interlinked.<\/p><p>There is concern that harmonisation will mean upward harmonisation but in Waterford and, I believe, in Tipperary the Minister provided extra funding this year to ensure that is bedded down.  In some cases it will be harmonisation, with the definition being a downward harmonisation.  Does the Minister envisage that continuing and where does he see the slack being taken up if we do not continue to get a subsidisation every year from the Department?  Does he believe the uplift in the economy will ensure that or will it be done through efficiencies within the local government system?  When does he believe we can look forward to a trend towards downward harmonisation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000015#P00500","speaker":"1162","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387541400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I do not propose to accept amendment No. 20 even though I understand the spirit of the amendment in terms of where the Senators are coming from.

The economic indicators or whatever criteria we come up with have to be taken into account but, equally, we must have a stable system of funding local government and providing the necessary finance for those services.  There is a balance to be struck but we are making provision in this legislation for harmonisation downwards towards the lowest rate in the county.  That is a prudent measure to take account of these difficult times for businesses.  I have already done it in Waterford, Limerick and Tipperary because they are merged counties, and it is up to the elected members to make sure the savings are achieved to harmonise it downwards.  I am giving them a ten year transitional period in which to do that.

I am disappointed with the response the Minister has given.<\/p><p>On the municipal district councils that will now do this function, as a former member of a local authority I know that in the rural areas, the question of rates is not an issue because there are very few commercial rate-paying entities, therefore, the people in those areas do not have an electoral voice.  I have spoken to colleagues across the country many of whom said that when they came to the end of the debate on rates, which might have taken place over five or six days, and they were left looking at a deficit of &euro;30,000, &euro;60,000 or whatever, the simplest way to deal with that, and there will always be a proposal from predictable sources, was to increase the rate by 1% or 2% to make up that deficit.  As a result of the direction the Minister has gone with this legislation the interests of those small businesses will be affected, even by leaving it at municipal level, but extending it now county-wide will seriously disadvantaged those people.  The Minister will be away in Brussels and it will not be a headache for him but it will be a headache for them, and it will be a headache for those interested in creating jobs here.

I refer especially to the funding that has been given to local authorities to reduce rates.  Any lifting of the burden, especially on small and medium-sized businesses, must be seen as a good development.  Nobody will argue against that.  However, we need to have a debate about rates, how they are calculated and how they are paid.<\/p><p>The other issue, which the Minister has not dealt with, is the power to set rates for the municipal districts.  I am looking at the two amendments which my party tabled, one of which, amendment No. 20, is supported by Fianna F&aacute;il.  We are dealing with five amendments in this grouping, but I will deal with amendment No. 20 first.  It seeks to insert the wording: &quot;Each municipal district may, in respect of that district, set an additional commercial rate for premises occupied by large commercial entities which exceed such thresholds in turnover or other economic activity as may be prescribed.&quot;  The Minister has not told us why that would not be good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000017#R02800","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1387542000,"counter":285,"content":"<p>More or less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000017#R02900","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1387542000,"counter":286,"content":"<p>It will be for larger multiples.

There is scope to increase taxes on some of those bigger multiples, and these taxes can be used to ease the burden on smaller retailers.  The amendment seeks to provide some form of a progressive nature to rates, yet the Minister has not given us any reason for not accepting it.<\/p><p>  The second amendment to which I wanted to come back is amendment No. 23 in respect of municipal districts.  This amendment is straightforward and pragmatic.  Given the Minister's view of how wonderful the new municipal districts will be, I do not understand why he cannot give them the power.  It seeks to substitute the wording in the Bill with the following: &quot;The base year adjustment shall be determined in accordance with <i>subsections (3)<\/i> and <i>(4)<\/i> by a rating authority, with agreement of the members of the Municipal District Area where the base year adjustment will apply, in respect of each year of the adjustment period for each of the specified areas of the rating authority.&quot;  We are asking only for the consent of the municipal district area members, and even that is being ruled out.  The Minister has not dealt with that issue either.  He is not giving them the autonomy to set a rate, and this was referred to by Senator Walsh and others.  The Minister can argue that in the overall authority, whether it is the new merged authority of Tipperary, Waterford, Limerick or wherever, all members can set the rate, but that is not the point.  The point is the municipal districts, which the Minister states will benefit those areas, whether it is Waterford city, Galway or wherever, should have the power to set a rate.  They have it at present.  It is being taken away from them and it is being given to a bigger authority.  Why was that not looked at?  If there is a reason the power to set a rate was not given to the municipal districts, what was the reason for it?  Why did the Minister not go with that option?  I would interested in hearing the logic of that decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000017#R03200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1387542000,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I am delighted that Senator Walsh accepted that he is in favour of increasing rates on businesses and that he is against this amendment tabled by the Government to make the necessary changes to harmonise rates to the lowest level in each county.

Senator Coghlan has good timing.  The Valuation (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill will cover a number of Senator Cullinane's concerns.  It is important to have a good debate on the valuation process because, as I stated earlier, it is not satisfactory at present.  That is why the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has had a lengthy consultation process for the past year with stakeholders.  For the information of Senator Walsh, there is much work done on this in the Department of Finance, which has always been the Department appropriate for valuation.<\/p> <p>It is a matter for the Government to change if it wishes.  The Senator was very concerned about it but did not get to change it over 14 years.  We are not prepared to devolve the function of and responsibilities for levying rates to municipal districts because I do not want different rates applied by authorities in the same county.  People may disagree with that if they wish.  We are certainly conscious of the harmonisation of rates across a county area.  In this regard, consider the competitive pressures that exist whereby counties or regions might be competing with one another.  One should not have one rate on one side of a line dividing municipal districts and a different one on the other.  If this were the case, there could be a different rate a mile up the road in a different village or town.  That is the background to why we decided to leave the setting of the rates at county level.  The elected municipal district member has a second bite of the cherry in that he can argue, at the plenary session of the council, as to what rates would be appropriate, based on needs and resources, in order to run the show in his district.  He can also argue what the priorities should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000017#R03700","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387542600,"counter":295,"content":"<p>This is a bit like playing handball against a haystack.  There is none so blind as those who do not want to see.  There are two aspects to the amendment that has been tabled.  One aspect is that each municipal area should be allowed to determine its commercial rate.  The Minister's argument against that is that different rates could apply in areas within a mile or two of each other.  This is already the case.  A mile from where I live, a different rate is applied on each side of the river.  This is because the other side of the river is in a different county.  The Minister's argument against doing what we are suggesting is, therefore, a non-argument.  Our proposal would create a competitive dynamic within a county because a municipal area, by creating a rate according to its budget, would generate competitiveness regarding commercial rates within that county.  We need some discipline to keep the rate down and competitive.<\/p><p>The second point of the amendment concerns premises occupied by large commercial entities.  Tesco has been mentioned but I do not believe it has brought much to the shopping landscape of this country.  Other retailers may have.  Most of the stores of Tesco are on the outskirts of towns and their location has been detrimental.  I argued against the rezoning of land to allow this to happen in my town but I was in a minority.  The majority decided otherwise.  The rates arrangement certainly has an effect.  I certainly commend the efforts being made to try to find a balance by examining charges, including car parking charges.  The amendment affords the Minister an opportunity to examine the profitability, and perhaps the revenue, of large commercial enterprises to ensure in some way that their contribution will be higher than that of the smaller shopkeepers so as to afford an opportunity to the latter to survive.  The smaller shopkeepers may not be a priority for the Minister but they are a priority for our party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000018#S00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"vote","time":1387542600,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Amendment

I previously signalled that I intended to revert to this matter and I appreciate Members' contributions to the debates both in this House and in the D&aacute;il in the past few weeks.  There are, however, numerous factors to be considered when proposing an amendment to rates legislation, including its effect on business sentiment and its impact on local government finances.  I accept that the commercial property market is not homogenous and there are locations around the country where there is little or no demand for commercial premises, which means that the intentions behind introducing a reduced refund are more difficult to achieve.<\/p><p>I believe the best way of ensuring that local circumstances are accounted for is to provide the elected councils with the authority to tailor their vacancy refunds that best suit their own local economic circumstances.  The amendment I am introducing specifically seeks to provide that elected members in all local authorities can, as a reserve function, decide an electoral district or districts within the administrative area of the county and city, where a differing rate of refund may apply.  Councils can decide on the appropriate refund being any proportion downwards from 100% that should apply in each individual area, and provide that the Minister may make regulations setting out the administrative and financial procedures to apply in relation to the taking of such decisions.  The underlying objective of these provisions is to allow elected members to respond to the realities of economic circumstances in their own areas.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 147 amends Part 3 of the schedule to provide for this new reserved function.  Related amendments are also being made to the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1930 and the Cork City Management (Amendment) Act 1941 to provide for local discretion there as well because in both of these cases, the prevailing refund regime of 50% already applies.  As I have explained, provision is being made to allow the local authority to provide a different proportion of refund in specific electoral districts within the authority's administrative areas.  It would, of course, be open to the elected members in Dublin and Cork to apply a 50% refund regime to all electoral districts in the relevant cities, thereby maintaining the current position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000019#T01800","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387543500,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I extend a lukewarm welcome to the change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000020#U00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1387543500,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Vote against it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000020#U00300","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1387543500,"counter":317,"content":"<p>To be honest, it was my intention to call a vote on this section because where premises are vacant and there are no revenues accruing, there are also no services being utilised by the owners of that premises.

A large body of case law is well established and local authorities and ratepayers are in the main very familiar with and generally accepting of the operation and practice of the rating system, notwithstanding what we discussed earlier.  The local authorities must play a leading role in creating a pro-enterprise and supportive environment to generate jobs and sustain existing jobs and are best placed to meet many of the needs of businesses in terms of infrastructure, local promotion and other key enabling measures.  In this context, local authorities work with ratepayers who are experiencing financial difficulties and take whatever action is possible to support enterprises that wish to establish, expand and create jobs in their administrative area.  Moreover, I have been concerned with an aspect of rating legislation that in my view could give rise to an unfair burden on new occupiers of rateable property, be they companies that wish to expand, relocate or indeed start up.  The subsequent occupier provisions contained in the Poor Relief (Ireland) Acts 1838 and 1849 determine that occupiers can held liable for up to two years for the unpaid commercial rates of the previous occupier.<\/p><p>I am taking this opportunity in amendment No. 142 to repeal those provisions and eliminate this financial burden for new occupiers to ensure that any possible barriers to enterprise development are removed.  Removing this liability offers the possibility that property that may otherwise have remained vacant and unoccupied can now be re-let, thus improving opportunities in the property market and reducing the instance of vacant commercial properties.  The amendments to this effect are set out in Part 4 of Schedule 2.  As I said before, rating legislation is complex and there are numerous factors to be considered when proposing an amendment such as this, including its effect on business sentiment and local government finances.<\/p><p>I am taking the opportunity with amendment No. 28 to introduce a new duty to inform the local authority of the transfer of rateable property, be it a change of ownership or tenancy, in order that the local authority is in a position to ensure liability can be established as soon as it falls due.  The amendment details the nature of these requirements and the penalty for non-compliance.<\/p> <p>Subsection 2(<i>a<\/i>) places an obligation on property owners to notify the local authority of a change in interest within two weeks of the transfer.  This includes a transfer of ownership or tenancy where the person to whom the interest transfers will become liable for rates.  This therefore applies in circumstances where the new owner takes up occupation of the premises or a new tenant is moving in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000020#U01900","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387544100,"counter":334,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387544100,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That section 32 stand part of the Bill&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387544100,"counter":336,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That section 33 stand part of the Bill&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387544100,"counter":337,"content":"<p>SECTION 34<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387544100,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 29:\r\nIn page 43, line 17, to delete &ldquo;, 13, 14(3) and 15&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and 13, subparagraphs (3) and (4) of paragraph 14 and paragraph 15&rdquo;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1387544100,"counter":339,"content":"<p>This amendment addresses an omission in the list of consequential provisions in Schedule 4 of the Bill that shall not apply in the case of county and city development boards.

As a consequence of this deletion, technical amendments to renumber the provisions in section 128 are covered by amendments Nos. 45, 50, 54, 61, 62, 66, 68 to 74, inclusive, 76, 77 and 82.  Amendments Nos. 31, 32, 34, 36, 38, 39, and 78 to 81, inclusive, all provide for specific references to the local and community plan to be replaced by reference to the local and economic community plans or to the community elements of the plan, as the case may be.  Amendment No. 37 alters the reference in this part of the Bill to the duration of the plan from five to six years.  The change to the duration of the plan from five to six years is being provided for in the amendments I am tabling for section 66, which will provide for the local economic and community plan, and for the harmonisation of the planning period of this plan with other local authority planning processes, including the new regional spatial economic strategies.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 44 introduces a new function for local community development committees asking them to consider the economic elements of the plan before it is finalised to enhance co-ordination with the community elements of the plan and ultimately integrate the economic and community elements into a single plan.  Amendments Nos. 67 and 75 make minor adjustments to the provisions for making regulations relating to local and community development committees.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with the amendments tabled by Senators.  Amendment No. 46 proposes to add a focus on social inclusion as an issue to which LCDCs should have regard.  A similar proposal was made on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il and I undertook to consider the proposal when framing the proposals for the local economic and community plan, which will be the key focus of the work of the LCDCs.  Accordingly, I consider that the intention of this amendment is met through the provision in section 66B(3)(<i>a<\/i>)(<i>i<\/i>), which we have yet to debate, for a focus in the plan on the need to tackle poverty, disadvantage and social exclusion.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 35 is one of a number relating to the description of the key responsibilities of the LCDCs.  I am satisfied that the wording set out in the Bill referring to the local and community development of each area properly represents the role and functions of the proposed committees.  This includes the responsibility the committees will have for certain local development programmes.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendments to remove the references to local and community development or to remove the word &quot;local&quot; from the phrase &quot;local and community development&quot;.  I believe these two amendments would limit the scope of the LCDC functions to dealing with community development supports and activities.  This would be inconsistent with my policy intentions, which seek to give the committees a management and oversight responsibility for local development and community development programming at a local level.  Therefore, I oppose them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000021#V02600","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1387544100,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Many organisations are very concerned about this section of the Bill.  They have concerns about the implications for independent work in the community sector in particular and for the most disadvantaged and marginalised communities.  They regard this as a centralisation of powers around local development.<\/p> <p>We are moving away from having the power with local development companies, as they are at present, and taking that away.  Basically, we are handing a chequebook to the county councils.  As we now, it is he who holds the chequebook will influence the agenda.<\/p><p>There is genuine concern that Part 6 of the Bill will give wide-ranging powers to the local authorities rather than the community development sector.  There is a concern that the Bill gives the State control over the local element of independent Irish civil society.  It is vital that the sector is autonomous and independent in order to work towards positive social change.  The Bill states that the local development committees will be independent in their workings.  From my experience it is clear that will not be the case in practice.  <\/p><p>We are quite aware that when these companies, which are supposed to work from the bottom up, are under the influence of the county councils that the agenda will be totally different.  I mean that the funding will be spent in a different way, and one can be clear on that matter.  <\/p><p>We are also concerned that the Bill will provide for a wide-range of issues to be dealt with by ministerial order.  That again will give the Minister, or a future Minister, significant powers to implement even wider ranging reforms without the need to introduce new legislation.  That is a worrying development.<\/p><p>The legislation also provides for the reform of other legislation, some of which will have direct implications for the participation of the most marginalised communities, including the Traveller community.  The Bill does nothing to further the involvement or participation of those most distant from democratic processes.  It does nothing to address the democratic deficit identified.  Let us examine the matter from a community development perspective.  The idea behind community development is to empower people in their local communities.  This section, particularly regarding the local economic plans, will serve as a rubber-stamp and lead to the county council agenda being imposed on local communities.  Also, the county council agenda regarding how moneys are spent will be rubber-stamped by the committees.  <\/p><p>I have worked with a local development company in the past and I am well aware of the issues on the ground.  I have also sat on a social inclusion committee in county councils.

There is no new vision for local community development but a continuity of policy.  Let us be honest, in the section there is a drift towards centralising community development into local government and putting it under Government control which was set in train by the previous Government.  It started with the abolition of the community development projects which were subsumed with partnerships to become local development companies or whatever they are called at present.  The previous Government dissolved the boards that comprised people who lived in communities and knew what the issues were.  Those boards were dissolved and local accountability and responsibility was taken away from the very people who live in the communities.  That was the first step taken to undermine the principle of community development and a bottom-up approach.<\/p><p>When the Minister came to power he could have reversed centralisation and stemmed the drift towards taking power away from communities.  He could have given power back to communities, instead he has further centralised power.

Their power and responsibilities were taken away from them.  They no longer have any involvement in the CDP because it was subsumed, along with partnerships, into local community development companies.<\/p> <p>Where is the bottom-up approach?  A team of people working in a voluntary capacity across the State have been taken out of the system.  How could that be a good thing for the people who live in those communities?  I remember attending an event in Croke Park which the Department and Pobal also attended.  The Minister referred to a lack of accountability.  There was accountability through Pobal and the Department.  Pobal representatives were very clear when the community development partnerships, CDPs, were being dissolved that community development would not be subsumed into local government and controlled by it but that is exactly what happened.  As Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said, whoever controls the chequebook controls the agenda and policy.  That is what will happen.<\/p><p>It is unfortunate that the Minister has not brought any fresh thinking, new initiatives or vision.  He simply followed on with a process that was set in train long before he was Minister, yet he is dressing it up as a reform by him.  That is nonsense.  It was created by Fianna F&aacute;il in the previous Government and it was set in train long before he became Minister.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, is simply implementing it and giving us no new vision, which is disappointing.  Previous speakers suggested that the Minister might end up in Europe but before he goes he could take the opportunity to fundamentally reform local government and local community development.  He has missed the opportunity.

The best use of volunteers was not being achieved because of the processes that were introduced.  The Minister will recall that much auditing was done to determine value for money and best practice.  Nationally, we did not come out very well from the process.  There is always an opportunity, none more so than at the moment when the most significant reform of local government in 100 years is taking place, to examine a system that would best serve communities through local development companies but also with a sense of democratic accountability and autonomous opportunity attached.  For those reasons I look forward to the roll-out of the system and to getting clarity on the issues I raised and those that were raised by Senator Wilson to protect and enhance the role of elected persons.

This is the first time the role of the community is being recognised in a structured way in law.  Senator Cullinane said there is nothing in the Bill but for the first time ever we are giving reserved functions to councillors to decide the local economic and community plan.  They will work with the community in a structured way for the first time ever.  That is just an example of the wide suite of opportunities councillors will have after the 2014 local elections.  By the vote of the people they will have an influence on all moneys that are disbursed in their community, not through private companies, which is the current structure, where there are all the obligations of company law.  Many company directors did not appreciate that when they began, but they telephone my office to get details of their role and responsibility under company law.  I can assure Senator Cullinane that they were not always aware of what was involved, especially when coming to the end of a programme period, as we are under the rural development programme.  We do not know the funds yet for the rural development programme because we have not completed discussions on that element of it in the Common Agricultural Policy.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the contracting party &ndash; not my Department - with Brussels on the rural development programme.<\/p><p>In response to Senator Landy, the chair of the LCDC has to be elected by the membership of the LCDC in order to comply with EU regulations for funding.  That is a committee within the local government structure that has to be self contained for the purpose of drawing down those funds in order to adhere to the EU regulations on the bottom-up approach.<\/p><p>I understand that one of the front-runners in terms of participation by local authorities with the community on LCDCs is Cork County Council.  My understanding is that a councillor has been elected chairperson from within the group.  I am sure that will allay Senator Landy&rsquo;s concerns.  The situation will vary but it is possible if councillors and the local community work closely together.  The working relationship between councils and communities varies as well.  Officials and members of the county council must embrace the community more and, equally, the community must be less suspicious of what councils are trying to do.  If statutory bodies and community groups work together in a local area the outcomes and output of local community development committees will be improved.  I hope that will allay the concerns some people have had on those matters and put paid to some of the hypocrisy in terms of not devolving responsibility and power to councillors.

Some &euro;17 million was to be allocated to the Gaeltacht areas under the original Leader programme.  From recent parliamentary questions it seems clear to me that we have only received a fraction of that and that we are approximately &euro;9 million down on the figure we were told we would get only some years ago.  Figures I received recently on County Galway show that of the Leader funding moneys we were supposed to get, we are approximately &euro;5.5 million short because of cutbacks.<\/p><p>That is an issue.  That money should have been spent locally but it has not been spent locally because of an issue between the Department, the Minister, the county councils, etc.  That points towards the lack of confidence people in local areas have in a centralising of the chequebook system through the county councils.  Although the Minister says there will be a majority of community and voluntary members on the local committees, we all know well that it is the people who hold the chequebook who will hold the power and drive the agenda.  We all know that in this case they are the county managers and the directors of services.  That is exactly what will happen and the Minister knows it well.  It will probably be at the behest of the Minister of the day too.  That is an important point and one of the reasons we need to re-examine this section and this part of the Bill.<\/p><p>What consultation has taken place with the representatives of the community sector on this part?  They have raised serious issues with us.  For example, the Community Workers Co-operative, CWC, has said to us that these wide-ranging and deep-seated changes are being made in the absence of any consultation with the sector or with the most disadvantaged communities that would be most affected.  Communication from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on the process has been non-existent despite numerous calls for information.

These were companies limited by guarantee in the first instance.  These were companies made up of voluntary members from community development projects who lived in the communities.  They did their job in a voluntary capacity.  They made up what was a voluntary board of management.  The Minister seems to gloss over the fact that all of these community development projects were under the control of Pobal.  Therefore, there was oversight and accountability from the Department of the community development sector.  The point is that there was a community element.  The previous Government took away the community element.  The Minister is now not only supporting that but taking the whole area and putting it into local government and giving the power to unelected people in terms of the influence that the county and city managers or chief executives, as they will be called, and directors of services will have and the local councillors as well.<\/p><p>It is interesting.  The Minister made a charge that I was being hypocritical because I was saying on the one hand that no new powers are being given to local government but at the same time I am not pleased with the powers of local development being given to local government.  Is it not interesting that the only real power, the only power of substance that is being given to local government and councillors is by way of taking away power from the bottom up and from the local community?  Not one element of power is being devolved from any Department.  It is a matter of keeping power in the centre and all the Departments hanging onto their power and none being given to local government.  The Minister is taking away the little power and influence that people at community level had.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000024#Y01800","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1387545900,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Is Senator Cullinane afraid of democracy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000024#Y01900","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1387545900,"counter":467,"content":"<p>The Minister is giving it to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000024#Y02000","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1387545900,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Senator Cullinane has not been a democrat for too long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000024#Y02100","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1387545900,"counter":469,"content":"<p>The Minister is giving it to local government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000024#Y02200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1387545900,"counter":470,"content":"<p>Senator Cullinane, without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000024#Y02300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1387545900,"counter":471,"content":"<p>The Minister is trying to suggest that there is something wrong with having voluntary boards of management and people who live in communities influencing policy at the local level in matters of community development.

Amendment No. 43, for example, refers to improving the efficiency with which publicly-funded local and community development resources are used.  This returns us to an earlier question we discussed, namely, whether the Minister has evidence to show that local development companies have been doing this work inefficiently in recent years.  While some of the reports and audits Pobal has done on these groups have shown difficulties in a number of local development companies, they generally found that the companies provide value of money, are operated efficiently and allocate resources effectively.<\/p><p>  The other issue of major importance to most of the local development companies is that they employ large numbers of local people.  The Minister will no doubt inform me that negotiations are ongoing with the Irish Local Development Network, etc., but many of those who work in local development companies are based in the local area and have local knowledge.  This is a major bonus, as is the fact that most of them live in the areas in which they are employed, some of which, for example, south, west and north Connemara, are remote rural locations.  It is important that these people are living and working in their communities as their jobs are among the most important employment in rural areas that do not benefit from significant industrial development.<\/p><p>  Many people are concerned that the county councils will hold the chequebook and allocate resources.  They fear the administrative functions of the local development companies will be assumed by county councils and some of the moneys currently spent in peripheral areas will be spent shoring up staff numbers in local authorities in response to cutbacks.  This would result in posts being lost in local communities. <\/p><p>  I remain concerned about the Minister's replies to previous questions.  There is still the potential that some of the local development companies will be starved of funding.  This would leave them with no choice but to close down and result in job losses in rural areas.  While the Minister will no doubt inform me that he does not propose to close down any local development company, the <i>de facto<\/i> outcome of the process he proposes will be the removal of funding and resources from the sector, as has occurred in the community and voluntary sector in recent years.  As we all know, without funding the jobs will vanish.  <\/p><p>  I note from the Schedules that key organisations will be excluded from the decision making process.  I note, for example, that the National Traveller Partnership, the National Collective of Community Based Women's Networks, both of which function as local development companies, the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Community Workers' Co-operative, Pavee Point and the National Traveller Women's Forum do not feature among the groups that must be consulted, as relevant bodies, under section 128G(1)(<i>d<\/i>).  I ask the Minister to comment.<\/p><p>  The local development companies work in local areas and seek to foster social inclusion and involve local people in the decision making process.  The Minister is rowing back on this by providing for greater centralisation of this role under the county councils.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000027#BB01800","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1387547400,"counter":573,"content":"<p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh trots out the mantra that we will close down this or that.  That is not the case.  Of the approximately 1,900 people employed in the local development companies, around 1,650 are Exchequer funded.  I provided &euro;47 million for the sector in 2014, the same level of funding I provided in 2013.  This sum will fund 1,650 positions on the same basis next year as this year.  It is a matter for the local development companies to decide on employment levels but that is the current employment figure in the companies.<\/p><p>Approximately 250 people are employed under the rural development programme, that is, the Leader partnership.  I will not know if the funding available for this purpose will decline until negotiations conclude with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Government.  At that point, we will know what level of staffing or structures are required to deliver the programme.  There is no reason the local development companies will have insufficient resources to continue the good work they do in 2014.  They currently employ 1,650 people, excluding those employed under the rural development programme.   <\/p><p>The local development companies are private companies which receive money as part of a contract to deliver programmes on behalf of the State.  We do not have contracts to deliver programmes with the organisations the Senator suggested have been excluded from the Schedule.  They do not feature in the Schedule because we do not have contracts with them. <\/p><p>The local government system will need partners to deliver programmes in the same way as the State needs partners through the local development companies.  The arrangements for this type of partnership have not yet been finalised as they form part of the current negotiations.  We cannot anticipate the preferential partnerships or bidding process there will be for various communities to deliver programmes on behalf of the local community development companies.  The discussions are ongoing and I do not know what will be their outcome. <\/p><p>There has been an uneven pattern in respect of administration costs in local development companies.  While the rural development programme allowed for 20% administration costs, the administrative costs of many local development companies reached 35%, which is far in excess of what they should have been.  Clearly, this has an impact as projects do not proceed where money is spent on administration.  In the past 18 months, we have tried, with some success, to reduce the cost of administration to ensure more money becomes available for front-line services.  I assure the Senator that the audits Pobal has done in some companies are disturbing and he would be surprised to learn where these companies are located.  Pobal was established to ensure good corporate governance and management practices are in place and administration costs are kept down in the interests of having projects proceed in communities.  The organisation does a good job.  <\/p><p>The notion that there will be a disconnect between the community sector and local government arising from these decisions is nonsense.  The local community development committees will focus strongly on securing partnership arrangements with the community to deliver programmes based on their local economic and community plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000027#BB01900","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1387548000,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I appreciate the clarification.  I appreciate also that negotiations are ongoing.  It is a misnomer to call these companies private companies; they are companies limited by guarantee.  That is not the same as a private limited company but people might take that as being the case from what the Minister said.  Prescriptive memorandums and articles of association were given by the then Minister's Department at the time, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to all those companies to the effect that they had to be set up with 23 members in rural areas and, if I remember correctly, 21 members in urban areas.

They are not private companies in any sense; they were set up to be responsible to all sectors in society.<\/p><p>Regarding the Schedule, the Minister said the companies I mentioned are not contracted with the Minister's Department as are the ones on the Schedule.  Those on the Schedule are the Leader companies, the local development companies as such.  Can the Minister clarify at this stage, in light of the negotiations taking place with ILDN, if it is his vision that those companies will remain in place and be the local deliverers because, if not, why are negotiations ongoing with them?  It is like saying we are having negotiations with schools on an education issue but we might pull out of the negotiations and set up different schools afterwards.  The Minister for Education and Skills would not say something like that.  Does the Minister have a vision that the local delivery will happen through those companies because that needs to be put to bed here today?<\/p><p>I am very concerned about the Minister's comments on the audits.  These programmes have not just appeared overnight.  They have been in place for many years.  Pobal has been responsible for quite a number of programmes, including the local community development programme and its successors.  It has been involved in the child care programmes.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been overseeing the Leader programmes.  They have been auditing these programmes for many years.  We have had European Union scrutiny of the Leader companies also.  If the Minister is telling me there are serious overruns in companies where 20% was supposed to be allocated to overheads and 30% or 40% has been spent, that tells me there has been a serious lack of oversight on the part of the Department, Pobal and the EU on these issues.<\/p><p>On the question of who is to blame, I have seen previous Administrations put the blame on the local communities and let companies like Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, MFG, go to the wall-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000028#CC00100","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1387548000,"counter":575,"content":"<p>The companies spent the money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000028#CC00200","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1387548000,"counter":576,"content":"<p>The companies spent the money but they were being audited on an ongoing basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000028#CC00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1387548000,"counter":577,"content":"<p>Are these the same people the Senator wants to discharge the programmes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000028#CC00400","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1387548000,"counter":578,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000028#CC00500","nonspeaker":"A Senator"},{"type":"speech","time":1387548000,"counter":579,"content":"<p>Is the Minister saying that all the companies are not responsible enough to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000028#CC00600","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1387548000,"counter":580,"content":"<p>The individual companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000028#CC00700","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1387548000,"counter":581,"content":"<p>Yes.

This was an ongoing practice but it is very important that we do not tar all those local development companies with the same brush.<\/p><p>Of the 30 or so companies, is the Minister talking about a very small number of them or is he talking about the companies in general?  That needs to be clarified in case people might be of the opinion that all the local companies were being managed in a bad way.  In terms of the companies that were not following the guidelines, what was done about it by Pobal, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which was managing the Leader programmes, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, in terms of child care cases, etc., which would have been managing programmes, and the EU, which would have scrutinised the Leader funding?  The paperwork for Leader was unbelievable.  In terms of the auditing, I was often told by people working in Leader companies that the amount of audit going on was massive.

As directors they are still obliged to comply with the law under the Companies Acts.  They have very serious responsibilities in terms of financing and so on.  I assure the Senator that any of the audits that threw up problems identified by Pobal were dealt with but there was over-expenditure on administration.  Too much money is being spent on administration in these companies and we intend to streamline that.  The money we have available for local development companies will be spent on projects, not on unnecessary administration, which can be duplicated with local government.  The integration of these services and alignment with local government will mean more money for front-line services, and hopefully more opportunities in the community in terms of capacity building and animation to help people in the communities, not setting up a super structure.

This will provide for an important input to the process via the CPG.  However, I should point out that the focus will be on identifying the sectors to be represented on the LCDCs, rather on selecting individuals.  In practice, nominating organisations will select their own nominees and submit them to the chief officer.  He or she will have no role in selecting the individual nominees, nor will the members of the CPG.  This will be provided for in the regulations.  This amendment may clarify the position regarding amendment No. 58, which proposed to preclude the elected members from the nominees that would be sought by the chief officer in the context of the role of the chief officer as originally drafted.  Given that this process will now be carried out in consultation with the CPG, I expect that that amendment will not be necessary.<\/p><p>The same applies to amendment No. 59 which proposes that the elected members to be nominated to the committee shall have been elected by the local authority.  Elected members already have well chosen means of selecting nominations from their number to a range of bodies.  In due course, I will bring forward regulations to cover the detailed arrangements for the nomination by various stakeholder bodies to the local community development committees.  In doing so, I will consult as necessary with the representatives of elected members to ensure that a fair and reasonable process is followed. <\/p><p>There will not be room for everybody on every committee, otherwise we would have 30 people on these committees.  Every organisation cannot be represented, but the LCDCs will consult with all sectors to see how we can ensure that we accommodate people as far as possible. <\/p><p>I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 51 and 60 concerning membership and the chairmanship of the local community development committees.  The legislation, as drafted, reflects the balance between the status of the committee as a committee of the local authority on the one hand and the independence of the committee in the performance of its functions on the other for the purposes of drawing down EU local development funds.  One cannot have a situation, other than what I am proposing, if one wants to have the contract agreed for the next round of funds to be with the LCDC.  It has to be a bottom-up approach whereby the majority of members are from the community sector.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh may agree with me on that.  The majority of the LCDC members have to be from the community and therefore that must reflect the EU regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000031#FF00800","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1387549500,"counter":653,"content":"<p>We do not have agreement on that one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000031#FF00900","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1387549500,"counter":654,"content":"<p>The guarantee that the chairperson shall be drawn from a specific sectoral interest, or that a specific sectoral interest should have a minimum number of members on a committee, would undermine the committee's independence and would impact on its eligibility as an implementer of key EU local development programmes.  Given this requirement, I am not in a position to accept the amendments as proposed.  However, I should point out that elected members may very well be the chairs of these committees.  It is up to the committee to make that decision, as they did in Cork yesterday.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 52 proposes that with regard to sectors to be represented on local community development committees, a reference to statutory agencies be added to the already existing reference to public authorities.  This section of the Bill relies on the definition of &quot;public authorities&quot; contained in section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001, which provides for the inclusion of a broad range of public bodies as public authorities, including &quot;a board or other body established by or under statute&quot;.  This definition has been drafted in a sufficiently broad manner to encompass statutory agencies and therefore the amendment is, in my view, unnecessary.  <\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 53, 55 and 56 propose additional categories to be covered in the membership of committees.  I do not consider that a reference to drawing members from communities of interest is required because section 128D(2)(<i>d<\/i>) already provides for members to be drawn from representatives of the local community.  Therefore, this refers to the proposed communities of interest.<\/p><p>  With regard to the proposals of additional categories of committee members, a key point is to ensure that we have a tightly focused membership and not a huge number of people that would make the committee unwieldy.  The proposed amendments concerning, for example, guaranteed membership for representatives of all social partners on the committee would inevitably result in a larger than intended membership.  <\/p><p>  It is well known that we have had a plethora of large committee and boards whose effectiveness frequently suffers due to the size of their membership.  The recommendation to me by the expert group that studies local development alignment was to keep the committees as small and focused as possible.  Accordingly, I will do so and therefore I will not accept the amendment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000031#FF01000","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1387549500,"counter":655,"content":"<p>Could the Minister oblige the House by clarifying the situation on the mayors?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000031#FF01100","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1387549500,"counter":656,"content":"<p>I am not going to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000031#FF01200","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1387549500,"counter":657,"content":"<p>Is amendment No. 51 being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000031#FF01300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1387549500,"counter":658,"content":"<p>We have not concluded with this yet.

It reiterates the recognition given in the Local Government Act 2001 to various historic charters for civic or ceremonial purposes.  Specifically, it provides that the title of mayor will be reserved for cities, municipal districts which contain boroughs and county towns or towns with a population of over 20,000 at the last census.  This provision was amended on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to provide that this population figure would include all of the town environment, rather than just the element in the county in which the town was mainly located which would affect places such as Athlone and Carlow.  In other cases, the office will be titled chair, Cathaoirleach or leader.  Provision is also made for the use of titles of Lord Mayor or mayor in respect of cities, as was the case prior to the introduction of the Bill.  Similarly, in the case of the merging authorities in Limerick and Waterford, it will be open to the overall authority to adopt the title of mayor in view of the fact that these will be city and county councils.  This will provide an additional means of maintaining the identity of the cities in the context of the merged entities and, as such, I am opposed to amendment No. 83.   It will be a matter for the elected members in these authorities to decide which title they would prefer to use.<\/p><p>The Bill provides that the option of adopting the title of mayor will no longer be available to county councils.  This restores the position which applied prior to the Local Government Act 2001.  Furthermore, while examples of largely rural authorities having a mayor can be found, the more usual practice internationally is for the office of mayor to be associated with significant urban centres.  Confining the office of mayor to larger urban centres will enhance the status of that historic office.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 84.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000032#GG06900","speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387550700,"counter":756,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387550700,"counter":757,"content":"<p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387550700,"counter":758,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 84 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387550700,"counter":759,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That section 36 stand part of the Bill&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387550700,"counter":760,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That section 37 stand part of the Bill&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387550700,"counter":761,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That section 38 stand part of the Bill&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387550700,"counter":762,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That section 39 stand part of the Bill&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387550700,"counter":763,"content":"<p>SECTION 40<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1387550700,"counter":764,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 85 to 87 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000033#HH01300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1387550700,"counter":765,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 85:<blockquote><br \/>In page 58, line 1, after &quot;matters&quot; to insert &quot;, and the chairperson of such committee will be a member of the relevant Local Enterprise Office&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000033#HH01400","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1387550700,"counter":766,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 85 seeks to make the chairperson of the new economic development and enterprise SPC a member of the local authority's local enterprise office.

This is an important element of the Bill and will ensure that balanced local economic and community development will be undertaken in accordance with the principles of sustainable development, and that this development will be led and co-ordinated by the local government system.  This function will be central to the new functions of local authorities.  It will add to the current function in promoting the interests of local authorities, and in that context I am proposing amendment No. 88.<\/p><p>The changes in regard to economic development, enterprise support, community development and local development are major departures in local government functions, reversing some of the marginalisation of local government over the past few decades.  There is a link between what we are doing in this Bill and the larger national economic crisis.  Through the hard work and sacrifice of the people of Ireland, we have now exited the bailout programme.  The Government recently launched its medium-term economic strategy to point the way to a stable and prosperous future, and away from the failed policies of boom and bust that have cost us so dearly.  The local economic and community sector has an important contribution to make to the national economic recovery plan and to the objectives of the medium-term economic strategy.  This is the context in which we are tasking local authorities, together with the local community development committees, to prepare integrated local economic and community plans for their areas for the first time.  These plans will have economic and community elements which will be prepared separately, but in parallel.  Both elements will be prepared in consultation with the public, with relevant public authorities, with the regional assemblies and with the municipal district members.<\/p><p>There will be ample opportunity to ensure synergies in the development of the economic and community elements, through the timing of public consultations on both elements, availability of drafts in parallel and meetings of the SPC and the LCDC being held in the same timeframes.  The local economic and community plan must be consistent with the local development plans made by the elected members and with the regional, spatial and economic strategies.  The making of these strategies will be a matter for the elected members in the regional assembly.  The local authority will be tasked with drafting the economic elements of the plan, and I have provided a power for the Minister to give a role to the new SPC for economic development and enterprise in this regard.  The LCDC will be tasked with preparing the community elements of the local economic and community plan.<\/p><p>Implementation strategies and arrangements must be put in place and led by the local authority and the LCDC, respectively, for the economic and community elements of the local economic and community plan.  These will be reviewed and updated annually, and the local authority must report on the successes or otherwise of their implementation of these plans each year in their annual report.  It will be a matter for their members to approve the text of the annual report as a reserved function, giving them a further opportunity to ensure that the implementation of their economic and community plan is properly driven and led.  In that context, I am proposing amendments Nos. 135, 144, 145, 146 and 149. <\/p><p>There are also two technical amendments, one of which inserts an indefinite article in the text to correct the grammar,  while the other relates to the definition of the local economic and community plans.  In that context, I am also proposing amendment Nos. 106 and 130.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000033#HH02800","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1387550700,"counter":778,"content":"<p>I support the sections that relate to the preparation of local economic and community plans.

However, we need to learn from the mistakes of the past.  The Minister served on the old city development boards himself.  They were good in theory, but not very good in practice in some areas.  It depended on the local authority involved.  One of the difficulties that city and county managers encountered, as well as local government representatives, was in getting buy-in from many of the stakeholders.  That included enterprise agencies, as they were not really engaging with the city development board plans.  We had the same problem with some of the educational providers.  Now we are seeing real changes and when the LEOs are up and running, we will hopefully change some of that perception.  The new education and training boards are also coming on stream.  How is all of that going to work?  How will all those stakeholders be pulled in to frame the local economic and community plans?  If they are to have any real value, and if the local economic and community development plans are to be as holistic and worthwhile as they need to be, then the local authorities involved will need the support of the stakeholders.  Does the Minister agree with that?<\/p><p>If we are going to have local economic development plans, the enterprise agencies need to be on board.  Perhaps the Minister might tell of his experience of the old development boards, including their failures so that we do not repeat some of their mistakes.  As we go forward with the new local economic and community plans, we need assurance that they are genuine, that there will be buy-in and that they will be meaningful and what we all want them to be.  If these plans are being framed but we do not get the buy-in from stakeholders, how will the Minister deal with that and how can the local authorities deal with it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013122000033#HH03100","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1387550700,"counter":781,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Cullinane's sentiments that the local enterprise offices and the local authorities have to be centre stage in economic development in the future, and not be by-passed into agencies and quangos, as occurred in the past.

This is to ensure that the agencies and Departments cannot, for want of a better phrase, fob off the local elected members who have a genuine concern on behalf of the people they represent about the economy, transport, or any other activity in their community.
