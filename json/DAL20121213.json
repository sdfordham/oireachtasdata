To quote the T\u00e1naiste himself on 11 February 2011, before the election date: \"The Labour Party will not agree to having child benefit cut anymore and Fine Gael need to drop their plans to cut child benefit\".

The T\u00e1naiste has accused others of having a hard neck.  I suggest that his is a hard neck of the bright, brassy variety.  It is clear that \"fair\" is a four-letter word in the minds of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  I do not know how he can credibly say what he has said to the very people he promised to protect, including children and their parents, carers and people with long-term sickness and disability.  I do not know how any Member opposite will look these people in the eye and utter the word \"fair\".  The Government is rushing through social welfare legislation today to introduce cuts which in real terms and in real time will cause real hardship to real families, real children and real women.  Here is the real clanger - these are the very sections of society to which the Government promised protection.  So much for that.  I do not know whether the T\u00e1naiste deliberately set out to make liars of his Ministers, TDs and Senators and to make a liar of himself, but he has done that comprehensively.  So brass iron is his own neck that he will stand up in this Chamber and waffle on about fairness.  I do not know how he does it.<\/p><p>  I suggest to Government Members, especially those in the Labour Party, that perhaps the die is not yet cast.  Amendments will be brought forward today to see off the worst excesses of these cuts, particularly in respect of the respite care grant and child benefit.  The latter is the matter about which the T\u00e1naiste was so passionate and so right not so long ago.  The die may not already be cast.  Despite Labour Deputies' brass-necked leader, who has made liars of them, perhaps they will step up to the plate and actually defend those people to whom they made solemn promises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300004#B03300","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1355395200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I advise the Deputy that the word \"lie\" is not appropriate in any circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300004#B03400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355395200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Withdraw it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300004#B03500","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1355395200,"counter":88,"content":"<p>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle should tell that to the T\u00e1naiste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300004#B03600","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1355395200,"counter":89,"content":"<p>We do not need any advice from Sinn F\u00e9in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300004#B03800","speaker":"961"},{"type":"speech","time":1355395200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I ask Deputy McDonald to withdraw that word.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300004#B03900","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1355395200,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I will not withdraw it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300004#B04000","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355395200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355395200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>The word \"lie\" is not appropriate in any circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300004#B04200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1355395200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I cannot hear what the Chair is saying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300004#B04300","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1355395200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I am asking the Deputy to withdraw the word \"liar\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300004#B04400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355395200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Withdraw it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300004#B04500","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1355395200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Members opposite are constantly diverting this conversation.

We were given an assurance last year that this provision would not come into effect until such time as child care arrangements had been put in place.<\/p><p>  Where a lone parent payment is withdrawn, a parent will have to sign on and make a declaration that he or she is available for full-time employment.  The parent will then be asked to take up a place on a T\u00fas or back to education scheme and so on.  The difficulty that arises, not for parents but for children, is that in the absence of adequate child care places children will be left to care for themselves.  One would expect that where a parent leaves a child on his or her own all day social services would, possibly, take that child into care.  Yet, an arm of this State will later this year commence an order which encourages this.<\/p><p>  I do not disagree with the policy change in terms of providing people with a way back to work.  However, I do not believe it is possible to do this without first ensuring there are guaranteed child care places for the children of parents forced to return to work, where those children are below an age at which they can reasonably care for themselves.  If the Minister can give that commitment, then it is appropriate to enforce this arrangement.  If not, she will be putting parents in impossible situations.  Not alone will they lose their lone parent payment but they may lose entitlement to rent assistance.  This could become a major issue during the next year.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to the ten new offices throughout the country.  While I understand these are part of a pilot scheme, ten new offices will not cut it in terms of the number of child care places required.  There are almost 450,000 people unemployed.  There are not jobs and places on schemes for all of the people at whom this change is aimed.  I urge the Minister to postpone this commencement order until after the pilot scheme is up and running, following which a more comprehensive scheme in respect of the provision of child care places for the children of lone parents who are going to be asked to seek full time employment can be put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300012#K00300","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1355399700,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I would like to put on the record of the House that much of the discussion by the Opposition around the lone parent and carers issues is confusing people.  I will explain to Members what a single parent with a special needs child receives from the Department by way of income support, which with a special needs child such parent would, of course, need.  A single parent of a special needs child is entitled to \u20ac188 per week plus \u20ac30 for the child.  In addition, he or she receives a half rate carer's allowance.  As such, a parent with one child, who is a special needs child, would receive a weekly social welfare payment of \u20ac319.80.  This is important in the context of the policy debate we are having.  The \u20ac319.80 payment is made up of a one-parent family payment of \u20ac188, a child payment of \u20ac29.80 per week and a half rate carer's allowance of \u20ac102 per week or \u20ac309.50 per month.<\/p><p>  As I have stated previously, I have protected primary weekly payments.

A lone parent who is a carer - I know the Deputy is aware of this - is not, as suggested by Deputy Murphy, required to seek employment because he or she is, by virtue of being a carer, deemed to be working.  In addition to the \u20ac319.80 per week payment plus \u20ac130 per month by way of child benefit, a lone parent is entitled to the household benefits package and a travel pass.  The household benefits package includes a \u20ac3 per week television allowance, an estimated \u20ac2 per week free travel allowance; a \u20ac10 electricity allowance and a telephone allowance of between \u20ac5 and \u20ac6 per week.  In addition, a lone parent who is a carer is entitled to a respite care grant of \u20ac1,375 per annum.  In international terms - I know the Deputy is aware of this - our lone parent and carer payments are among the highest in Europe.<\/p><p>  The lone parents with whom I have spoken say that what they would like is more certainty around the availability of respite places and other services for the child for whom they are caring.  I want to make it clear that what many of the carers with whom I have spoken want, in terms of reform of the system, is more certainty in relation to respite care places.  The package of payments for a carer in receipt exclusively of the carer's allowance is worth \u20ac13,350 per annum.<\/p><p>If the person being cared for lives with the carer and is an adult, he or she is entitled to disability payments amounting to approximately \u20ac11,000 per year.  The total package, therefore, for a disabled adult being cared for by a spouse is worth \u20ac24,370 per year.  Deputy Murphy and I would both like to make that payment higher, but the worst reduction in payments to such people was made by Fianna F\u00e1il when it cut the allowance for a disabled adult being cared for by a spouse by \u20ac16 per week over the course of a number of budgets.

That is why, for instance, in this budget I am increasing funding for the provision of hot school meals and for the special initiatives for children in disadvantaged areas.  Deputy Murphy, to some extent, is not looking at the question of how to ensure we have a strong social welfare system that is not simply strong in terms of income transfers.  All of the European statistics show that it is exceptionally strong in that regard and even rich European countries do not, in many cases, have the level of transfers that we have.  Instead, what they have is a much more active social welfare system that encourages people back to work.<\/p><p>  I said already that we have ten offices now operating the new system of social welfare.  These are not pilots but are the first wave of the transformation of the Department of Social Protection from being a passive Department that simply pays money to people who unfortunately have lost their jobs or who, for other reasons, are getting a social welfare income, to an active Department that not only pays people an income but also enters into a contract with them - a contract between the individual and the Department on behalf of our citizens and taxpayers - that the Department will give the individual and his or her family their entitlements in the form of income supports but will also oblige the person, particularly as his or her children grow up and attend school, to get back into education and training and back to work.  That combination is a win for the family and a win for Irish society and taxpayers.<\/p><p>  There are approximately 96,000 lone-parent families in Ireland.  Think of all of the talent and energy that could be harnessed by my Department by helping those families get back into education and work and back to financial independence.  Deputies know that the families and individuals who get back into employment and regain their financial independence are the winners.  If one talks to women in their fifties or sixties who have been parenting on their own they will say that getting a good job was the best step they took.  If, however, a woman in her twenties or early thirties who is looking after a baby on her own delays taking that step for a long time and delays updating her education, training and qualifications for ten or 20 years, it is quite hard for her to make up the gap in terms of getting a reasonable job and becoming financially independent.

This is why I was happy to announce an additional 6,000 after-school places.  Ireland is starting from a low base in regard to child care.  All of us recognise that our child benefits and lone parent payments are among the highest in Europe.  However, in most other countries in Europe, including 90 miles to the north, lone parents do not retain that status exclusively once their children attend school.  This is to give the parents the opportunity to get involved in education, training and community work, which will assist them and their families to become financially independent.  The best social welfare systems provide income support, particularly when the children have not yet started school full-time, while also giving tremendous support to help people return to education, training and, ultimately, employment and financial independence.  That is the purpose of the changes to the lone parent payments.<\/p><p>  These changes have been welcomed.  Last night Deputy \u00d3 Snodaigh, like most of the other Deputies who spoke in the debate, welcomed the extension of time and the additional child care places.  I think this is an important initiative and I hope the House will support it as a progressive development which will open new horizons for people who are parenting alone.  Even though we have been discussing painful reductions in this budget, our lone parent and childhood supports are among the highest in Europe.  Successive Governments have devoted 37% of their budgets to social welfare.  That has resulted in a reduction of the at risk of poverty rate of 60%, which is twice the average of almost every other European country, including some particularly wealthy ones.

We favour a move towards a more universal basic pension.  Therefore, measures that would further restrict eligibility move in the wrong direction.

Two changes in the State pension contributory scheme are contained in this section, one of which aligns the contribution conditions applying to the pension across all categories of claimant.  The other abolishes a provision which is no longer required.<\/p><p>  Under legislation which was enacted in 1997, the number of PRSI contributions a claimant for the contributory State pension is required to have paid in order to be eligible for that pension increased from 156 to 260, with effect from April of 2002.  This further increased to 520, with effect from April of this year.  That plan was set out in 1997 and was implemented in 2002, with the final part being implemented in April 2012.  The 1997 legislation provided for a number of consequential amendments and for &quot;savers&quot; to protect existing pensioners.  However, the 1997 legislation inadvertently omitted to provide for the increase from 260 to 520 in the case of a particular category of claimant for the contributory State pension.<\/p><p>  The 260 contribution requirement still applies in the case of claimants for contributory State pension who have a reduced yearly average of between ten and 20 contributions.  This means that this particular category of claimant is treated differently from all other claimants for contributory State pension, including claimants for other reduced rate pensions who are required to have paid a minimum of 520 PRSI contributions.  Section 4 aligns this requirement in the case of all claimants for contributory State pension who reach pension age from 1 January 2013 onwards.  Existing recipients of the contributory State pension will not be affected by this measure.<\/p><p> Section 4 makes a further amendment to abolish a provision which is no longer required.  Special pension arrangements were introduced in 1988 to cater for people who had been affected by the operation of the earning limit for insurability purposes that applied in the case of non-manual workers before 1974.  In those days, a distinction was made between manual workers and people who worked in offices.  Manual workers paid a stamp, but middle management and other office workers who had access to company pension schemes did not.  Before the pre-1974 arrangement was changed, certain people who had gaps in their social insurance records relating to periods when they were not covered by social insurance found it difficult to meet the existing reduced yearly average requirements for the purposes of the contributory State pension.  In those circumstances, special lower rate pensions were introduced to cater for these groups.  The range of reduced rate pensions generally available to claimants of the contributory State pension has been improved since 1988.  As a result, there is no longer any difference between the reduced rate payable under these special arrangements and the reduced rate of the contributory State pension generally.  As a consequence, section 4 of the Bill proposes to abolish these provisions in the case of those who reach pension age on or after 1 January 2013.  Existing beneficiaries of these special pension arrangements will not be affected by this measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300015#N02600","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355402100,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I must put the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300016#O00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1355402100,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Say nothing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300016#O00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355402100,"counter":525,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355402100,"counter":526,"content":"<p>SECTION 5<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355402100,"counter":527,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355402100,"counter":528,"content":"<p>This section is opposed by Deputies Joan Collins, Patrick Nulty, Willie O'Dea, Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh and Catherine Murphy.

It proposes a reduction from &#8364;1,700 to &#8364;1,375 in the annual respite care grant.  I had intended to make a longer contribution on this matter, but I am aware that many Deputies want to speak on it.  I have received many e-mails on this issue.  I hope that by reading from an e-mail I have received from a carer which has been signed &quot;a very tired woman&quot;, I can capture everything I had intended to say:<blockquote>I am the mother of 3 children, 2 of whom have special needs.  My children need 24\/7 care, 365 days, that is every single day since they were born, there are no holidays away with them or from them, I am all they have as their father died last year.  This cut in the respite grant plus the children's allowance having a 10 euro cut per child plus the cut in the household [benefits] package plus the increase of medical prescriptions has left me in tears, literally tears.  As a one income family, I can't work as my daughter has so many therapies and hospital appointments, there is no job in the land who would employ me if I was to go to Galway Monday for hospital appointments and Dublin for treatments Thursday and the other side of Mayo for dental treatments another day, let alone the rare but needed speech therapy that was hard fought for.  I barely am able to pay for the car that takes us to all these places by the Domiciliary Care Allowance and the tax\/insurance is paid by the Respite Grant, the petrol is almost covered by the children's allowance but not now.  It's a struggle to shop every week, to keep oil in the tank, coal on the fire, and God forbid, a letter comes home from the school looking for money for something or one of them need new shoes or rips a trousers or the car breaks down, my nightmares revolve around that, when I can sleep of course [and] as I said, my special needs child is 24\/7 and sleep is a luxury at times.  The money I get weekly\/monthly\/annually is earned, every single cent.  325 euro is small change to most in this government, it's a meal for the buddies and the 20 euro a month I am losing on children's allowance is the equivalent of ONE bottle of wine with that meal.  Small change to those who can change our lives while they have never known financial insecurity or what it is to ceiling stare in fright and fear thinking and worrying about how am I going to last another 3 days with no money in my purse or bank.  This government has us hard against a wall though, they know we can't protest in the thousands that we are because we can't bring the people we care for out of their homes into the streets in a lot of cases.  They know we will never abandon our people like the government has.<\/blockquote>That is part of a longer e-mail.<\/p><p><br \/>  I urge the Minister to examine her conscience and the Government to examine its collective conscience.  They need to reverse this cut.  They should delete this section of the Bill.  The e-mail from which I have read captures all of the despair and distress it is causing.  The consequences of this cut will be felt on the collective conscience of the Government.  I have mentioned that I have received e-mails from many distressed parents and carers who have contemplated the worst.  I urge the Government to give them some hope by deleting this section.  We have set out some of the alternative ways of gathering the small few million euro involved.  If the Government does not act, it will have electoral consequences for the Deputies on the other side of the House and the poor carers in our society who are struggling day in, day out.  The Minister referred to them as unsung heroes, but I suggest that was an insult to them.  One looks up to one's heroes.  One praises and supports them in their times of need.  By introducing this measure, the Minister is not supporting them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300016#O01300","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1355402100,"counter":535,"content":"<p>This is one of the main areas people believe should be protected.  The Minister has made the point that this grant was approximately \u20ac700 or \u20ac900 in 2004 and suggested she is not really eating into it.  This measure will have huge repercussions for every single person who is caring for someone and also for the person who needs such care.  The Government should reverse this cut because it did not form part of the remit it was given when it was elected to office.  It is not good enough.  The amount involved is just \u20ac26.15 million.  Our next amendment outlines how this and all other cuts can be reversed by taxing wealth and incomes of more than \u20ac100,000.  Deputies have an opportunity to act in line with the words they spoke when they made their promises a number of months ago.<\/p><p>  Those who look after people who need to be supported every day, week and month of the year are the unsung heroes of our society.  There is a great deal of anger and the protest was smaller today.  People are saying if the Government implements this cut, they will bring those for whom they are caring into accident and emergency departments and leave them there in order that the State will have to look after them.  They do not believe they are being given enough support to care for those who need care.  They have also said word is getting out, in the context of The Gathering next year, that one should not come to Ireland if one needs care, etc.  I ask the Minister to delete this section of the Bill and support the people in question.  She should not claim that the sum of \u20ac325 is insignificant in the context of all other benefits and supports they receive.<\/p><p>They need this money.  The cost of living has gone up, in particular for electricity, gas and bus fares.

I have also received numerous messages and it is distressing just to read them, let alone try to imagine the distress those unfortunate people and those they are caring for are enduring.<\/p><p>  I appeal to the Minister.  People outside the House who watch the exchanges, clashes, debates and interaction here would be surprised at how many things we privately agree on.  If all of the 166 Deputies were asked privately, off the record, what their opinion of this change was, I suggest they would all be of the one view, whether they were Government or Opposition Deputies.  They would simply be of the view that it is a mistake, it is unfortunate, it looks very bad for the Government and it is a pity it happened.<\/p><p>  I am not attributing any superhuman qualities to the Minister for Social Protection.  We are all human and we all make mistakes.  I am nobody to lecture anybody on mistakes as I have made more than my fair share.  However, I have learned in life that the best thing to do when one makes a mistake is to acknowledge it, correct it if possible and move on.  It was George Bernard Shaw who said there was no shame in admitting one has made a mistake; it only means one is wiser today than one was yesterday.<\/p><p>  To anticipate some of what the Minister might come back with, one of her central defences of the social welfare provisions in the budget is that she has not cut the basic rates.  The fact is that everybody in receipt of carer's allowance is entitled to the respite care grant, so their income is not just the \u20ac204 per week, it is \u20ac204 plus the total of the respite grant which, divided by 52, comes to \u20ac32.50.  Therefore, it is \u20ac204 plus \u20ac32.50, which makes \u20ac236.50, in effect.  As a result of this change, they will come out with \u20ac6.50 a week less.<\/p><p>  There are a minority of people who, for one reason or another, do not qualify for the carer's allowance, perhaps because their spouse's income is too high or over the limit.  Nevertheless, they are doing a tremendous job of caring on a full-time basis for somebody who is disabled or ill.  In return for that work, they get a measly \u20ac32.50 per week from the State, and that is now being cut to \u20ac26.50, a 19% cut for that particular category.  Incidentally, we should bear in mind that carer's allowance is a means-tested payment so people who qualify for the carer's allowance are certainly not the rich.  They must pass a means test, and while this is more generous than the ordinary social welfare means test, it is restrictive enough nonetheless.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach told us on the Order of Business in recent days that the Government is spending over \u20ac780 million on carers this year.  I accept that and I acknowledge it is a fair chunk of money.  However, the contribution which carers are making to this State, if the State had to pick up the tab for the work they are doing, is estimated by independent economists at approximately \u20ac5 billion per year.  This is the only category of social welfare where we are getting back a multiple of what we are giving out.  As somebody said recently, carers are the only recipients of social welfare who are actually working for the money they are getting.  God knows, even as it stands, it is paltry enough for the amount of work.<\/p><p>  There is nobody in this House, or nobody I know outside it, who works harder than a full-time carer - that is a fact.  My mother died earlier this year.  She was in a nursing home and two of my sisters took turns to visit her and stay with her.  Even that - taking turns and visiting somebody who was being cared for by somebody else - really exhausted them.  I cannot even begin to imagine what it is like caring for somebody on a full-time basis.<\/p><p>  As I said, the State gets back six or seven times what it puts into carers.  The amount of money involved here is \u20ac26 million, which is a drop in the ocean in a budget adjustment of \u20ac3.5 billion.  We are told it cannot be changed but nobody has explained why.  Last year, there was a bigger adjustment in regard to disability and it had to be changed and was changed.  Ministers came out and said they had got it wrong, and they were respected and admired for that.  There were a few journalists who wrote headlines about U-turns and so on, but people appreciated the fact Ministers saw they had made a mistake and were good enough to stand up and change their minds in regard to a much bigger amount.<\/p><p>  We are also told that if the \u20ac26 million has to be found, it has to be found elsewhere in the social welfare budget.  Why?  What particular rule of accountancy or arithmetic dictates this?  In any case, while I am sure the Minister could find it elsewhere within the social welfare budget, she does not have to.  Some \u20ac26 million is less than \u20ac2 million across each of 14 Government Departments.  If the 14 Departments are so strapped they cannot find a sum of less than \u20ac2 million each to make this up, then the slightest adjustment to the taxation system would provide \u20ac26 million without affecting the budgetary arithmetic at all.<\/p><p>  The commitment to the troika, as I understand it, was to come in this year at a deficit of not more than 8.3% of gross domestic product.  The Government has pointed out, as it is entitled to do, that it is coming in at 8.2%, which is under what is required.  The sum of \u20ac26 million will not change that arithmetic one iota.<\/p><p>  Like other Deputies, I met carers outside Leinster House last week and many of them have been in contact with me in recent days.  The one issue that was really distressing them was the chasm between what they were experiencing and suffering and the stated views of certain Members in here.  One Minister of State said they could stay in a top hotel for \u20ac700 a week and told them to get on with it.  It is very easy for a junior Minister to express sentiments like that because a junior Minister is being paid 13 times per week the basic rate of carer's allowance.  A junior Minister could earn the \u20ac325 which is being cut from the respite care grant in less than a day - their basic earnings are approximately \u20ac380 per day, before expenses and other ancillaries such as drivers, free telephones and so on.  What a crass, unfeeling, unsympathetic approach to take from someone who is doing so well.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, when on this side of the House used to throw moral imperatives like lollipops, with several per day and three or four at lunchtime.  He said this was a &quot;modest&quot; reduction.  It might be a modest reduction for the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, because he is earning \u20ac169,000 a year or 17 times the basic rate of carer's allowance.  He earns \u20ac470 per day, seven days a week.  By 3 p.m. today, Deputy Rabbitte will have earned the equivalent of the cut in the respite care grant.  In general, I find that if one believes one is going to subtract from rather than add to the sum of human knowledge when one speaks, it is better not to speak at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300017#P00200","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1355402700,"counter":538,"content":"<p>Will Deputy O'Dea please watch the time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300017#P00300","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1355402700,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I will conclude on this point.<\/p><p>When one considers what Ireland's position might be like a year from now, the focus must be on the factors, including external factors, on which that position is dependent.

Whether or not this particular cut is imposed today will not make the slightest difference to where Ireland stands economically in 12 months.  This decision is very bad politically for the Minister's party.  I accept that she does not need political advice from me, but the reality is that it will leave an indelible stain on the record of this Government and particularly on that of the Labour Party.  There is no need for that to happen.  Financially, it will make not an ounce of difference but will impose disproportionate hardship on the people who least deserve it.

After all, this is a Fine Gael budget.  I have no doubt that if the Labour Party had framed it, the measures that we are discussing would not have been included.  It is the Fine Gael Party that is driving economic policy and putting us in a situation where these measures have to be brought forward.  I have no interest in what Fianna F\u00e1il has to say.  I am not a part of that political tradition, nor am I part of the political tradition of Sinn F\u00e9in.  I am part of the tradition of the labour movement.  I joined a trade union when I was old enough to work and the Labour Party when I was old enough to vote.  In fact, I voted for the Minister, Deputy Burton.  I was a socialist as soon as I was old enough to reflect on the inequalities that exist in our society.<\/p><p>  We have been told that there are no alternatives to the measures set out in this Bill.  If I could accept that as truth, I would vote for the legislation.  The reality, however, is that there are plenty of alternatives.  As Susan George, the great American writer, observed, the world is full of alternatives.  Proposals in this regard have been made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Claiming Our Future and TASC.  My colleagues, Deputy Thomas Broughan and Ms Nessa Childers, MEP, and I have presented options.  Alternatives have been offered by virtually every progressive voice in Irish society, pleading with the Government to reverse the cut in the respite care grant and child benefit and instead to impose higher taxes on people earning more than \u20ac100,000 per year.  In response to a recent parliamentary question by Deputy Michael Conaghan, it was revealed that a tax rate of 48% on incomes above that threshold would bring in \u20ac365 million per annum.  That cannot be done, however, because Fine Gael will not allow it.  The Labour Party has a choice, therefore, either to agree to a compromise which is not sufficient or to stand up to its partner in government.<\/p><p>  Last year the Minister, Deputy Burton, and others disagreed with my decision to vote against an austerity budget.  I respect their position.  However, I do not accept that a single voter sent me into this House to cut the respite grant for carers and take \u20ac10 from the allowance paid to every mother in this country.  These decisions are shameful.  It is even more shameful that outstanding members of my party will be forced to vote for this measure out of some blind faith and loyalty to an archaic 19th century Whip system which demands adherence to the party line irrespective of personal convictions.  It is my conviction that these cuts are wrong and alternatives could have been chosen.  For God's sake, let us stand together to effect their reversal, no matter what the consequences.

In fact, it has become a lightning rod for public dissatisfaction with Government policy.  If the Minister listens to the people in her own party and in Fine Gael, she will discover that they all have their antennae up and have realised that this measure is unacceptable.  It is purely a case of stubbornness and the desire to save face that is behind the claim of there being no alternatives.  As others have stated, there certainly are alternatives to what is proposed in this measure.<\/p><p>  The Minister argued that the respite care grant has increased substantially in recent years.  The reality, however, is that the demands on that payment have also increased.  For example, the cost of home heating fuels has increased significantly.  People engaged in caring work face a disproportionate cost in this area because they are predominantly doing so in their own home.  The cost of health care has increased.  Moreover, the reduction in front-line services means that the respite care grant is very often used to plug gaps such as the lack of speech and language or occupational therapy.  The notion that it is used in some type of frivolous way, that it is there for the little treats or extras, is completely to misunderstand the purposes for which it is used by the vast majority of recipients.  In most cases it is not about paying for a week's holiday.  Even if it were used for that purpose, to afford some rest and respite for carers, it would probably make a great deal of sense from a health care perspective.  One third of all carers become ill themselves as a result of the stresses and strains of looking after another person 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<\/p><p>  I will conclude shortly because I know that colleagues are anxious to speak.  I referred in this Chamber earlier in the week to a woman - a constituent of the T\u00e1naiste - to whom I had spoken outside Leinster House.  She told me that her house is locked down at all times because she is caring for her young adult child who has autism and cannot access adult services.  The young person is essentially a flight risk.  This woman and others like her have taken grave offence to this cut because they feel they have been singled out.  Everybody in society is offended that this vulnerable group is being targeted once again.  I appeal to the Minister to show a little bit of sense and reason on this particular measure.  Even if it is the only change she agrees to, it would at least demonstrate a degree of humanity.  If she does not want to hear what we on the Opposition benches are saying, I urge her to heed what Government backbenchers have said.

This cap, which is projected to bring in \u20ac250 million in a year, is not due to come into effect until 1 January 2014.  If this measure were brought in sooner, on 1 July, for example - which independent experts have indicated is entirely possible if the political will is there - it would bring in \u20ac125 million next year.

To take this action is obnoxious and nauseating.  One cannot describe it as fair; it is obscene and indecent.  The Minister has claimed consistently she had no alternatives in this regard and had to make hard choices.  I find the use of the word \"hard\" extraordinary.  What carers do is hard, in fact \"hard\" does not even come close to describing what they have to do.

What upset her was not that the Minister took the money away but that she sat down and thought about doing so.  <\/p><p>  I will leave it at that because other people wish to speak.  I appeal to the Minister on this, above all the cuts she has made, because it concerns the people who work hardest in society, some of them 24 hours a day.  My sister has to get up five or six times every night.  I did the work one weekend to give her a break and did not bother going to bed the second night because I had to turn my father in the bed so often, a consequence of the illness he has.  Carers do not deserve to have any kind of cut to their grant.

Four of them made it clear, in consultation with the people they care for, that today they will be leaving four people - human beings - at accident and emergency departments.  We talk about respect.  What about respecting these people?  There does not seem to be any respect from journalists; none of them is present.

I can only presume she has not, given the cuts she proposes to implement.  My mother was a carer.  I say \"was\", because she used to care for my father who passed away last August.  She never went on a holiday while she was caring for him but used the respite care grant to subsidise my father's medical care so that we could keep him at home and grant him his final wish to die in peace with his family.  If we had not used the grant to do that it is possible we would have had no choice other than to put him into a home.  We would then have been unable to grant his dying wish.<\/p><p>  The Minister stated, as did many other speakers in the Chamber, even today, there are alternatives to implementing this measure.

I appeal to whatever sense of decency and humanity she may possess and I plead with her not to proceed with this proposal.  The saving involved is \u20ac26 million out of total savings of \u20ac3.5 billion.  These are just figures.  My mother and the other 77,000 carers throughout the country are not interested in figures, they just want to be given the resources and to have the capability to do what is right by their loved ones.  If the Minister proceeds with this cut, she may be denying some mother, father, son or daughter the ability to care for a loved one in their own home.  In my book, that is just immoral.

When one considers the latter in conjunction with what is happening in the Department of Health, one can see that a combination of things are affecting carers.  Sadly, the Minister is caught in the middle of the storm.  That statutory two weeks respite to which elderly people are entitled has been removed.  Even though there is statutory provision, people cannot avail of this.  The cuts to home help hours represent a clawing back of the supports available to people in their own homes.  There are those who increasingly rely on the respite care grant to subvent those cuts that are being made by the Department of Health.  This highlights the fact that it is not possible to deal in isolation with an issue which has implications across the entire budget.<\/p><p>  It is extremely frustrating that for one third of those who are in receipt of it, the respite care grant is the only State recognition they get.  These people do not receive medical cards or many of the other allowances and entitlements that are available.  Those to whom I refer feel really hurt in the context of the proposed cut to the grant.  If one considers this cut in tandem with the delay which exists in respect of carer's allowance applications - this currently stands at approximately 11 months - and the impact this has in the context of delays with regard to the processing of the respite care grant, it is obvious that what is happening is placing an additional administrative burden on the Minister's Department and leading to overpayments of supplementary welfare allowance.  Efficiencies could be achieved by streamlining the process to which I refer and these, in turn, could give rise to savings.<\/p><p>  The Bill also contains a proposal in respect of farm assist and I am of the view that this will actually cost money rather than give rise to the saving of \u20ac5 million that is envisaged.  I have put forward proposals to the Minister regarding how we might save \u20ac50 million in respect of the child benefit budget by addressing the issue of fraud and non-resident children.  A number of suggestions have also been put forward by other Deputies in respect of the changes to pension relief.  If these were brought forward, the savings to which the Minister refers could be made.<\/p><p>  I accept that the Minister is in an extremely difficult position in the context of the proposed cut to the respite care grant.  The saving involved - \u20ac26 million - is relatively small in the context of her Department's overall budget.  In light of the fact that this proposal will not be implemented until next June - when the respite care grant is due to be paid - I suggest that there is a window of opportunity available to the Minister during which she might reconsider the position.  A second social welfare Bill is normally introduced in the spring.  In that context, will the Minister postpone what is proposed here and, during the window of opportunity to which I refer, ask the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection to consider the views of and suggestions put forward by those in opposition and come up with an alternative - within the Department's budget - to the \u20ac26 million cut to the respite care grant? I am of the view that it would be possible to make savings within the Department of Social Protection's budget by improving efficiencies.<\/p><p>  The Minister should provide the window of opportunity to which I refer in order that we might take the time to deal with this matter.  The provision in this regard will not kick in until the middle or the end of June.  Rather than dividing the House on this issue, all the Members should work together to arrive at a workable solution in respect of this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300020#S00200","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1355404500,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I will not rehearse what previous speakers stated.

We are all fed up listening to representatives of the Government speak about the budget.  Those to whom I refer stated - prior to its introduction - that the budget would be tough but fair and they continue to say this.  As the Minister is well aware, the budget is nothing like fair.  As previous speakers stated, if it had been the case that the Government had no choice but to make these draconian cuts, people would have faced up to the reality involved.  The truth is, however, that the Government had several options open to it.  For example, it could have increased the universal social charge or introduced a solidarity levy.  God knows we need solidarity now more than ever before and if we had introduced a 5% solidarity levy in respect of people with incomes in excess of \u20ac100,000 - in the context of the element of those incomes that is above that amount - we could have raised \u20ac320 million.<\/p><p>  I put it to the Minister that a majority of the Members of this House would favour a solidarity levy.  Such a levy was first mooted by a number of Fine Gael backbenchers last year - I believe they still support it - and I am of the view there is widespread support within the Labour Party and across the Opposition benches for such a measure.  A levy of this nature is necessary because we need those who are wealthy and who have been fairly well protected from the cold winds of the recession to show solidarity with people who are desperately badly off and really struggling.  If a solidarity levy had been introduced, it would have negated the need to bring forward any welfare cuts in the budget.  Unfortunately, the Government has chosen to hammer people on low and middle incomes.  That was a very definite choice that was made within Government.  As already stated, it had options.<\/p><p>  The Government could also have tackled the inequalities relating to the pensions regime.  Last year it stated that it would do so this year and now this year it is saying that it will perhaps take action next year.  That is just not good enough.  There is an obvious target in this regard, namely, making the pensions regime much fairer and thereby saving a considerable amount of money.  If the Government had done that this year - as should have been the case - it could have raised \u20ac250 million and there would not have been a need for any of these awful cuts which are going to place enormous pressure on the poorest people in our country.<\/p><p>  The Government had options.  In such circumstances, its members should stop saying that the budget is fair.  Will the Minister, the T\u00e1naiste and their ministerial colleagues please stop saying that they have protected the vulnerable?  They have not done so.  They had the option to do it.  They could have given effect to that aspiration but they did not do so.  They chose instead to leave those in the protected sectors - namely, those who are much better off - alone.  Again, these people will not be expected to contribute anything this year.  I am already on record as stating that this has something to do with the fact that the 12 or 15 people who drew up the budget behind closed doors are all in receipt of a minimum of \u20ac160,000 per year.<\/p><p>They are very much removed from the reality of life for so many families who are struggling.  Too often, the respite care grant is regarded as an optional extra for families.  For those caring for elderly people or people with disabilities, it enables them to meet the additional costs of providing care such as higher heating bills and the cost of special foods needed.  In many cases, it enables them to access the critical therapies required such as speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy, all of which have been run down by the Government.<\/p><p> This is a hard-hearted cut and reprehensible.  I do not see how anybody who promised the public that there would be fairness and owes his or her position here to the making of that promise can support a measure such as this.

Every Deputy who has spoken regards it as a very serious issue.  Some Deputies or their close family members have personal experience of this work and have described what I know to be the reality.  The committee could examine the range of supports supplied.  Some Deputies may not wish to hear what I am saying or take it into account, but the level of departmental expenditure this year to pay the weekly carer's payment, the weekly half-rate carer's payment and the respite care grant has increased by \u20ac20 million because we are paying more carers.  I have provided for an increase in total expenditure next year on carers.  In the clamour Members may not have appreciated how much was spent on carers.  I concur with Deputy Catherine Murphy that no matter how much money is spent on direct income supports - I refer to the earlier discussion on child care - the services provided are a critical factor.<\/p><p>  I refer to Deputy Denis Naughten's comment about the job to be undertaken by the committees of this House.  Various committees should consider the supports available for children such as those provided in schools and the therapies to which Deputy Catherine Murphy referred.  They should also consider the important issue of respite care for the person receiving care.  Some carers care for more than one adult or one child and they receive a double payment, which is a very important support for them.  We should look at all of these factors.  However, it must be borne in mind that citizens and taxpayers will be spending more than \u20ac20 billion on social welfare payments.  Some have suggested there is a lack of solidarity in society, but they are mistaken.  I suggest they compare social welfare payments here with those made in very wealthy countries.  Our weekly social welfare payments are very high relative to those made in more well-off countries.  What distinguishes Ireland from some of these wealthy countries is that our service provision is not as good.  <\/p><p>  My ministerial colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, will address the issue raised by Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly of the salaries paid and payments made to workers in the public service as part of a structured discussion.  I know many of those who work to provide the services on a professional basis, as opposed to carers who work at home, all my life.  They work around the clock and are always available.  Deputy Willie O'Dea will remember that the respite care grant was originally introduced to help carers to take a break on the premise that respite care was available for the person being cared for.  I accept that the grant is used and spent in a variety of ways, usually for the benefit of the person being cared for.  It is to be hoped carers will use it to take a break which would be very good for them.  Deputy John Halligan spoke about his sister whose situation is typical and familiar to us all.  She is helping to care for her parents at home and her dad is bedridden.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Stephen S.

While the balance and proportions of expenditure and taxes can be varied, the troika has set expenditure ceilings.  Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly has professional experience, having worked with the World Bank and the IMF, and will know that in countries in which expenditure ceilings are part of the package, they are not as flexible as implied.  Some variations are permitted, but total flexibility is not.  In fairness to my ministerial colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, he has worked with the troika such that the budget reflects the proposed reduction in the pension ceiling - a change I have advocated for a long time.  <\/p><p>  I refer to Deputy Brendan Ryan's detailed proposal, about which I will speak to the Minister for Finance.  It may be a matter for the finance committee and there is a job of work to be done.  Given the collapse of the country, the position is difficult.  We have to recover to enable us to have the social welfare system we all want.<\/p><p>If we do not see the other side of this programme and recover our financial sustainability, the people who will suffer most will be those dependent on the social welfare system.<\/p><p> Deputy Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh has given as an example a widow with three children, one of whom has special needs.  She sent the Deputy an e-mail.  A widow who is a carer would receive a weekly widow's pension and half-rate carer's allowance.  These benefits, with some others, amount to over \u20ac18,000 per year.  If the individual has two children in addition to the child who requires care, as the Deputy suggested, this will result in payment of a further \u20ac60 per week.  Of course, a monthly child benefit payment will also be received.  If the Deputy gives me the details of the case in question, we can check the position for him.  With regard to respite care, the recipient will be receiving \u20ac1,375 next year for the child who requires care.<\/p><p> The Irish carer's package is unique by comparison with packages in the rest of Europe.  Very few other European countries have a carer's package like ours, but there is a weakness in the provision of services.  Deputy Johnathan O'Brien will know this, given the position of his father.  If we are to have a discussion on this issue, which I welcome, we should examine holistically how we can have good value services available to those who provide care.

Such a couple earning up to \u20ac60,000 per year can still qualify for the minimum rate of carer's allowance.  The Deputy did not mention that carers who work fewer than 15 hours a week have no means test in regard to the respite care grant.  That is why the grant is the only payment made to some people.  It is because their income is above the level required for the general means test.  I refer to the disregards for carers.  For the most part, the individuals in question have a significant income.  Nonetheless, the State, in recognition of the care work they do, pays a respite care grant to over 6,000 people in respect of whom there is no means test.  That, again, is a very positive feature of the system.

It is unfair and lacks compassion, particularly in the case of the Minister's Department.  It punishes the poor, carers in particular, through the reduction of the carer's grant.  Carers believe they are a burden on the State because of the reduction in the fund.  They should be looked upon as a very special resource - people who have the skills and the time and who make sacrifices on an individual basis to give love and provide care and attention for their families and others within their communities.  Instead of reducing the carer's grant, we should be acknowledging the contribution they make.  We should also acknowledge that they are not a burden on the State, but rather that they make a generous contribution to the health and welfare of others.

These amendments and the related Schedules are designed to provide for measures which will allow the Central Bank of Ireland greater capacity to co-operate with its counterparts in other countries.  Specifically, these amendments, where enacted, permit the Central Bank to sign the International Organization of Securities Commissions', IOSCO's, multilateral memorandum of understanding, MMOU, by the end of this year.  In light of the pressing end of year timeline for signing the MMOU, it has been necessary to make these amendments as part of the Bill.  <\/p><p>  The purpose of the MMOU is to allow the Central Bank to co-operate and share information with other regulators, including other securities commissions around the world, in accordance with international best practice.  The provisions being inserted into this Bill are currently part of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011.  Colleagues will be aware that Bill is slowly wending its way through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  To cut to the chase, we are including the area contained in that Bill in this Bill because of the timeline by which we must sign the MMOU- by the end of the year.  If we had to wait until the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill, which is due for Committee Stage in January 2013, we would miss the end of year deadline for signing the MMOU.<\/p><p>  The IOSCO organisation is an international group of regulators, of which the Central Bank is a member on behalf of this country.  One of its key functions is to control and provide information to different members on international fraud.  The Central Bank of Ireland, as regulator and a member of IOSCO, requested the Government to allow it sign the memorandum and this is the reason we are bringing in section 4.  Lest colleagues are concerned this might be some kind of movement two minutes from midnight, that is not the case.  The case is we were asked to do this and are bringing it forward from the Bill that is currently only approaching Committee Stage.<\/p><p>  These amendments were made in the Seanad and the changes envisaged include enacting section 53 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill so that the Central Bank may use its powers on behalf of overseas regulators; enhancing and consolidating authorised officer provisions; and provisions for guarding the Central Bank confidentiality regime.  Given that these amendments are not related to credit unions, it was also necessary to amend the Short and Long Titles of the Bill to accommodate them.  I would like to emphasise that the expeditious passage of the Credit Union Bill through the House is necessary to allow the \u20ac250 million to be contributed to the credit union fund by the end of this year, as there is no scope in the 2013 figures for this to be done after the end of this year.  This money is essential for the restructuring process to get under way.<\/p><p>  These amendments deal with a number of new sections we wish to include to deal with allowing Ireland to extend its membership of IOSCO.  I believe the Central Bank would highlight some of the important benefits of membership if it had an opportunity to do so.  In the circumstance where there is international fraud or an allegation of fraud through securities, for example, it should be open to member states of the organisation to pass information freely to other member states.  Having this memorandum in place will have benefits for Ireland, as a signatory to the agreement, in terms of governance and international regulation.  I commend this group of amendments to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300029#CC00700","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1355409000,"counter":662,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comments on the amendments.

We are at the final stage of the debate on it.  I want to commend the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, for the way he has engaged with the Opposition on the legislation from the start.  I also commend the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, who was involved in part of the discussion on Committee Stage.  It is fair to say that at all stages of the legislative process the Minister listened to the concerns of the Opposition about the effect the legislation might have on the credit union movement and all parts of the sector, especially smaller credit unions.  I am glad that he introduced amendments in the Seanad after listening to us.  Almost 180 amendments are being presented in the House today.  It is clear that Sinn F\u00e9in would have liked further changes to be made to the Bill and we continue to have concerns about some aspects of it.  We will stay in touch with the credit union movement at national and local level and I hope we will not have to return to the issue, but we will do so, if necessary.  I am satisfied with the engagement that has happened.  It is an example of the true engagement we should have when we are dealing with legislation.  I do not want to hark back to what happened earlier other than to say that was not the way to deal with legislation.  In fairness to the Minister, he commended me and other Members of the House for introducing practical suggestions.  It is clear from the many amendments before the House that our concerns were listened to and I hope we will continue to see that spirit in 2013.  I welcome that engagement.

This has been a model exercise in how the Oireachtas should work.  Organisations representing the credit union movement made their views known about the Bill initially proposed by the Government.  Representatives of various parties listened to those concerns and brought them to the attention of the Government which took action to change the Bill as a result.  That is how democracy should work.  I would be interested to hear detailed explanations of some of the formulations proposed by the Government, as there may be some issues that we would still like to raise.  In general, the Government has engaged genuinely with the Opposition on this matter and listened to the concerns of the credit union movement.  The Bill has been improved substantially as a result.  Like Deputy Pearse Doherty, I cannot help wishing the Government had engaged with the public and the Opposition on other matters, some of which we discussed earlier today and in the last week, in the same way.  If it had done so, it would have enhanced the credibility of the House and politics generally to a great degree.

When this issue was brought to our attention during the Seanad debate which I attended, the fundamental question I asked was related to when this was brought to our attention.  I appreciate the constructive remarks the Deputies have made.  This is important because a watchlist of countries that have not signed the memorandum of understanding will be circulated by the International Organization of Securities Commissions by the end of the year.  We did not want this country to be highlighted for not having signed the memorandum of understanding when other countries had done so.  This net issue was part of the original Central Bank Bill which would have been passed.  That is why we have brought it forward.  I should have sent a note to my colleagues on the other side of the House when this issue was brought to the attention of the Seanad.  I should apologise to the House for this, as it was my responsibility.  I note the Deputies' comments that they have no difficulty with the signing of the memorandum of understanding.  It is important for this country not be on some kind of blacklist of non-signatory countries as we move into next year.  I appreciate the Deputies' remarks in that regard.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who ostensibly dealt with the Bill on Second and Committee Stages before I became involved gave a commitment in advance of Report Stage that he would respond in the Seanad to a range of amendments the Members opposite had introduced and teased out at the select committee.  He was true to his word in considering these amendments which we have tried to reflect as far as we can in the body of amendments being introduced today.  The reason it is imperative for this legislation to get over the line before the end of the year relates to the provision of half of the \u20ac250 million required for the restructuring of the credit union movement.  The rest of the money will be put up through levies within the organisation.  That is why it is important for this work to be done by the end of the year.  We had a very fruitful discussion in the Seanad with the Members of that House about many of the ideas championed by my colleagues on the other side of this House.  As we go through the amendments, I hope the Deputies in question will see how their ideas are being put into law as a result of the changes made in the Seanad.<\/p><p>  Deputy Michael McGrath asked a specific question about the definition, with which amendment No. 5 deals.

That will be highlighted when we reach the amendment in question.  This will have an effect on what happens in the future.

The latter deals with the policies, procedures and practices a credit union must have in place to ensure it is compliant with requirements imposed on it.  For example, the Central Bank may make regulations imposing liquidity requirements on credit unions under section 30 of the Bill.

The amendment allows the Central Bank to make regulations prescribing the operational practices, policies and procedures to be adopted by the credit unions more generally.  These may include requiring credit unions to adopt monitoring procedures to ensure the 20% liquidity requirement is complied with.  Regulations may also require credit unions to ensure people involved in monitoring liquidity have an understanding of the calculation of liquidity and maturity mismatches.

Not only is it important to include it in the Bill but I urge the credit unions, as did the Minister of State, to come forward with their proposals so that we can look at them and thereby take this suggestion seriously.  It seems as if some of the desperately needed investment funds we would all like to see made available to invest in employment-rich and socially valuable projects are being offered to us by an organisation whose members have the best interests of this country at heart.

This would state the kind of investments envisaged, would point out that the credit unions had wanted the measure and note that it has been enshrined into law in terms as clear as day.  It can ask them what their proposals are, ranging from small, medium and large packages.

There is an opportunity here to do something imaginative.  Although this section is all about ensuring that credit unions use their investments with judgment and common sense, there must be a recognition that where public projects arise that could have a mutual benefit for credit union members in communities known to credit unions, it makes sense to invest in them, having regard to any potential risks.  The way we approached this in the amendment was to give power to the Central Bank to bring forward the regulations.  This seemed to get over the legal hurdle that had been present up to the point when we had our discussions with the Office of the Attorney General.  There is nothing to stop the Department of Finance, with other Departments, as Deputy Doherty suggested, bringing forward ideas and proposals or a scheme of ideas, in tandem with the regulations the Central Bank will make.  This is positive because it is about delivering for an entire community.  Such a community also looks to the future as to where its investments can best lie and how community benefit can best be obtained.  They are the people who know best, and that can be tempered by a standard form of regulation which the Central Bank can stand over.  I believe we are all in agreement on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300033#GG00500","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355410800,"counter":764,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355410800,"counter":765,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 32:Section 12: In page 15, lines 38 and 39, to delete &#8220;appropriate&#8221; and substitute &#8220;necessary&#8221;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355410800,"counter":766,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355410800,"counter":767,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 33:Section 15: In page 19, to delete lines 1 to 5 and substitute the following:\r\n\r\n&#8220;(6) The board of directors of a credit union shall be elected&#8212;\r\n\r\n(a) where the organisation meeting occurs after the commencement of this provision (as amended by section 15 of the Credit Union Act 2012), by secret ballot at the organisation meeting and, subject to subsection (15) and section 57, subsequent vacancies on the board of directors shall be filled by secret ballot at an annual general meeting, and\r\n\r\n(b) in any other case, by secret ballot at the annual general meeting first occurring after the commencement of this provision (as amended by section 15 of the Credit Union Act 2012) or, if earlier than that annual general meeting, at a special general meeting called for the purpose of such ballot and, subject to subsection (15) and section 57, subsequent vacancies on the board of directors shall be filled by secret ballot at an annual general meeting.&#8221;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355410800,"counter":768,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 33, made in the Seanad, makes provision for the election of the board of directors at the first annual general meeting or special general meeting called after the organisation meeting of a new credit union.

A number of amendments were made on Committee Stage in the Seanad which relate to eligibility for membership of boards of directors and which arose as a result of constructive debates with Deputies and Senators in both Houses in recent weeks.  The effect of these amendments will be to reduce the exclusions that would apply to members of boards.  There was a great deal of discussion in respect of this matter on Committee Stage and Report Stage in the D\u00e1il and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, gave a guarantee to the effect that he would introduce amendments.  These are the amendments before the House.  I accept that not everyone will be satisfied with them but we have gone as far as possible.<\/p><p><br \/>  Amendment No. 35 allows volunteers from a credit union, as well as a member of the board oversight committee of such a credit union, to serve on the board of another credit union.  That is the first substantial change and it means that if a person is a volunteer with one credit union, he or she can serve on the board of another.  That was the first exclusion we overturned.<\/p><p><br \/>  Amendment No. 36 removes the prohibition under which family members of volunteers on credit unions may not becoming directors.  This was the second exclusion, under which, if a person was a volunteer in a credit union, he or she was excluded from serving on the board.  The Minister stated that he would introduce an amendment in this regard and he has done so.  This amendment also removes the express exclusion of members who have been in arrears on their repayments for more than 90 days.  Instead, it provides that credit union rules should deal with the eligibility of such members.<\/p><p><br \/>  Amendment No. 174 follows on from amendment No. 36 and provides that the rules of a credit union must set out how it will deal with a member of the board of directors or board oversight committee who is in arrears of more than 90 days, up to and including suspension or removal of that member.<\/p><p><br \/>  Amendments Nos. 95 to 111, inclusive, and 113 relate to exclusions from the board oversight committee.  There was much constructive debate in the D\u00e1il and Seanad in respect of the eligibility for membership of board oversight committees.  A number of amendments were proposed in respect of section 53(10) in the context of changes to the exclusions from boards of directors.  These amendments were proposed in order to ensure consistency between boards and board oversight committees.  Their effect will be to reduce the number of exclusions that would have applied in respect of membership of board oversight committees.<\/p><p><br \/>  Amendment No. 95 allows volunteers from other credit unions to be on the board oversight committee of a credit union.  This matter arose on foot of Committee Stage proceedings in the D\u00e1il.  Amendment No. 106 removes the prohibition on family members of the credit union becoming members of the board oversight committee.  Amendment No. 96 allows a director of another credit union to become a board oversight committee member.  Amendment No. 108 clarifies that a member of the board oversight committee of the credit union cannot also sit on the board of directors of the same credit union.  Amendment No. 104 makes a change to the exclusion of auditors from the board oversight committee.  This exclusion will now include a person employed or engaged by that auditor and is designed to guard against any conflict of interest in the context of a person's having worked in other credit unions or possessing information about what is occurring in another credit union.  Amendment No. 109 deletes section 76N(4)(<i>q<\/i>) in line with the changes for exclusion from board membership.  Amendment No. 110 ensures that where a committee member falls under any exclusion provisions, he or she should resign from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300034#HH01000","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1355411400,"counter":783,"content":"<p>I take this opportunity to acknowledge the fact that this section has been changed to a substantial degree.  There is no doubt about that.  Consequently, many of the concerns that were voiced have been met.  However, there is an issue outstanding in respect of the voluntary aspect.  I will not rehash the debates in which we have engaged on this matter.  We will monitor what occurs and if difficulties arise, we will return to this matter either in the form of a Topical Issue Debate or on Private Members' business.  I encourage the Minister of State and the Department to monitor this provision in order to gauge its effect.  I understand what the Minister and Minister of State have been saying during the debates on the Bill in the context of ensuring that we have the best governance.  However, we must also ensure that the latter does not impact in a negative way on the sector and, in particular, on smaller credit unions.<\/p><p>  The second matter about which I am concerned relates to the exclusion of a staff member of a credit union from serving on the board of another credit union.  There was a way to do this in the context of the conflict of interest provisions.  Again, I will not revisit the debate on this matter.  What I will say is that those who are voluntary assistants within credit unions or who serve on boards of directors may obtain employment in other credit unions as a result of the experience they have gained.  The Bill will have the unintended consequence of forcing such people into making a choice between their job and their position on the board of directors.  Such individuals or their parents may have been involved in the founding of the credit union in question and they will not be placed in a nice position.  Cases of this nature may be few and far between but we should not put anyone in the position to which I refer.  I accept, however, that it is too late to tweak the provision but perhaps we can revisit the matter in the future.<\/p><p>  I strongly support the other amendments that have been put forward in this regard.  I refer, in particular, to amendment No. 36, which relates to circumstances in which a person is in arrears and will be excluded from the board of directors as a result.  As I pointed out on Committee Stage, such members should be forced to resign with immediate effect.  It is very important that this will now be the case.  I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward this amendment.<\/p><p>  This is the only part of the Bill to which I am strongly opposed.  Amendment No. 35 is actually better then the provision contained in the Bill, but it does not go far enough.  That is why I wish to place on record the fact that I remain opposed to the relevant exclusions.  I ask the Minister of State to monitor the position with regard to voluntary assistants and to give particular consideration to the provision under which a person will be asked to choose between his or her job and his or her membership of the board of directors.<\/p><p>  My final point relates to amendment No. 124, which is in a later group.  That amendment is relevant to the matter under discussion because it deals with the exemption clause I suggested on Committee Stage and in respect of which I tabled an amendment on Report Stage.  The Minister for Finance signalled that he was open to such a clause.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 124 deals with that issue to a certain degree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300034#HH01100","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355412000,"counter":785,"content":"<p>The length of service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300035#JJ00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1355412000,"counter":786,"content":"<p>It allows for the Central Bank asking the credit union to appoint an additional person and the term limits are waived.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300035#JJ00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1355412000,"counter":787,"content":"<p>Yes, if they can find someone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300035#JJ00400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1355412000,"counter":788,"content":"<p>It deals with the term limits issue in one way.

We need to arrive at the correct balance.  The next group of amendments deals with the term limit - 12 years out of 15.  I made the point yesterday on Report Stage in the Seanad that it was only when the Bill was passed by both Houses and became law that all these sections would apply.  For example, a person may have served for 30 years, but he or she will only be appointed as a director next year.  The Bill will be another transition for the credit union movement and it is certain this issue will be considered again in the next few years.  I understand the point made by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  The next group of amendments provides that the Central Bank is empowered to put to one side the exclusion if a credit union cannot find people because of the term limit.  The Deputy has argued dthat the same should apply to  volunteer and employees.  I understand the logic of his argument.  When this new regime and the transition period begin, we may need to look at any problems with the exclusion of volunteers.  Beginning with the report of the commission, there has been an argument that this distinction is needed to ensure potential conflicts of interest are minimised and that the best governance system will be in place for all credit unions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300035#JJ00800","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355412000,"counter":792,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355412000,"counter":793,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 36:Section 15: In page 20, to delete lines 16 to 28 and substitute the following:&#8220;(m) a person who is a spouse or civil partner, parent, sibling or child of a director, board oversight committee member or employee of that credit union.&#8221;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355412000,"counter":794,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355412000,"counter":795,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 37:Section 15: In page 20, to delete lines 32 to 49 and in page 21, to delete line 1.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355412000,"counter":796,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355412000,"counter":797,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 38:Section 15: In page 21, line 2, to delete &#8220;(14) A member of&#8221; and substitute &#8220;(12) A member of&#8221;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355412000,"counter":798,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355412000,"counter":799,"content":"<p>Seanad amendments Nos. 39, 41, 64, 66, 112 and 124 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300035#JJ01550","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355412000,"counter":800,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 39:Section 15:In page 21, line 4, to delete &#8220;9 years&#8221; and substitute &#8220;12 years&#8221;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355412000,"counter":801,"content":"<p>I tabled a number of amendments on Committee Stage in the Seanad to increase the term limits of members of the board of directors.  This arose from discussion with colleagues opposite on Committee and Report Stages in this House.  On Report Stage the Minister for Finance had stated he intended to bring forward an amendment, following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, to change the term limits to 12 years in aggregate in a 15 year period.  This commitment is now reflected by the amendments made in the Seanad which strike an appropriate balance between promoting board rotation and protecting the volunteer ethos of credit unions.  Seanad amendment No. 66 is consequential on this amendment to increase the term limits from nine to 12 years.  Seanad amendment No. 64 increases the maximum consecutive term for the chairman from three years to four.  The term of office of the chairman is for a period of one year.  Currently, a chairman is not permitted to serve more than three consecutive terms in that post.  The Minister agreed on Committee Stage to increase the maximum consecutive term for the chairman from three years to four.  This will ensure continuity in the board.  However, it will also be one of the responsibilities of the nomination committee to ensure board continuity.  Seanad amendment No. 124 permits the Central Bank to appoint a director, even where that person may have exceeded the limit.  This is the point made by Deputy Pearse Doherty when speaking on the previous group of amendments.  The bank can give a credit union the power to appoint someone, even if that person is beyond the term limit.<\/p><p>  In the course of the debate on Committee Stage and again in the Seanad a discussion ensued on a waiving of the term limits in exceptional circumstances.  The Minister undertook to examine this proposal.  The issue to be addressed is whether the term limits could result in a credit union being unable to attract enough suitable directors.  The Bill already provides that the Central Bank can require a credit union to nominate additional directors where the board is lacking in skills or expertise.  The director so nominated must be approved by the Central Bank.  The Bill has been amended in order that the time served as an additional director in these circumstances is not reckoned for the purposes of the term limit.  This means a director who has already served his or her 12 years in a15 year period could still be appointed to the board, but only in these exceptional circumstances, if there is a deficiency in expertise and agreed to by the Central Bank.  This addresses the concern raised without undermining the core principle of the Bill on term limits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300035#JJ01800","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1355412000,"counter":802,"content":"<p>This is reasonable.

If term limits are considered so important for credit unions, why are they not imposed on banks, for example?

The credit union movement is a democratic movement.  In the same way that this institution, a democratic one, does not have term limits, credit unions should not have any either.  The issues is dealt with and we lost the debate but I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has extended the term limits.  I welcome the exclusion, waiver or whatever the Minister of State wants to call it that I suggested on Committee Stage and furnished on Report Stage.  It is basically encompassed in amendment No. 124, which deals with the term limits.  The provision is not as strong as I would have liked.  It refers to an additional director.  I am not sure about this because I obviously have not been on the board of directors of a credit union.<\/p><p>  Consider the circumstances if we add up the exclusions that exist in terms of voluntary assistance, employees of other credit unions and account for the real and necessary requirements we place on directors of credit unions to be fit for purpose and have knowledge and experience.  In a small credit union, one could limit the pool; therefore, this is a question of additional directors and not about circumstnaces where a credit union cannot fill its complement.  Scope is provided to allow that to happen.  I hope the procedure will not be cumbersome.  Under section 90, the review must be carried out by the Central Bank.  One must go to the credit union nomination committee to suggest a director one feels would be fit for purpose.  The bank must agree that and then the director is appointed for the period up to the next AGM.  After an AGM, the procedure could take nine months, after which the director may only be in office for three months before leaving.  The provision is really to ensure that the board does not lose experience and will have the necessary experience to carry out its functions properly.  I am a little bit concerned but perhaps my concern is ill founded.  The Central Bank will obviously have to work out the procedure.  I want to ensure the process is not cumbersome.<\/p><p>  The legislation does address my concerns in regard to the points on directors.  We could have given full discretion to the Central Bank in respect of a voluntary member of staff or a member of staff from another credit union.  I can understand the conflict that the Minister of State talked about in regard to a staff member of one credit union being a director of another, and the need for one to be fully aware of the books and all the various project.  If the section encompassed this, it would be up to the Central Bank to determine whether the employee of a given credit union would have a conflict of interest if he or she were a director of another.  The amendment would be very safe.  We cannot do anything about this at this stage but we could and should have examined it.  Perhaps we will do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300036#KK00500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1355412600,"counter":808,"content":"<p>We all share the common goal of ensuring that credit unions have the requisite number of staff with suitable qualifications and skills required to the job they are being asked to do.  Deputy Doherty made a fair point in asking whether we are now accepting a pretty cumbersome set of circumstances whereby, if a credit union found it did not have the correct range of skills required on its board, it would make an application to the Central Bank, which would decide on the position, after which a name would come forward that the bank would have to sanction.  If this applies, it is because the credit union makes the application to the Central Bank on the basis that it feels it does not have the requisite number of people to serve the purpose in question because of a lack of skills or expertise.  This gives the credit union the power to make the first move.  However, Deputy Doherty's point is important in that it is a question of what happens next.  This issue is one that the Central Bank needs to be mindful of in circumstances where it is trying to expedite an application on behalf of the credit union.  Certainly, any help that the Department of Finance can bring to bear on the bank to speed up the process and putting in place a code of practice in this regard would make sense.<\/p><p>  On the remarks made by Deputy Boyd Barrett, there have been many investigations into banking but we have not had a commission yet.

Issues arose during the debate in the D\u00e1il about the procedure for the suspension and removal of directors, particularly in relation to the directors concerned being provided with written notification of the board oversight committee's reasons for taking action under this section.  The Minister, on both Committee and Report Stages in this House, indicated his willingness to look again at these provisions and the amendment reflects the changes necessary in order to address the concerns raised by colleagues in the D\u00e1il.  The amendment brings the procedure for the removal of a director at a special general meeting convened under this section into line with that for the removal of a director from office by members of a credit union which is set out in section 56 of the 1997 Act, thereby ensuring greater procedural consistency from one Act to the next.  Under this section, the board oversight committee can suspend a director where it considers that a member has taken an action or decision which is not in accordance with Part IV of the 1997 Act.<\/p><p>  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett proposed an amendment on Committee Stage in the D\u00e1il which was accepted by the Minister and provides that the board oversight committee is required to give written notice to the director setting out the reasons for its decisions before suspending the director or convening a special general meeting of the credit union to consider whether to remove the director.  Where a director is suspended by the board oversight committee under this section, the suspension takes effect immediately and if that director does not resign within seven days of being suspended, the committee shall convene a special general meeting to review the suspension and consider whether to remove the director.  At a special general meeting convened in accordance with this section the members may ratify the suspension, rescind it or remove the director from office.  The amendment provides, in a similar manner to section 56 of the 1997 Act, that a director is entitled to written notice of a special general meeting to be held under this section not less than 21 days in advance of the meeting.  The amendment also sets out the procedure for the director in question to make written representations in advance of a special general meeting and that the director has the right to be heard orally at such a meeting.  The Minister is confident that the amendment addresses the concerns raised by Deputies in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300037#LL05100","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1355413200,"counter":887,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for accepting the amendment.

This directive, known informally as the gender goods and services directive, implements the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services.  In its decision of 1 March 2011, in case C-236\/09 taken by a Belgian consumer rights organisation, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared that Article 5(2) of this directive was invalid, with effect from 21 December 2012.  This decision, known as the Test-Achats ruling, is binding on all member states of the European Union.  The provision thus struck down had allowed an exception from the principle of equal treatment enunciated in the regulation so that insurance companies could price life and motor insurance products differently for men and women, where this difference is reasonable and supported by actuarial or statistical data.<\/p><p>Ireland availed of this exemption in the Equal Status Act 2000, permitting gender differentiation to continue in the areas of motor insurance, life assurance, critical illness cover, income protection cover, and private annuities and pensions.  The effect of the ruling is that Ireland is obliged to prohibit by law the selling of private insurance products which differentiate by gender on price or benefits and to have such provisions in force on or before 21 December 2012.  The unisex rule will apply to all contracts concluded for the first time as and from that date.  It also applies to agreements between parties, as and from 21 December 2012, to extend contracts concluded before that date which would otherwise have expired.<\/p><p>The European Commission has issued guidelines on the application of this judgment on national legislation transposing directive 2004\/113 and on insurance industry practice.  I have taken due regard to this guidance and to the intention stated in the directive to avoid sudden readjustment of the insurance market in determining the amendments to the Equal Status Acts necessary to comply with this ruling.  As I will explain shortly, these amendments are largely technical in nature.  For me and for my colleagues in Government, this ruling highlights the crucial importance of achieving legal clarity in the drafting of legislation at European level to ensure that such instruments are interpreted and have the intended impact.<\/p><p>The Government is conscious of the potential for confusion and misinformation among consumers and insurance providers alike resulting from these changes to the private insurance market.  For this reason, in October the Department published an information note for consumers on the new rules on the permitted use of gender by insurance providers and sources of further information and advice.  The information note is widely available through public information channels such as the Citizens Information Board.  I would like to express thanks to the industry bodies - the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Brokers Association, the Professional Insurance Brokers Association and the Society of Actuaries in Ireland - who contributed to the preparation of this advice for consumers.  I also thank the Department of Finance, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Social Protection, the Central Bank, the National Consumer Agency, the Citizens' Information Board, the Pensions Board, the Equality Authority and the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau.<\/p><p>I would now like to highlight some of the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for amendment of section 5 of the Equal Status Act 2000.  It limits the existing derogation from the prohibition on gender discrimination in specified insurance products, provided in section 5 of the Equal Status Act, to contracts concluded before 21 December 2012.  This is to ensure the prohibition on gender-differentiated insurance, with effect from 21 December 2012, does not affect existing contracts lawfully entered into before that date.  The scope of the prohibition is then expanded by providing in a new subsection (4A) that all contracts within the categories of motor or life insurance concluded for the first time as and from 21 December 2012 must comply with the unisex rule.  For the avoidance of doubt and because to determine otherwise would result in a sudden readjustment of the motor insurance market, contrary to the intention of the directive, the second paragraph of the new subsection provides that mid-term adjustments to motor insurance contracts concluded before 21 December 2012 are not considered to be new contracts for this purpose.<\/p><p>Finally, this section provides that the obligation imposed on the Central Bank of Ireland to compile, maintain and publish data to support the existing derogation ceases to have effect from 21 December 2012, while not affecting its obligation to maintain and publish data compiled before that date.  Consequential to the cessation of this obligation, section 5 provides for the amendment of section 41 of the principal Act.  It has the effect of terminating the Minister's power, which is no longer required, to make regulations with regard to the data to be compiled, published and maintained by the Central Bank.<\/p><p>Section 3 provides for amendment of section 14 of the principal Act to clarify that insurance providers may continue to collect, store and use gender status or gender-related information which is genuinely intended for the purposes of reserving and internal pricing, reinsurance pricing, and life and health underwriting.  For example, it is envisaged that insurance providers may continue to gather and use gender data in connection with offering gender-specific insurance products and options within contracts to cover conditions which exclusively or primarily concern males or females, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer.<\/p><p>I have also taken the opportunity afforded in this Bill to address a minor procedural issue regarding equal status complaints referred to the Equality Tribunal for mediation.  Section 4 provides for amendment of section 24 of the Equal Status Acts to extend the time available to persons who have referred such complaints to apply for resumption of the hearing in instances where mediation has not resolved the dispute between the parties.  The amendment will extend the period, after the issue of a notice of non-resolution, within which a complainant is allowed to make an application in writing for a resumption of the hearing, from 28 days to 42 days.  This amendment applies the same conditions to complaints under the Equal Status Acts on failure of mediation as are already applicable to resumption of complaints under the Employment Equality Acts.  The remaining provisions are of a standard or technical nature.<\/p><p>Before concluding, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the technical nature of these amendments, while reiterating that the State has no option but to ensure national law complies with the European Court of Justice interpretation of the gender goods and services directive in this instance.  I thank the Members of the House for their attention and I look forward to a detailed discussion on the Bill.  I commend this Bill to the House.<\/p><p>Deputy Niall Collins: Fianna F\u00e1il supports this Bill.<\/p><p>Deputy Kathleen Lynch: Sorry to interrupt, but I wish to apologise for not having a copy of what was a very technical speech available for the Deputies.<\/p><p>Deputy Niall Collins: That is fine.  I thank the Minister of State.  We accept that we have to amend our legislation because the derogation period is coming to an end.  On that basis, we understand where the Minister of State is coming from.  We are supporting the Bill.  We do not have any particular issue with it.<\/p><p>When the Equal Status Act 2000 was introduced, it was a ground-breaking measure.  Its effects on people's participation in civil society were felt throughout the country.  It was right that so many sections of society, including religious and political organisations, had to ensure they offered a level playing field to both genders.  It was important that many clubs and associations in this country experienced a mini-revolution when they had to rewrite their constitutions and go about their business differently.  It went a long way towards promoting a greater mix and a greater balance with regard to the participation of women in organisations.  Unfortunately, there were one or two high-profile instances of organisations in Dublin not abiding by the new law.  One particularly high-profile golf club refused to amend its rules to allow women to become full members.  It was regrettable that they did not comply with the spirit of the legislation.  Neither I nor my party would subscribe to the notion of having exclusive men-only organisations in a modern society.<\/p><p>Perhaps we should review the complete effectiveness of the Equal Status Act 2000 by carrying out an audit, in so far as possible, of how it is being complied with by organisations throughout the country.  That could be done in many ways.  Our local authorities, for example, have a substantial active database of all community and voluntary organisations, including sports clubs and non-sporting organisations.  If we could audit and monitor the level of compliance with the 2000 Act and the impact it has had, it would be a worthwhile exercise as it would be something we could refer to in time.  If that is done, I am sure it will find that the legislation in question has had a very positive effect on the promotion of gender balance and a greater mix of participation by both genders.<\/p><p>One of the major concerns associated with the Bill before is that it will lead to an increase in the premiums to be paid across a number of insurance policies.  I suppose the week after the budget is probably a bad week to discuss another increased bill that households will have to face.  Given that the derogation will cease on 21 December next and will not apply to new insurance policies written after that date, it is unfortunate that so many insurance premiums are renewed in early January.  The timing of this measure is particularly cruel because it means that many people will face increased insurance premiums late this year and early in the new year.  In that context, I would like to know whether any regulatory impact assessment was carried out by the Department.  Was that possible?  If so, was it published?  It might serve to inform the public.<\/p><p>The final issue I would like to raise with regard to this Bill relates to the financial services industry.  Many of the organisations that underwrite this business are banks.  As we know, some banks are involved in insurance as well as banking.  Insurance is one of the many aspects of their financial services activity.  We will have to keep an eye on how they treat the application of this change in the legislation.  We must ensure they do not use it as an excuse to hike up premiums further than the actuarial people tell them they need to do.  In other words, they must not use it as an opportunity to try to grow their capital bases further, or engage in another capital-gathering exercise.  People are being squeezed by the banks on many fronts.  This should not be viewed by the banks as an opportunity to squeeze the consumer a bit more.  Consumers are being absolutely squeezed dry.  The Financial Regulator and the Central Bank should have a role in ensuring the banks do not engage in opportunism.  Unfortunately, we have learned to our detriment from our experience that the banks will take every opportunity possible to add a greater margin to the margins they are already squeezing out of people with the other products they are selling.  Did we get the observations of the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau of Ireland as part of the regulatory impact assessment?  Did that office make any input during the drafting of the legislation?  Has the Department had any particular interaction with the ombudsman in that regard?<\/p><p>Deputy Sandra McLellan: As this is a very technical Bill, I will not take up too much time.  This Bill has had to be introduced on foot of the ruling by the European Court of Justice that the derogation in the EU gender directive that allows gender to be used as a risk factor in determining insurance costs is illegal.  While we are on the matter of European courts, I would like to mention briefly that it is a shame the Government does not seem to hold the European Court of Human Rights in the same regard.  I assume that is why it has not legislated for the X case as required by the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of A, B and C v. Ireland.  There is a point to be made here about the role of statistical evidence about risk factors when the price of insurance is being determined.  Insurance premiums are based on risk factors.  In general, women receive lower premiums as there is a lower risk attached to them.  Geographical location is a further risk assessment factor.  Insurance costs are much higher in some parts of the country than in others because a higher proportion of road traffic accidents takes place in such locations.  My concern about this Bill is that it will not result in lower insurance premiums for male drivers, but higher premiums for female drivers.  While it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of gender, I am aware of some insurance companies in Britain that have introduced interesting initiatives to ensure women are not unfairly penalised in their insurance claims.  Some insurance companies in Britain are offering discounts for young driver schemes, as well as safe driver schemes in which premiums are reduced for both genders where there is a demonstrable record of safety over a period of time.  I hope insurance companies here will do the same.<\/p><p>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Kathleen Lynch): I thank both Deputies.  I assure Deputy Niall Collins that there was extensive consultation with the entire insurance industry, as well as with the Departments of Finance, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Social Protection, the Central Bank, the National Consumer Agency, the Citizens Information Board, the Pensions Board, the Equality Authority and the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau of Ireland.  The level of consultation was quite significant.  People will always say there could have been additional consultation, but in this case I do not think that would have been possible.  Anyone who was seen to be a stakeholder in this sector, including the consumer, was consulted.<\/p><p>As we all know, this measure has resulted from a case that was successfully taken at the European courts by a consumer group in Belgium.  I know people are very conscious of what others pay for their insurance.  We tend to know what is being paid.  I appreciate what Deputy Collins said about the mortgage protection, income protection and life assurance products offered by banks.  This Bill will not affect life assurance unless it is to be taken out after 21 December next and is therefore considered to be an ongoing contract rather than a new contract.<\/p><p>(Speaker Continuing)<\/p><p>&#91; Deputy Kathleen Lynch: &#93; Where the major impact will be felt is in regard to new car insurance after 21 December.<\/p><p>Equality is a funny thing.  As a woman, I see how it will affect women but, on the other hand, as Deputy McLellan rightly said, if we take out the gender issue, insurance companies will surely be able to take account of the fact that someone is a safer driver, as they have done in the past.  No matter what gender they were, in the past unsafe drivers would see their insurance costs rise if they were involved in crashes.  It is this type of detail that will be necessary.<\/p><p>Equality is a funny thing.

No matter what the gender was, in the past an unsafe driver would see their insurance cost rise if they had a crash.  It is this type of detail that will be necessary.<\/p><p>While I hate to say the following, it is a fact.  People taking out insurance products, whether from a bank, a broker or directly from an insurance company would be wise to get at least three quotes.  Just because a person is getting a mortgage from a particular lender does not mean the person must take insurance from that lender.  Sometimes people do not realise this or forget it, and while there can be a degree of pressure, customers should resist it.<\/p><p>Comprehensive and detailed information leaflets are available both on the Department's website and on the website of the Citizens' Information Bureau.  These have been available on the Internet for some time because we knew this was coming, and all the information the average citizen will need is available.<\/p><p>This is a brief but significant Bill that will have an impact on people's lives in the future.  I hope those in the insurance industry will be sensible and take into account that someone is a safe driver, whether male or female.<\/p><p>I thank the two Deputies.  It is late on a Thursday evening and I know what it is like to have to stay when the D\u00e1il sits late.<\/p><p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p><p>Bill reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Olivia Mitchell): The Bill will now be sent to the Seanad.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: I raise this issue in the context of the various cutbacks and adjustments that have been made to home support in the caring sector.  For elderly people, the disabled, the immobile and the disadvantaged, the home help scheme, along with the other care schemes, is invaluable.  The benefit of the health budget to the economy as a whole is obvious.  Supporting and maintaining people in a home setting for as long as is practical and possible is very desirable.<\/p><p>There has been a whole sequence of adjustments and cutbacks to the home help scheme, particularly the number of hours available to particular families.  While I will not cite the individual cases that have cropped up in the Louth-Meath East constituency, I am sure they mirror the position across the country.  I exhort the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to take a serious and urgent look at the scheme.  It is so valuable to people living in a home setting that this bears reiteration time and again.  Even at a time when resources are scarce, there is a need to prioritise, and there is certainly a need to prioritise the home help scheme.  I encourage and exhort the Minister of State to urgently re-examine the situation to see whether additional resources can be made available to support this scheme.<\/p><p>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Kathleen Lynch): I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue, which is one that needs to be discussed on an ongoing basis.  The aim of Government policy remains to support older people in living in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  This objective is realised through various community-based supports such as mainstream home help, enhanced home care packages, meals-on-wheels and day or respite provision.  Our aim is to develop and improve community-based supports where possible, taking account of wider reforms of the health service, the overall resources available and the need for the HSE to meet its statutory budgetary obligations.<\/p><p>The HSE has been developing various operational initiatives to improve its approach nationally to all relevant aspects of its home support services.  These include various new guidelines for home care and agreeing a new procurement framework for approved agencies providing such services on a partnership basis on behalf of the executive.<\/p><p>(Speaker Continuing)<\/p><p>&#91; Deputy Kathleen Lynch: &#93; While ongoing developments have been designed to standardise and maximise the use of limited resources in the face of increasing demand, they are also intended to enhance quality, safety and other key aspects of planning and delivering services, for both providers and care recipients alike.  The HSE service plan for 2012 originally envisaged some 50,000 recipients of mainstream home help and approximately 11,000 recipients of enhanced home care packages at any one time.  Notwithstanding the recently announced reduction in HSE home care towards the end of this year, investment in these services remains significant, with expected outturn expenditure of approximately \u20ac320 million for home help and home care packages in the course of 2012.<\/p><p>The recent measures adopted by the executive were designed to secure a reduction of approximately \u20ac8 million in expenditure on home help hours to the end of December, equating to some 400,000 hours, and a reduction of approximately \u20ac1.2 million on home care packages.  Every effort has been made to ensure the impact of these reductions will be minimised for individual recipients so that services are provided, in the first instance, for direct patient care.  Decisions in regard to the provision of home help hours continue to be based on a review of individual need and no current recipient of the service who has an assessed need will be without a provision.  The latest information available from the HSE indicates that in balancing overall projected financial savings for the home help budget nationally against maintaining adequate service in individual cases, it will probably not meet the savings target envisaged.  The Department continues to work closely with the executive to monitor the position between now and year end.<\/p><p>I emphasise again that in addressing very difficult financial realities overall, protecting community-based services for vulnerable older people continues to be a priority for the Government.  However, the challenge facing the HSE in drawing up its 2013 service plan should not be underestimated.  I am pleased, therefore, to reiterate our commitment to restore to 2012 levels of service the core community services of home help, home care packages and personal assistant hours.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  I am somewhat disappointed, however, that the underlying message seems to be that the position is as it is and the prospect of enhanced provision for those who are down to three quarters of an hour of care under the home help scheme are poor.  I ask the Minister of State again to examine those cases where the curtailment of hours is such that it is unrealistic to expect that the type of care and support required by individuals and families can be met within the assigned allocation.<\/p><p>I have no reason to question or doubt the provision contained in the Estimate for this scheme.  Moreover, I accept the financial constraints with which the Minister of State is dealing.  However, this is an absolutely invaluable scheme.  If we get to a position where a person of 82 or 83 years of age can be maintained in a home setting for another 12 months rather than being taken into institutional care, there are benefits not only for the individual but also for the State.  The arithmetic dictates that providing more resources in this area is in line with best public policy.  I urge the Minister of State to endeavour to secure greater resources for the scheme.<\/p><p>Deputy Kathleen Lynch: I do not doubt for one minute the Deputy's sincerity on this issue.  I am not certain, however, that he heard the last part of my reply, which indicates that we have indeed revisited the matter.  I stated:I emphasise again that in addressing very difficult financial realities overall, protecting community-based services for vulnerable older people continues to be a priority for the Government.  However, the challenge facing the HSE in drawing up its 2013 service plan should not be underestimated.  I am pleased, therefore, to reiterate our commitment to restore to 2012 levels of service the core community services of home help, home care packages and personal assistant hours.In other words, we have done exactly what the Deputy is asking.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: The challenge here is the inadequacy of the 2012 provision.<\/p><p>Deputy Kathleen Lynch: We are all agreed that the difficulties which arose midway through 2012 caused undue hardship.  However, that budget has been restored.<\/p><p>Deputy Jonathan O'Brien: The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is well aware of the challenges facing the parents of children with special needs in Cork and their concerns in regard to the process of reconfiguration of service delivery that is now under way.  I attended the meeting at which she outlined in great detail what is proposed in this regard and attempted to allay some of the fears that were raised from the floor.  The difficulty, however, is that the communication breakdown between the HSE and parents' groups remains a problem.  Several of the parents who attended the public meeting and whose children are attending special needs schools had received virtually no information on the proposed reconfiguration before the Minister of State provided some of the details.  From speaking to parents in recent days, it seems this communication deficit has not yet been addressed.  There are parents who are still not aware of the plans that are being implemented.  This is something that needs to be taken on board by the Department.<\/p><p>I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the meeting that took place last Monday in the HSE offices in Cork at which parents of children with special needs had an opportunity to voice their concerns about the changes that are taking place.  I assume she received the minutes of the meeting, as did I, which clearly point to the concerns that remain outstanding and which must be addressed as soon as possible.  One of the main concerns relates to the issue of parent representation on the implementation groups.  The answer attendees received to queries as to whether there might be increased representation was that the proposed complement of four is larger than that in other geographical areas.  In other words, the message was that four parent representatives is more than enough.  That position must be clarified.  At the same time, there is a genuine concern among parents that the requirements of the parent representative role go above and beyond what they should be asked to do.  The Minister of State will recall from the public meeting she attended that many people are concerned that anybody who accepts the role of parent representative on the implementation group will be held responsible for all of the decisions made.  I accept that the Minister of State sought to clarify this matter at the meeting, but that fear persists.<\/p><p>The other main concern among parents is how the changes can be implemented on a cost neutral basis.  In fact, there is a genuine view among parents that it is simply not possible.  Nobody has yet been able to provide them with details or a plan for how to improve the services and implement the proposed reconfiguration on a cost neutral basis without impacting on front-line services.  If the Minister of State could outline how that is proposed to be achieved, it might ease parents' fears.  There was a debate at the public meeting around the need for a mapping of services.  An argument is being put forward that such mapping should be in place before the implementation groups are established.  To do it the other way around would seem to be putting the cart before the horse.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?<\/p><p>There is a danger that parents will be pitted against parents.  The minutes of last Monday's meeting show there are already differences of opinion, with parents of children attending mainstream schools or units attached to mainstream schools indicating a wish to proceed with nominating representatives to the implementation group as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>(Speaker Continuing)<\/p><p>&#91; Deputy Jonathan O'Brien: &#93; On the other hand there are parents of children attending special schools who are very wary about nominating representatives and proceeding with the implementation group.  We are already seeing a kind of breakdown within the implementation groups, with parents not being able to agree on the best way forward.<\/p><p>The other concern that came out of the meeting, which I hope will be addressed, was that parents were being asked to partake in the groups but they did not have all the documentation and did not know what the overall plan was.  No policy documents were provided to them for studying before they were asked to join the implementation groups.<\/p><p>Deputy Kathleen Lynch: Every parent wants the very best for their child.  If one has a child with particular needs, or needs that are different from those of other children, there is always a fear the needs of the child will not be met into the future.  That is a normal feeling, something one must accept and realise happens.<\/p><p>On the mapping, the implementation groups and whether the mapping should be in place, I reiterate what I said at that meeting, namely, both can run in tandem.  There is no need to hold one up while waiting on the other.  Mapping is vitally important, as I have always maintained.<\/p><p>I refer to the Progressing Disability document, which is part of a suite of measures we are taking in the area of disability.  It is a very good document that outlines delivery of a service in the community.  I understand that people in specialist schools have a difficulty with that taking place.  I realise they are happy with the service they have and do not want to lose it so this reaction is very understandable.  The difficulties I heard about on that day were in terms of where children must go in order to receive the service, and the type of environment they will face.  It should be possible to sort out all these things - they are not impossible tasks but entirely solvable issues.<\/p><p>However, there are swathes of children in the community going to mainstream schools who do not have access to any services.  I am not one who says we should run madly ahead with the project or that it is cost-neutral.  Nothing is cost-neutral.  Even moving something to a new location is not so because one has to look at the location and see what is needed.  We must try to ensure that every child has access to a service.  The mapping should tell us where the gaps are, which is key to the whole issue.  If we find there are gaps in the area of speech therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, psychology and all those things, it will then be my job, or that of whoever stands in this position next time around, to ensure the resources are put in place to fill those gaps.  That is what we did in mental health and what we are about to do in the area of older people and old age psychiatry.  It is what we need to do.<\/p><p>Above all else, we must ensure every child has access to a service.  This is not an overnight project; it will take at least three years.  I heard the parents talking about their fears that day and these are genuine fears.  Nobody wants other than the very best for their children.  I would say to those people they need to be part of the process, if they want to have any influence.  That is not to say everything will be agreed.  This will not happen, it never does.  However, mapping and finding the gaps in the service is vitally important.  That is what we did in the area of mental health and we need to do it here too.  We cannot continue to allow the resource that is in place to go unused.  It is not enough, but the resource I mean is the allied professionals I just named.  I do not say this in a negative or disingenuous way.  We cannot allow all those people to remain within institutions and only delivering service in those institutions.  We must have a more holistic approach and must ensure that children who have a difficulty about going into particular areas are accommodated.  I very clearly heard the woman the Deputy mentioned.<\/p><p>This is a solvable problem, however, and we need to look at solutions.  This is about delivering a better service to more children, and also to those many young adults who are still receiving the service.  That would be the aim but it is not an overnight project and will take time.  I urge people to become engaged with the process.<\/p><p>Deputy Jonathan O'Brien: I do not, for one moment, doubt the Minister of State's sincerity about trying to improve the service.  I genuinely mean that, because I know her track record in this area.  It is very welcome that she has acknowledged today in the Chamber that this project cannot be done on a cost-neutral basis.  That is a big fear people have, as the Minister of State will know from the meeting.<\/p><p>I completely agree we must map out the services we need in order to identify the gaps that must be filled.  The Minister of State rightly stated there cannot be a situation where people who need services do not receive them.  Everybody is entitled to them and should receive them.  The mapping process will identify the individuals in question and resources will have to be put in place.<\/p><p>The big fear, however, was about doing the work on a cost-neutral basis.  If gaps are being identified which will then have to be plugged with resources, and this is being attempted on a cost-neutral basis, it is easy to understand the fear on the part of parents whose children are attending specialist schools.  Their big fear is that in moving to the geographical model services will be taken from some individuals in order to plug the gaps in other areas.  The Minister of State's acknowledgment today that perhaps this cannot be done on a cost-neutral basis is a positive step and I am sure if parents heard it they would feel there is an understanding of their fears.  If we can achieve this, which is not easy in the circumstances we face with the public finances, perhaps we can have a situation where we do not take from one area that is working well in order to try to compensate another area where there are gaps.<\/p><p>Deputy Kathleen Lynch: I will be brief.  I approach everything on the basis that people come to the table with the very best intentions.  I have always done that and that is how I will continue.  Equally, when I am dealing with any situation I ask myself what I would do in that circumstance.  I know if I had a child who was receiving a very good service and there was a possibility that service might move to a different location, I would be very nervous about all of that.  I understand this, I really do.  What we need to look at is how to improve the service.  It is not about taking from Peter to pay Paul, which never works: neither Peter nor Paul is happy.  We really need to start improving the service.<\/p><p>We have used a model which I am reluctant to mention because I know it could be misinterpreted and I do not mean it in that way.  The model we used in the area of mental health, whereby we mapped what was necessary for delivering the service in the community, is a good one and we must consider it.  The deeds will be different in the area of disability and we understand that.  Nevertheless that type of mapping process works.  It looks at where gaps exist and what is necessary to ensure they are filled, not by robbing Peter to pay Paul but by taking a look at the kind of enhanced budget we need.  This may be a separate budget.  In mental health, we used developmental money rather than a centralised budget.  That is the direction we need to take and we must look at it.<\/p><p>That answer will not satisfy the parents we met in Ballincollig - at this time.  However, if we have a view of where we want to get to and if there is an incremental plan of how to get there, we could go on this journey together.<\/p><p>Deputy Ann Phelan: I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter.  According to ASH Ireland, the prevalence of smoking in this country stands somewhere between 26% and 29%.  While the position in this regard is better than it was a generation ago, when nearly half of the population smoked, the figure remains high, particularly in comparison to that in places such as California where only 11% of the population smoke, or Norway where the figure is 17%.  Smoking must be one of the greatest causes of health problems, with most smokers admitting that they wish they had never begun in the first instance.  Smoking is an extremely difficult addiction to overcome and a very expensive habit.<\/p><p>We have made great strides in reducing the level of smoking, having banned it in so many public places.  It is well known, however, that the cost of nicotine replacement therapies such as gum, patches and the newer artificial cigarettes is a factor in ensuring some people continue to smoke.  They are very expensive, particularly in comparison to the prices paid by our friends north of the Border and throughout the United Kingdom.  A major factor in the difference in price is that the British Government has introduced a special VAT of just 5% for these therapies.  In Ireland, however, we charge a rate of 23%.  This is what gives rise to the significant price differential between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  If we could follow the example of the United Kingdom and introduce a similar rate here, the knock-on effects for smokers and the Exchequer would be tremendous.  Over 5,500 people die each year as a result of smoking-related illnesses.  It is estimated that we spend close to \u20ac1.5 billion in treating these illnesses.  While a reduction in VAT might result in a small shortfall for Revenue, we should consider the savings to be made in the long term if the beleaguered Department of Health were obliged to deal with fewer smoking-related illnesses.  We must do everything possible to reduce the startling statistics for smoking.  We can only bring about such a reduction if we help people to give up smoking, while also deterring young people from taking up the habit.  Having nicotine replacement therapies available at a reasonable price would definitely assist those trying to beat the addiction.<\/p><p>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy John Perry): I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue, to which I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  I welcome the opportunity to outline the position on the question of the VAT treatment of nicotine replacement patches posed by the Deputy.<\/p><p>I wish to explain that, when considering the VAT system and the VAT treatment of any product or service, the VAT rating of goods and services is governed by the requirements of the EU VAT directive with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In this regard, it may be useful to remind the House of the structure of Ireland's VAT regime.  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland operates a number of VAT rates.  The standard VAT rate of 23% applies to the majority of goods and services, including cars, petrol, diesel, alcohol, tobacco, electrical equipment, CDs and DVDs.  There is also a reduced rate of 13.5% which applies mainly to fuel used for heat or light, construction, housing, labour intensive services and general repairs and maintenance.  A second reduced rate of 9%, introduced as part of the jobs initiative, applies mainly to tourism-related services, including hotel and holiday accommodation, restaurant services and some entertainment services.  The zero rate of VAT generally applies to most food, children's clothes and shoes and oral medicines.<\/p><p>As the Deputy correctly pointed out, nicotine replacement patches are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 23%.  Unlike other nicotine products such as inhalers, tablets and chewing gum which are categorised as oral medicines and which thereby qualify for the zero-rate of VAT, nicotine replacement patches are not considered to be oral medicines and are, therefore, correctly subject to the standard rate of VAT of 23%.  However, I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that member states have the option, under Annex lll of the EU VAT directive, of applying a reduced rate of VAT to pharmaceutical products of a kind normally used for health care, for the prevention of illnesses and medical treatment purposes.  In this regard, since nicotine replacement patches could be considered to meet such criteria, Ireland would have the option of applying a reduced rate to such products.  However, constraints imposed by the VAT directive on the number of reduced VAT rates which a member state may operate at any one time would not allow for the possibility of a special reduced VAT rate of 5% to match, as suggested by the Deputy, that which applies in the United Kingdom.  Article 98 of the directive provides that member states may apply either one or two reduced rates to the goods and services listed in Annex lll.  The introduction of a third reduced VAT rate would, therefore, not be possible under EU VAT rules.  Accordingly, any reduction in the VAT rate on nicotine replacement patches would have to be considered in the context of the existing 9% and 13.5% reduced rates.<\/p><p>A proposal to reduce the VAT rate applying to any good or service raises a number of issues.  The Deputy will not be surprised if I emphasise the need to maintain VAT revenues and also the need to ensure losses to the Exchequer in these difficult economic times are avoided.  Notwithstanding the potential health benefits which may accrue from the use of nicotine replacement patches, losses in one area must be balanced by savings or increased taxes in others.  The issue of the degree to which the consumer might benefit from a reduction in VAT on nicotine replacement patches also arises.  In this regard, there is, unfortunately, no guarantee that moving standard-rated products to a reduced rate of VAT would necessarily be reflected in full in the retail prices charged to consumers.  Any dilution of the potential benefit to the consumer would obviously be a major concern and effectively negate the promotion of the use of nicotine patch technology.<\/p><p>In the context of the imbalance of price between Ireland and the United Kingdom to which the Deputy refers, cross-Border shopping studies indicate that fluctuations in the exchange rate between sterling and the euro represent the most significant influence on price.  In this respect, the current exchange rate between sterling and the euro should provide less incentive for people to shop outside the State.  The report of the implications of cross-Border shopping which was undertaken on behalf of the Minister for Finance by the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office notes that the main causes of price differentials between goods in Northern Ireland and the Republic are operating costs, profit margin or mark-up, taxes and the exchange rate between sterling and the euro.  While variations in VAT rates widened some price differentials, their impact remained small compared to the significance of the change in the exchange rate.<\/p><p>I again thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I hope I have clarified the position on the VAT treatment of nicotine replacement patches and the situation regarding the possibilities available under the EU VAT directive.<\/p><p>Deputy Ann Phelan: I thank the Minister of State for his reply and highlighting the various rules which apply.  I remain of the view that this is an area in which we should do a great deal more work, particularly as the benefits for Ireland and other member states would be very significant.  It is stated one's health is one's wealth.  If we can help people to stop smoking, we will have done a great deed.  Nicotine replacement therapies are sold from behind the counter in Ireland, whereas in the United Kingdom and most other countries they are sold off the shelf.  They are also sold exclusively by chemist shops in this country, but elsewhere one can purchase them from a wide variety of outlets, which makes matters much easier for those who want to quit.  I am determined to pursue this significant issue which has major implications for people's health and the Exchequer.  We must do everything in our power to help people stop smoking, particularly as the habit is so closely associated with the lower socioeconomic classes.  In the case of a person in receipt of a benefit payment of \u20ac188 per week and who smokes 20 cigarettes a day - most people smoke more at weekends - one can calculate that he or she spends \u20ac60 to \u20ac70 a week on tobacco, which is a significant amount of money.  If we put in place a task force to assist people on benefits to quit the habit, this would go a long way towards helping such individuals rebalance their budgets rather than watching their money go up in smoke.<\/p><p>(Speaker Continuing)<\/p><p>&#91; Deputy John Perry: &#93; I appreciate fully the point made by Deputy Phelan.  She correctly described the impact on public health of the sale of tobacco.  I suggest the promotion of nicotine patches is an issue she could discuss with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  It may be possible to have nicotine patches on open display to make them more available to the consumer.  The cost of 20 cigarettes is the best part of \u20ac70 a week.  This is a major expenditure for people on low incomes.  More than 5,500 people die in this country every year from smoking related diseases.  The consumption of cigarettes is detrimental to people's health.<\/p><p>I refer to the issue of the illegal importation of tobacco products.  Cigarettes are being sold door to door.  This is illicit tobacco and the quality is dubious.  Any tobacco is bad but this illicit tobacco is substandard and the quality is even worse.<\/p><p>The Minister for Finance referred to the possibility of a VAT rate of 9% or 13.5% on nicotine replacement patches.  I suggest the Deputy could pursue this issue with him.  I am certain a self-financing mechanism would benefit the State and the health of the population.  I agree with the Deputy that these products should be more available.<\/p><p>Deputy Ann Phelan: I thank the Minister of State for his very positive response to this issue.  I take the point about the 9% VAT rate and the 13.5% VAT rate.  Anything that could be done to lower the rate to encourage people to quit the smoking habit would be welcome.  I will pursue the issue with the Minister for Health.<\/p><p>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan: The social housing programme has collapsed in most constituencies, including mine.  Dublin City Council figures show that last year, 16,600 families and individuals were on its housing waiting list, with 7,538 on the transfer list.  A total of 32% of applicants were waiting more than five years, with 2,544 waiting more than seven years.  I describe these figures as deeply damaging to the credibility of Dublin City Council and the Government.  In addition, Fingal County Council confirmed to me that 9,082 families and individuals were waiting for housing on its council housing list.<\/p><p>When Members of this House are able to retire to our comfortable homes or lodgings after long days in the D\u00e1il, 80 to 90 people will be sleeping on the streets of this city.  They will sleep outside on this very night as they have done over recent bitter November nights.  It is unacceptable and disgraceful.<\/p><p>Like other Members I receive many phone calls and e-mails from constituents.  I meet many of them at my weekly information clinics who are in dire straits with regard to housing.  They describe very difficult home circumstances.  They may be on a housing waiting list for anything from five to 13 years.  A typical example is a young woman with three children who has been living for the past five or six years in very cramped conditions with her adult siblings and her parents in a modest two-bedroom house.<\/p><p>A few weeks ago I asked the Taoiseach whether a social housing investment programme would be implemented in 2012.  I have studied budget 2013 as best I can but I have not found any evidence of any serious intent on the part of this Government to address this issue.  I estimate that perhaps only a few dozen individuals and households were rehoused in the past year in my constituency out of the 4,000 on the Dublin North-Central housing list.<\/p><p>The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is committed to tackling the issue but it is impossible for any progress to be made unless proper funding is allocated to kick-start the social housing programme.  This would also have a beneficial effect on the construction industry.<\/p><p>I have spoken about the appalling treatment of citizens who have been left on the waiting list, in some cases for up to 15 years.  I have long urged Dublin City Council to move away from its historic points-based, priority-based housing list system to a system based on time on the list, as used in Fingal County Council.  I am a former Dublin City Council councillor.  The council last week decided to move to the system of time on the list, which is a fair and transparent system.  It is a case of first come, first served.  It now awaits the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to sign the regulation.  When will he sign that regulation?<\/p><p>Under the Fianna F\u00e1il regime led by Ahern and Cowen, the failure of local authorities to provide social housing meant a massive growth in the private rental sector.  In the past five years since 2007, almost \u20ac3 billion has been expended on rent supplement allowances.  This money has gone into the pockets of private landlords.  Ordinary constituents wonder why that money was not used to fund a housing programme.<\/p><p>When will the promised housing Bill come before the House?  I refer in particular to provisions in respect of the administration of voluntary housing bodies.  My constituency has organisations such as NABCO, Iveagh Trust, Respond and Cl\u00faid.  There is no legislation governing estate management and tenancy and it is urgently needed.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Hogan, gave two deadlines - the first Sunday in September and then a further ten days - to the developers, builders, auctioneers, insurance companies in respect of the pyrite disaster.  He keeps issuing deadlines but when will he take action?  When will he decide to levy the industry which did those terrible things to households?  People are upset that they are expected to pay a housing tax - which the House will discuss tomorrow - on houses which are worthless because they need to be remediated.  I ask the Minister of State to bring these points to the attention of the Minister.<\/p><p>On a final point, I ask the Minister of State to ask if the Minister will join us next Monday at 7.30 p.m. at Priory Hall for a candlelight vigil.  Those families - a total of 250 people - are facing a second Christmas out of their homes at Priory Hall.  I am sure they would be delighted to see him at the vigil next Monday night at Priory Hall.<\/p><p>Deputy John Perry: I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this issue.  I may not have the comprehensive reply he wants but I will bring his concerns to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Hogan.  The current economic crisis is severely testing the capacity of the State to meet social housing need.  Financial considerations mean local authorities are effectively no longer engaged in large-scale housing stock construction programmes at the very time when demand for housing services is at its greatest.  The Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, sets out a new approach for housing provision that recognises these key unfortunate realities.  It is specifically predicated on a tenure-neutral approach that focuses on enabling households to access the housing solution that best suited to their needs at a point in time.  While home ownership is still a very valid aspiration for a majority of households, it is no longer the acme of all tenure options.<\/p><p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with the housing authorities and with not-for-profit approved housing bodies, is engaging in a range of innovative and flexible housing solutions to meet housing need in general, and homelessness in particular.  I acknowledge the Deputy's campaigning work on behalf of the homeless  I sympathise with the fact that up to 80 people are sleeping on the streets of Dublin tonight.  I cannot even imagine what it must be like on such a cold evening.  I appreciate the Deputy's point about homelessness.<\/p><p>The Department's approach to homelessness is to focus on providing people with a home where they can live as full and valued members of society.<\/p><p>(Speaker Continuing)<\/p><p>&#91; Deputy John Perry: &#93; That is why Government policy in this area is moving to a housing-led approach rather than the traditional model that places hostel or shelter-type accommodation at the centre of accommodation provision.  This change will take time to implement, but the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is committed to seeing it through.  People deserve the dignity of a home.  We must obviously bear in mind the financial constraints.<\/p><p>Early in the new year, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will be issuing a policy statement on homelessness.  This will indicate what we expect from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.  The Minister of State has sought to put in place real solutions for people who find themselves without a home.  Investment of nearly \u20ac50 million has been provided by central and local government in the provision of homelessness services in 2012.<\/p><p>With regard to wider demand for social housing, the Government's focus is on optimising the delivery of social housing for the resources invested.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.<\/p><p>The social housing capital budget has had to be reduced from \u20ac1.535 billion in 2008 to just over \u20ac333.7 million this year - this is a considerable reduction - and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital-funded construction programmes.  Nevertheless, the Minister of State is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs across the country through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  Delivery is being significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the rental accommodation scheme and leasing, but the Minister of State is also developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. In spite of these challenging circumstances, a tentative projection of 4,000 housing units is anticipated for 2012.<\/p><p>The Minister of State will continue to target available resources to ensure the critical housing needs of the most vulnerable sectors of our society are addressed.  Precise data are critical in this regard, which is why the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will in 2013 carry out a full housing-needs assessment, the first such assessment to be carried out under the 2009 housing Act.  This will give a comprehensive picture of real need and help to direct scarce resources to best effect.<\/p><p>I will pass on Deputy Broughan's concerns on Priory Hall to the Minister, Deputy Hogan.<\/p><p>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan: I warmly welcome that because the householders of Priory Hall are anxiously awaiting the recommendation of Mr. Justice Finnegan.  Those with pyrite damaged homes are waiting to know whether the Government will put in place a facility regarding the new house tax, which is having an impact on them, and whether the deadline has been reached.<\/p><p>The current social housing capital budget is \u20ac333.7 million, a very disappointing sum.  The Government is supposed to be getting \u20ac400 million plus for the 4G communications auction.  Could at least part of this not be hypothecated to address the awful housing problem?  Might this be considered?  I understand we are not going to make the promissory note payment at the end of March.  We slotted into the Estimates for the medium term approximately \u20ac5 billion between interest and capital repayments.  Are there not more areas in the kitty that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should be examining to kick-start the sector and get all the unemployed construction workers back onto the sites?<\/p><p>It is shocking that 80 to 90 people might be sleeping out tonight.  There was a recent tragic death involving a homeless person in Bray.  This urgent issue needs to be addressed in the coming days.  When will the housing Bill be introduced?<\/p><p>With regard to the rent-to-buy and rental accommodation schemes, the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, mentioned various initiatives.  Do the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, intend to do something more dramatic regarding plans for long-term rental?<\/p><p>Has the Minister of State given any consideration to allowing local authorities themselves to engage in housing construction like the voluntary bodies by establishing their own construction and housing-management companies?  It would involve emulating what Cl\u00faid, NABCO and other bodies have done.  Thus, local authorities, such as Sligo county and city councils, could take the initiative rather than wait for individuals in the community to do so.<\/p><p>Deputy John Perry: The Minister, Deputy Hogan, is very far-reaching in his thinking.  The biggest shake-up in local government in 100 years has taken place under his watch.  This involves a considerable change of mindset.  Bearing in mind the limited budget and very scarce resources, I am quite certain value for money will be achieved in respect of the buy-to-let and rental accommodation schemes.<\/p><p>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan: We need more money.<\/p><p>Deputy John Perry: Given the amount of rental accommodation available throughout the country, not only in Dublin, I have no doubt the Minister and Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will do their very best to obtain the best value for money despite the very limited resources made available through the voted Estimate.<\/p><p>It is obviously a matter for the Minister for Finance to deal with the money allocated for the 4G communications auction.  I will raise the timeline for the legislation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I note what the Deputy said and the Minister will revert to him.<\/p><p>With regard to homelessness and people sleeping out, we are very fortunate that there are some fantastic services providing short-term solutions.  Members of the voluntary sector are bringing people into shelters in the city every night.  I hope sincerely that the homeless will be facilitated in every way possible.  Members of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na are identifying people.  It is very important that, in the short term, the homeless must be facilitated, especially in this very difficult climate.  This is only a short-term solution, not a long-term one.<\/p><p>1.Deputy Seamus Kirkasked theMinister for Agriculture, Food and the Marinethe advantage to milk producers of the milk quality assurance scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.[55818\/12]<\/p><p>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney): The development of a dairy sustainability and quality programme comes against the background of ambitious plans under the Food Harvest 2020 report to increase dairy production by 50% in the period to 2020, and the need to find a home on international markets for this additional production.<\/p><p>We are taking a series of steps on a number of levels to prepare for this.  State agencies, the Department and companies are working together to restore new markets in areas such as Asia, the Middle East, Russia and Africa.  We are also developing a common brand, Origin Green, across the food industry generally.  This is about differentiating Irish food from food produced in competitor countries.  Essentially, it is a sustainability claim backed up by data that are internationally accredited in respect of how food is produced in Ireland.  Part of building that brand requires a sustainability and quality programme for primary producers of dairy projects.  This is why, in last year's budget, I announced that I wanted to see the rolling out of a quality or sustainability programme among the 18,000 dairy farmers in the country to ensure we could stand over our collective dairy industry and say we produce milk to a certain standard.  This will not be some kind of inspection-based witch-hunt of farmers; it will be quite the opposite.  We will roll out the programme in the same way that the carbon-footprinting programme has been rolled out for the beef sector.  By the end of this year, 32,000 beef farms across Ireland will be carbon-footprinted.  When we sell a steak, not only will we be able to put on the label the traceability claim indicating the farmyard from where it came, we will also be able to tell buyers the carbon footprint of the animal that produced it.<\/p><p>(Speaker Continuing)<\/p><p>&#91; Deputy Simon Coveney: &#93; We want to provide similar sustainability claims for dairy production in Ireland.  Bord Bia is working with all the interested parties and farming organisations to ensure we get buy in  from farmers and that we insulate the Irish dairy industry from price volatility in the future on the basis of quality and the data we collect which can prove sustainability.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  In his preamble to the points he made about the proposed scheme, he said the background to this is Food Harvest 2020 and the projected increase in diary production in Ireland.  I understand Teagasc has prepared expansion plans for the dairy industry and the plans indicate it will be expensive to expand.  This industry, by its nature, is capital intensive and there is a low margin return on the money invested in it.  When the inevitable price volatility that will arise for the dairy sector is injected into the mix, any proposal that will increase costs for the farmer, or a combination of farmers in partnership arrangements, is dangerous territory to approach.<\/p><p>Is the model of the proposed scheme a template taken from somewhere else?  Has it been modelled on a template in some other jurisdiction across the Community?  For instance, will the authorities north of the Border have a parallel scheme running alongside our proposed scheme?  The core question is the additional cost that will be imposed on farmers who will be stretched financially to meet the expansion objectives set out in Food Harvest 2020.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: The best way farmers can insulate themselves from the price volatility that will happen in the future is to ensure Irish product get differentiated from other product.  Let us not forget that more than 85% of all the milk we produce is exported in various forms, be it infant formula, skimmed and semi-skimmed milk, cheese, yoghurts and all the other products in which milk is an ingredient.  If we are to be able to demand a higher price for our product in the future, which we will need to do, and move away from being a commodity producer of volume to being a quality producer of volume, targeting the top 10% price area in the new markets we are exploring, we have to be able to stand over the way in which our food is produced.  The sustainability and quality programme will not cost farmers a great deal of money, in fact it will help them to run their businesses more efficiently.  If a farmer is using less water, has more feed conversion efficiency and more efficient grazing management, his business will be more efficient and sustainable.  The combination of those two factors will improve the standard of dairy farming in Ireland, which will be beneficial for everybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the context of the capital investment farmers have to make, we will make more than &#8364;10 million available to dairy farmers next year in the form of the TAM scheme, which is half of the overall scheme as such, to help them with the costs of expansion, growth and upgrading their equipment.\r\n\r\n  Additional information not given on the floor of the House\r\n\r\n\r\n  Environmental sustainability is an increasingly important issue in the marketplace for many multinational dairy and food operators, many of which now have sustainability as a core part of their corporate strategies.  During my trade missions to China and the US in 2012 it was clear that the sustainability and quality messages have a strong resonance both with potential customers for Irish food products and with potential investors in the Irish agri food sector.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  Developing a unique selling point for Irish food products is a critically important element of the national strategy for the development of the sector.  It is particularly relevant in the dairy sector where we will need to maximise market returns for significantly increased production in competitive markets worldwide.  Ireland is well placed to develop a national brand image based on a reputation for high quality dairy products, and on its mild maritime climate, plentiful supplies of water, grass based production and an already positive green image.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In that context, earlier this year, Bord Bia launched its &#8220;Origin Green&#8221; programme, which establishes a framework within which Irish food companies can have their green credentials independently measured.  This will be a critically important element in the development of the Irish food sector in the coming years and its promotion on international markets. The key is to build independently verifiable metrics, which can be used in the marketplace, around Ireland&#8217;s already positive green image.   \r\n\r\n\r\n  It is equally important to develop an independently accredited sustainability and quality programme at farm level for the dairy sector as part of that overall strategy to enable the sector point to verifiable attributes in maintaining and expanding its market share.  There is also a strong correlation between the measures needed to improve environmental sustainability and to improve hygiene and other quality practices on farm, and those needed to reduce the costs of production at farm level and improve profitability.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  In that context, and following extensive consultations with stakeholders in the first half of 2012, I announced in June that Bord Bia would begin detailed work on the development of a national sustainability and quality programme for the dairy sector to be used as a key element in marketing and promotional efforts on international markets.  The programme will provide an independently accredited framework for operating best practice quality and sustainability principles on Irish dairy farms, and an objective and uniform mechanism for measuring compliance with these principles.  It will also provide a vehicle for encouraging continuous improvement in production standards on Irish farms, underpin the marketing of Irish dairy products internationally and provide additional assurance for potential investors in Ireland. \r\n\r\n\r\n  Stakeholders are currently engaged in detailed technical discussions on the development of the programme, under the aegis of a technical advisory group convened by Bord Bia to progress the issue, and I hope it can be finalised in the near future.<\/p><p>2.Deputy Martin Ferrisasked theMinister for Agriculture, Food and the Marinehis views on the impact of budgetary cuts on farm programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.[56052\/12]<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: As this is a fairly broad question, I will address the issues that might be most pertinent.  There has been some criticism since the announcement of the budget that we have targeted certain schemes unfairly and I want to give the Deputy the rationale for why we did what we did.  I will deal with the beef sector first.<\/p><p>For the past five years we have had a suckler cow welfare scheme which has been a popular and extremely good scheme.  It has significantly improved the welfare standards within the suckler herd and it has provided very valuable data around breeding programmes and fertility within herds to Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, which is very useful for planning for the future, breeding programmes and so on.  That was a five year scheme and this is the fifth year of it.  It has come to an end.  I had signalled that I would not be able to continue the suckler cow welfare scheme indefinitely into the future because we do not have the money to do it and it has come to the end of its five year term.  I would have had to have put a new scheme in place and get approval from Brussels for that.  Instead we decided to put in place a smaller, more targeted scheme to replace the suckler scheme for the moment, which will cost us approximately \u20ac10 million a year and which will pay farmers \u20ac20 rather than \u20ac40 an animal.  We are asking them to continue to supply the kind of data on breeding and fertility they previously would have been providing to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF.  We are asking new entrants also to provide that data for that money.<\/p><p>It is important to say in terms of the beef sector, because it is misunderstood, that next year we will spend almost as much on the beef sector as we spent this year.  This year we will spend \u20ac25 million on the suckler cow welfare scheme in addition to approximately \u20ac2 million connected to beef discussion groups which started half way through the year.  Next year we will spend \u20ac10 million on this new scheme.  We will spend \u20ac10 million on the existing suckler cow welfare scheme where the payments will be paid next year in respect of calves that were born in the second half of the year, and we will spend \u20ac5 million on beef discussion groups on this sector next year.  That is \u20ac25 million that will be spent on suckler beef next year which is not a significant difference from what was spent on that sector this year, although I accept the make-up and design of those payments are different.  I will address one or two of the other sectors related to the sheep sector and DAS payments when I get an opportunity to do so later.<\/p><p>Deputy Martin Ferris: I thank the Minister for his reply.  He is aware that farm incomes have fallen by 22% up to November of this year.  That is an average payment of approximately \u20ac18,000 which is well below the industrial wage.  I am sure he is also aware of the plight of the weaker farmer, which includes farmers in the suckler welfare scheme, those on previous REP schemes and so forth, and the fact that such schemes were instrumental to the viability of that type of farming.  Notwithstanding the tremendous work regarding the provision of data and so forth, the suckler scheme has had a huge impact on the quality of calves being born and in terms of the finished product, and everybody benefited as a result.<\/p><p>It is not the remit of the Minister's Department, but the farm assist scheme has been cut by approximately \u20ac8 million.  The farmers in that scheme are the most marginal and they are struggling to survive and care for their families.  These cuts will have a detrimental effect on that type of farming in particular because one will find that the farmers in the suckler welfare scheme and some people involved in sheep farming are also dependent on farm assist.  While the Minister might try to make up that loss another way, perhaps by compensating for the situation in regard the suckler welfare scheme, the farm assist being cut as well will make it almost impossible for these type of farmers to survive.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: There is a genuine concern about ensuring that farmers on relatively small farms in very disadvantaged areas are provided with enough support to keep them on the land.  That is the reason, in terms of the savings we must make in the disadvantage areas scheme, we have excluded mountainous farmers from any of those savings to ensure nobody farming in a mountainous area - that is 32,000 out of the 100,000 - will face any reduction in their incomes.  Regarding the low land disadvantaged area farmers, instead of reducing the rate for everybody, we have reduced the eligible hectarage for people to again protect smaller farmers.  In other words, instead of claiming the payment on 34 hectares as a maximum it will be claimed on 30 hectares as a maximum.  I have tried to prioritise the most disadvantaged farmers, that is, the people on the mountains and the smaller farmers within the disadvantaged areas scheme, DAS, in lowland areas.  A total of 73% of people in disadvantaged areas will be unaffected by the reductions and the remainder will see a reduction of an average of about 11% but those decisions were made to protect those with holdings and the most disadvantaged people within DAS areas.  The same applies to the suckler scheme.  Those who apply for the new suckler scheme in terms of the data transfer scheme will automatically get \u20ac20 per cow for the first 20 cows.<\/p><p>(Speaker Continuing)<\/p><p>&#91; Deputy Simon Coveney: &#93; The average size of a suckler herd is 16 cows while the average size of a suckler herd in the suckler cow welfare scheme is 18 cows.  We are trying to prioritise smaller farmers.  If we have moneys left over after that, then we will give it to the farmers who have more than 20 cows.  I believe there will be some money left over to give top-up payments to farmers with 30 to 40 suckler cows.<\/p><p>This was the third year of the three-year sheep grasslands scheme.  We have decided to continue with the scheme, which will be paid for by unspent moneys under pillar 1.  While we have reduced the cost of it from \u20ac18 million to \u20ac14 million, we have made up for that by introducing a discussion group, similar to the ones that have worked so well for the dairy sector, which will bring farmers together to discuss how they can improve their businesses and make more money in the marketplace.  We will spend \u20ac3 million on these discussion groups next year.  The total spend on the sheep sector next year will be more or less the same as this year's.  I have worked hard to achieve this, as I see the sheep sector as a vulnerable area.<\/p><p>3.Deputy John Halliganasked theMinister for Agriculture, Food and the Marinefurther to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 521 and 522 of 4 December 2012, when a decision will be made in relation the potential inclusion of Dunmore East Harbour, County Waterford, under the 2013 Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Capital Development Programme; if he will confirm where Dunmore East Harbour sits in relation to other competing priorities; if his attention has been drawn to factors (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.[56183\/12]<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: My Department administers the fishery harbour and coastal infrastructure capital development programme every year.  Dunmore East fishery harbour centre is one of the six designated fishery harbour centres which are owned, managed and maintained by my Department and, as such, it receives funding annually on foot of the programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n  My Department continues to support the harbour's development with funding provided for maintenance, development and upgrading works each year.  Indeed, expenditure under the programme for Dunmore East since 2007 has been in the order of &#8364;4 million.  This is in recognition of the valuable contribution the harbour makes to the fishing industry as well as the local community in terms of the support the harbour infrastructure provides to the development of the tourism industry and the local economy generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dunmore East fishery harbour centre provides a dedicated and essential service to our fishing fleet.  Both local and visiting fishing vessels, including vessels of significant dimensions, avail of the harbour facilities at Dunmore East.  I am happy to report the investment in Dunmore East fishery harbour centre in recent years is bearing fruit.  Indeed, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority's records indicate a year-on-year increase in fish landings in recent years.\r\n\r\n\r\n  My Department's officials host a harbour users' forum regularly and meet with local stakeholders and harbour users.  This forum provides a platform for harbour users to air their views and gives my officials an opportunity to hear at first hand the concerns and suggestions of the people using the harbour facilities.  As recently as July of this year, the Dunmore East tourism group, which plays an active part in the harbour users' group, formally complimented both the appearance of the harbour and the good work being done there by my Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The need for dredging works at the harbour has been recognised by my Department.  Reports commissioned have indicated that 80% of the harbour sediment contains tributyltin, TBT.  Unfortunately, the cost associated with the disposal of dredge is approximately &#8364;5 million.  This is a figure we cannot afford immediately but I am conscious of the need to dredge the harbour.  We are examining the best way of dealing with this as safely as we can given our budgetary constraints.  The total harbours budget this year was &#8364;7 million and the cost of cleaning Dunmore East is &#8364;5 million.  The Deputy can understand the difficulties I have.\r\n\r\n  Additional information not given on the floor of the House\r\n\r\nThis represents a significant expenditure in the current economic environment and I can confirm that my Department's engineering division has engaged consultants to examine and report on a number of alternative options in terms of the structuring of the works and the outlay involved.  I expect to have the report in early 2013 and will assess at that stage how best to proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Future investment at Dunmore East and the five other fishery harbour centres will of course be considered each year in the context of available Exchequer funding and overall national priorities.  In early 2013, I expect to be in a position to identify projects for inclusion under the 2013 fishery harbour and coastal infrastructure capital development programme at each of the six fishery harbour centres.<\/p><p>Deputy John Halligan: Twenty-five years ago, up to 50 fishing boats worked out of Dunmore East employing hundreds of fishermen, with hundreds more employed in fish-processing plants around the harbour.  Over the past decade, however, this long-established fishing industry has been under threat from restrictions designed to protect stocks.  The local fishermen's co-operative is struggling enormously with EU fish quota restrictions, an aging fishing fleet and poor fish prices caused by low demand due to the recession.  As fishing vessels become more technologically demanding, additional pressure has been put on resources and infrastructure.  Reduced catches put pressure on employment in the processing sector.  Several fish factories have already closed in Dunmore East over the past four years.<\/p><p>Dunmore East Harbour is suffering from inadequate infrastructure to address its potential needs.  No dredging of the harbour has taken place for 17 years.  Consequently, larger vessels cannot access the harbour.  Silting has reduced the depth of the approach under the synchrolift.  Despite the fact that it has a lifting capacity of 200 tonnes, it is only suitable for vessels with a maximum draft of about nine feet.  Hence, many vessels have to divert to Cork or Howth for docking.  This poor access has had a devastating impact on the local fishing fleet.<\/p><p>Since the recession hit, several hotels and restaurants in Dunmore East have closed.  There is a significant scarcity of work and little or no investment in local industry.  It is well recognised that the average income in the fishing village is below the national average.  The local community has suffered significantly in the past several years, with a 12% decline in population.  Without a properly functioning harbour, we may as well close down Dunmore East.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): There is only one minute left.<\/p><p>Deputy John Halligan: Will the Minister reconsider dredging the harbour there?  Although he has acknowledged in the past that dredging works in Dunmore East are a priority, it is not possible to wait another five years for this to happen.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): This will have to be just a headline answer as there is only half a minute left.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: The reality is that nothing can be done if one does not have the money.  We have taken on consultants to examine the options-----<\/p><p>Deputy John Halligan: The harbour has a turnover of \u20ac10 million and we are asking for a \u20ac4 million investment which could increase that turnover and, in turn, bring more money into the Exchequer.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: The Deputy is asking for more than half of my total harbours fund.  I simply do not have it.  If I had the money, I would be spending it on this.  This is one of the harbours that has priority when it comes to dredging investment.<\/p><p>Fish landings at Dunmore East are actually increasing every year.  Quotas are significantly up this year and it is my job to negotiate another good deal on the quotas next week.  The stocks of cod, haddock, whiting and herring in the Celtic Sea are all up.  It is not as bad as some people make out.<\/p><p>I agree there is a significant problem in the harbour and it needs to be dredged.  I will do it when I can afford to.  In the meantime, we will have to put a plan in place to do what we can do.<\/p><p>4.Deputy John Browneasked theMinister for Agriculture, Food and the Marinethe position regarding the common fisheries policy review; the possible implications for Irish fishermen; when he expects this to be concluded; and if he will make a statement on the matter.[56051\/12]<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): Before we continue, I must let Members know I had a tasty piece of sole before I came into the Chamber.  I hope it came from Dungarvan.<\/p><p>Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan: Did the Acting Chairman have a bit of sole or a bit of soul?<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: Sole is one of the species whose stock is under pressure in the Irish Sea.<\/p><p>Deputy John Browne: The Acting Chairman should not have eaten it then.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): I am glad I did something good.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: I am hoping to get the best deal I can for fishermen next week in a whole series of areas, particularly with regard to prawns in the Irish Sea and area VII generally.  As part of that, fantastic work has been done by the Marine Institute.  One of the stocks under pressure is sole.  I hope the Acting Chairman feels guilty now.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): I am sorry to have added to the pressure.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: I hope he enjoyed it because it might be the last one he gets.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): It was lovely and I recommend it.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: Deputy Browne has been in this ministry before and will know the preparation required for the negotiations on total allowable catches, TACs, and fishing quotas.  These preparations have been completed this year in an impressive manner.<\/p><p>There has been much talk about getting the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy done during the Irish EU Presidency.  I am equally focused on the Common Fisheries Policy.  We want to get a deal for all countries but one that will also shape policy to ensure the Irish industry can survive and grow.  One of the key issues under discussion is how we deal with discards.<\/p><p>(Speaker Continuing)<\/p><p>&#91; Deputy Simon Coveney: &#93; At the moment in many of our fisheries up to 40% or 50% of the fish caught are being dumped over the side, dead.  They are either juvenile fish or in some cases adult fish.  We need and we will find solutions to that and I hope the industry will work with me in the change process.<\/p><p>We are moving towards what is termed maximum sustainable yield in how we determine quotas each year.  The idea is that there is a set formula now based on data collection and linked to total allowable catch which can measure what a fish species can take in terms of the amount of fish caught each year to ensure that the stocks can survive and grow.  We are trying to apply maximum sustainable yield, MSY, calculations to as many of the stocks as we can and to have enough data to do that by 2015.  We are trying to apply it to all the stocks with sufficient data by 2020.  That is part of the programme.<\/p><p>The other issue relates to regionalisation of decision making.  This is something we are supportive of because we are keen to see countries fishing in Irish waters making decisions on the management of stocks in Irish waters rather than others, but we also want the protection of the Commission to ensure that Ireland does not get outvoted or outnumbered in a regionalisation structure on decision making.  For example, we want to avoid a scenario whereby the French and Spanish could gang up on Ireland and make decisions on fish stocks in Irish waters.  That would be unacceptable.  Only when there is a unanimous decision on a regionalised decision-making process will we support it.  Otherwise we want to be able to go back to the Commission, which is essentially there to support small nations.<\/p><p>The challenge is to find common ground with the European Parliament.  I will spend a good deal of time in Brussels talking to people in the European Parliament about how to ensure that the Council, which is represented by Ministers, and the European Parliament can come together in a co-decision process to find a compromise position on the future of the fishing industry and to try to get that job done by the end of June next year.  I believe it will be possible to do it but it will be demanding.<\/p><p>Deputy John Browne: I thank the Minister for his detailed reply and I wish him well at the negotiations in Brussels next week.  I imagine he will have the fishermen and the fishery organisations in tow.  It is important to the 11,000 people employed in the fishing industry around the country that the Common Fisheries Policy review leans towards Irish fishermen.  They believe that in the past they have not got the best possible deals.  Does the Minister believe he will be in a position to conclude the review during the term of the Irish EU Council Presidency?<\/p><p>The Minister has been pursuing the issue of discards, among other issues, since he came to the Ministry.  Does he have any other countries on board supporting him on the issue of discards?<\/p><p>In the area of regionalisation one size does not fit all for Irish fishermen but it is an important issue on the agenda.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: We worked hard during the Danish EU Council Presidency, which was before the current Cypriot Presidency, to get a Common Position on discards by the end of the Presidency, which was the end of June this year.  There is a basic agreement in principle on how to address discards.  However, dealing with the pelagic sector is different from dealing with the whitefish sector and there is a recognition of this, in particular in the whitefish sector, in which there are mixed fisheries.  For example, off the south coast of Ireland at Dunmore East if one is catching cod, one is also likely to catch haddock and whiting in the same net.  When adult fish species are the same size and a fisherman has a quota to catch two types but not the third, what does he do when he catches all three in the one net?  These are complex problems that we must try to solve through more technical measures and more targeted fishing gear.  It is one thing to deal with the juvenile fish issue.  One can deal with it through measures such as mesh size to allow smaller fish to escape, but in mixed fisheries where one is likely to catch multiple species in the one net because the fish are roughly the same size there are complex problems relating to the management of discards.  We are trying to find flexible ways of doing that, minimising discards and ultimately eliminating them altogether.  I believe we will be able to do that.<\/p><p>It will be possible to do this before June but it will be challenging because there are deep divisions on some of these issues between member states, some of which are driven by the sustainability arguments while others are driven by the fishing industry.  I maintain that they have a common interest and it will be our job during the Irish Presidency to try to bring the two sides together and to agree compromise positions.<\/p><p>5.Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanaganasked theMinister for Agriculture, Food and the Marinehis plans for Castlerea Town Trust, Cow Park Trust, County Roscommon; his position regarding appointing new trustees to such a trust; and if he will make a statement on the matter.[56184\/12]<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: I am pleased that the Deputy has asked this question because we discussed it some weeks ago.  I am pleased that I have managed to bring the issue forward since that discussion.  I wish to make clear at the outset that my reply relates to the public trust set up in 1919 under the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts.  To avoid confusion, my Department refers to it as the Castlerea Public Trust because there is another private trust bordering the trust in Castlerea.  The Castlerea Public Trust land is registered on folio No. 13684 County Roscommon in the names of the trustees.<\/p><p>Public trusts vest the trust land in the trustees and provide that day-to-day operational matters relating to the public trust are dealt with by the trustees, appointed from time to time.  As Minister, I retain certain residual powers, mainly set out in section 30 of the Land Act 1950.  These powers are to appoint the trustees; to alter or amend the terms of the trust; to agree to proposals from the trustees regarding disposal in whole or in part of the trust; and revocation of the trust if it is not being used for its intended purposes.<\/p><p>Castlerea Public Trust was originally created as a cow park trust, where local landless people could graze a cow.  With the passage of time as Castlerea town has developed, part of the trust lands close to Market Square have been used by local people for recreational purposes and there are several paths and walkways traversing the trust lands.<\/p><p>As Minister, I am solely empowered to appoint trustees to these Land Act trusts.  The existing trustees notify my Department when any appointments are necessary and they also nominate names of persons suitable and willing to act as trustees.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): Minister, the remainder of the reply can be read into the record because there is quite a bit to go.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: If the Deputy prefers I will get to the meat of it.<\/p><p>Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan: Yes, please.  If the Minster could do so I would be keen to hear what he has to say.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: I have only half a page left.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): Okay, but it lessens your time for supplementary questions.<\/p><p>Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan: I will chat to the Minister afterwards.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: The minimum number of trustees in this trust is five and the maximum number is 12.  It is important that the replacement trustees are nominated by and acceptable to existing trustees to ensure the harmonious work of the trust.  This is especially important in Castlerea because at present the people who are the trustees of the Castlerea Public Trust lands are also trustees of the contiguous private trust lands.<\/p><p>In the case of Castlerea Public Trust, new trustee nominations were recently submitted to me.  I have not as yet appointed these nominated parties because I believe it is necessary for the existing trustees to carry out a comprehensive review of the operation of the trust and address in particular the need to modernise the use of the trust from mainly pasturage to accommodate general recreational use.  When this review has been completed, I will consider the nomination and replacement of trustees, who may bring additional community value and reflect any new direction established for the use of the trust lands.  This will entail the trustees liaising with community leaders for the ongoing development, preservation and increased community use of the important local amenity.<\/p><p>It is my policy generally with Land Act trusts that where agreement can be reached locally, ownership of the trust lands should be transferred to a community company or a co-operative representative of local communities.  I endeavour to seek consensus not confrontation in carrying through such a transfer.  I am mindful of the fact that the trustees in Castlerea and their predecessors in title have preserved and developed this trust since 1919 as a significant amenity for the area and I hope to be able to move this process forward in a positive way.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): There are only two minutes remaining for this question.<\/p><p>Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan: I do not often come into the House and praise the previous Government.  I hope I can do likewise for this Government.  The former Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, stated in this House: \"The ... trust does not appear to be answerable to anybody, is not elected, refuses to discuss the business of the town demesne with any local representative group\".  That was possibly the first time that the former Minister of State chimed with the people of Castlerea.<\/p><p>In 2005, 1,300 people wrote to the then Minister with responsibility for agriculture asking her to revoke the trust.  While she did not do so, she did not appoint any new trustees.  This has led to the situation whereby there are now only five trustees remaining.  If that number falls below five, it will not be possible to obtain a quorum for a meeting, at which point action will have to be taken.  When I heard that an attempt had been made to appoint new trustees, I contacted the Minister whom I thank for taking the time to speak to me on what I know was a busy day for him.<\/p><p>More people have now written to the Minister.  I understand some 1,300 people have done so and that there are a further 280 letters on the way to the Minister asking him not to appoint new members to the trust, to let it fall and, if needs be, to use his powers to revoke the trust.  When the Minister's officials last visited the trust, they outlined the future of the cow park trust in view of the fact that the main objective of the original trust had now ceased.  They also informed it of the 1,300 letters received by the Minister, which had been organised by then Councillor Flanagan, and said that as a public official the Minister could not ignore them.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): Time for this question has elapsed.<\/p><p>Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan: The purpose of the trust has ceased.  As such, an opportunity to revoke it exists.  It is hoped the Minister will do this.  People in my town are united on their right to have a say in their own future and destiny.  I hope the Minister will facilitate that.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): We must move on.<\/p><p>Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan: I thank the Minister for what he has done thus far.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: I am not sure everybody will get what they want but we are moving towards resolving the matter.<\/p><p>Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan: All we want is openness and accountability.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: That is what is happening.  I turned around a situation about which the Deputy was very unhappy.<\/p><p>Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan: Yes.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: We have created time and space to try to find a solution.<\/p><p>Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan: Thank you.<\/p><p>6.Deputy Michael P. Kittasked theMinister for Agriculture, Food and the Marineif he would favour a limit on the amount of money being paid to any one farmer under the single farm payment of the Common Agricultural Policy 2014-2020; the ceiling he thinks would be appropriate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.[55990\/12]<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: This question is in the name of Deputy Kitt, although I suspect it comes from Deputy \u00d3 Cu\u00edv.  It relates to whether we should be setting ceilings on future single farm payments.  Before considering whether we should be setting caps on single farm payments, we first need to know that we have the capacity to do so.  I have been supportive of the Commissioner's proposals to cap single farm payments.  This would result in a reduction in payment on amounts in excess of \u20ac150,000.  I would like to see the cap set lower than \u20ac150,000.  I have stated that I would have no difficulty with a cap on payments of approximately \u20ac100,000.  I recognise that we must find a common solution across the European Union which all countries can accept and live with.  In my view, a number of the larger powerful countries, such as, for example, Germany and Britain, will not accept a cap on single farm payments because they have large landowners who are big commercial food producers who are receiving large payments and they want to see that continue.<\/p><p>Ireland is in a different situation.  I need to ensure the flexibility countries are given in relation to the capping issue suits Ireland.  Once a final deal is done and, if we have the capacity on a voluntary basis, country by country, to be able to set caps on single farm payments, we can then have this discussion and try to get this right.  I do not have a problem with that in principle but we need to be careful not to push the cap too low because we have large commercial farmers we need to support.  We will have an opportunity at a later stage, when we know the options, to be able to debate and discuss this issue and then make the most informed decision.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: Perhaps the Minister will indicate the overall budgetary position for CAP funding.  There appears to be some doubt about what that figure will be.  Will we be dealing with a reduced provision in 2013 or is it likely the budgetary situation will deteriorate with the passage of time?  The envelope available for distribution to primary producers in Ireland will be determined by the budgetary position.  There are various proposals floating around concerning the multi-annual financial framework for 2014 to 2020 - the long-term budget plan.  The danger in this context is that provision for CAP funding may well be reduced and that the Irish envelope will suffer as a result.  Perhaps the Minister would appraise the House of the up-to-date position.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: Two sets of negotiations are ongoing.  The first concerns negotiations on the overall budget, the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, as referred to by the Deputy.  We failed collectively last month as a European Union to get agreement on the MFF.  This budget is for seven years and is worth more than \u20ac1 trillion.  There was a wide variation in what countries wanted in terms of the levels of reduction or increases to that budget.  For example, Britain wanted cuts of up to \u20ac200 billion.  President Van Rompuy proposed cuts of approximately \u20ac80 billion.  As the negotiations proceeded, the different budget lines within the budget were being debated in terms of which might take cuts and which might not.  There are three big budget lines.  CAP represents approximately 38 to 40% of the budget.  Cohesion Funds represent one third of the budget and innovation and research and development also account for a large chunk of it.<\/p><p>Ireland has been trying to prevent a significant reduction in the overall MFF funding.  If there are to be cuts, we will seek to protect the CAP budget within that.  Some 85% of all EU money coming into Ireland comes through CAP.  This amounts to approximately \u20ac1.6 billion per annum.  We had some success in the negotiations.  At one stage, it looked like there was going to be a cut to CAP of approximately 6% or 7% in terms of pillar 1 and about 11% in pillar 2.  By the end of the discussions, this had been reduced to a 3% cut in pillar 1, which was progress.  The difference was about \u20ac8 billion across the Union.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): There is only one minute remaining for this question.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: We hope to conclude the MFF discussions during the Irish Presidency of the European Council at a Heads of State meeting to be held on 7 February.  It is likely to be the next big summit meeting on the MFF.  If we can get the budget agreed in February, it may be possible to get the CAP reform finalised before the end of the Irish Presidency.  If we cannot get the MFF agreed in February, it will be difficult, in terms of the timescale, to do this.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: In terms of the eventual template or formula to be put in place for Ireland, a serious difficulty is arising in terms of the age profile of people involved in the agriculture industry in Ireland.  As regards incentives and support under CAP to encourage young people to get involved and become participants in the future of the agriculture industry, how does the Minister see this unfolding?<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: This issue is the subject of Question No. 9, at which point I will respond to those questions.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): We now move on to Question No. 7.<\/p><p>7.Deputy \u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edvasked theMinister for Agriculture, Food and the Marinethe progress made to date with discussions in relation to the re-establishment of a sugar industry here including the growing of sugar beet for sugar production; the steps he has taken to promote this industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.[55991\/12]<\/p><p>Deputy Tom Barry: I have a problem with this question.  It is an absolute disgrace that this question has been tabled.  The question asks the Minister what steps he is taking to promote the sugar industry.  I have news for the Deputies opposite: we do not have a sugar industry.  It is an insult to people like me and others who grew beet and worked in the factories that Members opposite would table a question like this.<\/p><p>(Speaker Continuing)<\/p><p>&#91; Deputy Tom Barry: &#93; It is absolutely unbelievable.  Why do we not have an industry?  We do not have an industry because a Fianna F\u00e1il Minister in a Government of which Deputy \u00d3 Cu\u00edv was a member shut it down and absolutely ruined our countryside.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): I must ask the Deputy-----<\/p><p>Deputy Tom Barry: I understand that but it is insulting to those of us who tried to maintain the industry.  I could spend ten minutes talking about why we do not have a sugar industry and I am upset that Deputy \u00d3 Cu\u00edv is not here to respond to me.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): This is out of order, Deputy.  I ask Deputy Barry to resume his seat.<\/p><p>Deputy Tom Barry: I will resume my seat but it is an absolute disgrace that Deputy \u00d3 Cu\u00edv tabled this question and his colleagues know that.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): Deputy Barry, you cannot-----<\/p><p>Deputy Tom Barry: It is insulting for those of us who have suffered.  I am not going to allow this sort of behaviour.  The Deputy tabled a question but he knew damn well-----<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: Deputy Barry is totally out of order.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): The conduct of the Chamber is my responsibility.<\/p><p>Deputy Tom Barry: I understand that.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): I ask the Deputy to resume his seat.  The Ceann Comhairle has listed the questions for oral answer and I am obliged to deal with the questions and invite the answers.<\/p><p>Deputy Tom Barry: I understand that but the Deputies on the other side know that their party was responsible for closing down the sugar industry.  It is a disgrace-----<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): That is a discussion for outside this House.<\/p><p>Deputy Tom Barry: The Fianna F\u00e1il Deputies brought it inside the House.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): Deputy, please.  I call on the Minister.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: I can understand my colleague's frustration, as somebody who comes from a town where the sugar industry provided huge employment and significant opportunities for arable farmers in particular, that the industry is now no longer in existence because of policy decisions and mistakes that were made a number of years ago.  That being said, I think it is possible for us to revive the sugar industry, but only if a number of things happen.<\/p><p>First of all, I have made it clear that the Government is not going to subsidise the setting up of a new sugar industry because we need to ensure that any new industry that begins in Ireland again can stand on its own two feet.  However, I believe there is a fighting chance that the sugar industry will be set up again in Ireland on a commercial basis.  Last summer we had two very professionally put together viability studies for the setting up of a sugar industry in Ireland again, from a processing point of view, which would involve building a large sugar processing plant and ethanol production facility.  There are a number of people who are extremely committed to making this happen and they are very credible people.  Michael Hoey, in particular, who heads up Beet Ireland, has put a huge amount of his own resources and time into putting together a very realistic business plan for rebuilding a sugar processing sector in Ireland.  It is his job to put the business case together and he will do that, in terms of attracting investors and so forth.  It is my job to ensure that if that business case is to proceed that there is either a sugar quota for Ireland in the future or there is no sugar quota in the European Union.<\/p><p>The current sugar regime in the EU will end in 2015 and Ireland has already been compensated to get out of that regime to the tune of \u20ac353 million.  That means that we are not going to be able to produce sugar before 2015.  The Commission is proposing that the sugar quota regime would end in 2015, which is something that Ireland supports.  However, I do not think it is realistic because the countries that currently have sugar quota will insist on the quota regime extending beyond 2015, in my view, possibly until 2018 or 2020.  In that context, we will be seeking an opportunity for Ireland to be allocated quota for domestic use, given the fact that we have been compensated to be out of the sugar industry until 2015 but not beyond that.  Given the size of our food industry here and the volume of sugar use in that industry, we should be allowed a sugar quota to be able to support it.  We have made a very strong case for this, both publicly and privately, to the Commission.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: If there is potential to rebuild and regenerate the sugar industry in Ireland then clearly steps should be taken to do so.  As the Minister has said, at least one feasibility study has been carried out-----<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: Two studies have been carried out.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: Have those feasibility studies been made available to the Minister?<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: Yes.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: Have the studies been assessed by those who are dealing with the possibility of regenerating the sugar industry and if so, what does the assessment indicate?  Is there a potential for the industry, provided certain things happen and if they do not happen, what is the position?  What is our competitive position vis-\u00e0-vis other sugar producing countries across the EU?<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: The feasibility studies were very professionally done.  Both of them were presented to me and both of them involved detailed meetings around the presentation of those feasibility studies.  We then asked officials in the economics section of my Department to assess the feasibility of the business plans.  It is important to say, though, that in order for those business plans to be viable, the price of processed sugar must remain at a level that can pay for all of this because we are talking about a &#8364;200 million investment to build the plant before any sugar beet can be processed to produce either ethanol or sugar.  It is probably fair to say, as a rule of thumb, that these feasibility studies stack up if the price of sugar remains at over &#8364;500 per tonne.  It is well over that level at the moment and actually, in the last 12 months, it was close to &#8364;800 per tonne because there were real shortages of sugar in the European Union.  A lot of food industries in Ireland, some from my own part of the country, were finding it hard to get sugar at any price, which suggests that there is an argument around sugar security for both the pharmaceutical and food industries.  Having said that, a judgment has to be made by the investors and those putting the business plan together as to what the likely sugar price will be in three, five or ten years time and what the price will be if sugar quotas are abolished in the European Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When we were producing sugar in Ireland we were not particularly competitive vis-\u00e0-vis other parts of Europe in terms of the tonnage of beet per hectare we were growing and the sugar content.  However, I believe we can be much more competitive now and the proof of that can be seen in the United Kingdom at the moment.  The varieties of sugar beet being grown there are highly competitive with other parts of Europe and there is no reason Ireland could not benefit from that.  We can be competitive in this area but whether this happens will be contingent on where world sugar prices go.  In my view, they are not likely to collapse any time soon.  Sugar is in strong demand because consumption will continue to grow, both in the European Union and, more important, further afield.<\/p><p>8.Deputy Charlie McConalogueasked theMinister for Agriculture, Food and the Marinethe position regarding the proposed sale of the Coillte forest crop; and if he will make a statement on the matter.[55980\/12]<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: The Deputy's question concerns the current position with regard to Coillte.  Deputies will know that the Government made a decision in principle to move ahead with preparing for and investigating the possibility of a sale of Coillte forests.  Essentially this involves selling the harvesting rights to commercial Coillte forests and the investigative and preparatory process is under way.  Work is ongoing between Coillte, NewEra - which is managing this process - and my Department.  Consultants have also been brought in to do specific work around valuations and managing how the sales process may proceed, with the aim of maximising the value to the State, if value is to be found, as well as taking account of the other sectors that may be impacted by such a sale, such as the sawmill sector and timber supply generally, which is totally dominated by Coillte at the moment.  This is a very complex process which we are in the middle of at the moment but I assure Deputies that the Government will act with caution.  We will not do anything that will undermine or significantly damage the timber or sawmill sectors in Ireland.  Effectively, we have a monopoly in Coillte at the moment.  Most sawmills take more than 80% of their timber from Coillte forests.  If we proceed with this, we will do so with caution to try to protect other sectors that will be affected by any sale, while at the same time trying to maximise value for the State.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: Are we to deduce from what the Minister has said that no decision has been taken yet as to what will happen with Coillte?<\/p><p>(Speaker Continuing)<\/p><p>&#91; Deputy Seamus Kirk: &#93; I assume that the decision on selling it has not been taken and that the process of assessment is continuing.  I ask the Minister to clarify that issue.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: The Government decision was straightforward.  We are not selling the company or the land.  The principal decision was to investigate and, if it makes sense to do so, proceed with the sale of harvesting rights for Coillte forests.  This would involve selling crops early, just like farmers might sell 30% of their barley crops before they are mature.  This is one option for realising the value of State assets, that is, the standing timber on State-owned land managed by Coillte, at a time when we need cashflow.  In the context of that sale, a range of complex issues arise which need to be addressed if we are to proceed with our plans.  The only decision that the Government has taken is that we will prepare for the sales process with a view to making a decision in the new year on whether it makes sense to continue the process in terms of realising value for the State without compromising strategic assets.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: The sale of immature timber will have profound implications for the saw milling sector, which employs a significant number despite the recession.  I understand the downturn in the economy has had a minimal effect on the numbers employed in the sector thanks to the flexibility of both employers and employees.  I ask the Minister for his assurance that the employment prospects and long-term viability of the saw milling sector will be borne in mind in any decision taken.<\/p><p>Deputy John Browne: I get the impression that the Minister is not jumping over the moon about selling Coillte.  The timber industry is very important for the saw milling sector but I am sure he will accept that the 18 million people who visit Coillte forests every year are also important in terms of recreation and environmental matters.  Does he agree that the proposal to sell the forest assets owned by Coillte presents a serious threat to the use of forests by the people?  It is an issue about which we are all concerned and I have received a considerable number of e-mails from groups which use Coillte forests for recreation and environmental matters.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: As I noted earlier, if we proceed with the sales process, we intend to protect the State assets, in other words, the common good element of State-owned forests in terms of the land on which they sit.  That includes public access.  Most of the forests to which there is public access are not commercial crops.  At least 25% of Coillte's estate comprises mature broadleaf forest primarily used for recreation.  That will remain the case.  These forests will remain in the ownership of the State and under the management of Coillte.  The sale will involve standing commercial timber and we will proceed with caution and in a way that is consistent with the Government's decision.<\/p><p>9.Deputy Dara Callearyasked theMinister for Agriculture, Food and the Marinethe steps he has taken to address the age profile imbalance in the farming industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.[55959\/12]<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: Many people find it extraordinary that more farmers are over the age of 80 than under the age of 35.  That is no basis for the kind of ambition we share for growth and innovation in the sector.  This is not to imply there are no good farmers who are older than 80.  Many of them are wise people who can teach the new generation.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: They have accumulated experience.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: Large numbers of young people are enrolled in agricultural colleges.  Over the past six years, the number has increased from 600 to 1,450 per year.  There has been a dramatic increase in the number of young men and women who want to get into farming and we need to offer them a future.  That is why an Irish proposal was taken on by the Commission as part of the Common Agricultural Policy reform to ask countries to set aside 2% of pillar 1 single farm payment money over the next five years for top-up payments for young farmers under the age of 40.  In other words, single farm payments for young farmers under the age of 40 will be topped up by 25%, up to a maximum of five years.  It is like an installation aid scheme except that it is sponsored by European money.  Ireland's proposal was supported by Hungary and the Commission has taken it on.  Irrespective of whether it is mandatory or voluntary, it will be implemented if I am still Minister.  We need to support young farmers in terms of giving them a financial advantage to allow them to invest in expanding their businesses.  That will boost the realisation of the targets in Food Harvest 2020.  Pillar 2 also provides opportunities to support young farmers through a series of programmes supported by rural development funds.<\/p><p>In terms of national policy, despite all the difficult decisions taken in the budget, we acted strategically to support young farmers by encouraging the consolidation of farms, and maintaining the preferential treatment they get in terms of stock relief, exemption from stamp duty and partnerships where sons and daughters work with their parents to manage the farm.  A number of positive initiatives are being taken in the interests of young farmers to address the generational problem.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: Does the Minister agree that we need to develop a public policy position which would also involve Revenue and other Departments?  The prospects for young farmers having access to land other than by leasing arrangements are limited and unless they win the lotto or inherit large sums of money, they are often unable to buy the sort of acreage that would rapidly create a viable holding.  Does the Minister see a need for a co-ordinated approach to stock relief, leasing arrangements and special tax breaks for those who own the land to ensure young people who graduate from agricultural colleges can seamlessly enter the industry and provide the energy it clearly needs?<\/p><p>Deputy James Bannon: I listened with interest to the Minister's comments on educational facilities for young farmers.  Quality education is key to developing Irish agriculture and giving it a competitive edge in Europe.  The Minister may be aware, however, that at least six agricultural colleges closed across the midlands during my lifetime.  There is a significant deficit in terms of educational facilities.  I have raised this issue in the House in respect of the midlands and Deputy Kirk's area.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): The Deputy's point has been well made.  Will he, please, allow the Minister to respond?<\/p><p>Deputy James Bannon: There is a huge deficit in the north of the country.  Does the Minister have plans to provide a new agricultural facility in the midlands or further north?<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: I agree with the Deputy that agricultural colleges, universities and institutes of technology that offer strong food and agricultural courses are hugely important.  We do not have plans to build new agricultural colleges.  What happened was that there was a dramatic fall-off in the numbers of young men, in particular, going to agricultural colleges.  As a result, some of the colleges closed and there was huge pressure to close others.  I remember sitting in a committee room trying to persuade policymakers that we should not be shutting colleges such as Rockwell, Gurteen, Clonakilty and others.  Fortunately, that did not happen and now these colleges are operating at full capacity.  Buildings are not the problem.  The problem is the availability of adequate staffing and expertise.<\/p><p>Deputy James Bannon: Multyfarnham and Warrenstown which were fine colleges were closed.  As a result, there is no agricultural facility in the midlands and no place in which to educate its young farmers.  I plead with the Minister to look at this issue.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): That would be an excellent subject for a Topical Issue debate.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: All of the agricultural colleges have dorm facilities.  Therefore, having to attend an agricultural college in another part of the country is not a disaster.  I went to Gurteen agricultural college, which is a long way from where I live in Cork, and had a really good year there.  I probably learned more in that year about farming than I did during my three year degree programme in agricultural science.  It works well when people from different parts of the country move to other parts where they can meet different types of farmers with whom they can live and learn while in agricultural college.<\/p><p>10.Deputy Michael Moynihanasked theMinister for Agriculture, Food and the Marinethe number of farmers who successfully applied for the sheep grassland scheme in 2012, broken down by county; the total anticipated savings in the Budget 2013 changes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.[55970\/12]<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: I mentioned this issue earlier in connection with a matter raised by Deputy Martin Ferris.  I would like to explain the decisions taken in last week's budget on the sheep grassland scheme.  We had a three year grassland scheme which was costing the country approximately \u20ac18 million a year, using unspent funds under Pillar 1.  The aim of the scheme and the idea behind it was to increase the number of sheep being farmed in Ireland because for ten years in a row the flock decreased in size year after year.  We had to try to reverse that trend.  I am delighted to be able to say the scheme has contributed significantly to reversing it and for the first time in a decade, the flock is bigger this year.  Therefore, the scheme has worked well.<\/p><p>I now want to try what I know has worked in other sectors, particularly in the dairy sector, in which we have seen the benefit of discussion groups.  In the dairy sector dairy farmers meet on a monthly basis in what they might call &quot;dairy discussion groups&quot; to discuss how their business works and how their animals are performing and everything else.  The issues discussed include fertility, grazing, feed conversion efficiency, stock management and so on.  The evidence we have from the groups is that, on average, farmers who attend them have increased their profit margins by somewhere between 4% and 5%.  I want to see the same benefits in the sheep sector.  The sheep grassland scheme was due to end this year, but we have chosen to extend it into next year.  We will spend \u20ac14 million on it next year and use \u20ac3 million from the budget to initiate a sheep discussion group model to encourage sheep farmers to enter the type of discussion group setting that has worked so well for the dairy and beef sectors in order that we can help sheep farmers to make more in the market place rather than rely on schemes for an income.  This is a progressive measure.  It is about using money in the most progressive way we can, given the problems we face.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: Despite the Minister's protestations, the reality is that the budgetary provision for the scheme is going downhill.  Once he starts to reduce the funds available-----<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: It is not.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: The fund is being reduced from \u20ac18 million to \u20ac14 million.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: It is going from \u20ac18 million to \u20ac17 million, when we include the \u20ac3 million being transferred for the sheep discussion groups<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: I take it there has been an assessment of expenditure under the scheme by the Department.  What has been the result of that assessment?  Has the expenditure been justified?  Obviously, the Minister has decided to change direction.  Should there be a continuation of the financial support provided under the original scheme?<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: The scheme has been a success on a number of levels.  We had seen sheep numbers reduce year on year and were getting to a stage where the perception was developing that a farmer could not make money from sheep farming.  We had to put a scheme in place to help farmers to make more money from responsible sheep production and that was the origin of the sheep grassland scheme which was a three year scheme.  This was to be the last year of the scheme.  We believe it makes sense to continue it but to divert some of the money towards a discussion group model that we know has worked well for other sectors in order that, as well as supporting the income of sheep farmers and the quality of production, we can help upskill them to ensure they are maximising the potential of their holdings and the returns they obtain.  That is what discussion groups do.<\/p><p>Although farmers have seen this move as a cut to the sheep grassland scheme, they should instead look at it in the round and realise that while there is a slight reduction in financial support for the scheme, there is a new opportunity for them to sign up to participate in a sheep discussion group through which they will be paid \u20ac1,000 a year to attend meetings and participate in discussions that will help them to run a more effective lamb and sheep production business.  That is a good use of the money.<\/p><p>Deputy Mick Wallace: On the issue of schemes, I notice the suckler cow welfare scheme has been done away with.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: Is the Deputy trying to get in early?<\/p><p>Deputy Mick Wallace: I realise this is a slightly different issue, but small farmers have contacted me about it.  Producing suckler cows has been a way of life for them and even if they do not make money one year, they stay in the business because it is their way of life.  The ending of the scheme is a huge blow for many small farmers who have depended on this money.  The allowance used to be \u20ac80 which was cut to \u20ac40 and now it is \u20ac20, payable on a maximum of 20 animals.  There is significant work involved for the farmers concerned.  Last week I spoke to a farmer who had gone through all his records for his animals, including date of birth, date of tagging of cow and calf, the rate of calving, the date of dehorning, the date of castration, date of meal introduction and so on.  He needs three bags of meal for just one calf.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: None of that comes under the scheme we are discussing.<\/p><p>Deputy Mick Wallace: The farmer also mentioned he had to feed a calf meal for six weeks before he could part with it.  The scheme was a very good one for the industry and made sense.  Sadly, its demise will hit small farmers more than big farmers.  It is a pity it is going.  I, therefore, suggest the Minister should reconsider the matter.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): To use a golf analogy, the Deputy is out of bounds on this question.  However, the Minister seems to be willing to respond.<\/p><p>Deputy Mick Wallace: We need a flexible Acting Chairman.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: If the Acting Chairman allows, I will be happy to answer the question.  There are only the four of us in the Chamber.  The media have probably long since gone to bed.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): I feel I am in Gurteen to gain an education.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: This is a serious issue.  I hope I have answered the questions on sheep farming.  I answered questions on the beef sector for Deputy Martin Ferris, but I will respond to Deputy Mick Wallace.  I am not targeting the small guys.  The new scheme we are putting in place - a \u20ac10 million scheme - will ensure farmers with 20 or fewer suckler cows will receive payments on all of them.  We made this provision deliberately to ensure smaller farmers would receive their payments first.  The bigger farmers, with more than 20 animals, may receive payment on more than 20 animals, if there is money left over as I suspect there will be at the end of the process.<\/p><p>(Speaker Continuing)<\/p><p>&#91; Deputy Simon Coveney: &#93;   The other aspect is that the new scheme does not requires farmers to do anything other than transfer data relating to the breeding and fertility of their animals to the ICBF.  We are not asking them to do all the other things they would have been paid for before.  In other words, they are being asked to do a fraction of what they were asked to do before and they are being paid \u20ac20 per cow rather than \u20ac40 per cow.  It is important for the Deputy to understand that the total amount of money going into the beef sector next year will not be very different from what went into the beef sector this year.  That is because under the existing suckler cow welfare scheme, at least \u20ac10 million is to be paid next year in respect of calves that were born in the second half of this year.  When that \u20ac10 million is taken with the \u20ac10 million we will spend on the new data transfer scheme and the \u20ac5 million we will spend on beef discussion groups - farmers will be given \u20ac1,000 to attend meetings and learn about how they can run their businesses more effectively - it means we will be spending \u20ac25 million on the beef sector next year.  Most of that will be spent in the suckler beef sector.  We spent approximately \u20ac27 million in the beef sector this year.  It is important for farmers to get this into context.  Since the budget, there has been a blunt focus on arguing that the abolition of the suckler cow welfare scheme is a disaster.  I suggest there should be a concentration on what we are putting in place to replace it.  The State will be putting almost as much money into the suckler sector next year as it has put into it this year.  We are prioritising small farmers in that mix.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: Can the Minister tell us the number of suckler cows in the national herd?  What is the position at the moment?  What was it in each of the last three years?  What is the trend?<\/p><p>Deputy Mick Wallace: I take the Minister's point.  I have been listening to a couple of farmers who will be seriously affected by this change.  They were getting \u20ac80.  I know the Minister is saying they will have less work to do now in terms of documentation and registration, etc., but they did not mind doing the work.  That is what these small farmers were used to doing.  It was a good idea for them to keep records like this.  I do not know if they will have to do as much feeding under the new scheme.  The level of feeding they had to do under the old scheme made sense.  It is pretty draconian for a small farmer to have the payment he gets for each calf reduced from \u20ac80 to \u20ac20.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: The point is that they are being asked to do a fraction of what they were previously asked to do.  I agree that this was a great scheme.  It improved the quality of suckler beef in Ireland and brought about significant changes in areas like animal husbandry, data collection and the general performance of those animals.  While I would have put a new scheme in place anyway, I would have liked to have had more money to spend on building up the suckler cow welfare scheme.  I hope we will be able to spend more money in this area in the future.  When the new Common Agricultural Policy is in place, I hope we will be able to fund a larger scheme than the one to be implemented next year.  It is important to understand that all of the \u20ac25 million being spent in this sector will go to farmers.  It may go to different farmers next year.  It is important to recognise that contrary to what some farmers have claimed, there will be no dramatic reduction in the money going into this sector, all of which will go to farmers as I have said.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): We must finish on that note.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: I will conclude by responding to the point made by Deputy Kirk.  Half of the beef in Ireland comes from the suckler herd and the other half comes from the dairy herd.  As I have said on many occasions, if we do not support the suckler herd, beef will simply become a by-product of the dairy industry as it expands and grows in the context of the elimination of quotas in 2015.  I do not want that to happen because all of the real quality Irish beef comes from the suckler herd.  It is delivered by the bloodlines and the breeding.  That is why this sector needs additional support.  I hope we will be able to provide it in the context of the new Common Agricultural Policy.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: I would like to make a brief point about the scheduling of Question Time, particularly on Thursdays.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): We have gone over time.<\/p><p>Deputy Seamus Kirk: I will be brief.  The questions we have been discussing this evening relate to what is probably the most important industry in the country.  I do not have a problem with being here after 8 p.m.  If some of the earlier business had not finished ahead of schedule, however, Question Time would not have started yet.  It was not due to start until 8.45 p.m.  I assure the Minister that I am not carping when I say that the Whips need to examine the arrangements for the scheduling of the business of the House, particularly on Thursday evenings.  I am saying this in the context of agriculture questions, but it applies to other areas as well.  We should be able to revert to the traditional afternoon slot for Question Time.<\/p><p>Deputy Simon Coveney: I assure the Deputy that would have been my preference as well.<\/p><p>Acting Chairman (Deputy Peter Mathews): It would have been mine too.  As I said earlier, at least I got the benefit of a lovely plate of sole.  I thank those who posed the questions and the Minister who replied to them.  I thank the Clerk and the staff for their attendance.<\/p><p>Written Answers follow Adjournment.<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il adjourned at 8.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 14 December 2012.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355416200,"counter":1134,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355416200,"counter":1135,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment No. 179: Title: In page 5, lines 21 to 24, to delete all words from and including &quot;TO&quot; in line 21 down to and including &quot;MATTERS&quot; in line 24 and substitute the following:&quot;TO PROVIDE FOR MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS RELATING TO CREDIT UNIONS; TO AMEND THE CENTRAL BANK ACTS 1942 TO 2011, TO PROVIDE FOR CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE CENTRAL BANK OF IRELAND AND OVERSEAS REGULATORS AND TO PROVIDE FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF AUTHORISED OFFICERS BY THE CENTRAL BANK OF IRELAND; AND TO PROVIDE FOR MATTERS RELATED TO THE FOREGOING&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355416200,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>Seanad amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1137,"content":"<p>Agreement to Seanad amendments will be reported to the House and a message will be sent to Seanad \u00c9ireann acquainting it accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#QQ04600","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1138,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies opposite for the constructive role they played at all Stages of this legislation.

This directive, known informally as the gender goods and services directive, implements the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services.  In its decision of 1 March 2011, in case C-236\/09 taken by a Belgian consumer rights organisation, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared that Article 5(2) of this directive was invalid, with effect from 21 December 2012.  This decision, known as the Test-Achats ruling, is binding on all member states of the European Union.  The provision thus struck down had allowed an exception from the principle of equal treatment enunciated in the regulation so that insurance companies could price life and motor insurance products differently for men and women, where this difference is reasonable and supported by actuarial or statistical data.<\/p><p>  Ireland availed of this exemption in the Equal Status Act 2000, permitting gender differentiation to continue in the areas of motor insurance, life assurance, critical illness cover, income protection cover, and private annuities and pensions.  The effect of the ruling is that Ireland is obliged to prohibit by law the selling of private insurance products which differentiate by gender on price or benefits and to have such provisions in force on or before 21 December 2012.  The unisex rule will apply to all contracts concluded for the first time as and from that date.  It also applies to agreements between parties, as and from 21 December 2012, to extend contracts concluded before that date which would otherwise have expired.<\/p><p>  The European Commission has issued guidelines on the application of this judgment on national legislation transposing directive 2004\/113 and on insurance industry practice.  I have taken due regard to this guidance and to the intention stated in the directive to avoid sudden readjustment of the insurance market in determining the amendments to the Equal Status Acts necessary to comply with this ruling.  As I will explain shortly, these amendments are largely technical in nature.  For me and for my colleagues in Government, this ruling highlights the crucial importance of achieving legal clarity in the drafting of legislation at European level to ensure that such instruments are interpreted and have the intended impact. <\/p><p>  The Government is conscious of the potential for confusion and misinformation among consumers and insurance providers alike resulting from these changes to the private insurance market.  For this reason, in October the Department published an information note for consumers on the new rules on the permitted use of gender by insurance providers and sources of further information and advice.  The information note is widely available through public information channels such as the Citizens Information Board.  I would like to express thanks to the industry bodies - the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Brokers Association, the Professional Insurance Brokers Association and the Society of Actuaries in Ireland - who contributed to the preparation of this advice for consumers.  I also thank the Department of Finance, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Social Protection, the Central Bank, the National Consumer Agency, the Citizens' Information Board, the Pensions Board, the Equality Authority and the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau.<\/p><p>  I would now like to highlight some of the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for amendment of section 5 of the Equal Status Act 2000.  It limits the existing derogation from the prohibition on gender discrimination in specified insurance products, provided in section 5 of the Equal Status Act, to contracts concluded before 21 December 2012.  This is to ensure the prohibition on gender-differentiated insurance, with effect from 21 December 2012, does not affect existing contracts lawfully entered into before that date.  The scope of the prohibition is then expanded by providing in a new subsection (4A) that all contracts within the categories of motor or life insurance concluded for the first time as and from 21 December 2012 must comply with the unisex rule.  For the avoidance of doubt and because to determine otherwise would result in a sudden readjustment of the motor insurance market, contrary to the intention of the directive, the second paragraph of the new subsection provides that mid-term adjustments to motor insurance contracts concluded before 21 December 2012 are not considered to be new contracts for this purpose.<\/p><p>  Finally, this section provides that the obligation imposed on the Central Bank of Ireland to compile, maintain and publish data to support the existing derogation ceases to have effect from 21 December 2012, while not affecting its obligation to maintain and publish data compiled before that date.  Consequential to the cessation of this obligation, section 5 provides for the amendment of section 41 of the principal Act.  It has the effect of terminating the Minister's power, which is no longer required, to make regulations with regard to the data to be compiled, published and maintained by the Central Bank.<\/p><p>  Section 3 provides for amendment of section 14 of the principal Act to clarify that insurance providers may continue to collect, store and use gender status or gender-related information which is genuinely intended for the purposes of reserving and internal pricing, reinsurance pricing, and life and health underwriting.  For example, it is envisaged that insurance providers may continue to gather and use gender data in connection with offering gender-specific insurance products and options within contracts to cover conditions which exclusively or primarily concern males or females, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer.<\/p><p>  I have also taken the opportunity afforded in this Bill to address a minor procedural issue regarding equal status complaints referred to the Equality Tribunal for mediation.  Section 4 provides for amendment of section 24 of the Equal Status Acts to extend the time available to persons who have referred such complaints to apply for resumption of the hearing in instances where mediation has not resolved the dispute between the parties.  The amendment will extend the period, after the issue of a notice of non-resolution, within which a complainant is allowed to make an application in writing for a resumption of the hearing, from 28 days to 42 days.  This amendment applies the same conditions to complaints under the Equal Status Acts on failure of mediation as are already applicable to resumption of complaints under the Employment Equality Acts.  The remaining provisions are of a standard or technical nature.<\/p><p>  Before concluding, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the technical nature of these amendments, while reiterating that the State has no option but to ensure national law complies with the European Court of Justice interpretation of the gender goods and services directive in this instance.  I thank the Members of the House for their attention and I look forward to a detailed discussion on the Bill.  I commend this Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#RR00800","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1149,"content":"<p>Fianna F\u00e1il supports this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#RR00900","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>Sorry to interrupt, but I wish to apologise for not having a copy of what was a very technical speech available for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#RR01000","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1151,"content":"<p>That is fine.  I thank the Minister of State.  We accept that we have to amend our legislation because the derogation period is coming to an end.  On that basis, we understand where the Minister of State is coming from.  We are supporting the Bill.  We do not have any particular issue with it.<\/p><p>  When the Equal Status Act 2000 was introduced, it was a ground-breaking measure.  Its effects on people's participation in civil society were felt throughout the country.  It was right that so many sections of society, including religious and political organisations, had to ensure they offered a level playing field to both genders.  It was important that many clubs and associations in this country experienced a mini-revolution when they had to rewrite their constitutions and go about their business differently.  It went a long way towards promoting a greater mix and a greater balance with regard to the participation of women in organisations.  Unfortunately, there were one or two high-profile instances of organisations in Dublin not abiding by the new law.  One particularly high-profile golf club refused to amend its rules to allow women to become full members.  It was regrettable that they did not comply with the spirit of the legislation.  Neither I nor my party would subscribe to the notion of having exclusive men-only organisations in a modern society.<\/p><p>  Perhaps we should review the complete effectiveness of the Equal Status Act 2000 by carrying out an audit, in so far as possible, of how it is being complied with by organisations throughout the country.  That could be done in many ways.  Our local authorities, for example, have a substantial active database of all community and voluntary organisations, including sports clubs and non-sporting organisations.  If we could audit and monitor the level of compliance with the 2000 Act and the impact it has had, it would be a worthwhile exercise as it would be something we could refer to in time.  If that is done, I am sure it will find that the legislation in question has had a very positive effect on the promotion of gender balance and a greater mix of participation by both genders.<\/p><p>  One of the major concerns associated with the Bill before is that it will lead to an increase in the premiums to be paid across a number of insurance policies.  I suppose the week after the budget is probably a bad week to discuss another increased bill that households will have to face.  Given that the derogation will cease on 21 December next and will not apply to new insurance policies written after that date, it is unfortunate that so many insurance premiums are renewed in early January.  The timing of this measure is particularly cruel because it means that many people will face increased insurance premiums late this year and early in the new year.  In that context, I would like to know whether any regulatory impact assessment was carried out by the Department.  Was that possible?  If so, was it published?  It might serve to inform the public.<\/p><p>  The final issue I would like to raise with regard to this Bill relates to the financial services industry.  Many of the organisations that underwrite this business are banks.  As we know, some banks are involved in insurance as well as banking.  Insurance is one of the many aspects of their financial services activity.  We will have to keep an eye on how they treat the application of this change in the legislation.  We must ensure they do not use it as an excuse to hike up premiums further than the actuarial people tell them they need to do.  In other words, they must not use it as an opportunity to try to grow their capital bases further, or engage in another capital-gathering exercise.  People are being squeezed by the banks on many fronts.  This should not be viewed by the banks as an opportunity to squeeze the consumer a bit more.  Consumers are being absolutely squeezed dry.  The Financial Regulator and the Central Bank should have a role in ensuring the banks do not engage in opportunism.  Unfortunately, we have learned to our detriment from our experience that the banks will take every opportunity possible to add a greater margin to the margins they are already squeezing out of people with the other products they are selling.  Did we get the observations of the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau of Ireland as part of the regulatory impact assessment?  Did that office make any input during the drafting of the legislation?  Has the Department had any particular interaction with the ombudsman in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#SS00100","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1152,"content":"<p>As this is a very technical Bill, I will not take up too much time.  This Bill has had to be introduced on foot of the ruling by the European Court of Justice that the derogation in the EU gender directive that allows gender to be used as a risk factor in determining insurance costs is illegal.  While we are on the matter of European courts, I would like to mention briefly that it is a shame the Government does not seem to hold the European Court of Human Rights in the same regard.  I assume that is why it has not legislated for the X case as required by the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland.  There is a point to be made here about the role of statistical evidence about risk factors when the price of insurance is being determined.  Insurance premiums are based on risk factors.  In general, women receive lower premiums as there is a lower risk attached to them.  Geographical location is a further risk assessment factor.  Insurance costs are much higher in some parts of the country than in others because a higher proportion of road traffic accidents takes place in such locations.  My concern about this Bill is that it will not result in lower insurance premiums for male drivers, but higher premiums for female drivers.  While it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of gender, I am aware of some insurance companies in Britain that have introduced interesting initiatives to ensure women are not unfairly penalised in their insurance claims.  Some insurance companies in Britain are offering discounts for young driver schemes, as well as safe driver schemes in which premiums are reduced for both genders where there is a demonstrable record of safety over a period of time.  I hope insurance companies here will do the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#SS00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1153,"content":"<p>I thank both Deputies.  I assure Deputy Niall Collins that there was extensive consultation with the entire insurance industry, as well as with the Departments of Finance, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Social Protection, the Central Bank, the National Consumer Agency, the Citizens Information Board, the Pensions Board, the Equality Authority and the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau of Ireland.  The level of consultation was quite significant.  People will always say there could have been additional consultation, but in this case I do not think that would have been possible.  Anyone who was seen to be a stakeholder in this sector, including the consumer, was consulted.<\/p><p>  As we all know, this measure has resulted from a case that was successfully taken at the European courts by a consumer group in Belgium.  I know people are very conscious of what others pay for their insurance.  We tend to know what is being paid.  I appreciate what Deputy Collins said about the mortgage protection, income protection and life assurance products offered by banks.  This Bill will not affect life assurance unless it is to be taken out after 21 December next and is therefore considered to be an ongoing contract rather than a new contract.<\/p><p>Where the major impact will be felt is in regard to new car insurance after 21 December.<\/p><p> Equality is a funny thing.  As a woman, I see how it will affect women but, on the other hand, as Deputy McLellan rightly said, if we take out the gender issue, insurance companies will surely be able to take account of the fact that someone is a safer driver, as they have done in the past.  No matter what gender they were, in the past unsafe drivers would see their insurance costs rise if they were involved in crashes.  It is this type of detail that will be necessary.<\/p><p> Equality is a funny thing.

People taking out insurance products, whether from a bank, a broker or directly from an insurance company would be wise to get at least three quotes.  Just because a person is getting a mortgage from a particular lender does not mean the person must take insurance from that lender.  Sometimes people do not realise this or forget it, and while there can be a degree of pressure, customers should resist it.<\/p><p> Comprehensive and detailed information leaflets are available both on the Department's website and on the website of the Citizens' Information Bureau.  These have been available on the Internet for some time because we knew this was coming, and all the information the average citizen will need is available.<\/p><p> This is a brief but significant Bill that will have an impact on people's lives in the future.  I hope those in the insurance industry will be sensible and take into account that someone is a safe driver, whether male or female.<\/p><p> I thank the two Deputies.

I exhort the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to take a serious and urgent look at the scheme.  It is so valuable to people living in a home setting that this bears reiteration time and again.  Even at a time when resources are scarce, there is a need to prioritise, and there is certainly a need to prioritise the home help scheme.

The aim of Government policy remains to support older people in living in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  This objective is realised through various community-based supports such as mainstream home help, enhanced home care packages, meals-on-wheels and day or respite provision.  Our aim is to develop and improve community-based supports where possible, taking account of wider reforms of the health service, the overall resources available and the need for the HSE to meet its statutory budgetary obligations.<\/p><p>  The HSE has been developing various operational initiatives to improve its approach nationally to all relevant aspects of its home support services.  These include various new guidelines for home care and agreeing a new procurement framework for approved agencies providing such services on a partnership basis on behalf of the executive.<\/p><p>While ongoing developments have been designed to standardise and maximise the use of limited resources in the face of increasing demand, they are also intended to enhance quality, safety and other key aspects of planning and delivering services, for both providers and care recipients alike.  The HSE service plan for 2012 originally envisaged some 50,000 recipients of mainstream home help and approximately 11,000 recipients of enhanced home care packages at any one time.  Notwithstanding the recently announced reduction in HSE home care towards the end of this year, investment in these services remains significant, with expected outturn expenditure of approximately \u20ac320 million for home help and home care packages in the course of 2012.<\/p><p> The recent measures adopted by the executive were designed to secure a reduction of approximately \u20ac8 million in expenditure on home help hours to the end of December, equating to some 400,000 hours, and a reduction of approximately \u20ac1.2 million on home care packages.  Every effort has been made to ensure the impact of these reductions will be minimised for individual recipients so that services are provided, in the first instance, for direct patient care.  Decisions in regard to the provision of home help hours continue to be based on a review of individual need and no current recipient of the service who has an assessed need will be without a provision.  The latest information available from the HSE indicates that in balancing overall projected financial savings for the home help budget nationally against maintaining adequate service in individual cases, it will probably not meet the savings target envisaged.  The Department continues to work closely with the executive to monitor the position between now and year end.<\/p><p> I emphasise again that in addressing very difficult financial realities overall, protecting community-based services for vulnerable older people continues to be a priority for the Government.  However, the challenge facing the HSE in drawing up its 2013 service plan should not be underestimated.

I attended the meeting at which she outlined in great detail what is proposed in this regard and attempted to allay some of the fears that were raised from the floor.  The difficulty, however, is that the communication breakdown between the HSE and parents' groups remains a problem.  Several of the parents who attended the public meeting and whose children are attending special needs schools had received virtually no information on the proposed reconfiguration before the Minister of State provided some of the details.  From speaking to parents in recent days, it seems this communication deficit has not yet been addressed.  There are parents who are still not aware of the plans that are being implemented.  This is something that needs to be taken on board by the Department.<\/p><p>  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the meeting that took place last Monday in the HSE offices in Cork at which parents of children with special needs had an opportunity to voice their concerns about the changes that are taking place.  I assume she received the minutes of the meeting, as did I, which clearly point to the concerns that remain outstanding and which must be addressed as soon as possible.  One of the main concerns relates to the issue of parent representation on the implementation groups.  The answer attendees received to queries as to whether there might be increased representation was that the proposed complement of four is larger than that in other geographical areas.  In other words, the message was that four parent representatives is more than enough.  That position must be clarified.  At the same time, there is a genuine concern among parents that the requirements of the parent representative role go above and beyond what they should be asked to do.  The Minister of State will recall from the public meeting she attended that many people are concerned that anybody who accepts the role of parent representative on the implementation group will be held responsible for all of the decisions made.  I accept that the Minister of State sought to clarify this matter at the meeting, but that fear persists.<\/p><p>  The other main concern among parents is how the changes can be implemented on a cost neutral basis.  In fact, there is a genuine view among parents that it is simply not possible.  Nobody has yet been able to provide them with details or a plan for how to improve the services and implement the proposed reconfiguration on a cost neutral basis without impacting on front-line services.  If the Minister of State could outline how that is proposed to be achieved, it might ease parents' fears.  There was a debate at the public meeting around the need for a mapping of services.  An argument is being put forward that such mapping should be in place before the implementation groups are established.  To do it the other way around would seem to be putting the cart before the horse.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?<\/p><p>  There is a danger that parents will be pitted against parents.  The minutes of last Monday's meeting show there are already differences of opinion, with parents of children attending mainstream schools or units attached to mainstream schools indicating a wish to proceed with nominating representatives to the implementation group as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>On the other hand there are parents of children attending special schools who are very wary about nominating representatives and proceeding with the implementation group.  We are already seeing a kind of breakdown within the implementation groups, with parents not being able to agree on the best way forward.<\/p><p> The other concern that came out of the meeting, which I hope will be addressed, was that parents were being asked to partake in the groups but they did not have all the documentation and did not know what the overall plan was.  No policy documents were provided to them for studying before they were asked to join the implementation groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#UU00600","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1170,"content":"<p>Every parent wants the very best for their child.  If one has a child with particular needs, or needs that are different from those of other children, there is always a fear the needs of the child will not be met into the future.  That is a normal feeling, something one must accept and realise happens.<\/p><p>  On the mapping, the implementation groups and whether the mapping should be in place, I reiterate what I said at that meeting, namely, both can run in tandem.  There is no need to hold one up while waiting on the other.  Mapping is vitally important, as I have always maintained.<\/p><p>  I refer to the Progressing Disability document, which is part of a suite of measures we are taking in the area of disability.  It is a very good document that outlines delivery of a service in the community.  I understand that people in specialist schools have a difficulty with that taking place.  I realise they are happy with the service they have and do not want to lose it so this reaction is very understandable.  The difficulties I heard about on that day were in terms of where children must go in order to receive the service, and the type of environment they will face.  It should be possible to sort out all these things - they are not impossible tasks but entirely solvable issues.<\/p><p>  However, there are swathes of children in the community going to mainstream schools who do not have access to any services.  I am not one who says we should run madly ahead with the project or that it is cost-neutral.  Nothing is cost-neutral.  Even moving something to a new location is not so because one has to look at the location and see what is needed.  We must try to ensure that every child has access to a service.  The mapping should tell us where the gaps are, which is key to the whole issue.  If we find there are gaps in the area of speech therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, psychology and all those things, it will then be my job, or that of whoever stands in this position next time around, to ensure the resources are put in place to fill those gaps.  That is what we did in mental health and what we are about to do in the area of older people and old age psychiatry.  It is what we need to do.<\/p><p>  Above all else, we must ensure every child has access to a service.  This is not an overnight project; it will take at least three years.  I heard the parents talking about their fears that day and these are genuine fears.  Nobody wants other than the very best for their children.  I would say to those people they need to be part of the process, if they want to have any influence.  That is not to say everything will be agreed.  This will not happen, it never does.  However, mapping and finding the gaps in the service is vitally important.  That is what we did in the area of mental health and we need to do it here too.  We cannot continue to allow the resource that is in place to go unused.  It is not enough, but the resource I mean is the allied professionals I just named.  I do not say this in a negative or disingenuous way.  We cannot allow all those people to remain within institutions and only delivering service in those institutions.  We must have a more holistic approach and must ensure that children who have a difficulty about going into particular areas are accommodated.  I very clearly heard the woman the Deputy mentioned.<\/p><p>  This is a solvable problem, however, and we need to look at solutions.  This is about delivering a better service to more children, and also to those many young adults who are still receiving the service.  That would be the aim but it is not an overnight project and will take time.

That is a big fear people have, as the Minister of State will know from the meeting.<\/p><p>  I completely agree we must map out the services we need in order to identify the gaps that must be filled.  The Minister of State rightly stated there cannot be a situation where people who need services do not receive them.  Everybody is entitled to them and should receive them.  The mapping process will identify the individuals in question and resources will have to be put in place.<\/p><p>  The big fear, however, was about doing the work on a cost-neutral basis.  If gaps are being identified which will then have to be plugged with resources, and this is being attempted on a cost-neutral basis, it is easy to understand the fear on the part of parents whose children are attending specialist schools.  Their big fear is that in moving to the geographical model services will be taken from some individuals in order to plug the gaps in other areas.  The Minister of State's acknowledgment today that perhaps this cannot be done on a cost-neutral basis is a positive step and I am sure if parents heard it they would feel there is an understanding of their fears.

I know if I had a child who was receiving a very good service and there was a possibility that service might move to a different location, I would be very nervous about all of that.

It looks at where gaps exist and what is necessary to ensure they are filled, not by robbing Peter to pay Paul but by taking a look at the kind of enhanced budget we need.

According to ASH Ireland, the prevalence of smoking in this country stands somewhere between 26% and 29%.  While the position in this regard is better than it was a generation ago, when nearly half of the population smoked, the figure remains high, particularly in comparison to that in places such as California where only 11% of the population smoke, or Norway where the figure is 17%.  Smoking must be one of the greatest causes of health problems, with most smokers admitting that they wish they had never begun in the first instance.  Smoking is an extremely difficult addiction to overcome and a very expensive habit.<\/p><p>  We have made great strides in reducing the level of smoking, having banned it in so many public places.  It is well known, however, that the cost of nicotine replacement therapies such as gum, patches and the newer artificial cigarettes is a factor in ensuring some people continue to smoke.  They are very expensive, particularly in comparison to the prices paid by our friends north of the Border and throughout the United Kingdom.  A major factor in the difference in price is that the British Government has introduced a special VAT of just 5% for these therapies.  In Ireland, however, we charge a rate of 23%.  This is what gives rise to the significant price differential between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  If we could follow the example of the United Kingdom and introduce a similar rate here, the knock-on effects for smokers and the Exchequer would be tremendous.  Over 5,500 people die each year as a result of smoking-related illnesses.  It is estimated that we spend close to \u20ac1.5 billion in treating these illnesses.  While a reduction in VAT might result in a small shortfall for Revenue, we should consider the savings to be made in the long term if the beleaguered Department of Health were obliged to deal with fewer smoking-related illnesses.  We must do everything possible to reduce the startling statistics for smoking.  We can only bring about such a reduction if we help people to give up smoking, while also deterring young people from taking up the habit.  Having nicotine replacement therapies available at a reasonable price would definitely assist those trying to beat the addiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#WW00100","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1175,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue, to which I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  I welcome the opportunity to outline the position on the question of the VAT treatment of nicotine replacement patches posed by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  I wish to explain that, when considering the VAT system and the VAT treatment of any product or service, the VAT rating of goods and services is governed by the requirements of the EU VAT directive with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In this regard, it may be useful to remind the House of the structure of Ireland's VAT regime.  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland operates a number of VAT rates.  The standard VAT rate of 23% applies to the majority of goods and services, including cars, petrol, diesel, alcohol, tobacco, electrical equipment, CDs and DVDs.  There is also a reduced rate of 13.5% which applies mainly to fuel used for heat or light, construction, housing, labour intensive services and general repairs and maintenance.  A second reduced rate of 9%, introduced as part of the jobs initiative, applies mainly to tourism-related services, including hotel and holiday accommodation, restaurant services and some entertainment services.  The zero rate of VAT generally applies to most food, children's clothes and shoes and oral medicines.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, nicotine replacement patches are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 23%.  Unlike other nicotine products such as inhalers, tablets and chewing gum which are categorised as oral medicines and which thereby qualify for the zero-rate of VAT, nicotine replacement patches are not considered to be oral medicines and are, therefore, correctly subject to the standard rate of VAT of 23%.  However, I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that member states have the option, under Annex lll of the EU VAT directive, of applying a reduced rate of VAT to pharmaceutical products of a kind normally used for health care, for the prevention of illnesses and medical treatment purposes.  In this regard, since nicotine replacement patches could be considered to meet such criteria, Ireland would have the option of applying a reduced rate to such products.  However, constraints imposed by the VAT directive on the number of reduced VAT rates which a member state may operate at any one time would not allow for the possibility of a special reduced VAT rate of 5% to match, as suggested by the Deputy, that which applies in the United Kingdom.  Article 98 of the directive provides that member states may apply either one or two reduced rates to the goods and services listed in Annex lll.  The introduction of a third reduced VAT rate would, therefore, not be possible under EU VAT rules.  Accordingly, any reduction in the VAT rate on nicotine replacement patches would have to be considered in the context of the existing 9% and 13.5% reduced rates.<\/p><p>  A proposal to reduce the VAT rate applying to any good or service raises a number of issues.  The Deputy will not be surprised if I emphasise the need to maintain VAT revenues and also the need to ensure losses to the Exchequer in these difficult economic times are avoided.  Notwithstanding the potential health benefits which may accrue from the use of nicotine replacement patches, losses in one area must be balanced by savings or increased taxes in others.  The issue of the degree to which the consumer might benefit from a reduction in VAT on nicotine replacement patches also arises.  In this regard, there is, unfortunately, no guarantee that moving standard-rated products to a reduced rate of VAT would necessarily be reflected in full in the retail prices charged to consumers.  Any dilution of the potential benefit to the consumer would obviously be a major concern and effectively negate the promotion of the use of nicotine patch technology.<\/p><p>  In the context of the imbalance of price between Ireland and the United Kingdom to which the Deputy refers, cross-Border shopping studies indicate that fluctuations in the exchange rate between sterling and the euro represent the most significant influence on price.  In this respect, the current exchange rate between sterling and the euro should provide less incentive for people to shop outside the State.  The report of the implications of cross-Border shopping which was undertaken on behalf of the Minister for Finance by the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office notes that the main causes of price differentials between goods in Northern Ireland and the Republic are operating costs, profit margin or mark-up, taxes and the exchange rate between sterling and the euro.  While variations in VAT rates widened some price differentials, their impact remained small compared to the significance of the change in the exchange rate.<\/p><p>  I again thank the Deputy for raising this matter.

I remain of the view that this is an area in which we should do a great deal more work, particularly as the benefits for Ireland and other member states would be very significant.  It is stated one's health is one's wealth.  If we can help people to stop smoking, we will have done a great deed.  Nicotine replacement therapies are sold from behind the counter in Ireland, whereas in the United Kingdom and most other countries they are sold off the shelf.  They are also sold exclusively by chemist shops in this country, but elsewhere one can purchase them from a wide variety of outlets, which makes matters much easier for those who want to quit.  I am determined to pursue this significant issue which has major implications for people's health and the Exchequer.  We must do everything in our power to help people stop smoking, particularly as the habit is so closely associated with the lower socioeconomic classes.  In the case of a person in receipt of a benefit payment of \u20ac188 per week and who smokes 20 cigarettes a day - most people smoke more at weekends - one can calculate that he or she spends \u20ac60 to \u20ac70 a week on tobacco, which is a significant amount of money.  If we put in place a task force to assist people on benefits to quit the habit, this would go a long way towards helping such individuals rebalance their budgets rather than watching their money go up in smoke.<\/p><p>I appreciate fully the point made by Deputy Phelan.  She correctly described the impact on public health of the sale of tobacco.  I suggest the promotion of nicotine patches is an issue she could discuss with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  It may be possible to have nicotine patches on open display to make them more available to the consumer.  The cost of 20 cigarettes is the best part of \u20ac70 a week.  This is a major expenditure for people on low incomes.  More than 5,500 people die in this country every year from smoking related diseases.  The consumption of cigarettes is detrimental to people's health.<\/p><p> I refer to the issue of the illegal importation of tobacco products.  Cigarettes are being sold door to door.  This is illicit tobacco and the quality is dubious.  Any tobacco is bad but this illicit tobacco is substandard and the quality is even worse.<\/p><p> The Minister for Finance referred to the possibility of a VAT rate of 9% or 13.5% on nicotine replacement patches.  I suggest the Deputy could pursue this issue with him.  I am certain a self-financing mechanism would benefit the State and the health of the population.  I agree with the Deputy that these products should be more available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#WW00300","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1178,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his very positive response to this issue.

Dublin City Council figures show that last year, 16,600 families and individuals were on its housing waiting list, with 7,538 on the transfer list.  A total of 32% of applicants were waiting more than five years, with 2,544 waiting more than seven years.  I describe these figures as deeply damaging to the credibility of Dublin City Council and the Government.  In addition, Fingal County Council confirmed to me that 9,082 families and individuals were waiting for housing on its council housing list.<\/p><p>  When Members of this House are able to retire to our comfortable homes or lodgings after long days in the D\u00e1il, 80 to 90 people will be sleeping on the streets of this city.  They will sleep outside on this very night as they have done over recent bitter November nights.  It is unacceptable and disgraceful.<\/p><p>  Like other Members I receive many phone calls and e-mails from constituents.  I meet many of them at my weekly information clinics who are in dire straits with regard to housing.  They describe very difficult home circumstances.  They may be on a housing waiting list for anything from five to 13 years.  A typical example is a young woman with three children who has been living for the past five or six years in very cramped conditions with her adult siblings and her parents in a modest two-bedroom house.<\/p><p>  A few weeks ago I asked the Taoiseach whether a social housing investment programme would be implemented in 2012.  I have studied budget 2013 as best I can but I have not found any evidence of any serious intent on the part of this Government to address this issue.  I estimate that perhaps only a few dozen individuals and households were rehoused in the past year in my constituency out of the 4,000 on the Dublin North-Central housing list.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is committed to tackling the issue but it is impossible for any progress to be made unless proper funding is allocated to kick-start the social housing programme.  This would also have a beneficial effect on the construction industry.<\/p><p>  I have spoken about the appalling treatment of citizens who have been left on the waiting list, in some cases for up to 15 years.  I have long urged Dublin City Council to move away from its historic points-based, priority-based housing list system to a system based on time on the list, as used in Fingal County Council.  I am a former Dublin City Council councillor.  The council last week decided to move to the system of time on the list, which is a fair and transparent system.  It is a case of first come, first served.  It now awaits the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to sign the regulation.  When will he sign that regulation?<\/p><p>  Under the Fianna F\u00e1il regime led by Ahern and Cowen, the failure of local authorities to provide social housing meant a massive growth in the private rental sector.  In the past five years since 2007, almost \u20ac3 billion has been expended on rent supplement allowances.  This money has gone into the pockets of private landlords.  Ordinary constituents wonder why that money was not used to fund a housing programme.<\/p><p>  When will the promised housing Bill come before the House?  I refer in particular to provisions in respect of the administration of voluntary housing bodies.  My constituency has organisations such as NABCO, Iveagh Trust, Respond and Cl\u00faid.  There is no legislation governing estate management and tenancy and it is urgently needed.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, gave two deadlines - the first Sunday in September and then a further ten days - to the developers, builders, auctioneers, insurance companies in respect of the pyrite disaster.  He keeps issuing deadlines but when will he take action?  When will he decide to levy the industry which did those terrible things to households?  People are upset that they are expected to pay a housing tax - which the House will discuss tomorrow - on houses which are worthless because they need to be remediated.  I ask the Minister of State to bring these points to the attention of the Minister.<\/p><p>  On a final point, I ask the Minister of State to ask if the Minister will join us next Monday at 7.30 p.m. at Priory Hall for a candlelight vigil.  Those families - a total of 250 people - are facing a second Christmas out of their homes at Priory Hall.  I am sure they would be delighted to see him at the vigil next Monday night at Priory Hall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#XX00300","speaker":"1020"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1181,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this issue.  I may not have the comprehensive reply he wants but I will bring his concerns to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Hogan.  The current economic crisis is severely testing the capacity of the State to meet social housing need.  Financial considerations mean local authorities are effectively no longer engaged in large-scale housing stock construction programmes at the very time when demand for housing services is at its greatest.  The Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, sets out a new approach for housing provision that recognises these key unfortunate realities.  It is specifically predicated on a tenure-neutral approach that focuses on enabling households to access the housing solution that best suited to their needs at a point in time.  While home ownership is still a very valid aspiration for a majority of households, it is no longer the acme of all tenure options.<\/p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with the housing authorities and with not-for-profit approved housing bodies, is engaging in a range of innovative and flexible housing solutions to meet housing need in general, and homelessness in particular.  I acknowledge the Deputy's campaigning work on behalf of the homeless  I sympathise with the fact that up to 80 people are sleeping on the streets of Dublin tonight.  I cannot even imagine what it must be like on such a cold evening.  I appreciate the Deputy's point about homelessness.<\/p><p>  The Department's approach to homelessness is to focus on providing people with a home where they can live as full and valued members of society.<\/p><p>That is why Government policy in this area is moving to a housing-led approach rather than the traditional model that places hostel or shelter-type accommodation at the centre of accommodation provision.  This change will take time to implement, but the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is committed to seeing it through.  People deserve the dignity of a home.  We must obviously bear in mind the financial constraints.<\/p><p> Early in the new year, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will be issuing a policy statement on homelessness.  This will indicate what we expect from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.  The Minister of State has sought to put in place real solutions for people who find themselves without a home.  Investment of nearly \u20ac50 million has been provided by central and local government in the provision of homelessness services in 2012.<\/p><p> With regard to wider demand for social housing, the Government's focus is on optimising the delivery of social housing for the resources invested.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.<\/p><p> The social housing capital budget has had to be reduced from \u20ac1.535 billion in 2008 to just over \u20ac333.7 million this year - this is a considerable reduction - and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital-funded construction programmes.  Nevertheless, the Minister of State is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs across the country through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  Delivery is being significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the rental accommodation scheme and leasing, but the Minister of State is also developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. In spite of these challenging circumstances, a tentative projection of 4,000 housing units is anticipated for 2012.<\/p><p> The Minister of State will continue to target available resources to ensure the critical housing needs of the most vulnerable sectors of our society are addressed.  Precise data are critical in this regard, which is why the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will in 2013 carry out a full housing-needs assessment, the first such assessment to be carried out under the 2009 housing Act.  This will give a comprehensive picture of real need and help to direct scarce resources to best effect.<\/p><p> I will pass on Deputy Broughan's concerns on Priory Hall to the Minister, Deputy Hogan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#XX00400","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1183,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome that because the householders of Priory Hall are anxiously awaiting the recommendation of Mr. Justice Finnegan.

The Government is supposed to be getting \u20ac400 million plus for the 4G communications auction.  Could at least part of this not be hypothecated to address the awful housing problem?  Might this be considered?  I understand we are not going to make the promissory note payment at the end of March.

State agencies, the Department and companies are working together to restore new markets in areas such as Asia, the Middle East, Russia and Africa.  We are also developing a common brand, Origin Green, across the food industry generally.  This is about differentiating Irish food from food produced in competitor countries.  Essentially, it is a sustainability claim backed up by data that are internationally accredited in respect of how food is produced in Ireland.  Part of building that brand requires a sustainability and quality programme for primary producers of dairy projects.  This is why, in last year's budget, I announced that I wanted to see the rolling out of a quality or sustainability programme among the 18,000 dairy farmers in the country to ensure we could stand over our collective dairy industry and say we produce milk to a certain standard.  This will not be some kind of inspection-based witch-hunt of farmers; it will be quite the opposite.  We will roll out the programme in the same way that the carbon-footprinting programme has been rolled out for the beef sector.  By the end of this year, 32,000 beef farms across Ireland will be carbon-footprinted.  When we sell a steak, not only will we be able to put on the label the traceability claim indicating the farmyard from where it came, we will also be able to tell buyers the carbon footprint of the animal that produced it.<\/p><p>We want to provide similar sustainability claims for dairy production in Ireland.

This industry, by its nature, is capital intensive and there is a low margin return on the money invested in it.  When the inevitable price volatility that will arise for the dairy sector is injected into the mix, any proposal that will increase costs for the farmer, or a combination of farmers in partnership arrangements, is dangerous territory to approach.<\/p><p>  Is the model of the proposed scheme a template taken from somewhere else?  Has it been modelled on a template in some other jurisdiction across the Community?

Let us not forget that more than 85% of all the milk we produce is exported in various forms, be it infant formula, skimmed and semi-skimmed milk, cheese, yoghurts and all the other products in which milk is an ingredient.  If we are to be able to demand a higher price for our product in the future, which we will need to do, and move away from being a commodity producer of volume to being a quality producer of volume, targeting the top 10% price area in the new markets we are exploring, we have to be able to stand over the way in which our food is produced.  The sustainability and quality programme will not cost farmers a great deal of money, in fact it will help them to run their businesses more efficiently.  If a farmer is using less water, has more feed conversion efficiency and more efficient grazing management, his business will be more efficient and sustainable.  The combination of those two factors will improve the standard of dairy farming in Ireland, which will be beneficial for everybody.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the context of the capital investment farmers have to make, we will make more than &#8364;10 million available to dairy farmers next year in the form of the TAM scheme, which is half of the overall scheme as such, to help them with the costs of expansion, growth and upgrading their equipment.<\/p><p><i>  Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  Environmental sustainability is an increasingly important issue in the marketplace for many multinational dairy and food operators, many of which now have sustainability as a core part of their corporate strategies.  During my trade missions to China and the US in 2012 it was clear that the sustainability and quality messages have a strong resonance both with potential customers for Irish food products and with potential investors in the Irish agri food sector.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Developing a unique selling point for Irish food products is a critically important element of the national strategy for the development of the sector.  It is particularly relevant in the dairy sector where we will need to maximise market returns for significantly increased production in competitive markets worldwide.  Ireland is well placed to develop a national brand image based on a reputation for high quality dairy products, and on its mild maritime climate, plentiful supplies of water, grass based production and an already positive green image.<\/p><p><br \/>  In that context, earlier this year, Bord Bia launched its &#8220;Origin Green&#8221; programme, which establishes a framework within which Irish food companies can have their green credentials independently measured.  This will be a critically important element in the development of the Irish food sector in the coming years and its promotion on international markets. The key is to build independently verifiable metrics, which can be used in the marketplace, around Ireland&#8217;s already positive green image.   <\/p><p><br \/>  It is equally important to develop an independently accredited sustainability and quality programme at farm level for the dairy sector as part of that overall strategy to enable the sector point to verifiable attributes in maintaining and expanding its market share.  There is also a strong correlation between the measures needed to improve environmental sustainability and to improve hygiene and other quality practices on farm, and those needed to reduce the costs of production at farm level and improve profitability.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In that context, and following extensive consultations with stakeholders in the first half of 2012, I announced in June that Bord Bia would begin detailed work on the development of a national sustainability and quality programme for the dairy sector to be used as a key element in marketing and promotional efforts on international markets.  The programme will provide an independently accredited framework for operating best practice quality and sustainability principles on Irish dairy farms, and an objective and uniform mechanism for measuring compliance with these principles.  It will also provide a vehicle for encouraging continuous improvement in production standards on Irish farms, underpin the marketing of Irish dairy products internationally and provide additional assurance for potential investors in Ireland. <\/p><p><br \/>  Stakeholders are currently engaged in detailed technical discussions on the development of the programme, under the aegis of a technical advisory group convened by Bord Bia to progress the issue, and I hope it can be finalised in the near future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#ZZZ00300","speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Expenditure","time":1355416200,"counter":1195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#ZZZ00400"},{"type":"question","time":1355416200,"counter":1196,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[56052\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#ZZZ00500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the impact of budgetary cuts on farm programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1197,"content":"<p>As this is a fairly broad question, I will address the issues that might be most pertinent.  There has been some criticism since the announcement of the budget that we have targeted certain schemes unfairly and I want to give the Deputy the rationale for why we did what we did.  I will deal with the beef sector first. <\/p><p>   For the past five years we have had a suckler cow welfare scheme which has been a popular and extremely good scheme.  It has significantly improved the welfare standards within the suckler herd and it has provided very valuable data around breeding programmes and fertility within herds to Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, which is very useful for planning for the future, breeding programmes and so on.  That was a five year scheme and this is the fifth year of it.  It has come to an end.  I had signalled that I would not be able to continue the suckler cow welfare scheme indefinitely into the future because we do not have the money to do it and it has come to the end of its five year term.  I would have had to have put a new scheme in place and get approval from Brussels for that.  Instead we decided to put in place a smaller, more targeted scheme to replace the suckler scheme for the moment, which will cost us approximately \u20ac10 million a year and which will pay farmers \u20ac20 rather than \u20ac40 an animal.  We are asking them to continue to supply the kind of data on breeding and fertility they previously would have been providing to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF.  We are asking new entrants also to provide that data for that money.<\/p><p>  It is important to say in terms of the beef sector, because it is misunderstood, that next year we will spend almost as much on the beef sector as we spent this year.  This year we will spend \u20ac25 million on the suckler cow welfare scheme in addition to approximately \u20ac2 million connected to beef discussion groups which started half way through the year.  Next year we will spend \u20ac10 million on this new scheme.  We will spend \u20ac10 million on the existing suckler cow welfare scheme where the payments will be paid next year in respect of calves that were born in the second half of the year, and we will spend \u20ac5 million on beef discussion groups on this sector next year.  That is \u20ac25 million that will be spent on suckler beef next year which is not a significant difference from what was spent on that sector this year, although I accept the make-up and design of those payments are different.  I will address one or two of the other sectors related to the sheep sector and DAS payments when I get an opportunity to do so later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#ZZZ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1198,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

The farmers in that scheme are the most marginal and they are struggling to survive and care for their families.  These cuts will have a detrimental effect on that type of farming in particular because one will find that the farmers in the suckler welfare scheme and some people involved in sheep farming are also dependent on farm assist.  While the Minister might try to make up that loss another way, perhaps by compensating for the situation in regard the suckler welfare scheme, the farm assist being cut as well will make it almost impossible for these type of farmers to survive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#ZZZ00700","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1199,"content":"<p>There is a genuine concern about ensuring that farmers on relatively small farms in very disadvantaged areas are provided with enough support to keep them on the land.  That is the reason, in terms of the savings we must make in the disadvantage areas scheme, we have excluded mountainous farmers from any of those savings to ensure nobody farming in a mountainous area - that is 32,000 out of the 100,000 - will face any reduction in their incomes.  Regarding the low land disadvantaged area farmers, instead of reducing the rate for everybody, we have reduced the eligible hectarage for people to again protect smaller farmers.  In other words, instead of claiming the payment on 34 hectares as a maximum it will be claimed on 30 hectares as a maximum.  I have tried to prioritise the most disadvantaged farmers, that is, the people on the mountains and the smaller farmers within the disadvantaged areas scheme, DAS, in lowland areas.  A total of 73% of people in disadvantaged areas will be unaffected by the reductions and the remainder will see a reduction of an average of about 11% but those decisions were made to protect those with holdings and the most disadvantaged people within DAS areas.  The same applies to the suckler scheme.

I believe there will be some money left over to give top-up payments to farmers with 30 to 40 suckler cows.<\/p><p> This was the third year of the three-year sheep grasslands scheme.  We have decided to continue with the scheme, which will be paid for by unspent moneys under pillar 1.  While we have reduced the cost of it from \u20ac18 million to \u20ac14 million, we have made up for that by introducing a discussion group, similar to the ones that have worked so well for the dairy sector, which will bring farmers together to discuss how they can improve their businesses and make more money in the marketplace.  We will spend \u20ac3 million on these discussion groups next year.  The total spend on the sheep sector next year will be more or less the same as this year's.

Over the past decade, however, this long-established fishing industry has been under threat from restrictions designed to protect stocks.  The local fishermen's co-operative is struggling enormously with EU fish quota restrictions, an aging fishing fleet and poor fish prices caused by low demand due to the recession.  As fishing vessels become more technologically demanding, additional pressure has been put on resources and infrastructure.  Reduced catches put pressure on employment in the processing sector.  Several fish factories have already closed in Dunmore East over the past four years.<\/p><p>  Dunmore East Harbour is suffering from inadequate infrastructure to address its potential needs.  No dredging of the harbour has taken place for 17 years.  Consequently, larger vessels cannot access the harbour.  Silting has reduced the depth of the approach under the synchrolift.  Despite the fact that it has a lifting capacity of 200 tonnes, it is only suitable for vessels with a maximum draft of about nine feet.  Hence, many vessels have to divert to Cork or Howth for docking.  This poor access has had a devastating impact on the local fishing fleet.<\/p><p>  Since the recession hit, several hotels and restaurants in Dunmore East have closed.  There is a significant scarcity of work and little or no investment in local industry.  It is well recognised that the average income in the fishing village is below the national average.

These preparations have been completed this year in an impressive manner.<\/p><p>  There has been much talk about getting the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy done during the Irish EU Presidency.  I am equally focused on the Common Fisheries Policy.  We want to get a deal for all countries but one that will also shape policy to ensure the Irish industry can survive and grow.  One of the key issues under discussion is how we deal with discards.<\/p><p>At the moment in many of our fisheries up to 40% or 50% of the fish caught are being dumped over the side, dead.  They are either juvenile fish or in some cases adult fish.  We need and we will find solutions to that and I hope the industry will work with me in the change process.<\/p><p> We are moving towards what is termed maximum sustainable yield in how we determine quotas each year.  The idea is that there is a set formula now based on data collection and linked to total allowable catch which can measure what a fish species can take in terms of the amount of fish caught each year to ensure that the stocks can survive and grow.  We are trying to apply maximum sustainable yield, MSY, calculations to as many of the stocks as we can and to have enough data to do that by 2015.  We are trying to apply it to all the stocks with sufficient data by 2020.  That is part of the programme.<\/p><p> The other issue relates to regionalisation of decision making.  This is something we are supportive of because we are keen to see countries fishing in Irish waters making decisions on the management of stocks in Irish waters rather than others, but we also want the protection of the Commission to ensure that Ireland does not get outvoted or outnumbered in a regionalisation structure on decision making.  For example, we want to avoid a scenario whereby the French and Spanish could gang up on Ireland and make decisions on fish stocks in Irish waters.  That would be unacceptable.  Only when there is a unanimous decision on a regionalised decision-making process will we support it.  Otherwise we want to be able to go back to the Commission, which is essentially there to support small nations.<\/p><p> The challenge is to find common ground with the European Parliament.  I will spend a good deal of time in Brussels talking to people in the European Parliament about how to ensure that the Council, which is represented by Ministers, and the European Parliament can come together in a co-decision process to find a compromise position on the future of the fishing industry and to try to get that job done by the end of June next year.

There is a basic agreement in principle on how to address discards.  However, dealing with the pelagic sector is different from dealing with the whitefish sector and there is a recognition of this, in particular in the whitefish sector, in which there are mixed fisheries.  For example, off the south coast of Ireland at Dunmore East if one is catching cod, one is also likely to catch haddock and whiting in the same net.  When adult fish species are the same size and a fisherman has a quota to catch two types but not the third, what does he do when he catches all three in the one net?  These are complex problems that we must try to solve through more technical measures and more targeted fishing gear.  It is one thing to deal with the juvenile fish issue.  One can deal with it through measures such as mesh size to allow smaller fish to escape, but in mixed fisheries where one is likely to catch multiple species in the one net because the fish are roughly the same size there are complex problems relating to the management of discards.  We are trying to find flexible ways of doing that, minimising discards and ultimately eliminating them altogether.

It relates to whether we should be setting ceilings on future single farm payments.  Before considering whether we should be setting caps on single farm payments, we first need to know that we have the capacity to do so.  I have been supportive of the Commissioner's proposals to cap single farm payments.  This would result in a reduction in payment on amounts in excess of \u20ac150,000.  I would like to see the cap set lower than \u20ac150,000.  I have stated that I would have no difficulty with a cap on payments of approximately \u20ac100,000.  I recognise that we must find a common solution across the European Union which all countries can accept and live with.  In my view, a number of the larger powerful countries, such as, for example, Germany and Britain, will not accept a cap on single farm payments because they have large landowners who are big commercial food producers who are receiving large payments and they want to see that continue.<\/p><p>  Ireland is in a different situation.  I need to ensure the flexibility countries are given in relation to the capping issue suits Ireland.  Once a final deal is done and, if we have the capacity on a voluntary basis, country by country, to be able to set caps on single farm payments, we can then have this discussion and try to get this right.  I do not have a problem with that in principle but we need to be careful not to push the cap too low because we have large commercial farmers we need to support.

We failed collectively last month as a European Union to get agreement on the MFF.  This budget is for seven years and is worth more than \u20ac1 trillion.  There was a wide variation in what countries wanted in terms of the levels of reduction or increases to that budget.  For example, Britain wanted cuts of up to \u20ac200 billion.  President Van Rompuy proposed cuts of approximately \u20ac80 billion.  As the negotiations proceeded, the different budget lines within the budget were being debated in terms of which might take cuts and which might not.  There are three big budget lines.  CAP represents approximately 38 to 40% of the budget.  Cohesion Funds represent one third of the budget and innovation and research and development also account for a large chunk of it.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been trying to prevent a significant reduction in the overall MFF funding.  If there are to be cuts, we will seek to protect the CAP budget within that.  Some 85% of all EU money coming into Ireland comes through CAP.  This amounts to approximately \u20ac1.6 billion per annum.  We had some success in the negotiations.  At one stage, it looked like there was going to be a cut to CAP of approximately 6% or 7% in terms of pillar 1 and about 11% in pillar 2.  By the end of the discussions, this had been reduced to a 3% cut in pillar 1, which was progress.

That being said, I think it is possible for us to revive the sugar industry, but only if a number of things happen.<\/p><p>  First of all, I have made it clear that the Government is not going to subsidise the setting up of a new sugar industry because we need to ensure that any new industry that begins in Ireland again can stand on its own two feet.  However, I believe there is a fighting chance that the sugar industry will be set up again in Ireland on a commercial basis.  Last summer we had two very professionally put together viability studies for the setting up of a sugar industry in Ireland again, from a processing point of view, which would involve building a large sugar processing plant and ethanol production facility.  There are a number of people who are extremely committed to making this happen and they are very credible people.  Michael Hoey, in particular, who heads up Beet Ireland, has put a huge amount of his own resources and time into putting together a very realistic business plan for rebuilding a sugar processing sector in Ireland.  It is his job to put the business case together and he will do that, in terms of attracting investors and so forth.  It is my job to ensure that if that business case is to proceed that there is either a sugar quota for Ireland in the future or there is no sugar quota in the European Union.  <\/p><p>  The current sugar regime in the EU will end in 2015 and Ireland has already been compensated to get out of that regime to the tune of \u20ac353 million.  That means that we are not going to be able to produce sugar before 2015.  The Commission is proposing that the sugar quota regime would end in 2015, which is something that Ireland supports.  However, I do not think it is realistic because the countries that currently have sugar quota will insist on the quota regime extending beyond 2015, in my view, possibly until 2018 or 2020.  In that context, we will be seeking an opportunity for Ireland to be allocated quota for domestic use, given the fact that we have been compensated to be out of the sugar industry until 2015 but not beyond that.  Given the size of our food industry here and the volume of sugar use in that industry, we should be allowed a sugar quota to be able to support it.  We have made a very strong case for this, both publicly and privately, to the Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#DDD01600","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1278,"content":"<p>If there is potential to rebuild and regenerate the sugar industry in Ireland then clearly steps should be taken to do so.

Both of them were presented to me and both of them involved detailed meetings around the presentation of those feasibility studies.  We then asked officials in the economics section of my Department to assess the feasibility of the business plans.  It is important to say, though, that in order for those business plans to be viable, the price of processed sugar must remain at a level that can pay for all of this because we are talking about a &#8364;200 million investment to build the plant before any sugar beet can be processed to produce either ethanol or sugar.  It is probably fair to say, as a rule of thumb, that these feasibility studies stack up if the price of sugar remains at over &#8364;500 per tonne.  It is well over that level at the moment and actually, in the last 12 months, it was close to &#8364;800 per tonne because there were real shortages of sugar in the European Union.  A lot of food industries in Ireland, some from my own part of the country, were finding it hard to get sugar at any price, which suggests that there is an argument around sugar security for both the pharmaceutical and food industries.  Having said that, a judgment has to be made by the investors and those putting the business plan together as to what the likely sugar price will be in three, five or ten years time and what the price will be if sugar quotas are abolished in the European Union.<\/p><p><br \/>  When we were producing sugar in Ireland we were not particularly competitive <i>vis-\u00e0-vis<\/i> other parts of Europe in terms of the tonnage of beet per hectare we were growing and the sugar content.  However, I believe we can be much more competitive now and the proof of that can be seen in the United Kingdom at the moment.  The varieties of sugar beet being grown there are highly competitive with other parts of Europe and there is no reason Ireland could not benefit from that.  We can be competitive in this area but whether this happens will be contingent on where world sugar prices go.  In my view, they are not likely to collapse any time soon.  Sugar is in strong demand because consumption will continue to grow, both in the European Union and, more important, further afield.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#DDD02200","speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coillte Teoranta Lands","time":1355416200,"counter":1284,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#DDD02250"},{"type":"question","time":1355416200,"counter":1285,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[55980\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#DDD02300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding the proposed sale of the Coillte forest crop; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1286,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question concerns the current position with regard to Coillte.

This is a very complex process which we are in the middle of at the moment but I assure Deputies that the Government will act with caution.  We will not do anything that will undermine or significantly damage the timber or sawmill sectors in Ireland.  Effectively, we have a monopoly in Coillte at the moment.

I would like to explain the decisions taken in last week's budget on the sheep grassland scheme.  We had a three year grassland scheme which was costing the country approximately \u20ac18 million a year, using unspent funds under Pillar 1.  The aim of the scheme and the idea behind it was to increase the number of sheep being farmed in Ireland because for ten years in a row the flock decreased in size year after year.  We had to try to reverse that trend.  I am delighted to be able to say the scheme has contributed significantly to reversing it and for the first time in a decade, the flock is bigger this year.  Therefore, the scheme has worked well.<\/p><p>  I now want to try what I know has worked in other sectors, particularly in the dairy sector, in which we have seen the benefit of discussion groups.  In the dairy sector dairy farmers meet on a monthly basis in what they might call &quot;dairy discussion groups&quot; to discuss how their business works and how their animals are performing and everything else.  The issues discussed include fertility, grazing, feed conversion efficiency, stock management and so on.  The evidence we have from the groups is that, on average, farmers who attend them have increased their profit margins by somewhere between 4% and 5%.  I want to see the same benefits in the sheep sector.  The sheep grassland scheme was due to end this year, but we have chosen to extend it into next year.  We will spend \u20ac14 million on it next year and use \u20ac3 million from the budget to initiate a sheep discussion group model to encourage sheep farmers to enter the type of discussion group setting that has worked so well for the dairy and beef sectors in order that we can help sheep farmers to make more in the market place rather than rely on schemes for an income.

I hope I have answered the questions on sheep farming.  I answered questions on the beef sector for Deputy Martin Ferris, but I will respond to Deputy Mick Wallace.  I am not targeting the small guys.  The new scheme we are putting in place - a \u20ac10 million scheme - will ensure farmers with 20 or fewer suckler cows will receive payments on all of them.  We made this provision deliberately to ensure smaller farmers would receive their payments first.  The bigger farmers, with more than 20 animals, may receive payment on more than 20 animals, if there is money left over as I suspect there will be at the end of the process.<\/p><p> The other aspect is that the new scheme does not requires farmers to do anything other than transfer data relating to the breeding and fertility of their animals to the ICBF.  We are not asking them to do all the other things they would have been paid for before.  In other words, they are being asked to do a fraction of what they were asked to do before and they are being paid \u20ac20 per cow rather than \u20ac40 per cow.  It is important for the Deputy to understand that the total amount of money going into the beef sector next year will not be very different from what went into the beef sector this year.  That is because under the existing suckler cow welfare scheme, at least \u20ac10 million is to be paid next year in respect of calves that were born in the second half of this year.  When that \u20ac10 million is taken with the \u20ac10 million we will spend on the new data transfer scheme and the \u20ac5 million we will spend on beef discussion groups - farmers will be given \u20ac1,000 to attend meetings and learn about how they can run their businesses more effectively - it means we will be spending \u20ac25 million on the beef sector next year.  Most of that will be spent in the suckler beef sector.  We spent approximately \u20ac27 million in the beef sector this year.  It is important for farmers to get this into context.  Since the budget, there has been a blunt focus on arguing that the abolition of the suckler cow welfare scheme is a disaster.  I suggest there should be a concentration on what we are putting in place to replace it.  The State will be putting almost as much money into the suckler sector next year as it has put into it this year.  We are prioritising small farmers in that mix.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300042#FFF02500","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355416200,"counter":1326,"content":"<p>Can the Minister tell us the number of suckler cows in the national herd?

This directive, known informally as the gender goods and services directive, implements the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services.  In its decision of 1 March 2011, in case C-236\/09 taken by a Belgian consumer rights organisation, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared that Article 5(2) of this directive was invalid, with effect from 21 December 2012.  This decision, known as the Test-Achats ruling, is binding on all member states of the European Union.  The provision thus struck down had allowed an exception from the principle of equal treatment enunciated in the regulation so that insurance companies could price life and motor insurance products differently for men and women, where this difference is reasonable and supported by actuarial or statistical data.<\/p><p>  Ireland availed of this exemption in the Equal Status Act 2000, permitting gender differentiation to continue in the areas of motor insurance, life assurance, critical illness cover, income protection cover, and private annuities and pensions.  The effect of the ruling is that Ireland is obliged to prohibit by law the selling of private insurance products which differentiate by gender on price or benefits and to have such provisions in force on or before 21 December 2012.  The unisex rule will apply to all contracts concluded for the first time as and from that date.  It also applies to agreements between parties, as and from 21 December 2012, to extend contracts concluded before that date which would otherwise have expired.<\/p><p>  The European Commission has issued guidelines on the application of this judgment on national legislation transposing directive 2004\/113 and on insurance industry practice.  I have taken due regard to this guidance and to the intention stated in the directive to avoid sudden readjustment of the insurance market in determining the amendments to the Equal Status Acts necessary to comply with this ruling.  As I will explain shortly, these amendments are largely technical in nature.  For me and for my colleagues in Government, this ruling highlights the crucial importance of achieving legal clarity in the drafting of legislation at European level to ensure that such instruments are interpreted and have the intended impact. <\/p><p>  The Government is conscious of the potential for confusion and misinformation among consumers and insurance providers alike resulting from these changes to the private insurance market.  For this reason, in October the Department published an information note for consumers on the new rules on the permitted use of gender by insurance providers and sources of further information and advice.  The information note is widely available through public information channels such as the Citizens Information Board.  I would like to express thanks to the industry bodies - the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Brokers Association, the Professional Insurance Brokers Association and the Society of Actuaries in Ireland - who contributed to the preparation of this advice for consumers.  I also thank the Department of Finance, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Social Protection, the Central Bank, the National Consumer Agency, the Citizens' Information Board, the Pensions Board, the Equality Authority and the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau.<\/p><p>  I would now like to highlight some of the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for amendment of section 5 of the Equal Status Act 2000.  It limits the existing derogation from the prohibition on gender discrimination in specified insurance products, provided in section 5 of the Equal Status Act, to contracts concluded before 21 December 2012.  This is to ensure the prohibition on gender-differentiated insurance, with effect from 21 December 2012, does not affect existing contracts lawfully entered into before that date.  The scope of the prohibition is then expanded by providing in a new subsection (4A) that all contracts within the categories of motor or life insurance concluded for the first time as and from 21 December 2012 must comply with the unisex rule.  For the avoidance of doubt and because to determine otherwise would result in a sudden readjustment of the motor insurance market, contrary to the intention of the directive, the second paragraph of the new subsection provides that mid-term adjustments to motor insurance contracts concluded before 21 December 2012 are not considered to be new contracts for this purpose.<\/p><p>  Finally, this section provides that the obligation imposed on the Central Bank of Ireland to compile, maintain and publish data to support the existing derogation ceases to have effect from 21 December 2012, while not affecting its obligation to maintain and publish data compiled before that date.  Consequential to the cessation of this obligation, section 5 provides for the amendment of section 41 of the principal Act.  It has the effect of terminating the Minister's power, which is no longer required, to make regulations with regard to the data to be compiled, published and maintained by the Central Bank.<\/p><p>  Section 3 provides for amendment of section 14 of the principal Act to clarify that insurance providers may continue to collect, store and use gender status or gender-related information which is genuinely intended for the purposes of reserving and internal pricing, reinsurance pricing, and life and health underwriting.  For example, it is envisaged that insurance providers may continue to gather and use gender data in connection with offering gender-specific insurance products and options within contracts to cover conditions which exclusively or primarily concern males or females, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer.<\/p><p>  I have also taken the opportunity afforded in this Bill to address a minor procedural issue regarding equal status complaints referred to the Equality Tribunal for mediation.  Section 4 provides for amendment of section 24 of the Equal Status Acts to extend the time available to persons who have referred such complaints to apply for resumption of the hearing in instances where mediation has not resolved the dispute between the parties.  The amendment will extend the period, after the issue of a notice of non-resolution, within which a complainant is allowed to make an application in writing for a resumption of the hearing, from 28 days to 42 days.  This amendment applies the same conditions to complaints under the Equal Status Acts on failure of mediation as are already applicable to resumption of complaints under the Employment Equality Acts.  The remaining provisions are of a standard or technical nature.<\/p><p>  Before concluding, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the technical nature of these amendments, while reiterating that the State has no option but to ensure national law complies with the European Court of Justice interpretation of the gender goods and services directive in this instance.  I thank the Members of the House for their attention and I look forward to a detailed discussion on the Bill.  I commend this Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300043#RR00800","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416800,"counter":1346,"content":"<p>Fianna F\u00e1il supports this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300043#RR00900","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1355416800,"counter":1347,"content":"<p>Sorry to interrupt, but I wish to apologise for not having a copy of what was a very technical speech available for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300043#RR01000","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1355417400,"counter":1348,"content":"<p>That is fine.  I thank the Minister of State.  We accept that we have to amend our legislation because the derogation period is coming to an end.  On that basis, we understand where the Minister of State is coming from.  We are supporting the Bill.  We do not have any particular issue with it.<\/p><p>  When the Equal Status Act 2000 was introduced, it was a ground-breaking measure.  Its effects on people's participation in civil society were felt throughout the country.  It was right that so many sections of society, including religious and political organisations, had to ensure they offered a level playing field to both genders.  It was important that many clubs and associations in this country experienced a mini-revolution when they had to rewrite their constitutions and go about their business differently.  It went a long way towards promoting a greater mix and a greater balance with regard to the participation of women in organisations.  Unfortunately, there were one or two high-profile instances of organisations in Dublin not abiding by the new law.  One particularly high-profile golf club refused to amend its rules to allow women to become full members.  It was regrettable that they did not comply with the spirit of the legislation.  Neither I nor my party would subscribe to the notion of having exclusive men-only organisations in a modern society.<\/p><p>  Perhaps we should review the complete effectiveness of the Equal Status Act 2000 by carrying out an audit, in so far as possible, of how it is being complied with by organisations throughout the country.  That could be done in many ways.  Our local authorities, for example, have a substantial active database of all community and voluntary organisations, including sports clubs and non-sporting organisations.  If we could audit and monitor the level of compliance with the 2000 Act and the impact it has had, it would be a worthwhile exercise as it would be something we could refer to in time.  If that is done, I am sure it will find that the legislation in question has had a very positive effect on the promotion of gender balance and a greater mix of participation by both genders.<\/p><p>  One of the major concerns associated with the Bill before is that it will lead to an increase in the premiums to be paid across a number of insurance policies.  I suppose the week after the budget is probably a bad week to discuss another increased bill that households will have to face.  Given that the derogation will cease on 21 December next and will not apply to new insurance policies written after that date, it is unfortunate that so many insurance premiums are renewed in early January.  The timing of this measure is particularly cruel because it means that many people will face increased insurance premiums late this year and early in the new year.  In that context, I would like to know whether any regulatory impact assessment was carried out by the Department.  Was that possible?  If so, was it published?  It might serve to inform the public.<\/p><p>  The final issue I would like to raise with regard to this Bill relates to the financial services industry.  Many of the organisations that underwrite this business are banks.  As we know, some banks are involved in insurance as well as banking.  Insurance is one of the many aspects of their financial services activity.  We will have to keep an eye on how they treat the application of this change in the legislation.  We must ensure they do not use it as an excuse to hike up premiums further than the actuarial people tell them they need to do.  In other words, they must not use it as an opportunity to try to grow their capital bases further, or engage in another capital-gathering exercise.  People are being squeezed by the banks on many fronts.  This should not be viewed by the banks as an opportunity to squeeze the consumer a bit more.  Consumers are being absolutely squeezed dry.  The Financial Regulator and the Central Bank should have a role in ensuring the banks do not engage in opportunism.  Unfortunately, we have learned to our detriment from our experience that the banks will take every opportunity possible to add a greater margin to the margins they are already squeezing out of people with the other products they are selling.  Did we get the observations of the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau of Ireland as part of the regulatory impact assessment?  Did that office make any input during the drafting of the legislation?  Has the Department had any particular interaction with the ombudsman in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300044#SS00100","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1355417400,"counter":1349,"content":"<p>As this is a very technical Bill, I will not take up too much time.  This Bill has had to be introduced on foot of the ruling by the European Court of Justice that the derogation in the EU gender directive that allows gender to be used as a risk factor in determining insurance costs is illegal.  While we are on the matter of European courts, I would like to mention briefly that it is a shame the Government does not seem to hold the European Court of Human Rights in the same regard.  I assume that is why it has not legislated for the X case as required by the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland.  There is a point to be made here about the role of statistical evidence about risk factors when the price of insurance is being determined.  Insurance premiums are based on risk factors.  In general, women receive lower premiums as there is a lower risk attached to them.  Geographical location is a further risk assessment factor.  Insurance costs are much higher in some parts of the country than in others because a higher proportion of road traffic accidents takes place in such locations.  My concern about this Bill is that it will not result in lower insurance premiums for male drivers, but higher premiums for female drivers.  While it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of gender, I am aware of some insurance companies in Britain that have introduced interesting initiatives to ensure women are not unfairly penalised in their insurance claims.  Some insurance companies in Britain are offering discounts for young driver schemes, as well as safe driver schemes in which premiums are reduced for both genders where there is a demonstrable record of safety over a period of time.  I hope insurance companies here will do the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300044#SS00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1355417400,"counter":1350,"content":"<p>I thank both Deputies.  I assure Deputy Niall Collins that there was extensive consultation with the entire insurance industry, as well as with the Departments of Finance, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Social Protection, the Central Bank, the National Consumer Agency, the Citizens Information Board, the Pensions Board, the Equality Authority and the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau of Ireland.  The level of consultation was quite significant.  People will always say there could have been additional consultation, but in this case I do not think that would have been possible.  Anyone who was seen to be a stakeholder in this sector, including the consumer, was consulted.<\/p><p>  As we all know, this measure has resulted from a case that was successfully taken at the European courts by a consumer group in Belgium.  I know people are very conscious of what others pay for their insurance.  We tend to know what is being paid.  I appreciate what Deputy Collins said about the mortgage protection, income protection and life assurance products offered by banks.  This Bill will not affect life assurance unless it is to be taken out after 21 December next and is therefore considered to be an ongoing contract rather than a new contract.<\/p><p>Where the major impact will be felt is in regard to new car insurance after 21 December.<\/p><p> Equality is a funny thing.  As a woman, I see how it will affect women but, on the other hand, as Deputy McLellan rightly said, if we take out the gender issue, insurance companies will surely be able to take account of the fact that someone is a safer driver, as they have done in the past.  No matter what gender they were, in the past unsafe drivers would see their insurance costs rise if they were involved in crashes.  It is this type of detail that will be necessary.<\/p><p> Equality is a funny thing.

People taking out insurance products, whether from a bank, a broker or directly from an insurance company would be wise to get at least three quotes.

Sometimes people do not realise this or forget it, and while there can be a degree of pressure, customers should resist it.<\/p><p> Comprehensive and detailed information leaflets are available both on the Department's website and on the website of the Citizens' Information Bureau.

The benefit of the health budget to the economy as a whole is obvious.  Supporting and maintaining people in a home setting for as long as is practical and possible is very desirable.<\/p><p>  There has been a whole sequence of adjustments and cutbacks to the home help scheme, particularly the number of hours available to particular families.  While I will not cite the individual cases that have cropped up in the Louth-Meath East constituency, I am sure they mirror the position across the country.  I exhort the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to take a serious and urgent look at the scheme.  It is so valuable to people living in a home setting that this bears reiteration time and again.  Even at a time when resources are scarce, there is a need to prioritise, and there is certainly a need to prioritise the home help scheme.

The aim of Government policy remains to support older people in living in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  This objective is realised through various community-based supports such as mainstream home help, enhanced home care packages, meals-on-wheels and day or respite provision.  Our aim is to develop and improve community-based supports where possible, taking account of wider reforms of the health service, the overall resources available and the need for the HSE to meet its statutory budgetary obligations.<\/p><p>  The HSE has been developing various operational initiatives to improve its approach nationally to all relevant aspects of its home support services.  These include various new guidelines for home care and agreeing a new procurement framework for approved agencies providing such services on a partnership basis on behalf of the executive.<\/p><p>While ongoing developments have been designed to standardise and maximise the use of limited resources in the face of increasing demand, they are also intended to enhance quality, safety and other key aspects of planning and delivering services, for both providers and care recipients alike.  The HSE service plan for 2012 originally envisaged some 50,000 recipients of mainstream home help and approximately 11,000 recipients of enhanced home care packages at any one time.  Notwithstanding the recently announced reduction in HSE home care towards the end of this year, investment in these services remains significant, with expected outturn expenditure of approximately \u20ac320 million for home help and home care packages in the course of 2012.<\/p><p> The recent measures adopted by the executive were designed to secure a reduction of approximately \u20ac8 million in expenditure on home help hours to the end of December, equating to some 400,000 hours, and a reduction of approximately \u20ac1.2 million on home care packages.  Every effort has been made to ensure the impact of these reductions will be minimised for individual recipients so that services are provided, in the first instance, for direct patient care.  Decisions in regard to the provision of home help hours continue to be based on a review of individual need and no current recipient of the service who has an assessed need will be without a provision.  The latest information available from the HSE indicates that in balancing overall projected financial savings for the home help budget nationally against maintaining adequate service in individual cases, it will probably not meet the savings target envisaged.  The Department continues to work closely with the executive to monitor the position between now and year end.<\/p><p> I emphasise again that in addressing very difficult financial realities overall, protecting community-based services for vulnerable older people continues to be a priority for the Government.  However, the challenge facing the HSE in drawing up its 2013 service plan should not be underestimated.  I am pleased, therefore, to reiterate our commitment to restore to 2012 levels of service the core community services of home help, home care packages and personal assistant hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300045#TT00800","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355418600,"counter":1360,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.

I attended the meeting at which she outlined in great detail what is proposed in this regard and attempted to allay some of the fears that were raised from the floor.  The difficulty, however, is that the communication breakdown between the HSE and parents' groups remains a problem.  Several of the parents who attended the public meeting and whose children are attending special needs schools had received virtually no information on the proposed reconfiguration before the Minister of State provided some of the details.  From speaking to parents in recent days, it seems this communication deficit has not yet been addressed.  There are parents who are still not aware of the plans that are being implemented.  This is something that needs to be taken on board by the Department.<\/p><p>  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the meeting that took place last Monday in the HSE offices in Cork at which parents of children with special needs had an opportunity to voice their concerns about the changes that are taking place.  I assume she received the minutes of the meeting, as did I, which clearly point to the concerns that remain outstanding and which must be addressed as soon as possible.  One of the main concerns relates to the issue of parent representation on the implementation groups.  The answer attendees received to queries as to whether there might be increased representation was that the proposed complement of four is larger than that in other geographical areas.  In other words, the message was that four parent representatives is more than enough.  That position must be clarified.  At the same time, there is a genuine concern among parents that the requirements of the parent representative role go above and beyond what they should be asked to do.  The Minister of State will recall from the public meeting she attended that many people are concerned that anybody who accepts the role of parent representative on the implementation group will be held responsible for all of the decisions made.  I accept that the Minister of State sought to clarify this matter at the meeting, but that fear persists.<\/p><p>  The other main concern among parents is how the changes can be implemented on a cost neutral basis.  In fact, there is a genuine view among parents that it is simply not possible.  Nobody has yet been able to provide them with details or a plan for how to improve the services and implement the proposed reconfiguration on a cost neutral basis without impacting on front-line services.  If the Minister of State could outline how that is proposed to be achieved, it might ease parents' fears.  There was a debate at the public meeting around the need for a mapping of services.  An argument is being put forward that such mapping should be in place before the implementation groups are established.  To do it the other way around would seem to be putting the cart before the horse.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?<\/p><p>  There is a danger that parents will be pitted against parents.  The minutes of last Monday's meeting show there are already differences of opinion, with parents of children attending mainstream schools or units attached to mainstream schools indicating a wish to proceed with nominating representatives to the implementation group as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>On the other hand there are parents of children attending special schools who are very wary about nominating representatives and proceeding with the implementation group.  We are already seeing a kind of breakdown within the implementation groups, with parents not being able to agree on the best way forward.<\/p><p> The other concern that came out of the meeting, which I hope will be addressed, was that parents were being asked to partake in the groups but they did not have all the documentation and did not know what the overall plan was.  No policy documents were provided to them for studying before they were asked to join the implementation groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300046#UU00600","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355419200,"counter":1367,"content":"<p>Every parent wants the very best for their child.  If one has a child with particular needs, or needs that are different from those of other children, there is always a fear the needs of the child will not be met into the future.  That is a normal feeling, something one must accept and realise happens.<\/p><p>  On the mapping, the implementation groups and whether the mapping should be in place, I reiterate what I said at that meeting, namely, both can run in tandem.  There is no need to hold one up while waiting on the other.  Mapping is vitally important, as I have always maintained.<\/p><p>  I refer to the Progressing Disability document, which is part of a suite of measures we are taking in the area of disability.  It is a very good document that outlines delivery of a service in the community.  I understand that people in specialist schools have a difficulty with that taking place.  I realise they are happy with the service they have and do not want to lose it so this reaction is very understandable.  The difficulties I heard about on that day were in terms of where children must go in order to receive the service, and the type of environment they will face.  It should be possible to sort out all these things - they are not impossible tasks but entirely solvable issues.<\/p><p>  However, there are swathes of children in the community going to mainstream schools who do not have access to any services.  I am not one who says we should run madly ahead with the project or that it is cost-neutral.  Nothing is cost-neutral.  Even moving something to a new location is not so because one has to look at the location and see what is needed.  We must try to ensure that every child has access to a service.  The mapping should tell us where the gaps are, which is key to the whole issue.  If we find there are gaps in the area of speech therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, psychology and all those things, it will then be my job, or that of whoever stands in this position next time around, to ensure the resources are put in place to fill those gaps.  That is what we did in mental health and what we are about to do in the area of older people and old age psychiatry.  It is what we need to do.<\/p><p>  Above all else, we must ensure every child has access to a service.  This is not an overnight project; it will take at least three years.  I heard the parents talking about their fears that day and these are genuine fears.  Nobody wants other than the very best for their children.  I would say to those people they need to be part of the process, if they want to have any influence.  That is not to say everything will be agreed.  This will not happen, it never does.  However, mapping and finding the gaps in the service is vitally important.  That is what we did in the area of mental health and we need to do it here too.  We cannot continue to allow the resource that is in place to go unused.  It is not enough, but the resource I mean is the allied professionals I just named.  I do not say this in a negative or disingenuous way.  We cannot allow all those people to remain within institutions and only delivering service in those institutions.  We must have a more holistic approach and must ensure that children who have a difficulty about going into particular areas are accommodated.  I very clearly heard the woman the Deputy mentioned.<\/p><p>  This is a solvable problem, however, and we need to look at solutions.  This is about delivering a better service to more children, and also to those many young adults who are still receiving the service.  That would be the aim but it is not an overnight project and will take time.  I urge people to become engaged with the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300047#VV00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1355419200,"counter":1368,"content":"<p>I do not, for one moment, doubt the Minister of State's sincerity about trying to improve the service.

That is a big fear people have, as the Minister of State will know from the meeting.<\/p><p>  I completely agree we must map out the services we need in order to identify the gaps that must be filled.  The Minister of State rightly stated there cannot be a situation where people who need services do not receive them.  Everybody is entitled to them and should receive them.  The mapping process will identify the individuals in question and resources will have to be put in place.<\/p><p>  The big fear, however, was about doing the work on a cost-neutral basis.  If gaps are being identified which will then have to be plugged with resources, and this is being attempted on a cost-neutral basis, it is easy to understand the fear on the part of parents whose children are attending specialist schools.  Their big fear is that in moving to the geographical model services will be taken from some individuals in order to plug the gaps in other areas.  The Minister of State's acknowledgment today that perhaps this cannot be done on a cost-neutral basis is a positive step and I am sure if parents heard it they would feel there is an understanding of their fears.

I know if I had a child who was receiving a very good service and there was a possibility that service might move to a different location, I would be very nervous about all of that.

The deeds will be different in the area of disability and we understand that.  Nevertheless that type of mapping process works.  It looks at where gaps exist and what is necessary to ensure they are filled, not by robbing Peter to pay Paul but by taking a look at the kind of enhanced budget we need.  This may be a separate budget.  In mental health, we used developmental money rather than a centralised budget.  That is the direction we need to take and we must look at it.<\/p><p>  That answer will not satisfy the parents we met in Ballincollig - at this time.

According to ASH Ireland, the prevalence of smoking in this country stands somewhere between 26% and 29%.  While the position in this regard is better than it was a generation ago, when nearly half of the population smoked, the figure remains high, particularly in comparison to that in places such as California where only 11% of the population smoke, or Norway where the figure is 17%.  Smoking must be one of the greatest causes of health problems, with most smokers admitting that they wish they had never begun in the first instance.  Smoking is an extremely difficult addiction to overcome and a very expensive habit.<\/p><p>  We have made great strides in reducing the level of smoking, having banned it in so many public places.  It is well known, however, that the cost of nicotine replacement therapies such as gum, patches and the newer artificial cigarettes is a factor in ensuring some people continue to smoke.  They are very expensive, particularly in comparison to the prices paid by our friends north of the Border and throughout the United Kingdom.  A major factor in the difference in price is that the British Government has introduced a special VAT of just 5% for these therapies.  In Ireland, however, we charge a rate of 23%.  This is what gives rise to the significant price differential between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  If we could follow the example of the United Kingdom and introduce a similar rate here, the knock-on effects for smokers and the Exchequer would be tremendous.  Over 5,500 people die each year as a result of smoking-related illnesses.  It is estimated that we spend close to \u20ac1.5 billion in treating these illnesses.  While a reduction in VAT might result in a small shortfall for Revenue, we should consider the savings to be made in the long term if the beleaguered Department of Health were obliged to deal with fewer smoking-related illnesses.  We must do everything possible to reduce the startling statistics for smoking.  We can only bring about such a reduction if we help people to give up smoking, while also deterring young people from taking up the habit.  Having nicotine replacement therapies available at a reasonable price would definitely assist those trying to beat the addiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300048#WW00100","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1355419800,"counter":1372,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue, to which I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  I welcome the opportunity to outline the position on the question of the VAT treatment of nicotine replacement patches posed by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  I wish to explain that, when considering the VAT system and the VAT treatment of any product or service, the VAT rating of goods and services is governed by the requirements of the EU VAT directive with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In this regard, it may be useful to remind the House of the structure of Ireland's VAT regime.  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland operates a number of VAT rates.  The standard VAT rate of 23% applies to the majority of goods and services, including cars, petrol, diesel, alcohol, tobacco, electrical equipment, CDs and DVDs.  There is also a reduced rate of 13.5% which applies mainly to fuel used for heat or light, construction, housing, labour intensive services and general repairs and maintenance.  A second reduced rate of 9%, introduced as part of the jobs initiative, applies mainly to tourism-related services, including hotel and holiday accommodation, restaurant services and some entertainment services.  The zero rate of VAT generally applies to most food, children's clothes and shoes and oral medicines.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, nicotine replacement patches are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 23%.  Unlike other nicotine products such as inhalers, tablets and chewing gum which are categorised as oral medicines and which thereby qualify for the zero-rate of VAT, nicotine replacement patches are not considered to be oral medicines and are, therefore, correctly subject to the standard rate of VAT of 23%.  However, I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that member states have the option, under Annex lll of the EU VAT directive, of applying a reduced rate of VAT to pharmaceutical products of a kind normally used for health care, for the prevention of illnesses and medical treatment purposes.  In this regard, since nicotine replacement patches could be considered to meet such criteria, Ireland would have the option of applying a reduced rate to such products.  However, constraints imposed by the VAT directive on the number of reduced VAT rates which a member state may operate at any one time would not allow for the possibility of a special reduced VAT rate of 5% to match, as suggested by the Deputy, that which applies in the United Kingdom.  Article 98 of the directive provides that member states may apply either one or two reduced rates to the goods and services listed in Annex lll.  The introduction of a third reduced VAT rate would, therefore, not be possible under EU VAT rules.  Accordingly, any reduction in the VAT rate on nicotine replacement patches would have to be considered in the context of the existing 9% and 13.5% reduced rates.<\/p><p>  A proposal to reduce the VAT rate applying to any good or service raises a number of issues.  The Deputy will not be surprised if I emphasise the need to maintain VAT revenues and also the need to ensure losses to the Exchequer in these difficult economic times are avoided.  Notwithstanding the potential health benefits which may accrue from the use of nicotine replacement patches, losses in one area must be balanced by savings or increased taxes in others.  The issue of the degree to which the consumer might benefit from a reduction in VAT on nicotine replacement patches also arises.  In this regard, there is, unfortunately, no guarantee that moving standard-rated products to a reduced rate of VAT would necessarily be reflected in full in the retail prices charged to consumers.  Any dilution of the potential benefit to the consumer would obviously be a major concern and effectively negate the promotion of the use of nicotine patch technology.<\/p><p>  In the context of the imbalance of price between Ireland and the United Kingdom to which the Deputy refers, cross-Border shopping studies indicate that fluctuations in the exchange rate between sterling and the euro represent the most significant influence on price.  In this respect, the current exchange rate between sterling and the euro should provide less incentive for people to shop outside the State.  The report of the implications of cross-Border shopping which was undertaken on behalf of the Minister for Finance by the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office notes that the main causes of price differentials between goods in Northern Ireland and the Republic are operating costs, profit margin or mark-up, taxes and the exchange rate between sterling and the euro.  While variations in VAT rates widened some price differentials, their impact remained small compared to the significance of the change in the exchange rate.<\/p><p>  I again thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I hope I have clarified the position on the VAT treatment of nicotine replacement patches and the situation regarding the possibilities available under the EU VAT directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300048#WW00200","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1355419800,"counter":1373,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and highlighting the various rules which apply.  I remain of the view that this is an area in which we should do a great deal more work, particularly as the benefits for Ireland and other member states would be very significant.  It is stated one's health is one's wealth.  If we can help people to stop smoking, we will have done a great deed.  Nicotine replacement therapies are sold from behind the counter in Ireland, whereas in the United Kingdom and most other countries they are sold off the shelf.  They are also sold exclusively by chemist shops in this country, but elsewhere one can purchase them from a wide variety of outlets, which makes matters much easier for those who want to quit.  I am determined to pursue this significant issue which has major implications for people's health and the Exchequer.  We must do everything in our power to help people stop smoking, particularly as the habit is so closely associated with the lower socioeconomic classes.  In the case of a person in receipt of a benefit payment of \u20ac188 per week and who smokes 20 cigarettes a day - most people smoke more at weekends - one can calculate that he or she spends \u20ac60 to \u20ac70 a week on tobacco, which is a significant amount of money.  If we put in place a task force to assist people on benefits to quit the habit, this would go a long way towards helping such individuals rebalance their budgets rather than watching their money go up in smoke.<\/p><p>I appreciate fully the point made by Deputy Phelan.  She correctly described the impact on public health of the sale of tobacco.  I suggest the promotion of nicotine patches is an issue she could discuss with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  It may be possible to have nicotine patches on open display to make them more available to the consumer.  The cost of 20 cigarettes is the best part of \u20ac70 a week.  This is a major expenditure for people on low incomes.  More than 5,500 people die in this country every year from smoking related diseases.  The consumption of cigarettes is detrimental to people's health.<\/p><p> I refer to the issue of the illegal importation of tobacco products.  Cigarettes are being sold door to door.  This is illicit tobacco and the quality is dubious.  Any tobacco is bad but this illicit tobacco is substandard and the quality is even worse.<\/p><p> The Minister for Finance referred to the possibility of a VAT rate of 9% or 13.5% on nicotine replacement patches.

Dublin City Council figures show that last year, 16,600 families and individuals were on its housing waiting list, with 7,538 on the transfer list.  A total of 32% of applicants were waiting more than five years, with 2,544 waiting more than seven years.  I describe these figures as deeply damaging to the credibility of Dublin City Council and the Government.  In addition, Fingal County Council confirmed to me that 9,082 families and individuals were waiting for housing on its council housing list.<\/p><p>  When Members of this House are able to retire to our comfortable homes or lodgings after long days in the D\u00e1il, 80 to 90 people will be sleeping on the streets of this city.  They will sleep outside on this very night as they have done over recent bitter November nights.  It is unacceptable and disgraceful.<\/p><p>  Like other Members I receive many phone calls and e-mails from constituents.  I meet many of them at my weekly information clinics who are in dire straits with regard to housing.  They describe very difficult home circumstances.  They may be on a housing waiting list for anything from five to 13 years.  A typical example is a young woman with three children who has been living for the past five or six years in very cramped conditions with her adult siblings and her parents in a modest two-bedroom house.<\/p><p>  A few weeks ago I asked the Taoiseach whether a social housing investment programme would be implemented in 2012.  I have studied budget 2013 as best I can but I have not found any evidence of any serious intent on the part of this Government to address this issue.  I estimate that perhaps only a few dozen individuals and households were rehoused in the past year in my constituency out of the 4,000 on the Dublin North-Central housing list.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is committed to tackling the issue but it is impossible for any progress to be made unless proper funding is allocated to kick-start the social housing programme.  This would also have a beneficial effect on the construction industry.<\/p><p>  I have spoken about the appalling treatment of citizens who have been left on the waiting list, in some cases for up to 15 years.  I have long urged Dublin City Council to move away from its historic points-based, priority-based housing list system to a system based on time on the list, as used in Fingal County Council.  I am a former Dublin City Council councillor.  The council last week decided to move to the system of time on the list, which is a fair and transparent system.  It is a case of first come, first served.  It now awaits the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to sign the regulation.  When will he sign that regulation?<\/p><p>  Under the Fianna F\u00e1il regime led by Ahern and Cowen, the failure of local authorities to provide social housing meant a massive growth in the private rental sector.  In the past five years since 2007, almost \u20ac3 billion has been expended on rent supplement allowances.  This money has gone into the pockets of private landlords.  Ordinary constituents wonder why that money was not used to fund a housing programme.<\/p><p>  When will the promised housing Bill come before the House?  I refer in particular to provisions in respect of the administration of voluntary housing bodies.  My constituency has organisations such as NABCO, Iveagh Trust, Respond and Cl\u00faid.  There is no legislation governing estate management and tenancy and it is urgently needed.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, gave two deadlines - the first Sunday in September and then a further ten days - to the developers, builders, auctioneers, insurance companies in respect of the pyrite disaster.  He keeps issuing deadlines but when will he take action?  When will he decide to levy the industry which did those terrible things to households?  People are upset that they are expected to pay a housing tax - which the House will discuss tomorrow - on houses which are worthless because they need to be remediated.  I ask the Minister of State to bring these points to the attention of the Minister.<\/p><p>  On a final point, I ask the Minister of State to ask if the Minister will join us next Monday at 7.30 p.m. at Priory Hall for a candlelight vigil.  Those families - a total of 250 people - are facing a second Christmas out of their homes at Priory Hall.  I am sure they would be delighted to see him at the vigil next Monday night at Priory Hall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300049#XX00300","speaker":"1020"},{"type":"speech","time":1355420400,"counter":1378,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this issue.  I may not have the comprehensive reply he wants but I will bring his concerns to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Hogan.  The current economic crisis is severely testing the capacity of the State to meet social housing need.  Financial considerations mean local authorities are effectively no longer engaged in large-scale housing stock construction programmes at the very time when demand for housing services is at its greatest.  The Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, sets out a new approach for housing provision that recognises these key unfortunate realities.  It is specifically predicated on a tenure-neutral approach that focuses on enabling households to access the housing solution that best suited to their needs at a point in time.  While home ownership is still a very valid aspiration for a majority of households, it is no longer the acme of all tenure options.<\/p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with the housing authorities and with not-for-profit approved housing bodies, is engaging in a range of innovative and flexible housing solutions to meet housing need in general, and homelessness in particular.  I acknowledge the Deputy's campaigning work on behalf of the homeless  I sympathise with the fact that up to 80 people are sleeping on the streets of Dublin tonight.  I cannot even imagine what it must be like on such a cold evening.  I appreciate the Deputy's point about homelessness.<\/p><p>  The Department's approach to homelessness is to focus on providing people with a home where they can live as full and valued members of society.<\/p><p>That is why Government policy in this area is moving to a housing-led approach rather than the traditional model that places hostel or shelter-type accommodation at the centre of accommodation provision.  This change will take time to implement, but the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is committed to seeing it through.  People deserve the dignity of a home.  We must obviously bear in mind the financial constraints.<\/p><p> Early in the new year, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will be issuing a policy statement on homelessness.  This will indicate what we expect from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.  The Minister of State has sought to put in place real solutions for people who find themselves without a home.  Investment of nearly \u20ac50 million has been provided by central and local government in the provision of homelessness services in 2012.<\/p><p> With regard to wider demand for social housing, the Government's focus is on optimising the delivery of social housing for the resources invested.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.<\/p><p> The social housing capital budget has had to be reduced from \u20ac1.535 billion in 2008 to just over \u20ac333.7 million this year - this is a considerable reduction - and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital-funded construction programmes.  Nevertheless, the Minister of State is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs across the country through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  Delivery is being significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the rental accommodation scheme and leasing, but the Minister of State is also developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. In spite of these challenging circumstances, a tentative projection of 4,000 housing units is anticipated for 2012.<\/p><p> The Minister of State will continue to target available resources to ensure the critical housing needs of the most vulnerable sectors of our society are addressed.  Precise data are critical in this regard, which is why the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will in 2013 carry out a full housing-needs assessment, the first such assessment to be carried out under the 2009 housing Act.  This will give a comprehensive picture of real need and help to direct scarce resources to best effect.<\/p><p> I will pass on Deputy Broughan's concerns on Priory Hall to the Minister, Deputy Hogan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300049#XX00400","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355421000,"counter":1380,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome that because the householders of Priory Hall are anxiously awaiting the recommendation of Mr. Justice Finnegan.

The Government is supposed to be getting \u20ac400 million plus for the 4G communications auction.  Could at least part of this not be hypothecated to address the awful housing problem?  Might this be considered?  I understand we are not going to make the promissory note payment at the end of March.  We slotted into the Estimates for the medium term approximately \u20ac5 billion between interest and capital repayments.

State agencies, the Department and companies are working together to restore new markets in areas such as Asia, the Middle East, Russia and Africa.  We are also developing a common brand, Origin Green, across the food industry generally.  This is about differentiating Irish food from food produced in competitor countries.  Essentially, it is a sustainability claim backed up by data that are internationally accredited in respect of how food is produced in Ireland.  Part of building that brand requires a sustainability and quality programme for primary producers of dairy projects.  This is why, in last year's budget, I announced that I wanted to see the rolling out of a quality or sustainability programme among the 18,000 dairy farmers in the country to ensure we could stand over our collective dairy industry and say we produce milk to a certain standard.  This will not be some kind of inspection-based witch-hunt of farmers; it will be quite the opposite.  We will roll out the programme in the same way that the carbon-footprinting programme has been rolled out for the beef sector.  By the end of this year, 32,000 beef farms across Ireland will be carbon-footprinted.  When we sell a steak, not only will we be able to put on the label the traceability claim indicating the farmyard from where it came, we will also be able to tell buyers the carbon footprint of the animal that produced it.<\/p><p>We want to provide similar sustainability claims for dairy production in Ireland.

I understand Teagasc has prepared expansion plans for the dairy industry and the plans indicate it will be expensive to expand.  This industry, by its nature, is capital intensive and there is a low margin return on the money invested in it.  When the inevitable price volatility that will arise for the dairy sector is injected into the mix, any proposal that will increase costs for the farmer, or a combination of farmers in partnership arrangements, is dangerous territory to approach.<\/p><p>  Is the model of the proposed scheme a template taken from somewhere else?  Has it been modelled on a template in some other jurisdiction across the Community?  For instance, will the authorities north of the Border have a parallel scheme running alongside our proposed scheme?

Let us not forget that more than 85% of all the milk we produce is exported in various forms, be it infant formula, skimmed and semi-skimmed milk, cheese, yoghurts and all the other products in which milk is an ingredient.  If we are to be able to demand a higher price for our product in the future, which we will need to do, and move away from being a commodity producer of volume to being a quality producer of volume, targeting the top 10% price area in the new markets we are exploring, we have to be able to stand over the way in which our food is produced.  The sustainability and quality programme will not cost farmers a great deal of money, in fact it will help them to run their businesses more efficiently.  If a farmer is using less water, has more feed conversion efficiency and more efficient grazing management, his business will be more efficient and sustainable.  The combination of those two factors will improve the standard of dairy farming in Ireland, which will be beneficial for everybody.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the context of the capital investment farmers have to make, we will make more than &#8364;10 million available to dairy farmers next year in the form of the TAM scheme, which is half of the overall scheme as such, to help them with the costs of expansion, growth and upgrading their equipment.<\/p><p><i>  Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  Environmental sustainability is an increasingly important issue in the marketplace for many multinational dairy and food operators, many of which now have sustainability as a core part of their corporate strategies.  During my trade missions to China and the US in 2012 it was clear that the sustainability and quality messages have a strong resonance both with potential customers for Irish food products and with potential investors in the Irish agri food sector.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Developing a unique selling point for Irish food products is a critically important element of the national strategy for the development of the sector.  It is particularly relevant in the dairy sector where we will need to maximise market returns for significantly increased production in competitive markets worldwide.  Ireland is well placed to develop a national brand image based on a reputation for high quality dairy products, and on its mild maritime climate, plentiful supplies of water, grass based production and an already positive green image.<\/p><p><br \/>  In that context, earlier this year, Bord Bia launched its &#8220;Origin Green&#8221; programme, which establishes a framework within which Irish food companies can have their green credentials independently measured.  This will be a critically important element in the development of the Irish food sector in the coming years and its promotion on international markets. The key is to build independently verifiable metrics, which can be used in the marketplace, around Ireland&#8217;s already positive green image.   <\/p><p><br \/>  It is equally important to develop an independently accredited sustainability and quality programme at farm level for the dairy sector as part of that overall strategy to enable the sector point to verifiable attributes in maintaining and expanding its market share.  There is also a strong correlation between the measures needed to improve environmental sustainability and to improve hygiene and other quality practices on farm, and those needed to reduce the costs of production at farm level and improve profitability.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In that context, and following extensive consultations with stakeholders in the first half of 2012, I announced in June that Bord Bia would begin detailed work on the development of a national sustainability and quality programme for the dairy sector to be used as a key element in marketing and promotional efforts on international markets.  The programme will provide an independently accredited framework for operating best practice quality and sustainability principles on Irish dairy farms, and an objective and uniform mechanism for measuring compliance with these principles.  It will also provide a vehicle for encouraging continuous improvement in production standards on Irish farms, underpin the marketing of Irish dairy products internationally and provide additional assurance for potential investors in Ireland. <\/p><p><br \/>  Stakeholders are currently engaged in detailed technical discussions on the development of the programme, under the aegis of a technical advisory group convened by Bord Bia to progress the issue, and I hope it can be finalised in the near future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300051#ZZZ00300","speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Expenditure","time":1355421600,"counter":1392,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300051#ZZZ00400"},{"type":"question","time":1355421600,"counter":1393,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[56052\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300051#ZZZ00500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the impact of budgetary cuts on farm programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1355421600,"counter":1394,"content":"<p>As this is a fairly broad question, I will address the issues that might be most pertinent.  There has been some criticism since the announcement of the budget that we have targeted certain schemes unfairly and I want to give the Deputy the rationale for why we did what we did.  I will deal with the beef sector first. <\/p><p>   For the past five years we have had a suckler cow welfare scheme which has been a popular and extremely good scheme.  It has significantly improved the welfare standards within the suckler herd and it has provided very valuable data around breeding programmes and fertility within herds to Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, which is very useful for planning for the future, breeding programmes and so on.  That was a five year scheme and this is the fifth year of it.  It has come to an end.  I had signalled that I would not be able to continue the suckler cow welfare scheme indefinitely into the future because we do not have the money to do it and it has come to the end of its five year term.  I would have had to have put a new scheme in place and get approval from Brussels for that.  Instead we decided to put in place a smaller, more targeted scheme to replace the suckler scheme for the moment, which will cost us approximately \u20ac10 million a year and which will pay farmers \u20ac20 rather than \u20ac40 an animal.  We are asking them to continue to supply the kind of data on breeding and fertility they previously would have been providing to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF.  We are asking new entrants also to provide that data for that money.<\/p><p>  It is important to say in terms of the beef sector, because it is misunderstood, that next year we will spend almost as much on the beef sector as we spent this year.  This year we will spend \u20ac25 million on the suckler cow welfare scheme in addition to approximately \u20ac2 million connected to beef discussion groups which started half way through the year.  Next year we will spend \u20ac10 million on this new scheme.  We will spend \u20ac10 million on the existing suckler cow welfare scheme where the payments will be paid next year in respect of calves that were born in the second half of the year, and we will spend \u20ac5 million on beef discussion groups on this sector next year.  That is \u20ac25 million that will be spent on suckler beef next year which is not a significant difference from what was spent on that sector this year, although I accept the make-up and design of those payments are different.  I will address one or two of the other sectors related to the sheep sector and DAS payments when I get an opportunity to do so later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300051#ZZZ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1355421600,"counter":1395,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

Notwithstanding the tremendous work regarding the provision of data and so forth, the suckler scheme has had a huge impact on the quality of calves being born and in terms of the finished product, and everybody benefited as a result.<\/p><p>  It is not the remit of the Minister's Department, but the farm assist scheme has been cut by approximately \u20ac8 million.  The farmers in that scheme are the most marginal and they are struggling to survive and care for their families.  These cuts will have a detrimental effect on that type of farming in particular because one will find that the farmers in the suckler welfare scheme and some people involved in sheep farming are also dependent on farm assist.  While the Minister might try to make up that loss another way, perhaps by compensating for the situation in regard the suckler welfare scheme, the farm assist being cut as well will make it almost impossible for these type of farmers to survive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300051#ZZZ00700","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1355421600,"counter":1396,"content":"<p>There is a genuine concern about ensuring that farmers on relatively small farms in very disadvantaged areas are provided with enough support to keep them on the land.  That is the reason, in terms of the savings we must make in the disadvantage areas scheme, we have excluded mountainous farmers from any of those savings to ensure nobody farming in a mountainous area - that is 32,000 out of the 100,000 - will face any reduction in their incomes.  Regarding the low land disadvantaged area farmers, instead of reducing the rate for everybody, we have reduced the eligible hectarage for people to again protect smaller farmers.  In other words, instead of claiming the payment on 34 hectares as a maximum it will be claimed on 30 hectares as a maximum.  I have tried to prioritise the most disadvantaged farmers, that is, the people on the mountains and the smaller farmers within the disadvantaged areas scheme, DAS, in lowland areas.  A total of 73% of people in disadvantaged areas will be unaffected by the reductions and the remainder will see a reduction of an average of about 11% but those decisions were made to protect those with holdings and the most disadvantaged people within DAS areas.  The same applies to the suckler scheme.  Those who apply for the new suckler scheme in terms of the data transfer scheme will automatically get \u20ac20 per cow for the first 20 cows.<\/p><p>The average size of a suckler herd is 16 cows while the average size of a suckler herd in the suckler cow welfare scheme is 18 cows.  We are trying to prioritise smaller farmers.  If we have moneys left over after that, then we will give it to the farmers who have more than 20 cows.  I believe there will be some money left over to give top-up payments to farmers with 30 to 40 suckler cows.<\/p><p> This was the third year of the three-year sheep grasslands scheme.  We have decided to continue with the scheme, which will be paid for by unspent moneys under pillar 1.  While we have reduced the cost of it from \u20ac18 million to \u20ac14 million, we have made up for that by introducing a discussion group, similar to the ones that have worked so well for the dairy sector, which will bring farmers together to discuss how they can improve their businesses and make more money in the marketplace.  We will spend \u20ac3 million on these discussion groups next year.  The total spend on the sheep sector next year will be more or less the same as this year's.

Indeed, expenditure under the programme for Dunmore East since 2007 has been in the order of &#8364;4 million.  This is in recognition of the valuable contribution the harbour makes to the fishing industry as well as the local community in terms of the support the harbour infrastructure provides to the development of the tourism industry and the local economy generally.<\/p><p><br \/>  Dunmore East fishery harbour centre provides a dedicated and essential service to our fishing fleet.  Both local and visiting fishing vessels, including vessels of significant dimensions, avail of the harbour facilities at Dunmore East.  I am happy to report the investment in Dunmore East fishery harbour centre in recent years is bearing fruit.  Indeed, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority's records indicate a year-on-year increase in fish landings in recent years.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department's officials host a harbour users' forum regularly and meet with local stakeholders and harbour users.  This forum provides a platform for harbour users to air their views and gives my officials an opportunity to hear at first hand the concerns and suggestions of the people using the harbour facilities.

This is a figure we cannot afford immediately but I am conscious of the need to dredge the harbour.  We are examining the best way of dealing with this as safely as we can given our budgetary constraints.

Over the past decade, however, this long-established fishing industry has been under threat from restrictions designed to protect stocks.  The local fishermen's co-operative is struggling enormously with EU fish quota restrictions, an aging fishing fleet and poor fish prices caused by low demand due to the recession.  As fishing vessels become more technologically demanding, additional pressure has been put on resources and infrastructure.  Reduced catches put pressure on employment in the processing sector.  Several fish factories have already closed in Dunmore East over the past four years.<\/p><p>  Dunmore East Harbour is suffering from inadequate infrastructure to address its potential needs.  No dredging of the harbour has taken place for 17 years.  Consequently, larger vessels cannot access the harbour.  Silting has reduced the depth of the approach under the synchrolift.  Despite the fact that it has a lifting capacity of 200 tonnes, it is only suitable for vessels with a maximum draft of about nine feet.  Hence, many vessels have to divert to Cork or Howth for docking.  This poor access has had a devastating impact on the local fishing fleet.<\/p><p>  Since the recession hit, several hotels and restaurants in Dunmore East have closed.  There is a significant scarcity of work and little or no investment in local industry.  It is well recognised that the average income in the fishing village is below the national average.  The local community has suffered significantly in the past several years, with a 12% decline in population.

These preparations have been completed this year in an impressive manner.<\/p><p>  There has been much talk about getting the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy done during the Irish EU Presidency.  I am equally focused on the Common Fisheries Policy.  We want to get a deal for all countries but one that will also shape policy to ensure the Irish industry can survive and grow.  One of the key issues under discussion is how we deal with discards.<\/p><p>At the moment in many of our fisheries up to 40% or 50% of the fish caught are being dumped over the side, dead.  They are either juvenile fish or in some cases adult fish.  We need and we will find solutions to that and I hope the industry will work with me in the change process.<\/p><p> We are moving towards what is termed maximum sustainable yield in how we determine quotas each year.  The idea is that there is a set formula now based on data collection and linked to total allowable catch which can measure what a fish species can take in terms of the amount of fish caught each year to ensure that the stocks can survive and grow.  We are trying to apply maximum sustainable yield, MSY, calculations to as many of the stocks as we can and to have enough data to do that by 2015.  We are trying to apply it to all the stocks with sufficient data by 2020.  That is part of the programme.<\/p><p> The other issue relates to regionalisation of decision making.  This is something we are supportive of because we are keen to see countries fishing in Irish waters making decisions on the management of stocks in Irish waters rather than others, but we also want the protection of the Commission to ensure that Ireland does not get outvoted or outnumbered in a regionalisation structure on decision making.  For example, we want to avoid a scenario whereby the French and Spanish could gang up on Ireland and make decisions on fish stocks in Irish waters.  That would be unacceptable.  Only when there is a unanimous decision on a regionalised decision-making process will we support it.  Otherwise we want to be able to go back to the Commission, which is essentially there to support small nations.<\/p><p> The challenge is to find common ground with the European Parliament.  I will spend a good deal of time in Brussels talking to people in the European Parliament about how to ensure that the Council, which is represented by Ministers, and the European Parliament can come together in a co-decision process to find a compromise position on the future of the fishing industry and to try to get that job done by the end of June next year.

There is a basic agreement in principle on how to address discards.  However, dealing with the pelagic sector is different from dealing with the whitefish sector and there is a recognition of this, in particular in the whitefish sector, in which there are mixed fisheries.  For example, off the south coast of Ireland at Dunmore East if one is catching cod, one is also likely to catch haddock and whiting in the same net.  When adult fish species are the same size and a fisherman has a quota to catch two types but not the third, what does he do when he catches all three in the one net?  These are complex problems that we must try to solve through more technical measures and more targeted fishing gear.  It is one thing to deal with the juvenile fish issue.  One can deal with it through measures such as mesh size to allow smaller fish to escape, but in mixed fisheries where one is likely to catch multiple species in the one net because the fish are roughly the same size there are complex problems relating to the management of discards.  We are trying to find flexible ways of doing that, minimising discards and ultimately eliminating them altogether.  I believe we will be able to do that.<\/p><p>  It will be possible to do this before June but it will be challenging because there are deep divisions on some of these issues between member states, some of which are driven by the sustainability arguments while others are driven by the fishing industry.

It relates to whether we should be setting ceilings on future single farm payments.  Before considering whether we should be setting caps on single farm payments, we first need to know that we have the capacity to do so.  I have been supportive of the Commissioner's proposals to cap single farm payments.  This would result in a reduction in payment on amounts in excess of \u20ac150,000.  I would like to see the cap set lower than \u20ac150,000.  I have stated that I would have no difficulty with a cap on payments of approximately \u20ac100,000.  I recognise that we must find a common solution across the European Union which all countries can accept and live with.  In my view, a number of the larger powerful countries, such as, for example, Germany and Britain, will not accept a cap on single farm payments because they have large landowners who are big commercial food producers who are receiving large payments and they want to see that continue.<\/p><p>  Ireland is in a different situation.  I need to ensure the flexibility countries are given in relation to the capping issue suits Ireland.  Once a final deal is done and, if we have the capacity on a voluntary basis, country by country, to be able to set caps on single farm payments, we can then have this discussion and try to get this right.  I do not have a problem with that in principle but we need to be careful not to push the cap too low because we have large commercial farmers we need to support.

We failed collectively last month as a European Union to get agreement on the MFF.  This budget is for seven years and is worth more than \u20ac1 trillion.  There was a wide variation in what countries wanted in terms of the levels of reduction or increases to that budget.  For example, Britain wanted cuts of up to \u20ac200 billion.  President Van Rompuy proposed cuts of approximately \u20ac80 billion.  As the negotiations proceeded, the different budget lines within the budget were being debated in terms of which might take cuts and which might not.  There are three big budget lines.  CAP represents approximately 38 to 40% of the budget.  Cohesion Funds represent one third of the budget and innovation and research and development also account for a large chunk of it.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been trying to prevent a significant reduction in the overall MFF funding.  If there are to be cuts, we will seek to protect the CAP budget within that.  Some 85% of all EU money coming into Ireland comes through CAP.  This amounts to approximately \u20ac1.6 billion per annum.  We had some success in the negotiations.  At one stage, it looked like there was going to be a cut to CAP of approximately 6% or 7% in terms of pillar 1 and about 11% in pillar 2.  By the end of the discussions, this had been reduced to a 3% cut in pillar 1, which was progress.

That being said, I think it is possible for us to revive the sugar industry, but only if a number of things happen.<\/p><p>  First of all, I have made it clear that the Government is not going to subsidise the setting up of a new sugar industry because we need to ensure that any new industry that begins in Ireland again can stand on its own two feet.  However, I believe there is a fighting chance that the sugar industry will be set up again in Ireland on a commercial basis.  Last summer we had two very professionally put together viability studies for the setting up of a sugar industry in Ireland again, from a processing point of view, which would involve building a large sugar processing plant and ethanol production facility.  There are a number of people who are extremely committed to making this happen and they are very credible people.  Michael Hoey, in particular, who heads up Beet Ireland, has put a huge amount of his own resources and time into putting together a very realistic business plan for rebuilding a sugar processing sector in Ireland.  It is his job to put the business case together and he will do that, in terms of attracting investors and so forth.  It is my job to ensure that if that business case is to proceed that there is either a sugar quota for Ireland in the future or there is no sugar quota in the European Union.  <\/p><p>  The current sugar regime in the EU will end in 2015 and Ireland has already been compensated to get out of that regime to the tune of \u20ac353 million.  That means that we are not going to be able to produce sugar before 2015.  The Commission is proposing that the sugar quota regime would end in 2015, which is something that Ireland supports.  However, I do not think it is realistic because the countries that currently have sugar quota will insist on the quota regime extending beyond 2015, in my view, possibly until 2018 or 2020.  In that context, we will be seeking an opportunity for Ireland to be allocated quota for domestic use, given the fact that we have been compensated to be out of the sugar industry until 2015 but not beyond that.  Given the size of our food industry here and the volume of sugar use in that industry, we should be allowed a sugar quota to be able to support it.  We have made a very strong case for this, both publicly and privately, to the Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300055#DDD01600","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1355424000,"counter":1475,"content":"<p>If there is potential to rebuild and regenerate the sugar industry in Ireland then clearly steps should be taken to do so.

Both of them were presented to me and both of them involved detailed meetings around the presentation of those feasibility studies.  We then asked officials in the economics section of my Department to assess the feasibility of the business plans.  It is important to say, though, that in order for those business plans to be viable, the price of processed sugar must remain at a level that can pay for all of this because we are talking about a &#8364;200 million investment to build the plant before any sugar beet can be processed to produce either ethanol or sugar.  It is probably fair to say, as a rule of thumb, that these feasibility studies stack up if the price of sugar remains at over &#8364;500 per tonne.  It is well over that level at the moment and actually, in the last 12 months, it was close to &#8364;800 per tonne because there were real shortages of sugar in the European Union.  A lot of food industries in Ireland, some from my own part of the country, were finding it hard to get sugar at any price, which suggests that there is an argument around sugar security for both the pharmaceutical and food industries.  Having said that, a judgment has to be made by the investors and those putting the business plan together as to what the likely sugar price will be in three, five or ten years time and what the price will be if sugar quotas are abolished in the European Union.<\/p><p><br \/>  When we were producing sugar in Ireland we were not particularly competitive <i>vis-\u00e0-vis<\/i> other parts of Europe in terms of the tonnage of beet per hectare we were growing and the sugar content.  However, I believe we can be much more competitive now and the proof of that can be seen in the United Kingdom at the moment.  The varieties of sugar beet being grown there are highly competitive with other parts of Europe and there is no reason Ireland could not benefit from that.  We can be competitive in this area but whether this happens will be contingent on where world sugar prices go.  In my view, they are not likely to collapse any time soon.  Sugar is in strong demand because consumption will continue to grow, both in the European Union and, more important, further afield.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300055#DDD02200","speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coillte Teoranta Lands","time":1355424000,"counter":1481,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300055#DDD02250"},{"type":"question","time":1355424000,"counter":1482,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[55980\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300055#DDD02300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding the proposed sale of the Coillte forest crop; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1355424000,"counter":1483,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question concerns the current position with regard to Coillte.

Consultants have also been brought in to do specific work around valuations and managing how the sales process may proceed, with the aim of maximising the value to the State, if value is to be found, as well as taking account of the other sectors that may be impacted by such a sale, such as the sawmill sector and timber supply generally, which is totally dominated by Coillte at the moment.  This is a very complex process which we are in the middle of at the moment but I assure Deputies that the Government will act with caution.  We will not do anything that will undermine or significantly damage the timber or sawmill sectors in Ireland.  Effectively, we have a monopoly in Coillte at the moment.  Most sawmills take more than 80% of their timber from Coillte forests.  If we proceed with this, we will do so with caution to try to protect other sectors that will be affected by any sale, while at the same time trying to maximise value for the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300055#DDD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1355424000,"counter":1484,"content":"<p>Are we to deduce from what the Minister has said that no decision has been taken yet as to what will happen with Coillte?<\/p><p>I assume that the decision on selling it has not been taken and that the process of assessment is continuing.

I would like to explain the decisions taken in last week's budget on the sheep grassland scheme.  We had a three year grassland scheme which was costing the country approximately \u20ac18 million a year, using unspent funds under Pillar 1.  The aim of the scheme and the idea behind it was to increase the number of sheep being farmed in Ireland because for ten years in a row the flock decreased in size year after year.  We had to try to reverse that trend.  I am delighted to be able to say the scheme has contributed significantly to reversing it and for the first time in a decade, the flock is bigger this year.  Therefore, the scheme has worked well.<\/p><p>  I now want to try what I know has worked in other sectors, particularly in the dairy sector, in which we have seen the benefit of discussion groups.  In the dairy sector dairy farmers meet on a monthly basis in what they might call &quot;dairy discussion groups&quot; to discuss how their business works and how their animals are performing and everything else.  The issues discussed include fertility, grazing, feed conversion efficiency, stock management and so on.  The evidence we have from the groups is that, on average, farmers who attend them have increased their profit margins by somewhere between 4% and 5%.  I want to see the same benefits in the sheep sector.  The sheep grassland scheme was due to end this year, but we have chosen to extend it into next year.  We will spend \u20ac14 million on it next year and use \u20ac3 million from the budget to initiate a sheep discussion group model to encourage sheep farmers to enter the type of discussion group setting that has worked so well for the dairy and beef sectors in order that we can help sheep farmers to make more in the market place rather than rely on schemes for an income.

I hope I have answered the questions on sheep farming.  I answered questions on the beef sector for Deputy Martin Ferris, but I will respond to Deputy Mick Wallace.  I am not targeting the small guys.  The new scheme we are putting in place - a \u20ac10 million scheme - will ensure farmers with 20 or fewer suckler cows will receive payments on all of them.  We made this provision deliberately to ensure smaller farmers would receive their payments first.  The bigger farmers, with more than 20 animals, may receive payment on more than 20 animals, if there is money left over as I suspect there will be at the end of the process.<\/p><p> The other aspect is that the new scheme does not requires farmers to do anything other than transfer data relating to the breeding and fertility of their animals to the ICBF.  We are not asking them to do all the other things they would have been paid for before.  In other words, they are being asked to do a fraction of what they were asked to do before and they are being paid \u20ac20 per cow rather than \u20ac40 per cow.  It is important for the Deputy to understand that the total amount of money going into the beef sector next year will not be very different from what went into the beef sector this year.  That is because under the existing suckler cow welfare scheme, at least \u20ac10 million is to be paid next year in respect of calves that were born in the second half of this year.  When that \u20ac10 million is taken with the \u20ac10 million we will spend on the new data transfer scheme and the \u20ac5 million we will spend on beef discussion groups - farmers will be given \u20ac1,000 to attend meetings and learn about how they can run their businesses more effectively - it means we will be spending \u20ac25 million on the beef sector next year.  Most of that will be spent in the suckler beef sector.  We spent approximately \u20ac27 million in the beef sector this year.  It is important for farmers to get this into context.  Since the budget, there has been a blunt focus on arguing that the abolition of the suckler cow welfare scheme is a disaster.  I suggest there should be a concentration on what we are putting in place to replace it.  The State will be putting almost as much money into the suckler sector next year as it has put into it this year.

It is pretty draconian for a small farmer to have the payment he gets for each calf reduced from \u20ac80 to \u20ac20.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300058#GGG00300","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1355425800,"counter":1525,"content":"<p>The point is that they are being asked to do a fraction of what they were previously asked to do.  I agree that this was a great scheme.  It improved the quality of suckler beef in Ireland and brought about significant changes in areas like animal husbandry, data collection and the general performance of those animals.  While I would have put a new scheme in place anyway, I would have liked to have had more money to spend on building up the suckler cow welfare scheme.  I hope we will be able to spend more money in this area in the future.  When the new Common Agricultural Policy is in place, I hope we will be able to fund a larger scheme than the one to be implemented next year.  It is important to understand that all of the \u20ac25 million being spent in this sector will go to farmers.  It may go to different farmers next year.  It is important to recognise that contrary to what some farmers have claimed, there will be no dramatic reduction in the money going into this sector, all of which will go to farmers as I have said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300058#GGG00400","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1355425800,"counter":1526,"content":"<p>We must finish on that note.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300058#GGG00500","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1355425800,"counter":1527,"content":"<p>I will conclude by responding to the point made by Deputy Kirk.  Half of the beef in Ireland comes from the suckler herd and the other half comes from the dairy herd.  As I have said on many occasions, if we do not support the suckler herd, beef will simply become a by-product of the dairy industry as it expands and grows in the context of the elimination of quotas in 2015.  I do not want that to happen because all of the real quality Irish beef comes from the suckler herd.  It is delivered by the bloodlines and the breeding.  That is why this sector needs additional support.  I hope we will be able to provide it in the context of the new Common Agricultural Policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300058#GGG00600","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1355425800,"counter":1528,"content":"<p>I would like to make a brief point about the scheduling of Question Time, particularly on Thursdays.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300058#GGG00700","speaker":"945"},{"type":"speech","time":1355425800,"counter":1529,"content":"<p>We have gone over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121300058#GGG00800","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1355425800,"counter":1530,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

It was not due to start until 8.45 p.m.  I assure the Minister that I am not carping when I say that the Whips need to examine the arrangements for the scheduling of the business of the House, particularly on Thursday evenings.  I am saying this in the context of agriculture questions, but it applies to other areas as well.
