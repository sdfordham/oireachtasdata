Prior to that I was the director of the Small Firms Association for eight years.  I have held a number of representational roles on behalf of IBEC and the SFA, most recently on the National Competitiveness Council and prior to that on the Pensions Board and as a representative of Irish business both nationally and internationally.  This role of chairman is an exciting prospect because training and education are central to any growth strategy and that is recognised throughout Europe.  The rationale is that investment in training should result in an improvement in skills, which should result in higher output.  Higher output makes one more competitive.  The more competitive one is, the more one sells, and the more one sells, the more national income increases.  However, what is more important than that is the impact education and training has on individuals and their self-esteem, the communities they live in, the companies they work for and the personal growth that comes from investment.  My hope is that our new organisation, SOLAS, will be able to provide to all its stakeholders - the Government, business and individuals - the type of experience and training that will lead to positive outcomes for everybody and that we will be able to reach a significant improvement in our measurement and evaluation of inputs and outputs.  Hopefully, SOLAS will become an organisation which will be a partner of first choice for all of its stakeholders and we will have a recognised organisation that delivers strong analysis to inform the decision-making process on the policies that have to be pursued to make all of this work.<\/p><p>  I am happy to present myself to the committee.

SOLAS is charged under the recently enacted legislation with the responsibility of rolling out a national literacy strategy.  I mention this because the committee has had a discussion about the dynamics of adult learning and adult literacy in Ireland.  That was reinforced by the results published yesterday by the Programme for International Assessment of Adult Competencies, PIAAC, which indicated that 17.9% of Irish adults aged between 16 and 65 have a basic reading problem - that is, they are at or below point 1 on a 5-point scale of literacy proficiency.  SOLAS's predecessor, F&Aacute;S, did not even have an adult literacy policy.<\/p> <p>There is now a commitment to rectify that stitched into the legislation.  I would like a full and detailed response on what Mr. Delaney envisages in this regard.  All members feel strongly about the empowerment of those from 16 to 65 who may have been let down by the system or for whom it did not work.  It should be part of the authority's remit to dig deep to discover the reasons behind that and find a strategy that can overcome the problem so we can improve the statistics.

It is a matter of ensuring that the new organisation, at both board and operational levels, has unity of purpose and will ensure parity of esteem in all the areas that will be affected by the decisions it makes throughout the community.<\/p><p>  There ought to be a very strong focus on how we interact with labour market interventions, prepare people for work, encourage employers in getting back to business, and ensure all stakeholders in the system are properly recognised and supported in whatever they want to achieve.<\/p><p>  With regard to literacy, there ought to be recognition in every aspect of public policy, training and education that the measurement and evaluation of inputs are very important if we are to target the problem at the critical age.  We have noted a trend for many years in international markets.  In the 1980s and 1990s, companies were saying they needed to capture people who could speak languages because, although English may have been the primary language in the international sphere, companies trading internationally needed more people who could speak foreign languages.  We addressed that through degrees in languages but, realistically, we should have been considering a stronger focus on languages at primary or second level.<\/p><p>  Literacy is key and we should not wait until adult illiteracy becomes a problem.  Child literacy is an issue and it needs to be measured at a very early stage.  My organisation, through the breadth of the stakeholders that are and will be involved from workplace level to community level, will focus on the issue in its strategy.  It will have an oversight and strategic role.  It will not be the deliverer of the training.  In that regard, the teachers, tutors and trainers will need to be properly qualified to carry out training, be it through ICT or otherwise.  We must invest in the training.  In the coming years, we will be able to see the results of the strategy we are pursuing.  I strongly believe the strategy SOLAS will pursue will have a positive effect overall.<\/p><p>  SOLAS will have to interact to a greater extent with the business community.  Jobs are important for both individuals and the country.  Employees need to be on a continuous training curve.  I do not necessarily believe there is a difference between training and education.  If a person's capacity to learn is being fostered by way of growth in his day-to-day job, it will lead him to want to learn more and, therefore, get back into the education system.  The bigger problem that we have is leakage from the education system of young people.  We must ask why people are not proceeding to third level, and second level in some cases.  We must examine intergenerational literacy problems in some families and determine how to cope with that.<\/p><p>  There are some very interesting programmes in the United Kingdom on intergenerational illiteracy, one of which is called Dads and Lads.  I do not know whether the Deputy is familiar with that.  It has a really strong impact in that it captures both generations together in trying to deal with the problem.<\/p><p>  Any comments I make or views I give today are not those of the board of SOLAS.

The intention of the scheme is to provide sufficient support to meet a student's care needs but to fade this support over time as the student's needs reduce.  Schools' SNA support can change year on year as students leave, enrol and develop greater independence.  This year 56% of schools experienced no change, 21% had an increased allocation and 23% a lower allocation, which is broadly in line with what happened last year.<\/p><p>  We have allocated almost 10,500 SNA posts to schools to support 22,000 students and are continuing to respond to ongoing applications for SNA support.  Approximately 7,000 of these students attend special schools and, generally speaking, have considerably more complex needs and greater care needs than mainstream students.  Special schools and special classes have an average of one SNA for every 3.3 students.  In mainstream settings,the ratio is one SNA for every 1.47 students supported.<\/p><p>  Members can easily see from these figures that, per qualifying student, mainstream schools have more SNA support than special schools.  This is because even though some students in mainstream may only require SNA support at transition times during the day or at break times or for toileting reasons, it may be necessary to allocate a full-time post to the school because the support may be required intermittently during the day.   Mainstream schools can, therefore, have additional capacity to cater for significant care needs of other students as they may emerge during a school year.  For example, this capacity enabled schools to support the care needs of some 2,000 additional students between September and December 2012.  I wish to reassure members that additional SNAs were allocated where there was need and that the NCSE is confident that the schools were resourced to meet the care needs of the students concerned.  <\/p><p>  Members might like to know that this year, over 99% of the 22,000 applications processed by the NCSE for additional teaching or SNA support have been processed without any appeal.  We have had 76 appeals in total, 54 in respect of SNAs and 22 in respect of resource teaching decisions, out of the 22,000 processed applications. Some appeals are not necessarily about a SENO's decision, but because there is confusion about the scheme itself.  That begs the question as to why there is confusion<b>.  <\/b>There is clear evidence that the role of the SNA has been informally expanded by schools to include an educational remit.  Some parents, schools and professionals consider that an SNA is allocated to help with literacy difficulties or to provide therapeutic support, such as speech and language therapy.  Often, when SNA care support is being faded or withdrawn completely, a school might advise that they would like the SNA to do other work with a student such as improvement of language, literacy, numeracy and so on.  Over 30% of this year's applications were declined for these and other reasons.  This is very serious as each application raises expectations and hopes and when applications are declined because they do not meet the criteria for the scheme, there can be disappointment, concern, anxiety and anger and a belief that the NCSE is not doing its job properly or that cuts are the reason for non-allocation.  <\/p><p>  It has occasionally been suggested that teaching assistants should be introduced to provide additional educational support to these students.  Some recent research studies raise serious concerns about the effectiveness of teaching-assistant support for students with special educational needs.  While finding some positive effects on teachers' workload and stress levels, these studies found that the more support students received from teaching assistants, the less progress they made in subjects such as English, maths and science.<\/p><p>  The research also found that students with special educational needs spent over a quarter of their school time away from mainstream class, their teachers and peers and they were almost constantly accompanied by a teacher assistant who bore the greatest portion of responsibility for planning and teaching them.  As a result, they can become overly dependent on teacher-assistant support and socially isolated from other students.  Despite the good intentions of teaching assistants, these students received a less appropriate and lower quality educational experience than other students.  One US study noted that the substantial increase in teacher-assistant use in US schools had taken place without any compelling evidence that it is educationally sound to deploy the least qualified personnel to provide primary instruction to students with the most complex learning characteristics.  On the other hand, research findings consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between the quality of teaching and the outcomes achieved by this group of students.   <\/p><p>  Given these research findings, that paraprofessionals can act as a barrier to a student's access to the teacher and full participation in classroom activities, and that it is the quality of teaching which determines better educational outcomes, the NCSE in its recent policy advice to the Minister on supporting children with special educational needs argued that there is insufficient evidence at this point in time to support the introduction of a new teaching-assistant grade to work specifically with students with special educational needs.<\/p> <p>We have recommended that the Department of Education and Skills should clarify the role of the special needs assistant, SNA, and that SNA work should at all times be focused on developing independent living skills.<\/p><p> The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, believes students with complex learning needs should be taught by fully qualified and experienced teachers equipped with the necessary skills to meet their needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900005#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381321800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I now invite Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch to make her opening statement on behalf of the National Parents Council Primary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900006#F00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381321800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>The National Parents Council considers the special needs assistant scheme effective in meeting the needs of children who have specific care needs.  It supports children who have care needs that could not be ordinarily fully met by the teacher to access school placement.  The council believes the SNA scheme has contributed significantly to the enhancement of students' experiences in school.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding this however, the council believes the role of the SNA in the school needs to be reviewed and more clearly defined.  Research has shown that, despite the defined duties in circular 07\/02, SNAs often engage in extended functions.  Children with special education needs require the most specialised and skilled professionals to support them to access the curriculum.  While the SNA entry requirements are appropriate for the role as set out in circular 07\/02, it is the view of the council that they are not appropriate for the extended functions they may be engaging in as cited in the value for money report.  In particular, the council has significant difficulty with the role of the SNA as set out in the circular <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> children presenting with behavioural challenges.<\/p><p>  Behavioural challenges alone do not qualify a child for SNA support.  However, the circular states a child is entitled to SNA support when &#8220;their behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or to other pupils&#8221;.  A child whose behaviour is a danger to themselves or to other children has very complex needs.  This shows a clear example of where a child that requires the most specialised of supports is receiving support from a person who has not had the training to effectively work with this child.  When a person who has not received the appropriate training engages with a child with such complex needs, the outcome can often be extremely negative for the individual child involved, the SNA, other children and the teacher in the classroom.<\/p><p>  The council believes the allocation of SNA support should be clearly linked to an individualised plan which has been prepared for the child.  This plan would clearly identify the care needs of the child, how these needs would be met while ensuring that at all times a focus is maintained on the development of a child's independence skills.  The council is concerned that an overdependency on SNA support can lead to social isolation of children as the presence of an adult can create a barrier and so make normal interaction more difficult.  We would suggest other types of support including peer support be examined further at school level.  There is some evidence to suggest that peer support can have a positive impact on student's behaviour and can lead to a reduction in the need for SNA support.<\/p><p>  The council believes parents should have support and information about the different resources available for their child in the education system and the function of each support.  Parents often get caught in a fight for any resource rather than a fight for the right resource, due to lack of information on their child's needs and how these needs should effectively be met.<\/p><p>  Circular 07\/02 lists the duties of the SNA in detail.  They are varied and wide ranging from tidying classrooms to assisting children with their intimate hygiene needs.  The council believes there should be an overarching statement of priority regarding these duties.  This role needs to be strongly child-centred with a statement of this principle present in all references to the post.  When there are competing demands on the SNA's time, the child must always be prioritised.  It is important for this to be stated rather than assumed.<\/p><p>  The council believes there should be an accredited compulsory basic training course for all SNAs.  SNAs are often supporting the most vulnerable children in the school and basic training regarding understanding children's needs, communication skills and basic child protection knowledge should be included in a short initial training course.  The mere fact the SNA is working under the supervision and guidance of the classroom teacher will not ensure they are able to effectively carry out their duties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1381321800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I now invite Mr. Jim Moore to make his opening statement on behalf of the National Parents Council Post Primary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900006#F00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381321800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The National Parents Council Post Primary welcomes the opportunity to address the committee today on the issues relating to the role of special needs assistants.  In addressing this issue, we wish to draw on work carried out by our organisation in supporting our young people in education.<\/p><p>  In April, the National Parents Council Post Primary participated in a major research activity with partners in the post-primary education sector through the post-primary education forum, PPEF.  The PPEF is an umbrella group comprising representation from parents, teacher unions, school leaders and management bodies involved in the post-primary education sector.  Parents have been keen to address common issues and establish a shared viewpoint on priorities for the future development of second level education.<\/p><p>  The forum published, A 2020 Vision for Education in Ireland, a coherent and authoritative position for the future for education.  This document articulates common aims and ideals, presenting a view of the direction in which education should be moving.  Parents strongly support this unique strategic approach of collaboration in planning future developments.<\/p><p>  The debates that took place in the 1990s regarding the principle of students' voices in decisions that affect their lives and work in schools led to student councils being established through the Education Act 1998.  Beyond these formal views of student engagement in schools, there is a pedagogical requirement which is not always realised.  The relationship of teacher and student is never a one-way activity.  Rather this is a relationship which centres round a sharing of a range of experiences.  These are varied and they highlight the critical importance of establishing positive relationships in an environment of learning.<\/p><p>  There has been a demand to ensure school practices are consistent in areas of equality and inclusion such as entrance policies, streaming of students, providing for special needs, as well as meeting the needs of newcomer students.  Work is under way in many of these areas.  Streaming of students into ability groupings is a practice that has been decreased significantly.  A consequence for teachers is to become more accomplished in the delivery of teaching and learning.  According to the report of the inspectorate considerable progress has been made in promoting these new forms of grouping of students in schools.  This has been achieved through national support programmes for teachers.<\/p><p>  The inspectors&rsquo; report states more work needs to be done in the achieving of integration of previously streamed students and previous special education needs students into learning environments that are more diversely constituted.  While more work is not defined it is certain that it is not just about upskilling of teachers.  A more long-term programme of continuous professional development is required.<\/p><p>  The situation that now prevails in our schools has evolved and appears not to have been envisaged in scale, capacity or cost management.  It is now the case that fewer than 1% of students now attend a special school.  In the majority of cases, parents now choose to send their children to the local mainstream school.  In line with legislation, children with special education needs should be educated, wherever possible, in an inclusive school environment with other children who do not have such needs.<\/p><p>  What is striking in this approach for inclusivity in schools is the range of support skills that may be required.  The SNA may require particular skills in the role of supporting a student with particular needs.  Indeed, a range of skill sets may need to be employed in supporting a student and in a classroom where a number of students with special needs are enrolled.<\/p><p>  Parents rely on the provision of appropriate and essential supports for their child in the classroom.  They need reassurance that their decision in the first instance was in the best interest of their child.  In our view, there is a particular challenge for the present system to adequately provide such supports.  The classroom learning environment needs to be sustained while the teacher delivers to a classroom of students.<\/p><p>  It must also be noted this structure is provided with the aim of increasing the independence of the student with special needs while they move through the curriculum and school life.  Again, is the present structure of the delivery of these supports effective for the learning environment in the classroom?  The SNA is asked to contribute and support the individual student's learning and, indirectly, the learning environment of the classroom.  Many SNAs display a commitment to advancing their own capabilities by undertaking continued professional development and advanced studies.  Such initiatives provide an invaluable asset to the special needs student, teacher and the entire classroom.<\/p><p>  We also see the role of the supports required in the school extend to State examination activity where there has been an extensive requirement for reasonable accommodation for students.  A review of this process should be considered as part of our proposed review for the provision of all special needs and welfare supports available in schools with a view to devising an appropriately resourced comprehensive service in this area.<\/p><p>  The council also raises the issue of critical further provision to supporting the special needs of young people irrespective of whether they are in school or not and the provision of a 24-7 social service network.<\/p> <p>This would address the reality that difficulties in the lives of our young people occur not only during school hours.  NPC Post Primary calls for an urgent, comprehensive review of the special needs and welfare supports available in schools.  We have circulated an executive summary listing those four points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900006#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Moore","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381322400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I present my colleague, Ms Joan McCrohan, who is seconded to IMPACT but who spent several years as a special needs assistant, SNA.  I thank the committee for its invitation to IMPACT to outline some of our concerns and views on the role of SNAs.  During the last year or so IMPACT has invested heavily in education.  We have established a dedicated education division and recruited additional staff to organise and represent workers in the sector.  IMPACT represents approximately 10,000 education staff, of whom 60% are SNAs, and we are increasing that number all the time.<\/p><p>  Demand for SNAs has increased steadily in recent years, while the number of SNAs remains fixed at 10,575.  The number of SNAs has been capped for the last four years against a significant increase in demand for this service.  One special school took in an additional five children with severe or profound needs with no increase in the SNA allocation.  This is in marked contrast to the position regarding educational supports whereby the Minister, after his initial announcement of the allocation, revised the decision and increased the amount of resource teaching posts, which IMPACT fully supports.  This was in recognition of the educational needs of the children, but their care needs are not being dealt with in a similar fashion.  In some cases we could have one SNA looking after the care needs of seven children with special needs.<\/p><p>  We have been asked to address issues relating to the role of SNAs.  From my interaction with SNAs on a daily basis I have quickly come to the conclusion that one of the main issues is respect, rather than reward.  In the context of their role this means a number of things.  On one level it is about recognition by the school authorities and management that they bring a range of important life skills and experience to their work.  In many cases - but not all - they fail to receive parity of esteem with others within the school community.  This can be a source of irritation, especially if the SNA is older than the teacher, which is often the case.<\/p><p>  The absence of full respect for the role is due to the insecure employment position of SNAs.  Their employment is linked directly to a particular child or children.  Consequently, when the child's attendance at school finishes the SNA is made redundant unless another opportunity arises.  This is an undesirable situation because their employment is precarious and uncertain; but it is also undesirable from the point of view of children with special needs, as there is a reduction in knowledge, skills and experience within the system.  It would be preferable if SNAs were treated similarly to teachers, enjoying continuous employment.<\/p><p>  We raised the issue of job security, citing the commitments contained within the public service agreement and pointing out that SNAs' situation is virtually unique within the public service as they are subject to redundancy and enjoy very limited job security.  Job security was the subject of a Labour Court hearing.  The Labour Court issued its recommendation in June 2012, which was that a redeployment scheme be established.  We found it difficult to get the Department of Education and Skills and the management bodies to accept and implement the recommendation and it was only in the talks earlier this year, which eventually led to the public service stability or Haddington Road agreement, that we obtained a commitment to implement such a scheme.  It was only possible to put in place a limited version of the agreement.  It would be a much better use of and development of the resource if there was greater certainty surrounding employment and it would ensure retention of the skills and knowledge gained by SNAs.<\/p><p>  Our concerns in this regard have increased since the announcement of the 2013-2014 allocations.  There has been an increasing trend on the part of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to allocate portions of posts rather than full-time SNAs.  We are seeing more advertisements for JobBridge placements instead of full employment positions for SNAs.  If this trend continues unchecked it will lead to more and more casualisation of employment.  Apart from anything else, this is against the spirit and the principles underlying the public service agreement.  The Department tries to wash its hands of complaints on this, citing the independent statutory function of the NCSE.  There is a grave danger that in all of this the interests of the child will suffer.<\/p><p>  Clearly this approach reflects the limited resources that are being made available to meet the increasing demand.  More and more children are having their care needs met by approximately the same number of SNAs.  Some SNAs work with multiple children and others work with just one.  There have been unfortunate examples in which school managements have sought  to direct SNAs away from the care of their assigned children to other duties.  In many cases harmonious relationships exist within schools; however, there are many instances in which SNAs are being used as a whole-school resource.  This is wrong and deprives the child of a support he or she has been awarded and is entitled to expect.  Consideration of any change to the current model of resource allocation must focus on ensuring that the child gets the important support that has been allocated to them.  Far from adopting a rigid or restrictive policy, IMPACT would like to see the role of the SNA grow and develop.  We would like a programme of continuous professional development to be introduced that would add value for children and schools while giving added stimulation and a greater sense of worth to the SNA.<\/p><p>  The issue for most SNAs is respect, not reward.  It makes sense that the scheme should be continuously examined given the period of time since its introduction and the significant spend involved.  However, the best way to proceed is by improving job security, avoiding casualisation of the work, introducing standard training and professional development, ensuring full parity of esteem for SNAs within the school community by retaining their skills, and protecting the resource for the benefit of the children who need it.  It would make sense for these things to be addressed in a collaborative manner.  If there is a willingness on the part of the Department and the authorities to do this, IMPACT will not be found wanting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900007#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dessie Robinson"},{"type":"speech","time":1381322400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>We have agreed to take questions in order from the spokespersons, with a limit of three minutes per speaker and no supplementary questions until everybody has spoken, after which people may speak again if time permits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900007#G00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1381322400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the groups for their presentations.  As we have only three minutes, I will be brief.  Each group has touched on the fact that SNAs are asked to do other educational or whole-school duties.  I appreciate the research regarding the role of teaching assistants and anybody who is not properly educationally qualified in working with any child, particularly a child with special needs.  The reason for that is that gaps exist elsewhere in the system with the pressures over the last few years due to cuts.  Ms Griffin will correct me and say the cap in resource teachers, which has resulted in an effective cut in hours, has meant there is less educational support.  That must be part of the picture.<\/p><p>  We all agree that the SNAs should be restricted to a care role rather than being given educational duties for which they are not trained, but what is the impact of being stricter on that in the context of the other cuts?  Will the child ultimately lose out?  I was struck by a good idea in the NPC presentation, which was that of peer support.  Does the council have a particular school in mind where it has seen that work, or has it been done elsewhere internationally?  It strikes me as an interesting idea to encourage a child, rather than becoming too dependent on an adult, to have greater social interaction with their peers, as both sets of children gain from that relationship, not just the child with special needs.  Does the council have a model in mind?<\/p><p>  The NPC Post Primary presentation mentioned the lack of information for parents on the types of support available and the appropriate use of them.<\/p> <p>Where exactly is this gap?

My interest in compiling a report on this partly arose because the question of special needs assistants, SNAs, arises at budget time and is then forgotten about.  We need to have a discussion about the role of SNAs beyond budgetary corrections.  I hope in a few years time we will not be speaking about budgetary corrections.  The service has expanded a huge amount over a relatively short period of time.  Every presentation suggested the role has changed and needs to be re-evaluated.  A suggestion was made that roles should be differentiated or we should have a better definition of what the role is.<\/p><p>  My interest in this was also partly inspired by a trip I took to the IMPACT special needs assistants' AGM, where I saw the effect working as a special needs assistant has on the individual.  Special needs assistants sometimes experience a lack of respect from members of the teaching staff, principals and boards of management.  They are sometimes asked to perform menial tasks which are completely outside what they envisaged the job to be.  They want to be better trained, have job security and have a career in education.  Many schools need special needs assistants very much but, given the fact that the role has expanded beyond what the NCSE envisaged, perhaps we need to re-evaluate the role in totality and see if we can recast it for another person working in education.  If everybody in the committee came to this with a completely open mind about what a special needs assistant, an educational assistant or somebody working in the education system could be, perhaps it would be an exciting process of complete re-evaluation.<\/p><p>  What we spend on special education has increased from &euro;450 million in 2004 to &euro;1.3 billion now.  Increasing numbers of children present with special needs, which creates challenges in the system.  This year we have seen an 11% increase.  I am making a statement of intent rather than asking a question and I apologise for this.  I am very much taken by the presentations.  Everybody will accept that, like the Seanad, the role of the SNA does not necessarily need to stay in its current form and perhaps it should evolve.<\/p><p>  Sometimes when one speaks about examining the role of SNAs, the people themselves wonder whether they will be undermined and whether it will be suggested that their role should be eliminated from the system.  It is quite the contrary.  We need to focus heavily on the lack of career structure and certainty the average SNA has in the system and the respect the system gives them, which comes from the Department and filters through boards of management and principals.  There may be a question in what I have stated but I wanted to set out the stall as to where we are going with the report.  Perhaps we can publish a draft report, after which people can come back to see the type of discussions we are having.  We could really get something out of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900008#H00200","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1381323000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.

I am interested to hear the witnesses' comments on this.  What difficulty does this present?  Do they accept that demand has increased in the way it appears?<\/p><p>  What progress has been made on rolling out the 118 new classes for special needs which were announced?  Families are delighted to get a place in a school but they are disappointed they do not have support services such as speech and language therapy.

I would be interested to hear the witnesses' comments on this.<\/p><p>  I wish to ask Ms Griffin a question on geographical gaps.

Much of this is driven by the fact that everybody wants the best for children with special educational needs.  Everyone working in education wants children with special educational needs to grow and thrive.  We are almost desperate to do everything we possibly can and get every resource.  I was struck by a comment made by Ms Lynch on the fight parents feel they have, and that it is a case of any resource as opposed to the right resource.  Perhaps the discussion must be about the right resources children should receive.<\/p><p>  Many SNAs are very well qualified and have improved their skills, but many of them have not.  These children have the most complex learning needs and the most skilled people are required to intervene, educate and support them.  It is of concern that for a long time throughout the health and education sectors SNAs were the only demand-driven support available, until the cap was put in place.  This led to a huge increase to plug gaps.<\/p><p>  The needs in some schools are very intermittent.  Perhaps at post-primary level an SNA is needed to help a child during a practical class but support is not needed outside of this, perhaps a child has toileting needs which can be anticipated, or perhaps an SNA is required at break times.  No one in the education system wants to leave an adult walking around or sitting outside a classroom doing nothing, which happened at the beginning of the scheme when SNAs sat outside classrooms reading a book until called on.  There has been an evolution over time with regard to perceived gaps, but the perceived gaps are with regard to the right supports as opposed to anything else.<\/p><p>  I thank Senator Power for her comments on our material for parents.  We have produced another document quite recently, because the more information we can get out to professionals and parents on how the education system supports children the better.  We recently launched a document on helping parents choose a school for their child and we have outlined the types of supports made available.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's comments, we undertook quite a wide degree of discussion and consultation when we were working on our supports paper.  We consulted SNAs, and what was remarkable was the discussion that took place among the SNAs on the different types of role they had.  SNAs in special schools undertake quite different duties from SNAs in mainstream schools.  It is quite interesting that there is acknowledgement that the initial and original reason for the scheme still exists in special schools where children have enormously complex needs and needs for very direct care support.<\/p> <p>It reflects the fact the duties of SNAs have expanded because in the mainstream schools the children do not have the level and extent of address of care needs as in special schools.  In terms of how the role has changed, that is certainly an interesting aspect, as we found during our consultation process.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Ryan, what we found recently is there has been a very extensive increase in the demand for resource teaching supports.  We are currently working on consideration of a new model for allocating teaching supports to schools and we have been engaging in widespread consultations.  One of the questions we have asked some of the professional groups that have come in to us is why there is such an increase in children who have assessed conditions.  There seem to be multiple reasons rather than one reason.  One reason that is given, for example, is that there is a greater acceptance and awareness that children learn differently and that there can be underlying reasons for that.  Given that psychology and therapeutic programmes and the professions have developed their thinking in that regard, it is now much easier to put a label on a child.<\/p><p> Another reason, and one I am very concerned about, is the fact that our entire education system and the way we allocate resource teachers is driven by the need to attach a label.  There is almost a search for a label to put on a child in order to get the resources.  Again, this is driven by the fact everybody wants to get as much as possible into the system to help children with special educational needs.  I spoke to one speech and language therapist who said she knew absolutely that the child in front of her did not have a specific speech and language disorder but she was able to make the child fit the criteria.  That is a concern because labels are for life.  Even though they are just there to provide a resource into schools, it is a very serious issue to put a label on a child, particularly if a child has been assessed as having an emotional or behavioural disturbance, or a mental health illness, specifically to get additional teaching resources into schools.  We find that is one of the reasons for the increase.<\/p><p> With regard to the private assessment against HSE assessment, we are certainly aware anecdotally that this is going on.  We know there are very significant waiting lists in regard to HSE supports, some of over a year for CAMHS supports and in regard to some other diagnostic services.  We address this in our supports paper.  It is one of the reasons we have to move away from the current model of allocating supports on the basis of diagnosis.  It is worrying there is not a consistent assessment across private and public.  People sometimes say to us they would prefer to wait until the child is a little older to see if the child has a certain condition but we know that people, because they want the resources, will go private and get the diagnosis they want.<\/p><p> With regard to the 118 classes, those classes were sanctioned for this year.  My understanding is that they are open or they will be open soon this year, and while some might have to wait for building work and so on, they have been sanctioned for this year.  The 118 were spread across 24 counties specifically for the reason mentioned, which is that we try to identify gaps.  We know there are gaps but the NCSE currently does not have the ability to require a school to open a special class.  This can be difficult in areas where we perceive there are gaps as the SENOs are sometimes going from school to school, telling them to please open a special class, which can be quite difficult.  Increasingly, however, schools are seeing the benefits of special classes in terms of their ability to be much more inclusive and to have children in more inclusive settings in mainstream schools.<\/p><p> I could not agree more with the Deputy in regard to the issue around the special classes.  There is a difficulty in regard to the therapeutic supports, which is an issue that has been ongoing for some time and something I have raised with the HSE.  This goes back to Ms Lynch's comment about the right supports being in place.  The NCSE is a very strong supporter of the current reorganisation of therapeutic supports that is happening in the HSE in terms of progressing disability services.  It is developing school-based teams, which we believe is the right way to go.  We are working with the HSE and are part of its national co-ordination group on that.  The reality is, however, that there is a gap for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900008#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381323600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>On the issue of increasing demands, we are basing the evidence on the SNAs coming back to us to tell us of huge increases in demand in their schools.  Rather than having an additional SNA to look after one or two children, they are now looking after seven, so it is clear to us there is a definite increase in demand.  When we spoke earlier about what is required, I point to the range of duties SNAs perform throughout different schools.  Schools dealing with profoundly handicapped children are different to schools where a child may need catheterisation.  The SNA would be expected to perform that invasive procedure on the child and we have to consider both the time needed for that and the qualifications and training required.<\/p><p>  The SNAs see this as a vocation - like a teacher or a nurse, they would have to, given some of the functions they carry out.  The work they carry out and the level of respect they receive are issues, as Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in noted.  If we are to do anything to ensure SNAs are brought up to a level that would generate respect, if nothing else, we need a professional development scheme to ensure they move along and perhaps provide some of the services that are needed.  While my colleagues in the teaching unions might have a problem with this, the fact is some of the SNAs are highly qualified.  As my colleague from the NCSE said earlier, there are different levels, but some are so well qualified they could teach children.  There are teachers doing this function, believe it or not, who would rather take that part than actually teach on a full-time basis.  There is a need to look at the whole situation.  We will not be found wanting in this area in terms of help and taking part in the attempt to find a way forward that would improve the services our members provide to the children who need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900009#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dessie Robinson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381323600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>With regard to the question on gaps in information, we would pinpoint a couple of areas of grave concern with regard to that aspect of how to communicate with parents.  One of the great concerns is the transfer from primary to post-primary, particularly the parental involvement in that process.  Moving from primary to post-primary is a very particular change for the pupil and parental engagement with that change is a big problem.  How do we get the parent to be informed in advance of moving from primary to post-primary, given it is a totally different world, both for the student and the parent, particularly the parent of a child with special needs?<\/p><p>  We mentioned geography.  There is a particular problem where there is a standalone post-primary school which is servicing a very broad area, given the element of choice in the post-primary school is very limited.  Particularly in rural areas, there are some very large post-primary schools that are catering for the needs of a huge population.  The ability of a particular school to address those needs is not certain given the allocation process can sometimes be very crude with regard to entitlement of a school to engage teacher resources.  This is a big problem.<\/p><p>  Parental involvement is also a big problem.  I am sure everyone in this room has been involved in a parents' association of a primary or post-primary school at some stage of their lives.  A recent study states:<blockquote>The most recent evidence of parental engagement in the Irish post-primary schools, carried out by the ESRI as part of their Post-Primary Longitudinal Study, confirms the traditional commitment of the individual parent to the child's educational welfare.  The study further shows that the collaborating activity of parents collectively in the school community is weak.<\/blockquote>That is a real problem.  We find that we lose parents who no longer become involved in the child's education in moving from primary to post-primary.  There is also a question around the ability of parents to organise themselves, either in the primary or post-primary sector.<\/p> <p>We have too many schools that do not have an active parents' association.  This issue must be dealt with at board of management level at each school, in other words how are they responding to particular needs in their area.<\/p><p> With regard to our endeavours to be collaborative with partners in education, the model of the post-primary education forum has been very successful in highlighting the issues for everybody in education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900009#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Moore","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381324200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I am very conscious of the fact that we are discussing the role of the SNA but it is very difficult not to go outside of that with some of the questions that have been raised.  To respond to Senator Averil Power's questions, there are gaps elsewhere in the system.  One of the difficulties is that the resources that are available to a school are SNA or teaching resources and yet children with special educational needs in the system may have therapeutic requirements that are necessary for their education and are not general therapeutic services that they will need outside of their schooling.  For instance a child may need speech and language or behavioural therapies that are very specific to their education but that are not necessarily specific to the home environment.  I think that is where the gap is.  If a child with a particular behavioural difficulty, a speech and language difficulty or any other type of difficulty is in a school, one is faced with the choice of an SNA or resource teaching hours, neither of which will address the needs of that child in terms of accessing the curriculum.  That is where the gap lies.  It is not necessarily that we do not have enough resource hours or enough SNA people but we do not have the right resource for the child presenting in the school.  Sometimes the confusion can be about linking the health service with the education service.<\/p><p>  There are some specific therapeutic services that are specific to the educational system that do not exist currently.  We see how the psychological service has become education-based, specifically addressing the psychological services within the educational context.  There are other therapeutic supports that are needed for that as well.  There are other gaps but the fact the school only has an option of a SNA or resource teaching support is one of the significant difficulties in terms of gaps.  The SNA is seen as the most flexible resource, particularly because it is not capped, but even with the cap the evidence suggests it is the most prolific resource in the education system.  Often the SNA is with children who have very complex needs.  I gave the example of the behavioural issue.  Having had personal experience of working with children in child psychiatry previously, I am aware that children would exit the mental health services and the following day they would be back in school.  The mental health services have the most qualified professionals dealing with those difficulties and when the child returns to school the person who is trying to support that child is somebody who has no education or skills in this area.  That is negative for everybody in that classroom system.  It often then becomes a matter of containment; how does a teacher teach others in the classroom with this behavioural issue going on?  Then the negativity around that child increases.  There are gaps but I do not think we can talk about those gaps in respect of just talking about the role of the SNA.  It is a much bigger issue.<\/p><p>  There is emerging research around peer support but at a personal level I have seen the Portuguese system, where they do not have special schools and all children are in the mainstream system, with some special classes for children.  They have quite a significant model around peer support.  I have seen that work very positively, but I think we need more research to back that up.<\/p><p>  We referenced the gap in information for parents.  The guide from the National Council for Special Education was excellent and we were very supportive of it at the time, but there are guides for parents that are specific to education and to health, but the child is not split like that.  When parents have a guide about what is available in the education system for their child, explaining the different resources, and their child needs something specific which is not in that guide, it does not make sense to them.  It does not give them a clear understanding of where they are supposed to go.  They need information about their specific child.  Guides will help but they need to be linked and joined up as well so that parents can get that information.<\/p><p>   There should be discussions on recasting the role but we need to be very careful because there are children who require care.  We need people in the education system who can specifically address those care needs of the children.  At present, the SNA system works extremely well in that care role.  If we start saying that somebody who can address those needs very well can also have an educational role we are looking at a very different skill set.  Perhaps there is another role needed in the classroom but I think moving the SNA role, which is addressing a very important need within the classroom, to something wider may not be the right thing to do.  If we recast a new role within the education system, we need to ensure that it is child-centred and inclusive so it is not dealing only with children with specific needs but all the needs of the children in that classroom.  We may come up with the teaching assistant role or the education assistant role and if that is the role assigned to the children with the most complex needs we are back into the system of the least qualified people addressing the children with the most need.  Quite often those roles can be supplementary to children who are doing very well and need less support.<\/p><p>  How we manage that new role, if there was to be a new role, would be very important.  That addresses Deputy Ellis's point about very highly qualified personnel in the SNA role.  We cannot create a national system based on that.  If the SNA entry requirements are such and such then we need to create a system around that, not around the people who happen to find themselves in that role.  There must be a baseline for what we are creating.  In all walks of life one finds people who are over-qualified for positions because they chose to do the job.  We cannot create a system based on that.  The system has to be based on the entry requirement and perhaps we could find new roles for those people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900010#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1381324200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their contributions.  I totally agree with Ms Lynch's comments on the baseline qualifications.  We end up with too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  The problem arises from the lack of clarity of the roles of the teachers and the SNAs.  Parents are unclear, as has been said, on the role of the SNA.  Parents may say their child has an SNA whereas the SNA has been appointed to the school rather than to the individual.  I know that the guide produced by Ms Teresa Griffin last year was excellent but we need to get it out to all parents as I know several parents have not read it but would like to read something much simpler.<\/p><p>  I am concerned about the role of the Special Educational Needs Organiser, SENO, in all of this.  The SENO has a very important role.  The National Parents Council has raised the issue of the individualised plan.  All children in a special needs school have an individual education plan, IEP, which is an aid to better relations with the parents when they discuss the individual education plan with the teacher, with the SNA and with the SENO.  I have asked before whether the SENO sits down with the parents to discuss the individualised plan before the child goes in.  Clarity is being lost because of confusion about different elements that need to be pulled together.<\/p><p>  The NCSE document states that students with complex learning needs should be taught by fully qualified and experienced teachers, equipped with the necessary skills.  What extra qualifications should be provided?  What is their opinion of teacher training for national school teachers?  Teachers in special schools need specific skills on learning in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900010#K00300","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1381324800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I welcome the panel.  I get a little frustrated with the role of SNAs.  A large amount of resources have rightly been put into special educational needs.  However, we must work together to find the best way to achieve the best outcomes for children with special educational needs.  We must make that our sole purpose and ensure that the children get a level playing field.  The assistance can range from the provision of a special needs assistant to learning support or resource teaching.  The right resources must be provided for a child, which may mean more than care.<\/p><p>  I have read many reports on the subject.  I have read the report by the National Council for Special Education on its concern about role creep and moving from care to education.  We must face up to the fact that we need a combination of care and education, so let us stop fudging.  We are spending a fortune on the matter.  There are some incredible special needs assistants, some of whom have been educated to junior certificate level while others have a double master's degree.  We must discover what is the best model of care and education that will achieve the best outcome for a child.  I have examined what happens in other countries and some countries use the teacher assistant model that Ms Lynch mentioned.  The teacher is the key person in the classroom because he or she is responsible for the teaching and learning outcomes for a child.  A teacher assistant could take care of any care needs and also provide educational support to a child, so we should examine such a scheme.  We should also provide an SNA with a pathway to becoming a teacher assistant if he or she so wishes.  <\/p><p>  There will be extreme cases where the overriding need is care, and it is fine for an SNA to fulfil such a role.  As has been said, we must ensure that it does not end up as all care and no education.  Both are required.  I would like the delegations to answer my question, particularly Ms Teresa Griffin whom I know is faced with the job.  I would like to hear their views on the matter. <\/p><p>  Earlier Ms Griffin mentioned the danger of labels and, theoretically, I agree with her but not in practice.  Labelling may be a pathway to securing resources so parents must be greater than it and the child's esteem must be built up to be greater than the label.  I agree with her that labels are a problem for peers.

There is no doubt in my mind about that objective.<\/p><p>  I agree that there are different levels of attainment.  As far as my organisation is concerned, the bar was set a bit low when it came to the qualifications required to be an SNA, which are three subjects in the junior certificate or level 3.  It may be part of the reason for a lack of respect for the work done by SNAs.  Some people may wonder what qualifications does an SNA need other than being nice to a child.  A child needs much more.  A child places a great deal of trust in his or her SNA after a while, particularly if the SNA holds a certain level of qualifications.  There is nothing more joyful than when an SNA learns that the child that he or she assisted in their early years has gone to Trinity College or somewhere else.<\/p><p>  With regard to different levels, I favour them and Ms Lynch hit the nail on the head when she expressed her views on the matter.  Obviously there are different levels of requirement and levels of SNAs or a combination of both.  As I said earlier, some schools have a requirement for categorisation while others require behavioural needs to be met.  They are at different levels so there is nothing wrong with us examining whether we can change the level.  Therefore, we must provide the time, resources and necessary training in order to ensure the child gets the care that he or she deserves to allow him or her to continue in life, as we all expect to be cared for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900011#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dessie Robinson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381324800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>My answer to the Senator's question on the provision of speech and language services by a cluster of schools is yes, there is a great need.  I know of a project that was part of a previous community partnership scheme where the Childhood Development Initiative in Tallaght compiled a report on the subject of speech and language support services in the school system.  The scheme seemed to be greatly beneficial but it costs a lot more.  The children who engaged in the scheme made dramatic improvements.  They did not need it after a certain amount of time because the support got them back on a good path.  Sometimes we see either the gold standard or what we have now and there is a view that we should do nothing until we reach the gold standard.  The project in Tallaght showed some things that were not of a gold standard yet still were very effective.  One initiative meant teachers in the school were trained, during an 11 to 17 hour session, on early identification of speech and language problems and early intervention at a very low level.  The course was very short but made a dramatic difference.  It allowed teachers to identify speech and language problems very early in the early education sector and the first few years of primary school.  It also showed teachers what they could do and share with people at home in order to remedy many problems.  In addition, it highlighted the fact that if problems were not addressed early on they would become very big problems as children grew older.<\/p><p>  Of course we would like the school-based interventions when it comes to educational and curriculum access.  If we do not reach the standard tomorrow there is still a lot of support that we can give but all of the work cannot be left to the teacher, as often described.  However, if one does not address such problems early on then a teacher's workload will be much greater.  A short intervention course that gives teachers skills to monitor children and implement early intervention strategies will make the classroom much more manageable.  Also, the children will be much better able to communicate.<\/p><p>  Labelling was another issue.  Parents struggle with labelling and I get the point made by the Senator that parents need to get over labelling.  However, society caused the problem and, therefore, has the same ability to get rid of the need to label, particularly in the education system.

We have planned information evenings for parents.  We are testing the model to ensure we are getting the right information and that it is providing what parents need.  We have done so in Carlow and Dublin 8 and another test will take place next week or the week after in Tullamore, County Offaly.  The whole point is to get parents in, especially parents of newly diagnosed children or children who are just about to go to school.  I take Mr. Moore's point that transition is the key for children with special educational needs and that information should be provided on how the system supports children - for example, through their interaction with the HSE, as stated by Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch.  It is not just what happens in the school that must be communicated; the parents need to be given the whole picture.  Following the evening in Offaly we will review whether the information is right and, if so, the idea is that it would be rolled out by SENOs in each of the 80 SENO areas throughout the country during the course of the school year to specifically address the points made and also to introduce the SENOs.  How does a parent know that a SENO exists?  Often they go along to the school and that may be the first time they hear of a SENO.  We are trying to get the information out that the SENOs are a really good resource for parents in terms of providing information.  I hope that will address the information deficit in some way.  We will keep it under review because we think it is crucial to try to support parents more and ease the system in terms of transition.<\/p><p>  We hope, at some point when we have a little more time, to look at transition points to ascertain how we can better support children who are making the transition not only from primary to post-primary but also from preschool to primary and, perhaps, from junior national school into senior national school and, at the end of school, from fifth or sixth year into wherever their pathways bring them, whether to adult services, supported employment, continuing education, further education or third level.  Those are plans over a few years because we have limited resources.  We are prioritising the parents of newly diagnosed children and children about to enter the school system and we hope that will roll out and feed through.<\/p><p>  With regard to labelling, in case members misunderstood what I said, when we speak with parents we find that some value having a label because they like to know what the issue with their child is.  The main concern is that labels should not be allocated simply to drive educational resources.  We have to find a better way and that was the thrust of our supports paper and our policy advice paper to the Minister earlier in the year.  There has to be a better way.  Actually, the Minister has given us the go-ahead.  We are looking at how to get away from a disability or a medical model in terms of allocating teachers and we hope to come up with a better way.  We are in the middle of our consultation phase in considering that issue.<\/p><p>  On the issue of qualifications, with regard to what should be provided and what the teachers in special schools need, one of the central themes coming through all of our policy advice, whether in respect of children who are deaf or children who have challenging behaviour, through our supports paper and in all our research is that the specialist knowledge of teachers is what is important.  Not only do they have to be subject specialists but they also have to be specialists in what the child needs to learn, because children are different.  Some are visual learners and others are more logical learners.  For example, children who are deaf have specific requirements with regard to maths.  They find the maths concepts very difficult.  Much specialist knowledge is needed.<\/p><p>  With regard to undergraduate or initial teacher education and CPD in initial education, Ms Mary Byrne and I sat down with the Teaching Council last week to see how we can feed into the development of initial teacher education and how we can provide more information and inform the process of initial teacher education.  We were pleased that the subject of special education, which was hit-and-miss in initial teacher education for so long in that the amount of information one got depended on which college one attended, is now more standardised and is one of the critical areas that has been identified by the Teaching Council to cover in initial teacher education and CPD for teachers.  I appreciate Mr. Moore's point.  The NCSE believes a framework needs to be put in place for teachers.  The reality is that a large number of children who have special educational needs learn differently.  They may not necessarily need additional support in the school but the teachers need to know how they learn and differentiate their approach and language accordingly.  In our policy advice we have recommended that a framework for the professional development of teachers be put in place.  The framework includes initial teacher education and induction but also CPD.  All teachers need to be trained in CPD.  If there are children who do not have an assessed special educational need, they may have underlying reasons for learning differently.  Obviously in special schools, children with complex needs need dedicated learning.<\/p><p>  The whole ethos of the NCSE is that the child's needs must be at the centre and plans need to be put in place around the child.  Whatever CPD the teacher needs to put a proper<b><\/b>IEP, individualised education plan, in place for the child, a structure needs to be in place to enable the teacher access that.   We went one step further in our supports paper when we said that this training and CPD must be mandatory.  All teachers must have a qualification in the area of special education and must have at least one day's training-----  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900012#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1381325400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>At undergraduate level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900012#M00400","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381325400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>No, at CPD.

In our supports paper we recommend strongly that the EPSEN, Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, Act 2004 remains the best way.  Its full introduction provides for individual assessment and the right resources to be delivered to support those.  Obviously we are not there yet.  We have made 27 other recommendations that we think can be implemented in the short to medium term.  That includes a move away from diagnosis, which will free up professional time for assessments to inform teaching and learning.  That is crucial.  Rather than spending hours diagnosing a child with a disability, people should assess what the child needs to succeed in the classroom.  Where additional resources are allocated, whether SNA resources or teaching resources, they must be part of a comprehensive individualised plan for that child.  Personalised planning must happen at school level.  It is reasonable if we are allocating additional resources that the school should plan how they are going to use those resources and that the outcomes are monitored.<\/p><p>  In regard to the teaching assistant or SNA, we undertook some research in that area and looked at models in various countries.  It is an issue that is not easy to crack and everybody is struggling with it.  There are countries that have no special schools, there are countries where there are no teaching assistants, and there is everything in between.  We need to go back and focus on what the child needs in order to progress.  What does the child need to learn?  Howe can we free up the professionals in order to carry out that assessment and increase the skills of teachers to enable them to intervene?  In our supports paper we struggled with the issue of how to make a recommendation in this area.<\/p> <p>There is a great deal of evidence to show that where we have teaching assistant-SNA professionals, they impede the ability of the child to access the teacher. These people are linked to the child and working with the child and because of this they form a barrier not only between the child and its peers, but also between the child and the teacher.  This happens not because people are not working well together but because the teaching assistant is working with the child while the teacher is working with the rest of the class.  Where children have such complex needs and learn differently, we need the most skilled person to support those children.  Special education is a much broader issue than one of teaching assistants and SNAs.  Also, research is very mixed in terms of impact and outcomes.  We must be concerned with how to deliver the best outcomes.  If we tell parents of children with special needs that they should taught by somebody other than the teacher, that is the wrong message to send out.  All children, including those with special educational needs, deserve to be taught by fully qualified teachers who understand their needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900012#M00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381326000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I have some questions in that regard.

Children there might have intensive help for a while and then may not need it any longer or may drop in and out of the system.  Has the NCSE looked at any systems such as that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900013#N00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381326000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>We looked at lots of systems when we were trying to come up with our supports paper.  However, there is no magic wand.  Even in Finland, the system varies from school to school.  We also found that whereas models in some countries changed six years ago or more, these countries are now returning to their previous systems.  We need to look at the issue in terms of focusing on the child and its needs.  This is a challenge for the system, because the needs of children change from year to year.  As soon as one structure is put in place, another child comes in with a different need.  Therefore, there must be flexibility in the system.<\/p><p>  Our proposed tailored allocational model for teachers will give schools that flexibility.  Therefore, the position will not be that a child is allocated three or five hours or whatever every week or that children who have not been assessed will have no hours.  The model will give the schools flexibility to think about providing intensive support at key transition points and then fading those out over time.  This is the position we are trying to get to.  We are trying to change the system and to introduce a different culture in terms of how schools can use the supports that have been made available to focus on the needs of a specific child.  It should not be just literacy and numeracy that are looked at but issues such as assistive technology, mobility and different ways of learning.

The needs are very varied and unique to every child.  Job security for special needs assistants is crucial and there needs to be an end to casualisation, but I do not think that was addressed today.  It is very worrying for special needs assistants.  If there was a bit of security of tenure there would be a foundation on which we could build to provide professional development opportunities for SNAs.  They are very well placed to provide holistic support.  Ms Lynch and Mr. Moore are very knowledgeable of the situation.  They both spoke very passionately.<\/p><p>  Close to my heart is the issue of transitional care when coming from a care service or psychiatric service back into a school.  If an SNA is involved, he or she can provide a link or training to cope with the challenging behaviour.  When I started as an SNA 15 years ago, I worked with a child with cerebral palsy who needed walking aids.  I went to Enable Ireland after school every evening with him and his mother and I learned the little physiotherapy bits that I could do and I supported that in school.  There was a continuity of the service as he was not going to get physio every day.  Opportunities are there if only there was a little bit of inclusiveness, and I think that is what is missing.  The continuity of care for transition periods is hugely traumatic for a child to go from mainstream to special school or from primary to secondary school.  If we were a little bit imaginative, children could have that one bit of continuity in a transition period and the SNA could carry that out even for a brief period, so that everything is not new.<\/p><p>  The peer group support is very important.  Fostering peer group acceptance is a huge part of the role for SNAs, but if an SNA thinks his or her hours are going to be cut or if he or she is now working only eight hours per week, which have to be spread right across the week, that imposes hardship on the individual.  It is difficult to maintain a living wage on a whole-time post, not to mind when an SNA's hours are reduced to a portion of a job.  I do not think that would work in any sector.  If we are serious about providing an efficient and effective service, we must look at inclusivity and we must include SNAs in training.  The SESS had a fantastic budget last year for training teachers in special education.  We were told by representatives of many of the education centres around the country that there were empty seats at every single training session.  If a child with challenging behaviour presents in a school, the teacher will ask the SNA to withdraw the child so that she can continue with the teaching lesson.  However, the SNA has not had any training whatsoever in how to manage the challenging behaviour.  I was recently in a school in Waterford where a child with very significant needs and very challenging behaviour had access to support for the first time ever.  The principal cannot allow that situation and must have an SNA with the child on a full-time basis because, through no fault of his own, he is a danger to himself and to the children around him.  It is an awful pity that there is no inclusivity as a best practice across the board, because where it is in place it is very effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900014#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Joan McCrohan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381326600,"counter":81,"content":"<p>In response to the comments made about how the NCSE brings people along with them, I do not think there is any \"bringing along\" for parents, because parents obviously want the right thing for their child.  The difficulty we have with the system at the moment is that if a child has been identified with any need from birth onwards, it becomes a fight for that child.  His or her family are fighting for resources all the time.  Sometimes people fight when they do not need to fight, because they are just locked into the fight, but when people have fought for a resource and have got it, they will not let it go until another resource is in place.  It might not be the right resource and parents might think it is not the right resource for their child, but until another more appropriate resource is offered it is very hard to let go of the resource that they have.  That can often be misunderstood, and parents are seen as marching on the gates for their SNA provision or resource teaching hours.  When we talk to the individual parents they say they know their child does not need a particular resource but does need another resource, such as a speech and language therapist, but they might be on a waiting list for a speech and language therapist for four years, so what do they do?  The overall message that can come across as fighting against change is not actually the underlying message, but it is just that they hang on to the resource that they have until the get the right resource.  It would be a very easy door to push open with parents.  I do not think there is resistance to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013100900014#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381326600,"counter":82,"content":"<p>In any review of the SNA role, I ask the committee to ensure that the focus is on the child.

I have just returned from Jordan and northern Iraq where I conducted an assessment for MSF of the overall humanitarian response in the region for Syrian refugees.  Thousands continue to cross the border almost daily and all actors are trying to scale up their activities to try to meet the increasing needs.  Today, I will focus mainly on MSF's response inside Syria, but I will be happy to address any questions regarding the response to the Syrian refugees.<\/p><p>  Across Syria there are enclaves surrounded by intense fighting where virtually no aid is reaching the people trapped inside.  Our teams on the ground have seen at first hand the horrors of living under siege, where, for example, water is cut off and snipers fire at anyone who tries to access the only well with water left in the area and where food is scare and the constant shelling is intense.  People are living in extreme fear and in abominable conditions.  The wounded and sick face near insurmountable obstacles when trying to access health care due to the relentless bombings and the targeting and destruction of Syria's health system.<\/p><p>  The medical system, like the rest of Syrian society, has been under siege during the conflict and is no longer capable of responding to the acute and chronic medical needs of the Syrian people.  Of the 91 public hospitals across the country, 60% have been damaged or completely destroyed.  Doctors have fled the country in huge numbers.  Among those who remain are small numbers of medical specialists, doctors-in-training and surgeons with little or no experience in operating on war-related injuries.  Dentists are performing minor surgeries, pharmacists are treating patients and young people are volunteering to work as nurses.  MSF is providing emergency surgical care to victims of violence and trauma in six hospital across three governments in northern Syria.<\/p><p>  I will refer to an extract written by one of our Irish doctors who has just returned from working for two months in our hospital in Idlib, which reflects the reality of the situation.  He wrote:<blockquote> And then August hit and our project quickly turned to trauma management.  Fighting intensified, villages were bombed and casualties, fighters and civilians, flooded in.  Within two weeks we launched nine mass casualty incidents.  This is when the influx of the wounded exceeds the capacity of our hospital.  They all came together and with injuries so severe that many needed life-saving treatment at the exact same time.  The inpatient wards swelled beyond capacity, yet we did not have the staff to manage this.  Many of the team just kept working later and later each day, pushing past their limits.  There was no other choice.  Even between these events we were much busier than before with trauma victims.  More skulls fractured open, more hands and feet blown off, more injuries bleeding inside chests and abdomens needing immediate intervention, more faces smashed in.  Some cases were brought in already dead.  Some were immediately palliative as our staff sat with the parents of children waiting for them to die peacefully.  Others were the friends and family of our staff.  Explaining to our translator that there is nothing we could do to save his uncle who was hit by a rocket, he understood: &quot;Many of our family have already been killed.  We know this is what happens.&quot;  At a later bombing of a local village our new doctor lost three family members.  He quickly moved his family the following day and then turned up for work again and I couldn't say to him, &quot;take some days off, you need it&quot;.  The line between staff and victim had long since been lost.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p> Today, Syrians are dying not only from bullets, bombs and missiles, but also from easily treatable and preventable illnesses.  These are the silent casualties &ndash; people with chronic conditions like cancer and diabetes who can no longer get treatment following the collapse of the health system.  They cannot be referred outside the country and so they are dying slowly.  We are seeing evidence of hepatitis A generally, along with measles in children who have not been vaccinated in more than two years. <\/p><p> Although MSF initially focused on providing emergency and trauma care, we have now extended to include primary health care consultations, maternal care, polio and measles vaccination campaigns, mental health programmes, and donations of medications to treat communicable diseases such as typhoid and chronic illnesses.  We are working with 450 team members on the ground in order to deliver these essential medical services.  In areas where we cannot send our own teams because of insecurity or lack of access, in the past two years we have expanded our programme of supporting Syrian medical networks, hospitals and medical posts by providing drugs, medical equipment, and technical advice.  We are now supporting 84 health structures.  The majority of the clinics MSF supports are in opposition-controlled areas, but some are in government-controlled areas, or areas of conflict under mixed control.  In many areas, people are too scared to cross front lines to access health care, and health care workers have been killed, arrested, tortured or threatened.  Medical structures are relentlessly bombed and military bases have been established close to makeshift hospitals, putting these medical facilities at risk of being caught in the middle of fighting or being directly hit in an attack.  The situation is so extreme that some doctors have told us they feel it is more dangerous for them to be caught carrying medical supplies than if they were caught carrying weapons.<\/p><p> Despite the challenges of medical supply throughout Syria, there is some level of capacity being sustained in government-controlled areas, and an underground movement of medical facilities operates in opposition areas.  These structures are set up in incredible conditions &ndash; from kitchen tables to underground basements.  However, this medical capacity is not provided outside the divides of the conflict and therefore both sides view health providers as targets.  Field hospital are almost systematically bombed, health workers in government hospitals are threatened not to go to work and medical staff provide treatment to the wounded in secret.  One of the latest examples of this was in early September when a field hospital in al Bab, northern Syria, was bombed by the Syrian air force, killing nine patients and two medical staff.<\/p><p> The challenges in responding to the humanitarian fallout of this brutal conflict are immense.  There is an insufficient deployment of aid in Syria.  For those providing aid across borders - such as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res &ndash; it is impossible to have extensive geographic coverage.  Aid is confined to a very small area close to the Turkish border and it is possible to address only a fraction of the needs.  Since the beginning of the year, fewer than 20 UN and ICRC convoys have managed to cross the front lines.  Only a large-scale cross-border supply operation can meet the needs that arise from the fighting, the widespread destruction, population displacement and collapse of public services.  What we are seeing today is that even this very limited deployment of aid is being squeezed and is under constant threat.  We need to see more humanitarian actors accepted to work in Syria by the Syrian government, a complete lifting of restrictions on where medical aid can be deployed and respect for the safety of aid actors to be shown by both the armed opposition and the Syrian army.  To achieve this we need to see a diplomatic mobilisation similar to that we saw around the issue of chemical weapons <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013100900002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane-Ann McKenna","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381325400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McKenna.

We in Concern recognise that almost all of recent discussion on Syria has been about chemical weapons use and what to do about it or about the threat of international military intervention.  This distracts from the humanitarian situation so we welcome the opportunity to highlight the plight of the Syrian people and bring greater focus to humanitarian needs inside Syria and in neighbouring countries.<\/p><p>  This is a highly charged, highly complex, highly politicised and hugely complicated context.  For humanitarian agencies working on the ground in the country, such as ourselves, it is a matter of having to feel our way through this in a very slow, considered and measured way in order to overcome the issues relating to sustained access, build acceptance of our presence and programmes and work with very high levels of insecurity.  Concern is working in both Syria and Lebanon in response to the crisis, providing shelter and WASH - water and sanitation assistance - to refugees in northern Lebanon.  The primary focus of our current work inside Syria is to provide a broad WASH programme to reach people at risk of disease. <\/p><p>  I recently returned from a month in the region and have seen at first hand the impact this conflict is having on the Syrian population.  In Lebanon, the number of refugees is heading for the 1 million mark, in a country that has a similar population to Ireland but with only a fraction of the size.  Can members imagine what it would be like for a million people to come here out of desperation and need?  This is leading to increasing tensions between Syrian refugees and their Lebanese hosting communities because of the pressure the increased population is placing on available housing options.  The lack of suitable shelter options has reached crisis point in Lebanon, with more new arrivals and increasing incidents of evictions of those already in place.  Increased incidents of cross-border shelling into north Lebanon is putting both Lebanese and refugee families at increased risk.  While obviously indiscriminate in whom it affects, the shelling appears to be targeting areas of high displacement.  This is happening too often to be considered accidental or stray and is impeding access to affected populations. <\/p><p>  On 13 September, six bombs fell around the small village of Fraidis in northern Lebanon, which is barely a mile from the Syrian border.  Its former school, the Fraidis collective centre, is now home to ten Syrian families.  After the attack, the ten families living in Fraidis were asked to leave.  Those living in the old school building are being relocated to another collective centre away from the border.  One of them, Josianne, spoke of what had happened:<blockquote>We do not feel safe any more.  We hate it when night comes because of the shells.  Because of the shelling the host communities say the refugees are a target and they would like them to leave.  We are also afraid of something else.  The people in the village came by a couple of times to tell us to leave.  They don't want Syrian people in their village and they are saying it is because of our stay that shells are being thrown at them.<\/blockquote>  Inside Syria, the indiscriminate nature of the conflict and the climate of fear that exists after nearly three years of fighting - fear of aerial bombardment, fear of car bombings, fear of being lifted from one's home at night by one group or another - has led to a mass exodus and the almost total economic ruin of the country.  This has resulted in more than 10% of the population fleeing the country and becoming refugees in neighbouring countries.  The current estimate is such refugees is 2.1 million refugees.  More than double that number, or 4.5 million internally displaced persons, IDPs, are taking to the road and becoming internally displaced inside Syria.<\/p><p>  Another case study is that of Ibrahim and Nour, a brother and sister who have recently arrived at a refugee camp in Turkey.  Ibrahim spoke of their experience, saying:<blockquote>We don't know if we'll be alive from one day to the next or whether I will be kidnapped or arrested.  The most important thing for me is to feel safe.  This fear is not just my fear but also a fear for everyone living in Syria.  No one knows if there will be shelling or bombing - it is complicated.  There is no sense of security no matter where you go.  My sister and I have moved three times in the last year and finally we just had to leave Syria.<\/blockquote>  Syrians are finding it increasingly difficult to feed and house their families in safety.  Another case study is of Fatima, a mother, and her cousin Ahmed.  Fatima reported: <blockquote>Life is very difficult here.  My husband had a good job but now sells cigarettes on the road side.  I work at a border kitchen.  They give me breakfast, lunch and dinner for my family.  Another woman minds my children and baby while I work.  We also get one and a half loaves of bread a day from a local NGO.  We are grateful for this but this is not enough.  If we don't get the supplement food from the kitchen I work in we couldn't survive.<\/blockquote>  Much of the infrastructure is either destroyed or damaged and is not functioning, not even at minimum level. <\/p> <p>I refer to industry, electricity, water, health care and education.  Much of that infrastructure is concentrated in cities and towns, that is, the areas which have borne the brunt of sustained bombardment for more than two years.  The situation is deteriorating daily and winter is coming, for the third time since the conflict began, bringing with it additional hardship as people have fewer means for coping at their disposal.  In many parts of the country workers are not getting paid and the fabric of society is breaking down.  Yet many of these people are still showing up for work and trying to carry on with fewer and fewer resources and an infrastructure that is barely functioning.<\/p><p> What is normal inside Syria today is barely tolerable for its people.  We have seen a doubling of the number of refugees since January this year, with every reason to believe their numbers will double again if the situation remains unresolved.  For the huge displaced population inside Syria, conditions are appalling.  The UN has described the situation there as the greatest crisis of the last 30 years, a crisis from which the country will take years, if not decades, to recover.  As it draws in neighbouring countries, the conflict poses a very real danger of escalating beyond Syria's borders into a much broader regional conflict.<\/p><p> There are clear actions that must be taken to address the situation.  First and foremost, we must have more intensive efforts to find a durable political and diplomatic end to the conflict.  In that regard, we welcome the efforts of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and his engagement with the UN on this issue.  We hope that all possible pressure will be brought to bear to ensure the Geneva II talks go ahead as scheduled at the end of November.  Those talks must be inclusive, bringing together all parties and all influences.  Having just some of the multitude of movements and groups represented will not in itself bring about an end to hostilities.  Neighbouring countries affected by the crisis must also be represented and involved, including Israel and Iran.  The $4.5 billion appeal for Syria is only 50% funded to date and more resources must be made available to provide timely and appropriate humanitarian assistance both inside Syria and in neighbouring countries.  I have highlighted some of the issues facing refugees in Lebanon.  There is an additional need to lobby the Lebanese Government to rethink its objections to large-scale formal camps given that the other options are fully saturated and exhausted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013100900003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ros O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381326000,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. O'Sullivan.

In fact, that number was reached some weeks ago, which underlines the urgency of the problems confronting the people of that country.<\/p><p>  I made a presentation at the Daniel O'Connell summer school last month, where I made the point that when O'Connell died in 1847, he died with a broken heart because he could not persuade the British people that the Irish Famine was a humanitarian rather than a political issue.  The prevailing view in the British political classes at the time was that the Irish were a violent, reckless and undeserving people.  O'Connell was unable to persuade them that the humanitarian consideration should be more important than the political prejudices that existed.  Returning to the present day, leaders of non-governmental organisations and political leaders and influencers in this country - which has an outstanding reputation in the area of humanitarian aid - have a serious duty to persuade people of the extent of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria, which was perfectly illustrated by my colleagues from M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res Ireland and Concern.<\/p><p>  My colleague, Mr. Jonathan Edgar, has just returned from Syria where he undertook a full assessment of our operations.  He will outline some of his findings to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013100900004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381326000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>As Mr. Andrews indicated, I was inside northern Syria last week visiting GOAL's humanitarian programmes across the Idlib and Hama provinces.  GOAL has been working inside Syria since November 2012 and is currently delivering humanitarian assistance to more than 350,000 individuals every month.  My latest trip was a follow-up to an earlier visit in July.  It was evident to me that the humanitarian situation has deteriorated considerably in the meantime.  In fact, without an immediate and sustainable solution to the conflict, the humanitarian crisis will become unmanageable for the larger international NGOs operating inside Syria.<\/p><p>  I take this opportunity to urge Irish parliamentarians and other elected representatives to keep the humanitarian crisis in Syria high on the political agenda.  Political will and political pressure, not only from Ireland, but from across Europe and the rest of the world, is essential if we are to protect the human rights of the most vulnerable people affected by this conflict.  The United Nations has estimated that 100,000 people have been killed to date, 6.8 million are in need of aid, 4.25 million to 4.5 million are internally displaced inside Syria, and 2.1 million are seeking refuge in neighbouring countries.  Perhaps the most shocking statistic is that half of the 6.8 million people in need of aid are children.<\/p><p>  We can talk all day about figures but it is only when one visits Syria and sees the devastation and suffering at first hand that the enormity of the humanitarian catastrophe becomes really apparent.  It is one of the worst humanitarian crises I have witnessed, and I have seen many.  I welcome the statement by the United States Secretary of State, Mr. John Kerry, that his country and Russia are pushing the United Nations to hold a Syria peace conference in the second week of November.  It is important, however, to emphasise the urgency of the situation.  There is a need for a clear, sustainable solution right now.  Not only will innocent people continue to suffer if the impasse continues, but the realisation of any peaceful solution in the future will become more difficult as extremist groups look to profit from the inertia of the international community and the chaos inside Syria.  The country is unravelling as a result of the current vacuum.<\/p><p>  Thanks to the support of Irish Aid and other international donors, including the British and United States governments and the European Union, GOAL is providing food rations to 350,000 people on a monthly basis.  These rations include basic nutritional components such as rice, beans, pasta and oil.  In addition, GOAL is providing soya bread for 100,000 people per month and supporting the re-establishment of the bakeries through large-scale flour distributions.  To ensure that 84,000 displaced people are prepared for the harsh winter ahead, GOAL, with funding from the Government, is distributing vouchers that can be redeemed from a supplier for a range of items, including heating fuel, housing repair materials, blankets, clothing and cooking utensils - the types of materials we take for granted on a day-to-day basis.  When it reviewed GOAL's voucher programme recently, the United States Office of the Inspector General pronounced it one of the most innovative schemes it had seen and recommended that it be replicated as widely as possible.<\/p><p>  While ensuring humanitarian needs are met in GOAL's current areas of operation, we will continue to expand our geographical focus to reach those populations most at risk.  I agree with my colleague from M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res Ireland that the delivery of aid in a 12 km band just south of the Turkish border will not meet the needs of the most vulnerable and needy.  When security permits, we will have to work through local partners to access the less secure areas not currently receiving aid, including southern Idlib and Hama town, where the fighting is at its heaviest.  There is a need for the humanitarian community and international agencies to expand their humanitarian activities to include provision of safe water, supporting the rural agricultural sector, providing home repair and transitional shelter for families, and responding to the primary health care needs of the most vulnerable people.<\/p><p>  The challenges facing GOAL's operations in Syria in the coming months can only be mitigated significantly by the creation of a protected humanitarian corridor that allows humanitarian agencies access to the areas most in need.  This humanitarian corridor would protect aid distributions from the interference of both government and rebel forces.  That will only come about through dialogue at a political level.  The issue on the ground is humanitarian.  The humanitarian response will not solve the political situation but without a protected humanitarian corridor which allows aid agencies to reach those most in need, the situation will deteriorate further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013100900004#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jonathan Edgar"},{"type":"speech","time":1381326000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Edgar.

The witnesses' contributions have outlined the serious and frightening humanitarian disaster in Syria and the adjoining regions.  Mr. Ros O'Sullivan mentioned that we want to get away from the emphasis on chemical weapons and the political end of it and towards the humanitarian issue.  Mr. Barry Andrews highlighted the emphasis the Oireachtas and this committee put on the humanitarian needs of the region.  This is a committee in a small Parliament but, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the European Union Council of Ministers, the T&aacute;naiste assures us he raises the humanitarian aspect of the particular difficulties on an ongoing basis.  I fully accept that.  I am glad the Government has allocated &euro;13.8 million to date in humanitarian assistance.  It is needed.<\/p><p>  The figures supplied to us in a briefing show the vast majority of the funding has gone through the United Nations structures.  A much smaller quantum has gone to organisations like those represented by the witnesses.  I presume the United Nations organisations are hampered in getting much-needed humanitarian aid to the areas held by rebels.  I presume the UN must respect the mandate of the Assad regime.  That concerns me greatly.  From my limited knowledge, there are substantial areas under rebel control and a huge number of people are losing their lives and are in absolute distress.  Perhaps one of the witnesses can address the issue.<\/p><p>  At this committee and during Oral Questions in the D&aacute;il, I have welcomed the contribution of the Irish Government on behalf of the Irish taxpayer.  Do we need a refocus on the disbursement of funds and whether they are getting to the people most in need?  We have all raised the issue at this committee.<\/p><p>  The UN Security Council has been ineffective in trying to address this very serious difficulty.  Mr. Barry Andrews mentioned that this is the humanitarian issue of our generation.  Sadly, the situation has deteriorated since he last spoke to us, a few months ago, in respect of the number of people losing their lives and those displaced internally and to neighbouring areas.  The UN Security Council has five permanent members and my understanding is that the five permanent members have a veto.  It is a 16 member council with a rotating membership.  It was established after the Second World War and the architecture of the United Nations has not changed in the meantime.  The needs of so many people and regions have not been addressed.  In the countries that hold permanent membership, is there any sense that the ineffective working of the UN Security Council must be addressed?<\/p><p>  We know that the European Union has been the best contributor and donor to the humanitarian aid programme.  Other countries have made major pledges that have not been honoured.  Through sister organisations, can the witnesses find a forum or forums to highlight the absolute need for the countries, many of whom are large powers, to honour their pledges to people in distressing situations?  I compliment the witnesses and their organisations on working in extremely difficult areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013100900005#D00100","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1381326600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will attend next week's meeting and will concentrate to a considerable extent on chemical weapons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013100900005#D00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1381326600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Like other speakers, I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, has come up with the &euro;3 million in support.  The reference to 6.8 million people, half of whom are children, needing aid is staggering.  Our contribution is a drop in the ocean.  Is it helpful to talk about the fact that half of the aid budget promised was provided and that countries have not stepped up to the mark?  Is it helpful to name and shame these countries?  Does it matter if they have given a commitment and are not delivering on it?  Recently, a BBC programme showed two doctors going to Syria.  The countryside was desolation and bleak like a lunar landscape.  I presume the witnesses have experienced it.  The only aspect that does not come across on the television screen is the smell, the heat and the physical conditions in which people live.  The programme showed the refugee camps and the kids who had been bombed with phosphorus.  No proper medication is available.  The medical supplies are not suitable for children.  How can that be addressed?  Anyone affected by seeing the programme could not walk away from the problem.<\/p><p>  Mr. Ros O'Sullivan referred to the 1 million extra refugees in Lebanon.  People in Ireland complain about an influx of refugees in Ireland when, last year, 700 people came to this country.  It puts the figure in context.  In Syria, there was a 10% increase in the population from the Iraq war.  A certain amount of the population moved from Palestine.  Generations have been moved because of war and they are now being moved again.<\/p><p>  How do the witnesses deal with camps?  Sometimes, this arises out of a sectarian conflict.  How was this dealt with in camps?  Are they divided along sectarian lines or are people lumped together?  People need help and support in this respect.  How safe is it?  Witnesses referred to the corridor.  How can we make the corridor safe?  Are we talking about troops going in to make the humanitarian corridor safe?  Are the witnesses hoping the different groups, including the government and opposition sides, will come to agreement in order that supplies and humanitarian aid can be delivered?  How likely is that to happen?  Do we need troops on the ground?  If that happens, will the situation escalate?<\/p><p>  How is safe water secured?  With the growth of the refugee camps, problems arise with typhoid and cholera and children not receiving vaccinations.  Camps are breeding grounds for disease as they get bigger.  The BBC programme referred to a toilet drain going into the only water in the camp.<\/p><p>  I thank the witnesses for the work they are doing.  They are the heroes, in my eyes and in the eyes of many people, for risking life and limb to go into those conditions.  They are saving lives and they are giving hope.  We all hope some diplomatic initiative can be taken.  The fact that there has been movement on chemical weapons may open up real dialogue.  That is the only way forward.  I thank the witnesses for attending this meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013100900005#D00300","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1381327200,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their attendance.  This is not the first time the committee has heard a presentation about the situation in Syria which seems to be getting more grim each time.  There is very little hope being expressed by the many people we have met.  A population which is more than the population of Ireland has been displaced, with half of the population seeking refuge outside the country.  The plight of the children affects me most.  Some of them will not know any other life except growing up in a conflict situation.  People are dying from preventable illnesses.<\/p><p>  Ireland's provision of aid funding is just a small drop in the ocean.  Is it being used where it is most needed?  Have the delegates any suggestions as to where it could be better deployed?<\/p><p>  I have a question about Lebanon for Mr. Ros O'Sullivan.  Is he suggesting that big camps are the best option?  I acknowledge the pressure being exerted on Lebanon.  What is the most humane solution for those refugees moving into Lebanon?<\/p><p>  I have a question for GOAL.  Is GOAL working in parts of Syria where people are trying to lead a so-called normal life?  Can there be a humanitarian solution without a political one?  Do they go hand in hand?  Is the possibility of an interim measure such as a humanitarian corridor or a ceasefire being raised with any of the players in Syria to facilitate the movement of aid into the country?  I hope pressure can be applied to those countries which have pledged money and have not come up with it.<\/p><p>  The delegates and their work are amazing.  I feel totally helpless and inadequate.  This is not the first time that chemical weapons have been used but it could provide a way forward towards a study of the broader picture.

I thank the delegates for their contributions and for their sterling work in the region.  I support the call for the establishment of humanitarian corridors.  Unfortunately, it is probably very easy to say it and to ask that it be done.  I refer to the report on Syria by Mary Fitzgerald in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  She explained that there are at least 12 armed factions in control of various parts of Syria.  She wrote about the composition of these factions and the complexities of having the Kurds on the Turkish border and the relationship between Turkey, the Kurds and Lebanon and Hezbollah support for Assad.  It is an extremely disturbing country.  The key players are Russia and America.  The European Union does not seem to be effective but it is a significant contributor to the aid programmes, for which it is to be congratulated.  Is the incredible friction that exists between the fighters and the establishment Islamists, with people joining up in different camps, a contributory factor in the continuing escalation of the problem?  The poor unfortunate average civilians are suffering the most.<\/p><p>  I refer to the very detailed coloured map which accompanies Ms Fitzgerald's article.  If the Kurds control a large section of the area bordering Turkey, presumably aid could be brought in by that route, unless the Turks were being obstreperous but I do not think they are.  In fact, I congratulate the Turkish Government on its excellent, kind and humane response to so many refugees.  Ms Jane-Ann McKenna said that it was easier to organise humanitarian aid within government controlled areas.  It would seem that a humanitarian corridor might have to pass through areas controlled by many different factions.  I hope the Irish troops in Lebanon are safe.  Theirs is a remarkable task, and I note that some countries pulled their troops out of the region.  I wish our troops every success in keeping the peace in the area between Syria and Israel.  It may be necessary to wait for the outcome from Geneva.<\/p><p>  Ireland is a small nation but is providing hard cash for aid programmes.  Some organisations make the argument that aid from Ireland should go to them in direct funding.  Most of our aid goes to the United Nations.  The delegates represent NGOs operating in various parts.  I ask in what way the organisations complement the work of the United Nations which receives the funding.  I opened my e-mails today to see that my spam box contained a request to help Syrian children by donating &euro;45.  This e-mail looks very genuine and it comes from UNICEF, apparently.  However, the spam notice warned that this was a dangerous piece of Spam in so far as it was aimed at extracting money under false pretences.  Is it possible that people are trying to exploit our humanitarian goodwill by mimicking a website?  I would love to be told it is not spam but my e-mail box indicates it is so.<\/p><p>  I understand that about 50% of the Palestinians in the region are already second generation refugees.  Who is handling that element of the crisis?  Why would 50% of the Palestinians be dispersed while the other 50% are staying put?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013100900006#E00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1381327200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I join in welcoming our guests.  I compliment them on the amazing work of their various organisations.  It is difficult to visualise the magnitude of what they face every day.  The 6.8 million refugees number more than the population of the entire island of Ireland.  It is almost impossible to visualise if every one of us needed daily aid.  This statistic is coupled with the figure of 100,000 killed.  Half of the 6.8 million refugees are children.  This illustrates the seriousness of the situation.  Our Government is doing its best to help the aid efforts, but it is a drop in the ocean.  Like Deputy Crowe, I said that those who are failing to meet their obligations and much larger countries which are not contributing should be named and shamed.  We need to increase the pressure on some of those wealthier countries.  I am concerned that despite the size of this tragedy it is not getting the international attention a crisis of this magnitude deserves.<\/p> <p>There is coverage on television but people have become immune to it, leaving a challenge for organisations like those before us today to keep the matter highlighted.<\/p><p> I cannot rationalise that while there are discussions about loss of life from attacks using chemical weapons, there does not seem to be a diplomatic initiative to enable aid getting to injured people.  How is there no urgency in this regard?  The bigger conflict will require much diplomatic initiative but why would any government want to prevent aid getting to ill, injured or starving people?  Why would even people on opposite sides want to further disadvantage such vulnerable people?  Why is our Government and others within the European Union or the wider international community not acting more urgently to try to achieve what the witnesses have described, with more humanitarians actors being accepted by the Syrian Government?  Why are people who want to help the injured not allowed in and why are restrictions on deployment of medical aid not being lifted?<\/p><p> M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, is a key partner of Irish Aid but why has it not accepted aid for operations in Syria?

I am grateful that the committee has convened this meeting to consider the humanitarian impact of the crisis.  I have a specific question that has been asked of me by families, and I am particularly concerned about the impact of the crisis on children.  My understanding now is that there are more than 1 million children displaced, with child labour common as families need children to work to eke out survival.  Going into a cold and wet winter, education and health is way down the agenda.<\/p><p>  Is there merit in the suggestion of some Irish families that the Irish Government could arrange for short-term fostering of Syrian refugee children by Irish host families until the condition in the homeland improves?  That would only happen with the consent of Syrian parents.  I see some merit in that.  If there was a willingness to pursue this, we could consider the possibility of Ireland leading a European-wide initiative.  There would be a cap on numbers as children would have educational and health-related needs, and families would have to be vetted.  The process would have to be done right.<\/p><p>  Families are in crisis in Syria and the solutions are complex and not obvious.  These children may be in these conditions for another year or more.  The people working with the organisations before us today work on the ground and may be in a position to help select children, for example, if families are willing for them to go.  We have defence personnel who can help with logistics and movement, and although we are in a recession, we have public services that could be stretched, within reasonable limits.

There are sensitivities which accompany involvement in the internal affairs of a country, as we know from what has happened with the UN Security Council and a failure to get agreement to do anything.  It has been a key factor.  Whether we learn from that remains to be seen.<\/p><p>  We have discussed this many times and there must be a sequence of events that can be triggered automatically when a crisis like this occurs that involves serious human rights abuse, famine or starvation as a result of war, even an internal war.

Aid delivery in government-held areas as opposed to opposition areas has been raised a few times.  As I mentioned, since the beginning of the year only 20 UN and International Rescue Committee convoys have been able to cross front lines.  The majority of the aid within the UN is being delivered in government-held areas.  There has been an argument that the issue violates Syrian sovereignty by crossing front lines and borders to deliver aid, and we have raised this as a major consideration.  The current aid system is not working effectively for Syria, and there is a need for a level of innovation, flexibility and creativity by all actors to be able to deliver aid effectively in the region.  We know the Syrian Arab Red Crescent has 10,000 people working on the ground, and they have managed to deliver aid effectively.  There are numerous diaspora networks that are probably the most effective means of delivering aid on the ground, as opposed to larger western aid organisations like ourselves.  There are limits on what we can do.<\/p><p>  With regard to medical needs, although we can send medical supplies and technical equipment, there is a greater need for even more technical equipment and expertise.  There are complex surgeries required and deep inside Syria there is nobody to do them; it is too dangerous for MSF to go there and we do not have permission to be there anyway.  We can send supplies and medicine but there is not enough to save more lives on the ground.<\/p><p>  The availability of medical facilities and workers has been mentioned; there is not one side or another which is doing right or wrong in this respect.  We have seen threats from both sides - the opposition and the Syrian regime - when it comes to distributing medical aid.<\/p> <p> We have received funding this year for our programmes in the central African republic - South Sudan and Chad- for which we are grateful.  It is policy within MSF that we do not accept funding in highly politicised or conflict areas.  Syria is one of them, as are Somalia and Mali.  It is not a reflection on Irish Aid as a donor.  Irish Aid is one of the few government agencies we will accept funding from.  However, this maintains our own independence on the ground.  When we go into these areas, whichever side is in control, we can say we are there with no agenda other than to deliver medical assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013100900007#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane-Ann McKenna","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381328400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I would like to reply to Deputy Smith's question about access to aid on the rebel side.  The T&aacute;naiste made a strong statement at the UN General Assembly.  The proportion of Irish aid money that goes to NGOs should be properly calibrated to reflect need, whether it is through NGOs or UN.  It does not matter as long it reflects need.  That might require recalibration.  The committee will have an opportunity to discuss the UN Security Council's response to the chemical weapons issue when the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Costello, appears but the response reflects an interpretation of the best interests of the main powers holding the veto and permanent membership rather than an assessment of the merits of any issue that comes before the council.<\/p><p>  With regard to humanitarian access, if the UN is standing at the Turkish border, for example, with thousands of trucks full of humanitarian aid to go into the rebel side, naturally its officials will not do that unless they are welcomed by the Assad government.  The norms of international humanitarian law are that they cannot be reasonably denied access but there has never been a proper interpretation of the concept of reasonable denial of access.  Unfortunately, therefore, it is a grey area and it is difficult for any of us to have a strong opinion about it at this point.  That is the current position.  There is nothing to stop the General Assembly from passing a resolution and each UN member is entitled to sponsor a resolution of the assembly.

It will only come about by some diplomacy driven by the UN under pressure from politicians and the international community.  The two sides in conflict will not do this on their own and they need to come under pressure to ensure this happens.  I have no idea what that would look like but there needs to be an element of peace when it comes to humanitarian aid distribution.  It happened in Iraq, the Balkans and Afghanistan to a certain extent and it can happen here.  We were talking about the impact on families and children and what that means.  The current situation is unique but I found when I was on the ground there last week that child soldiers are being recruited into fundamentalist Islamic organisations.  Where there is a vacuum, which currently exists because there is an impasse, this is what will fill it, which is very worrying.  The work done recently by the American and Russian governments to negotiate a pressure point on the UN to put pressure on the Syrian regime to talk to the rebel factions was essential.  Any pressure parliamentarians can put on those bodies or actors will be critical.<\/p><p>  We need to understand that the rebel side is not one unified body.  There are five or six different organisations.  Given the vacuum, that is creating a level of uncertainty that is not healthy within the country.  Outside the political spectrum, the people who suffer are always the most vulnerable, particularly women and children, and that is what we are witnessing in northern Syria.  The movement of people has increased considerably.  When I was there in July, villages and towns were still operating in a war zone situation but people were still staying where they lived.  That has changed and people have moved away from their homes.  Those who can get across the border are in a better situation that those who are stuck in Syria.<\/p><p>  The UN is not working across Syria; it is only working in specific areas.

We are on the ground, we are implementing and we are addressing humanitarian aid but the UN will have to change the way it works because of the way the situation not just in Syria but in the rest of the world is going today, which has become so complex.<\/p><p>  There was a mention of the UN Security Council.  If it was a baby of the 20th century, let us sort it out in the 21st century now.  The council is not fit for purpose in certain contexts and, therefore, it is not a one-size-fits-all approach but that is all that has been allowed to date.  It will take something special to change that and, unfortunately, our select group around the table will not be able to come up with that solution.<\/p><p>  The question was posed as to whether there can be a humanitarian solution without a political solution.  It is important to clarify that there is no such thing as a humanitarian solution.  There is humanitarian assistance and humanitarian work but a political and diplomatic solution to the crisis is required and, in the meantime, there is a need for humanitarian work.  One hopes that, at a certain point, there will be an opportunity for recovery and longer term recovery work, which some observers suggest will take decades before Syria returns to where it was before.<\/p><p>  With regard to the humanitarian corridor, as my colleagues pointed out, there is no one Syrian opposition.  An estimated 400 to 600 different groups and movements make up the sum of the Syrian opposition.  They are loosely affiliated by one purpose and that is to see an end to the Assad regime.  After that in some respects all bets are off.  Some are more fundamentalist and others are more secular while some have a national focus but most have a local and a grassroots focus.  We work in a different area from GOAL while MSF works in the area we are but the dynamics and the context are different in every part of Syria due to the make up of the different movements and groups and the struggle for power that is going on at a localised level.  In examining how we approach the problem of delivering humanitarian assistance in a slow, considered and measured way, it is because this is probably the single most complex situation we have ever come across.  There is no book to which we can refer.<\/p> <p> We are experienced and we know what we are doing.  We have approaches but it is about flexibility, adaptability and working through the problem.  It is about dialogue with the different movements and groups that are now starting to take control in different areas and locations.  The amount of tea we drink in Syria right now is unbelievable, because that is how we dialogue.  We sit there with groups and movements and engage in dialogue.<\/p><p> In terms of the humanitarian corridors, through a combination of the UN being stymied, they are not able to operate as they were designed to operate.  There is no UN operating in the geographic area where we work.  When one is talking about a greater balance in where funding goes, as mentioned by one of my colleagues, the funding should go to where the identified needs are and to those agencies that are addressing those needs realistically on the ground.  Where the UN is running refugee camps, a proportional amount of aid should go to it.  We must recognise the NGOs who are in certain parts of Syria where the UN is struggling to operate legitimately.  I will ask my colleague, Peter Doyle, the desk officer for Syria and Lebanon to respond more specifically to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's question on camps.  He is more familiar with the Lebanese context than I.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013100900008#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ros O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381329000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I wish to address the issues Deputy O'Sullivan raised-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013100900009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1381329000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>We are coming to the end of the meeting.

The situation there at present is that the Lebanese Government does not want those large-scale camps so it is limiting the types of accommodation that are available to refugees.  For example, refugees could be staying in tented settlements and there is a maximum limit of 20 families per settlement.  They are also staying in collective centres which could be farm buildings or rented buildings that are refurbished by NGOs, such as Concern, to host refugees.  Many refugees are just renting.  They could be renting a garage or plot of land.  What we are finding is that those solutions are now becoming saturated.  The number of evictions has increased.  We have found since September that people can no longer afford to keep paying for some of the accommodation options they have.  It is not that we are necessarily calling for large-scale camps or that we think this is the ideal solution.  It is not.  There are advantages and disadvantages to everything.  We are seeking that the Lebanese authorities would reconsider the prohibition on large-scale camps because we must think about other solutions, given the saturation levels we have in all the other types of accommodation.<\/p><p>  Someone also asked about sectarianism in the camps.  What we are finding in northern Lebanon where we work is that it is quite a homogenous refugee population that comes mostly from the same sect.  Where tension seems to be increasing is between the host Lebanese population and the oncoming refugees.  It is one of the reasons why organisations such as Concern tries to provide assistance that will also benefit the host population and not just the refugees.  For example, some of our water supply projects benefit both local people and refugees.  In addition, we are going to try to facilitate dialogue between refugees and host populations to try and talk through issues and calm any tensions that might arise.<\/p><p>  I will address the impact on children.  It is wonderful to think there are families in Ireland that would be willing to take in refugee children.  I am sure they would look after them very well and be very welcoming.  However, from our perspective we think it is probably better to keep families together as much as possible.  Some of the families have fled fighting and they might already have lost some family members and are already traumatised.  To take a child out of that context and bring it to a far away, strange country would probably increase the trauma for them and their families.  We prefer to provide assistance to families as a unit and to keep them in the country.  It is one of the reasons we are looking at doing an education programme in Lebanon for Syrian refugee children who may well have missed two or three years of school at this stage.  The aim is to try to get them back into the schooling system so they do not lose even more time in education, which would only disadvantage them further in their lives ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013100900009#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1381329000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>We all got an e-mail referring to one of the cities in Syria that is surrounded by the Syrian army and is under constant shelling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013100900009#H00500","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1381329000,"counter":118,"content":"<p>A telephone is interfering with the sound.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013100900009#H00600","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1381329000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

Members have already heard from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, on the main features of the legislative package and the considerable progress achieved by him and his officials during the Irish Presidency of the Council of Ministers.  Whether this progress will be sufficient to have the proposals approved by the Council and the European Parliament in advance of next year's European elections remains uncertain.<\/p><p>  Data protection has become an increasingly important issue in the European Union following the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty.  The draft regulation, as put forward by the Commission, reflects the increased importance in a number of ways.  It accepts that the core principles set out in the 1995 data protection directive remain sound but need to be strengthened and updated in order to better protect the individual right to data protection and make clear to organisations the heavy obligations they take on when they gather and possess the personal information of individuals.<\/p><p>  The regulation also addresses the importance of uniform application of the law within the European Union, not least in order to ensure the free movement of data.  The individual right to protection of personal data that each of us enjoys is rightly at the heart of the Commission's proposals.  Regarding the somewhat bewildering online world, the regulation insists on the need for much greater transparency about what information is being collected from us and how it is being used.  As is appropriate for what is now a fundamental individual right, the proposals aim to give each of us greater control over what happens to our data and the related rights to have the minimum data collected, to have access to our data and to have it corrected, if necessary.  <\/p><p>  Let me turn to issues of direct relevance to data protection authorities such as mine.  The proposed one-stop shop for multinational companies, be they European or non-European, is the subject of significant discussion.  The idea of having a single regulator responsible for oversight of a multinational company is obviously attractive for companies.  Our experience of dealing with multinational companies here suggests it makes sense for a regulator to become very familiar with the business of a particular company, knowing its data protection policies inside out and ensuring these are in compliance with the law.  If the concept is to be acceptable, it is essential that all data protection authorities be willing to rely on the relevant data protection authority to vindicate the rights of all EU citizens, not just those of its own member state.<\/p> <p>For this, it will be essential that the proposed &ldquo;consistency mechanism&rdquo; work as intended to ensure uniform application of the law.  <\/p><p> This issue is of particular importance to us in Ireland for two reasons.  First, many companies providing services for Irish residents, for example, telecommunications and banking services, are European multinationals based in other EU member states.  Under the proposed regulation, oversight of their data protection practices would in future be primarily the responsibility of the data protection authority where they have their main establishment.  Second, many non-EU multinationals, especially US multinationals, have chosen Ireland as a base from which to provide services throughout the European Union.  Under the proposed regulation, oversight of their data processing activities would mainly be the responsibility of our office.<\/p><p> It will be essential that data protection authorities have the resources necessary to carry out their broader European oversight responsibilities.  This is a key issue for us owing to the large number of multinational companies handling personal data that have substantial operations in Ireland.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, has responded by providing additional staff and funding for our office and given a commitment to keep the resourcing of the office actively under review to ensure additional necessary resources will be made available.<\/p><p> I am sure companies will welcome the removal of most routine notification or registration requirements.  This is in exchange for a very strong focus on the responsibility placed on organisations to show to customers and regulators that they are willing to be accountable and demonstrate this through privacy impact assessments, a privacy by design approach, allocating sufficient resources to deal with privacy issues and notifying data breaches when they occur.  <\/p><p> It has long been a complaint from those concerned with data protection that data protection authorities do not have the teeth to enforce the rights of individuals.  It has often been put to me that when cold commercial decisions have to be made on issues such as marketing, the bottom line question is what it is going to cost companies if they do not comply.  The answer - &euro;1 million euro or 2% of worldwide turnover - should cause even the most hardened CEO to have second thoughts about taking risks in this area.  <\/p><p> It is important, of course, that such powers be used sparingly so as not to discourage organisations from seeking guidance from data protection authorities.  In our office we always make it clear that we prefer to help companies to comply rather than have to deal with the consequences of non-compliance.  For the same reason, we have always asked that we be consulted on new laws in order that we can ensure due account is taken of data protection when issues such as data sharing are being considered.  While I am sure companies will be happy with the less prescriptive approach taken in relation to advance notification of processing, they will need to realise that this shifts responsibility squarely onto them, which is where it properly lies.  The regulation is clear that failure to live up to these responsibilities will attract heavy penalties.  <\/p><p> Of course, there are points that may need to be further clarified as the package goes through the legislative process.  There has already been much debate, for example, on issues such as the definition of personal data and the restrictions on the use of consent.  The issue of international transfers of personal data has also recently been to the fore. <\/p><p> I will now deal briefly with the draft directive dealing with law enforcement which is part of the legislative package.  A harmonised set of basic rules applying to the activities of police forces across the European Union has much to commend it.   We must also acknowledge that some exemptions from data protection requirements are necessary to permit the police to do its work in the public interest.  This is already reflected in the exemptions granted to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in our own data protection legislation which otherwise fully applies to the area of law enforcement.  Getting data protection law right is important in order to give concrete expression to the right to protection of our personal data and to do so in a way that does not inhibit innovation in the rapidly changing Internet world in which we live.  <\/p><p> I hope these comments are of assistance to the committee.  I am very happy to answer questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900003#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Billy Hawkes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381307700,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hawkes for his very informative presentation.

I understand officials from the European Commission recently met US diplomats to discuss this issue.  However, it is not solely a matter for the United States, as there are other countries involved, too.  At the recent Dublin summit MEPs were almost unanimous in expressing their concern that data harvesting had been conducted on EU citizens who were not involved in any criminal activity.  Does the Data Protection Commissioner have views or observations on these issues in the context of EU law?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900004#D00200","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381307700,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his very pertinent questions.  On the question regarding biometric passports, the collection of biometric identifiers is an important issue in the context of data protection.  It comes down to the core issue of the extent to which the State is entitled to demand personal data from us in order to pursue or ensure a particular public interest.  In the case of passports, the argument for using biometric data is to improve the quality of passports in terms of avoiding people presenting false passports or tampering with them.  There have been some well documented cases of Irish passports being misused in different contexts.  This is particularly important in the context of preventing people from crossing borders to commit crime or engage in terrorist activity.  There is an obvious wish to try to ensure, as far as possible, that the document presented by an individual is genuine and is not being used by someone to cross a border to commit a serious crime, in the worst case scenario, or, in other cases, to evade legitimate immigration controls.  There is a proposal in the draft regulation to treat biometric data as sensitive personal data deserving of special protection.  That is something which many of us would support.<\/p><p>  The second question posed by the Deputy relates to digital fraud and the very legitimate concerns about the amount of fraud and crime being committed, particularly on the Internet.  It is an area in which there is a constant struggle between increasingly sophisticated criminals and our much put-upon law enforcement authorities.  The international effort to combat such crime is underpinned by the Convention on Cybercrime which quite a number of EU member states have ratified, although I gather it is still under consideration by Ireland.  Crucially, it involves an effort to combat some of the most sophisticated criminals operating and to provide law enforcement authorities with the tools required to deal with such crime, but to do so in a way that does not interfere excessively with the rest of us who are not committing crimes on the Internet.  <\/p><p>  To some extent, this issue relates to the Deputy's third question about the mass surveillance of individuals in the pursuit of law enforcement and anti-terrorism objectives.  While that issue has arisen most recently in the context of US Government activity in this area, it is important to remember that it is also very much a European issue.  There is, for example, at European level, a data retention directive to which each member state has been obliged to give effect.  It obliges all telecommunications companies to retain details of mobile phone calls and their location.<\/p> <p>The purpose of this retention is to permit law enforcement authorities to have access to such information when they are pursuing crime.  Obviously, there have been some examples in Ireland where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has successfully prosecuted people based on information obtained on the location of a person when an alleged crime was committed.  It is an issue that is being dealt with as a political issue between the European Union and the United States.<\/p><p> There is a question about achieving a proper balance between the right of the majority who do not commit any crime to have their privacy respected and, on the other hand, the challenges facing governments and the pressures on them from their citizens to protect them from terrorists who use the Internet to communicate for nefarious purposes.  Where that balance should lie is an issue of much concern to us in Europe, as the data retention directive shows, as it is to the United States.  This is quite apart from the well known fact that European intelligence agencies engage in similar practices to those revealed in the United States.  From a strictly data protection point of view, it concerns the issue of access by law enforcement authorities or intelligence services to the data of the innocent majority versus the public value of protecting us from terrorism.  I do not come to the committee with any solution in this regard.  It is essentially a political discussion about where that balance should lie.  It is for parliaments to make this decision.  The committee will have observed the ongoing extensive discussion in the United States on where the proper balance should lie within its system.<\/p><p> In the case of the data retention directive, there are challenges, including one from Ireland, to the European Court of Justice about the proportionality of the measure.  Those of us concerned with data protection hope the recent revelation on the US side will lead to greater public and parliamentary consciousness that there is an issue to be dealt with and a balance to be struck between competing public interests.  Many of us consider the balance is being struck on the wrong side of the line in protecting individuals.  Ultimately, this is an issue for governments and parliaments to resolve in the interests of their citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900004#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Billy Hawkes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381308300,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hawkes for his thorough overview of the directives.  What is the likely timeline for the adoption of the package and, then, its implementation into Irish law?<\/p><p>  In the context of the surveillance carried out by the United States and EU member states, I am concerned by two aspects of the right to privacy.  The first is the right to be forgotten, the right to demand the deletion of data.  The proposed regulation states, &ldquo;controllers have to take reasonable steps to delete data, taking into account available technology and the means available to the controller&rdquo;.  Is this adequately enforceable?<\/p><p>  The second aspect is that of consent, a thorny issue.  In the new regulation the Commission states that whenever consent is required for data processing, it will have to be given explicitly rather than be assumed.

The objective is to have the legislative package approved by next May when the European Parliament elections will take place.  The Deputy will be aware from the address by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, of the efforts he deployed during the Irish EU Presidency to push the package through and significant progress was made.  I am assured by those who know the system, including my colleague Mr. O'Dwyer, the deputy commissioner, who is just back from Brussels, that the challenge of getting this through purely on technical grounds by next May is significant.  It will require a significant political push both in the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament to get the package through, taking into account the significant differences that still remain on key issues about the package.<\/p><p>  It has always been recognised that the so-called &ldquo;right to be forgotten&rdquo; is a slogan.  Giving it concrete expression is more challenging.  The concept is understood as the idea, particularly in the world of the Internet, that one should have some sense of control over information on oneself.  In concrete terms, what this boils down to is, first, a requirement on organisations to limit the collection of data.  Clearly, there is written into the regulation, as there is in existing law, an obligation to only collect information that is necessary to deliver a service.<\/p><p>  A second issue concerns the retention of data.  In other words, one should only retain personal data for as long as is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected in the first place.  The third issue concerns the right to request the deletion of data where one believes there is no reason to hold on to it.  As the Minister made clear in his presentation, much as one would like it, one does not have the right to have one&rsquo;s criminal record erased.  It will not go that far.  However, the Oireachtas will be considering spent convictions legislation which has the objective of giving people the chance to move on after they have met their debt to society.  In practice, once one is reported in a newspaper, there will always be a record of what one may have done.  The challenges in this area are significant.<\/p><p>  A particular challenge is presented by the idea that where the data were originally collected by one organisation but have been replicated across the Internet, how far can one realistically expect action to be taken to delete all traces of them.  It is a difficult challenge.  Within data protection law it is about maintaining the existing principles of minimising the collection of data, deleting the data when they are no longer required and then making reasonable efforts to respond to requests for deletion of data both by the original organisation and where they may have been replaced.<\/p><p>  The concept in Europe is that we have the right to control the collection of our personal data.  The issue of consent goes to the heart of the fact that data protection is a fundamental right.  What it means in different contexts is a difficult issue.  On the one hand, one wants to have the right respected by giving us full control over what data are collected and used in important issues.  On the other, there are other cases where, if one insisted on data protection being used in dealing with Internet advertising or website pop-ups that occur every second, data protection would become more unpopular than it already is in some circles.  There is a balance to be struck in this regard, recognising that there are other interests involved.  For example, the State has a right to collect information on one&rsquo;s income, regardless of whether one likes it.  Accordingly, there is no issue of consent when dealing with the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>There is an increasing tendency for the State to insist on its right to access data.  That is a balance issue for parliamentarians rather than for me to consider.  It is a difficult issue.<\/p><p> The new resolution maintains the idea that consent is a very important legal basis but not the only one.  It also maintains that there can be a legitimising of data collection when there is a public interest involved, as when the law lays down that one must give details of one's income to the Revenue Commissioners, one must give relevant details to the State if one seeks means-tested benefits, etc.  Although it is controversial, there is also a recognition in the new law, as there was in the existing directive, that an organisation can also assert that it has a legitimate interest in using one's information to pursue its own commercial interests, but there is a balancing test, so the legitimate interests of an organisation are balanced against one's right to data protection.<\/p><p> Stepping back from the details of the law, data protection has always been a set of principles to be applied in particular contexts.

The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has expressed concerns on the rights of workers and the exchange of data between employers.  In its document it refers to the right to establish a workplace data protection committee.  There are issues such as the analysis of social media data and the use of GPS to see where workers are.

Arising from that, it asserts the right to insist that when the data of European citizens is transferred outside the EU it should continue to be protected.  Various mechanisms are provided in both the existing law and the planned law to provide for that.  There is a balance to be struck in this area because, again, in the Internet world in which we operate our data tends to flow all around the place.  At one moment it could be in a data centre in Ireland but ten seconds later it could be in a data centre in Japan or the US.<\/p><p>  This issue has come very much the fore regarding the issue Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny raised, because in recognition of the significant economic relationship between the EU and the US, a special deal was done when the original data protection directive entered into force, called safe harbour.  This provides that the EU will recognise that data transferred to the US is adequately protected if the company concerned signs up to the safe harbour principles, which are essentially EU data protection principles.  By doing that they bring themselves under the jurisdiction of the US Federal Trade Commission, which has very strong enforcement powers and has taken enforcement action against a number of major companies because, <i>inter alia<\/i>, they have not complied with the obligations they signed up to under safe harbour.<\/p><p>  From an Irish perspective we recognise particularly the number of US multinationals we have here and the importance to their business that there be a free flow of data between their Irish subsidiaries and US headquarters, balanced against the rights of Irish and European citizens to insist that their data be protected.  From our experience the majority of companies take their responsibilities under safe harbour very seriously.  Signing up to safe harbour involves a careful examination of a company's data protection practices across its different activities and subsidiaries.  For those companies that treat it seriously it is a demanding issue for them.  In general we find the US multinationals we deal with have a very strong approach to compliance and their obligations under safe harbour.<\/p><p>  Whereas there is pressure on the safe harbour system because of the fact of access by US intelligence and law enforcement to some data, there is the opposite economic argument in terms of free flow of data.  The new regulation tries to maintain this balance between the need to protect the rights of European citizens when data goes outside the country - various mechanisms are proposed for that which are very similar to the existing mechanisms - and recognising that in the Internet-driven world data must flow for commercial reasons.<\/p><p>  The two other questions related to the rights of trade union members.  They are very valid points.  European data protection law gives workers rights in the workplace.  We are regularly involved in the vindicating those rights, including in the specific areas the Deputy mentioned, particularly GPS tracking.  Our website provides guidance that GPS tracking is for tracking vehicles, not individuals.  In the workplace one continues to have rights under European law, so in the case of social media use, for example, it is important that workers know exactly what the limits are, whether they are not allowed to use social media and the extent of those limits.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned profiling, which the new regulation addresses specifically.  There is a need to be careful about the profiling of individuals to avoid putting people into boxes where they may not belong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900006#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Billy Hawkes"},{"type":"speech","time":1381308900,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Hawkes.

In the case of states, there is the analysis of patterns.  An example would be the big data held by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection, the biggest data holders in the State.  This operates in analysing patterns of behaviour to detect wrong behaviour, where people might be evading tax in the case of Revenue, or where they might be defrauding the system in the case of the Department of Social Protection.

We forwarded our powerpoint presentation and comments on the submission.<\/p><p>  In view of the time limit I will comment only on the most important points in our submission.  In the second slide, Olympic Entertainment Group is a publicly listed company, celebrating its 20th anniversary and operates in seven different jurisdictions.  The group has 20 years experience of operating casinos in central and eastern Europe.  As a publicly listed company we must respect the standards and accept responsibility for complying with the conditions on licensing, compliance, responsibility and transparency.  These are the core values on which we base our submission.<\/p><p>  The third slide summarises the four key areas for discussion.  The most important consideration is that gaming is conducted in a safe and controlled environment.  What I mean is that regulating casinos is a small part of the gambling business.  The gaming industry has developed so fast that the type of gaming changes.  It does not matter whether it is an online casino, a casino or gaming arcades, it is important that all regulations are applicable for all the gaming. <\/p><p>  Gambling can be a problem in the gaming industry.  We as casino operators are aware of the problems.  I believe most respected casino operators want to limit problem gambling.  This is crucial.  We have established measures of decreasing problem gambling in society.  In Estonia we have initiated the introduction of a self exclusion ban and I can refer to public services in Estonia.  When one puts oneself on a self exclusion list one cannot withdraw the application.  I think this is one of the drivers of reducing the gambling addiction problem in Estonia in the past three or four years. <\/p><p>  We deal with problem gambling, not only in the casino but with online gaming or slot arcades.  This is definitely necessary.  Based on our experience in Estonia, we have nationwide centrally controlled self-exclusion lists which applies to online as well as land based casinos.<\/p><p>  The third area is about gaming equipment limitations.  Under the current wording the maximum number of gaming tables is set at 15 and the maximum number of slot machines is limited to 25 in a casino.<\/p> <p>In contrast, there are no limitations on gaming arcades or on minimum bets or maximum wins for other sorts of gaming.  We believe it is necessary to regulate to make the sector equally transparent and fully controllable.  I recommend, based on the European standards and the proven setup of casinos, that 15 tables is okay but there should be five to seven slot machines per gaming table.  Therefore, casinos would need to be a little bit larger, have more investment and provide much nicer products in order to attract experienced and larger casino companies to invest in Ireland.  Let me give an example.  In each of the countries in which we have set up, we have flagship casinos with approximately 15 tables and between 100 and 140 slot machines, following investment worth &euro;10 million, and we employ at least 200 people.  I recommend the same format for Ireland. <\/p><p> The last matter is on regulation and how alcohol is treated in casinos.  It is a myth that when people drink they lose control of their gambling.  My colleague Mr. Geoff Taylor can comment on what happened in the UK where the serving of alcohol was originally prohibited but its introduction has had no negative effect on gaming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900009#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Madis J&auml;&auml;ger","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381311300,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I remind the delegation that we are against time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900010#M00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381311300,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I shall be brief.

I will give a brief overview of the Licensed Gaming Association of Ireland's observations and proposals on the Bill.<br \/><b><\/b>The members of the Licensed Gaming Association of Ireland are all holders of current gaming licences and court certificates.  They all operate in areas where Part 3 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 has been adopted.  My firm has represented clients in the sector for many years.  Recently it has been involved in substantial cases where the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 was an issue.  In 2012 there were 57 licensed premises throughout Ireland, which were mainly located in holiday, leisure and seaside locations.  In most cases the businesses have been family-run for several generations and are part of the commercial fabric of these locations.  Practically all of the businesses comprise the same traditional model of two segregated business offerings.  One is a family amusement area that is open to children and adults alike while the other is a gaming area that is restricted to over 18s.  The committee should note that one does not get a gaming licence unless one supplies amusements in the same building, so that is a matter of legislation.<\/p><p>  The family amusement area machines can be split into two main categories.  First, there are pure amusement machines such as video shooting games, car simulator and video games, pool, air hockey, table soccer and pinball.  Second, there are amusements with prize machines such as prize cranes, skill prize games, quiz prize games and redemption machines.  All of the members will have seen these amusements and will be familiar with them.  In the gaming area the machines are a combination of traditional and electronic slot machines and automatic table games.<\/p><p>  The present regime in Ireland operates under the 1956 Act, as amended.  In order to receive a gaming licence operators must provide a court certificate on an annual basis and the Revenue Commissioners issues the licence.  The requirements are as follows: confirm correct zoning and planning for the operation; apply, receive and adhere to opening and closing hours; confirm that an annual inspection by a fire officer has been carried out - the same as a public house - and confirm compliance to the court; provide the court with a complete listing of the number and type of machines available for play; hold a tax clearance certificate; pay &euro;505 per machine per annum, plus a premises licence of &euro;630 for each premises; provide amusement facilities in addition to gaming; provide confirmation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a licence has been operated in the previous 12 months in the correct manner; provide satisfaction to the general public that the licence has been operated in the correct manner in the previous 12 months; and place advertisements of the application in the newspapers circulated in the area to allow public objections.<\/p><p>  The association has compiled a detailed submission that addresses particular heads of the Bill and I shall restate some of them.  The first one is on security of tenure.  The Bill envisages examining the situation and makes no provision for the continuation of existing long-standing businesses.  The LGAI views the initiative as entirely inappropriate because it does not take into consideration past and present participation and investment of the licensed proprietors of gaming or amusement arcades.  The Bill opens up a number of uncertain possibilities, in many cases without the possibility of participation or objective challenge.  Some parts of the legislation might well be a disproportionate interference with the right to work on private property.  We propose that there should be recognition of the existing licensed proprietors and their investment in the business.<\/p><p>  We submit that appropriate arrangements should be provided to ensure a smooth transition to the new licensing regime.   Some of the gaming machines around the country have been licensed for many years.  They are a source of income and employment for a large number of people.  We maintain that constitutional and EU-protected proprietary rights have been established that cannot be taken away except in certain circumstances that are in the public interest and on payment of appropriate compensation.<\/p><p>  As I have already explained, under the existing Act one is obliged by law to provide amusement.  In other words, if one is supplying gaming one must also provide amusement machines.  The new Act proposes to exclude amusements from a gaming premises, a measure opposed by the LGAI.  In past decades it has been a legal requirement for the granting of a gaming licence that amusement machines be operated on the same premises as gaming.  They have been and are traditionally separated from each other, as age restriction is relevant.  For the reasons set out in section 5 of the submission, it is proposed that existing and future gaming licence holders be obliged to operate a supervised access controlled doorway to separate amusement and gaming areas.  Also, any new arrangements would be implemented for future premises as part of the planning process.<\/p><p>  With regard to opening hours, we submit that the proposed times are too restrictive.  The current operating times for a 2A licence are from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m.  We suggest that regime should continue for existing licence holders.  The times are already licensed by the court, with strict examination and regulation.  The times are adhered to by the licensed operators and the business model has been scaled to these times in recent decades.  It is also important to note that the critical timeframe of 11 p.m. to 2 a.m., especially on weekend nights, is pivotal for the commercial viability of the industry.  Additionally, the fact that the main commercial competition comes from the operation of the same machines online 24 hours a day should be taken into consideration.  We also propose that the closing time for a 2B licence should be 10.30 p.m. all year round, with the additional facility to grant a seasonal extension to allow for festivals and other activities associated with holiday, leisure or seaside locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900010#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Galvin"},{"type":"speech","time":1381311300,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I apologise for the interruption, but the allotted time has been exceeded.

The LGAI opposes the proposed promotion regime because there should be no possibility of direct contact.

The Ais&eacute;ir&iacute; group established in Cahir, County Tipperary in 1983, has primary addiction treatment centres in counties Tipperary, Wexford and Kilkenny and a halfway house in Waterford.  We are pleased to be invited to place our views and experience in working with problem and pathological gamblers to the committee.<\/p><p>  Ais&eacute;ir&iacute; has two adult treatment centres in Wexford and Tipperary and the Aislinn Adolescent Education Centre in Ballyragget, County Kilkenny, which works with 15 to 21 year olds, male and female.  The adult centres take 12 residents over a four week residential treatment programme and the adolescent centre works over a six week residential treatment programme.  Since its foundation in 1983, Ais&eacute;ir&iacute; has been working with problem gamblers using the 12 step recovery programme.  This programme has proved successful for hundreds of thousands of people suffering from alcohol, drugs and gambling addictions.  The most important issue about the 12 step programme lies in the fact that it works.  <\/p><p>  However, due to the changing and challenging nature of problem gambling, including Internet and gambling on social media sites, we have developed individual treatment plans based on the gambling clients' pathway model.  We try to follow best practice in the area and, therefore, offer value for money in terms of a better treatment episode for all those presenting with a gambling problem.  We assess using recognised assessment tools such as the South Oaks Gambling Screen and the diagnostic statistical manual, DSM 5 of the American Psychiatric Association.  We are happy that the gambling Bill includes treatment, education and research.  Ais&eacute;ir&iacute; will conduct its own research on past and current residents in a two year period 2012 to 2013 and present it to the Department in early 2014.  We hope it will assist in the final legislation.<\/p><p>  We recommend that education on the dangers of gambling and betting be introduced to all secondary and tertiary education in Ireland, that a prevalence study be carried out to determine numbers and those in danger of moving from social gambling to problem gambling.  During the past few years, and certainly since the financial crisis in Ireland, we have witnessed an increase in those presenting with a gambling problem.  The financial implications for a pathological gambler and his family are for the main part long term placing a huge burden on both those suffering from this insidious addiction and their families.<\/p><p>  We would like to work with all concerned including the gaming and betting industry in helping the problem gambler.  We need to work together and the provision of a statutory framework and a fund as is the case in the United Kingdom is to be welcomed.  For far too long gambling has been seen as the poor relation of the other addictions currently affecting Irish society, this is alcohol and drugs.  It destroys as many, if not more lives.  Research suggests a higher rate of suicide among problem gamblers than in the other addictions I have mentioned.<\/p><p>  Gambling has been called the hidden addiction and those of us working at Ais&eacute;ir&iacute; have witnessed at first hand the devastation wrought by gambling.  We agree with the compulsory training of staff in terms of recognising the incidence of potential problem gambling with their customers.  This alone may help in the reduction of pathological gamblers as we recognise that a small cohort of the gaming and betting industry's customers contribute a disproportionate amount of their profits.<\/p><p>  We have gained invaluable experience in working with problem and pathological gamblers across our adult and adolescent centres and have previously conducted research among adolescent gamblers and with members of Gamblers Anonymous.  Both of these studies are available at <i>academia.org<\/i> and were sent to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We hope to be in a position to offer a day programme for problem gamblers in 2014, as not everyone can avail of a four week long residential treatment episode and costs remain a hindering factor for those seeking help.<\/p><p>  I avail of the opportunity to thank the committee for the invitation and wish it the best in its endeavours to complete the gambling Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900011#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Mullins"},{"type":"speech","time":1381311900,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mullins for his presentation and staying within the time limit.

We welcome the opportunity to emphasise some of our key concerns regarding the general scheme of the gambling control Bill 2013.  This issue affects not only Rehab but all the other charitable lotteries.  I am aware the Association of Charity Lotteries in Ireland has made its own submission.<\/p><p>  The Rehab Group operates Ireland's largest charitable lottery and we are particularly alarmed about proposals included in the scheme in relation to such lotteries.  We believe that the implementation of current proposals would result in the complete elimination of charities from the lottery marketplace, because of the preferential and discriminatory position afforded to the national lottery.  This will increase dependence on Exchequer funding and increase charities' reliance on other types of fund-raising, which have also been seriously impacted by the recession.<\/p><p>  During the past three decades the impact of the national lottery on Rehab's lottery activities has been catastrophic, due to the unfair legislative regime currently in place.  In 1987, Rehab held a strong 25% share of the lottery market.  In 1989, following two years of operation by the national lottery, our market share had dropped to just 5%.  Today our market share is just 1%, the national lottery being 98% and all other charity lotteries combined share that remaining 1%.<\/p><p>  In 1996, following many years of negotiations with the charitable lottery sector, the Government introduced the charitable lottery compensation fund.  This recognised the inability of charity lotteries to compete with the national lottery as a result of the severe restrictions created by the cap on prize funds provided for under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  No restrictions apply to the prize funds of the national lottery.<\/p><p>  In 2012, the Government took the shocking decision, without consultation, to phase out the charitable lotteries compensation fund.  In this context, a complete removal of the cap on prize funds of charity lotteries would be the only correct and legal approach.  However, the proposed general scheme continues to place an absurdly low cap on the prizes which can be distributed by charitable lotteries.  It limits the monthly prize fund to &euro;400,000 while the national lottery can offer unlimited prizes and has offered weekly prize funds of up to &euro;190 million, through the Euromillions lottery.  The new proposed limit of &euro;1,750 of a top prize on scratch cards will have a particularly catastrophic impact on charitable lotteries as it reduces the current prize fund limit by 82.5% and will render them entirely unattractive to consumers and, therefore, uncompetitive in the lottery marketplace.<\/p><p>  In the absence of a fair and reasonable charitable lottery compensation fund, we urge the committee to recommend that the cap on prize funds be removed entirely, to ensure fair competition and to prevent abuse of dominance in the marketplace by the national lottery.  This is an issue which we believe must be rectified before the sale of the national lottery is completed.<\/p><p>  The proposed scheme further exacerbates issues in regard to competition in the marketplace by failing to recognise the size of lotteries in its requirements for a minimum charitable contribution.  We propose that the proceeds of a lottery be defined in terms of net gaming revenue - the money that the charity actually receives after the payment of prizes.  This is the approach which has been adopted for the national lottery.  A rising scale of charitable contribution would ensure that the bigger the lottery, the greater the percentage paid to good causes.<\/p><p>  We have grave concerns about the structures which will underpin the regulation of gambling and lottery activities in Ireland.  Instead of the establishment of an office, located within the Minister's Department, to oversee a small number of gambling and lottery activities, we propose the establishment of a specific regulatory authority, with an independent board, which is fully transparent and beyond political influence, charged with overseeing the operation of all gambling and lottery activities in Ireland.  Unfortunately, it is the case that, in the absence of a fair and reasonable charitable lottery compensation fund and, in light of the current proposals to continue to cap prize funds for charitable lotteries, the future of charitable lotteries is very bleak.<\/p> <p>It is likely that many of the legislative proposals provided for in head 19 will quickly become obsolete as this anti-competitive legislation fully eliminates the ability of the charity lotteries to compete in the marketplace, and therefore their ability to operate at all, thereby creating an absolute monopoly for the national lottery.<\/p><p> We would like to thank the committee for its attention and will be pleased to answer any questions members may have.  My colleague, Mr. Frank Flannery, may wish to add a further comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900011#N00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Kerins","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381312500,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I have nothing to add, but would reiterate the key point that from our point of view this is strange legislation, although it is long overdue as the 1956 Act is obsolete and unfit for purpose.

Outcome from lotteries supplemented an started much of the good causes which developed in Ireland over the past 60 years.

However, to use a phrase borrowed from head 33, page 43 of the general scheme document, there is a serious disparity in the matter of &ldquo;equality of arms&rdquo; for organisations such as ours in engaging with Government on this issue in comparison with the vast resources that the off-course betting industry has up to now committed, and will continue to commit into the future, in its efforts to ensure that legislation is structured in a way that favours the profit and greed driven objectives of most, but not all, of its members, to the detriment of not only the poor and vulnerable members of society but of society in general. <\/p><p>  The off-course betting industry would like to think of itself as well regulated.  However, one of its most senior executives and founder of a major bookmaker enterprise has stated that over the years it has been able to drive a coach and four through the Betting Act 1931, helped in no small measure by the inability of an unresourced Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to monitor and enforce the 1931 Act.  Bet Beware believes that unless the legislation is rigid in structure and the OGCI monitors the industry in a comprehensive and detailed manner, a coach and four will be driven through this new legislation by the off course betting industry.<\/p><p>  I would like to comment on some of the heads of the Bill.  Head 1 deals with the definition of a bet.   \"Bet\" needs to be defined in more precise detail for the protection of users of betting services and, in particular, in the interests of fairness and transparency.  The definition could be: &ldquo;a bet is a wager made on an event to be decided in the future&rdquo;.  It is important that &ldquo;decided in the future&rdquo; should be part of the definition.  It is universally accepted that a bet is a wager made on an event that is decided in the future rather than commenced or started in the future.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, the definition of &ldquo;betting&rdquo; should exclude any reference to virtual events.  Serious doubts exist about the integrity and fairness of virtual events.  The result is known before the event takes place, that is before the event is concluded or finished.  There have been instances in the past year alone where results of these virtual events have been shown on television screens in betting shops, before the advertised time of the event.  Bet Beware believes that there should be a prohibition on virtual events in the new legislation and that this prohibition should not be considered for repeal until such time as the OGCI has undertaken a detailed investigation into all aspects of  virtual events.<\/p><p>  The definition of &ldquo;fixed odds betting terminals&rdquo; needs to be examined specifically so as to eliminate all possible loopholes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900012#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1381312500,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I must interrupt for a moment.

We currently represent both gaming arcades licensed under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 and amusement arcades which are licensed by the Revenue under the Finance Act 1992.  Today, I will deal with some of the headings of the proposed legislation that affect our sector, but we have submitted a more comprehensive submission to the committee which members may look at later.<\/p><p>  Under head 1, which deals with definitions and interpretation, we are a little concerned about the proposed definition of an \"amusement hall\" or \"amusement arcade\", which refers to any covered area having amusement machines only and which is open to young persons as well as adults.  Our concern is that under the present planning regulations, an amusement arcade allows, and is described under SI 600 of 2001 of the planning and development regulations, as a premises for the playing of gaming machines, amusement machines or other video games.  If this proposed specific definition is to included in the Bill, it would mean that every arcade in the country would have to reapply for planning permission if it opts to be a gaming arcade.  I suggest that when the OGCI issues licences to either an amusement arcade or a gaming arcade, the licence should stipulate precisely what the operator is entitled to have at that premises and that licence should be displayed where it is visible to the public.  In other words, it would not interfere with the existing planning regulations or with the planning for existing premises.<\/p><p>  We have no great difficulty with regard to the definition of an \"amusement machine\".  However, we would ask that the words \"or by use of credits\" be dropped from that particular definition.  The reason for this is that an amusement machine is a low stake machine.<\/p> <p>We do not think there is any need for the use of credits in a low stake amusement machine - one with a low payout or a payout of what is known as nugatory value - under the terms of this Bill.  The opposite would apply in respect of the definition of a gaming machine.  We believe that the terminology on the use of credits could be inserted into the definition of a gaming machine.  There would probably be a greater cashflow in the operation of a gaming arcade rather than an amusement arcade, and the use of credits would probably result in less money being in machine boxes.  From the point of view of security, money management and so on, that would be of help to the operators of gaming arcades.<\/p><p> Head 2 deals with commencement, transition and Short Title.  This point was mentioned by Mr. Galvin of the Licensed Gaming Association of Ireland, who stated that section 2(2)(vi), which states, <i>inter alia<\/i>, &quot;Having a betting or gaming licence (a) immediately prior to the time of commencement, or (b) at that time&quot; would not automatically entitle a person to the renewal of a license.  While we accept that this is the norm in any application for a new licence under most existing legislation, and while we did not expect otherwise in the new Bill, we would draw the committee's attention to recommendation 18 of the report Regulating Gambling in Ireland, which reads: &quot;The Committee recommends that in the development of a new regulatory regime careful consideration be given to the status of amusement halls currently licensed under the 1956 Act.&quot;  We believe that the spirit of that statement should also apply to arcades formerly licensed under the 1956 Act and now licensed by the Revenue Commissioners under the Finance Act 1992.  This is particularly the case when we consider that of the 114 local authorities, only 43 operate the 1956 Act.  This is important because gaming is currently regulated in this State by two distinct Acts which contradict each other - namely, the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, which applies to approximately 60 arcades, depending on whether it is high or low season, covering about 6,000 machines in 43 local authority areas, and the Finance Act 1992, which applies to about 100 arcades containing about 7,000 machines in 71 local authority areas.  The 1992 Act is in total contradiction to the 1956 Act and our association had that discussion with the Department of Finance back in 1992.  There was a dispute about it between ourselves and the Revenue Commissioners in 2001.  The dispute went the whole way to the High Court and we were in and out of that court between 2001 and 2003.  One hundred and seventy thousand euro later - &euro;70,000 from our side and I assume the same amount on the Revenue side - when the Finance Act 2003 came in, it reinstated the relevant sections of that Act, which brought us exactly back to 1992.  In 2013, we are now still where we were in 1992, with two Acts completely contradicting each other, which is of service to absolutely nobody.<\/p><p> The solution to the problem is contained in the framework document.  If the recommendations in the framework document for the application of the new Gambling Control Bill 2013 apply nationwide under the normal rules, regulations and criteria that are laid down, those endemic problems which have existed for more than 20 years will be solved.  If this Bill is enacted by the Oireachtas, it will be easily enforceable because it will be quite transparent, it will be socially acceptable as it will be guaranteed to be fair to the customer, and it will also be economically viable, which is very important to us.<\/p><p> I would like to talk about the number of machines in the country.  We must deal with this as well.  It has been mentioned that there could be 20,000 machines in unlicensed venues.  We do not believe that is the case.  The figure of 20,000 does not take into consideration the 7,000 machines that operate under the 1992 Act - we call them the 1992 arcades - nor the couple of thousand machines that are down at any given time for storage or seasonal reasons.  We accept that there are possibly as many as 5,000 machines moving around the country and being put into takeaways, hackney offices, the back rooms of pubs and so on.  However, if the recommendations of the framework document on licensing are taken on board, then all people who deal with the handling of machines - distributors, suppliers and so on -  will be included and we will hopefully solve that particular problem completely.<\/p><p> We are in total agreement with the establishment of the social fund.  We probably have some views as to how it should be applied.  We also have some views on the advisory committee.  We hope that the provisions on the hours of business will become an operational matter rather than a policy matter, so that every application to the OGCI for a licence would be treated on its merits, as is the case currently with applications to the District Court under the 1956 Act, and the OGCI would decide on the basis of the information supplied and the reaction of the local authorities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na what hours would apply to the individual arcade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900012#O00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Roche","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381313100,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Thank you very much for that.

Mr. O'Connell and I are here on behalf of Mr. Richard Quirke, who has a 30 year involvement in the gaming sector in Ireland.  We wish to address the committee on just one aspect of the heads of this Bill.  Under the heads of the Bill as they currently stand, there is no prospect of the licensing of a resort casino in Ireland.  When we refer to a resort casino, we are talking about a casino that is part of a dedicated entertainment complex that may involve hotels, restaurants, a spa, conference facilities, an equestrian centre and so on.  Under the heads of the Bill as they currently stand, such a resort casino cannot be licensed.  The proposed regulator would not have the power to do so.  The mechanism for that restriction is under head 18 of the Bill, which places a limiting restriction on the number of gaming tables allowed in a casino and the number of gaming machines.  Head 18 states that one single casino can have 15 gaming tables and up to 25 gaming machines.  If the legislation goes through with that restriction, we will have a restriction in Ireland that exists nowhere else in Europe at the moment apart from Cyprus.  While we do not say it is a mistake to stand alone on an issue, we say it is a mistake when that stance is against the international evidence and policy on casinos.  We say it is a mistake when that stance is against home-grown policy put down in a detailed report less than three years ago by the Department itself, following on from another report in 2008 which recommended that the licensing regime allow for resort casinos.  We also say that it is a mistake when that prohibition seems to go against the very spirit and idea behind the legislation.<\/p><p>  The idea behind that legislation is that all kinds of gambling environment can be licensed, but they are to be subject to extreme scrutiny in terms of applicants, applications and ongoing regulation, which we welcome.  What we cannot welcome is the arbitrary selection of resort casinos as the only type of gambling that cannot be licensed under this Act.  When we look for a reason this might be the case, we come up empty.<\/p> <p>In terms of resource casinos, it is well accepted in international practice, and also, as I say, in the home-grown policy that we have, that there are, possibly, alone among types of gambling, social benefits to be obtained from resort casinos.  There is the tax revenue that is to be had from it; considerable licensing revenue when there is an operation of that scale; but, more important, the considerable economic benefits that come from the setting up of a resort casino in a particular locality.  The committee will have Appendix 2, the more detailed submission that we have submitted, that shows the evidence from the United Kingdom and the United States of resort casinos being used as an instrument of social policy because of what they bring.  When they set up in a particular locality, there is massive capital investment and significant employment opportunities are developed that are there at the construction stage and ongoing.  I refer the committee to the fact that this is not notional.  In the case of the north Tipperary venue which has recently gone through the planning process, these figures have acquired some reality.  It is estimated that, for a period of five to seven years of construction, there would be 800 construction jobs in it and, ongoing, there would be expected to be 1,300 jobs and, furthermore, a development of approximately 500 jobs in the locality as a result.  These are real benefits.<\/p><p> We are not blind to the fact, very eloquently put by Ais&eacute;ir&iacute;, that there are costs and risks associated with gambling, but we respectfully submit that those risks are less attendant with resort casinos than with other types of gambling.  The risks, I suppose, could be divided into three categories - compulsive gambling issues; disproportionate effects on poorer areas; and a criminality issue.<\/p><p> With compulsive gambling, we submit that a resort casino, which, of its nature, involves not only gambling but many other entertainment options, is not the natural recourse of somebody who wants to engage in compulsive gambling.  A resort casino is more of a leisure activity.  We are not saying that it would never happen in a resort casino but what we are saying is that responsible casino owners in a resort casino can take steps, and would have steps imposed on them by regulation, to ensure that they have the procedures in place to spot issues and that they take steps to ameliorate and mitigate any such issues.<\/p><p> Although I realise my time is coming to an end, I wish to address the position in Ireland with disproportionate effects on poorer people.  That is a serious issue - however, I really wonder how seriously we take it in this country - where the national lottery is all pervasive.  There are outlets for the national lottery on every street.  There are bookies on every street corner.  The national lottery is advertised as a way to transform one's life.  In these circumstances, where these are convenience ways to gamble, it is our submission that these, in fact, hit the lower economic group much more than a resort casino where one must get in a car and plan one's trip and one is going to a place where it is not just gambling.  I refer the committee to the appendices where there is hard evidence on those who frequent resort casinos.<\/p><p> Lastly, searching around for a reason for this arbitrary exclusion of resort casinos, we come up empty.  It seems to be an aesthetic objection.  It seems to be an objection to the scale of the physical building which is difficult to understand in a country such as Ireland, where there is a well-developed planning process and in which the north Tipperary venue has gone through that process recently - Mr. O'Connell can speak to that.<\/p><p> My final comment, merely to wrap up, is that we submit respectfully that resort casinos are different.  They have social benefits.  They carry risks like any other type of gambling but, we say, lesser risks and risk that can be mitigated and ameliorated more easily, and for that reason, the restriction in the heads of Bill at present that effectively prohibits them should be taken out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900013#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Yvonne McNamara","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381313700,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I thank everybody for being so co-operative in staying within time.

That means in every other area where gaming is carried on, it is unlicensed by definition.  First, it is a situation which is unacceptable in a rule of law country.  Second, it creates significant inequality for those who pay the licence.  Licensed persons pays &euro;630 per premises and &euro;505 per machine, and they are restricted to hours and other constraints.<\/p><p>  It is a complex area of law.  It will take time for the new Bill to come in.  What is being suggested by the LGAI is that one would even the playing field in the meantime.  One could not license those who are not licensed because that would be illegal but one could even the playing field by ensuring a mechanism is put in place by which they comply, for example, one could make arrangements to collect a fee for each machine to go to the Government because there is a loss of, according to one estimate, &euro;9 million.  If, when the Bill comes in, what will happen is that the local authority function will go out of it and there will be no prohibition on gaming <i>per se<\/i> but everyone who can show that gaming would be appropriate in a particular place would be licensed.  Pending that there should be an interim task force to ensure that the Revenue VAT is paid on it, that the machines are in some way regulated and that a licence fee equivalent to that of the licensed persons would be collected for the State.  It would require some small amendments to the existing legislation and would be very much an interim process.

Mr. Roche has mentioned that there are different licences in this regard.  Some of the 20,000 unlicensed machines referred to last week are operated under an amusement licence.  There are two licensing regimes.  As pointed out, to obtain a gaming licence one has to go through a strict regulatory process annually.  An amusement licence is a little different.  It is granted by the Revenue Commissioners and all one needs to obtain such a licence is a tax clearance certificate.  There is no mandatory inspection in regard to the number or type of machines held.  Some of the 20,000 machines referred to are covered by the amusement licence regime.  An issue arises in regard to the siting of machines in takeaways, pubs and so on.  This is a serious issue in the context of accountability, tax payments and so on.  The machine in question may be of such little value that even if Revenue was to remove or seize it, it could be replaced with another one.<\/p><p>  Mr. Roche referred to machines in storage.  I have been involved in the industry for 30 years and my father was involved in it before me.  I am not aware that there are thousands of machines in storage.  In this business people use the machines until they go out of fashion.  When they go out of fashion, they are then sold for the best price or thrown in a skip.  As I said, there are two types of licence in the industry, an amusement licence and a gaming licence.

Arrangements were made between the charity lottery sector and the State to allow the national lottery to develop along the lines it has and the charity lotteries to be compensated in a realistic way for agreeing to it.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party were in government for much of the time, followed by the rainbow coalition made up of the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Democratic Left.  Every party was fully involved and it was 100% agreed to.  It lasted to the satisfaction of all parties until very recently when it was concluded without any discussion or warning in quite a remarkable way, to use the kindest language I can come up with.  As a result, the charity sector faces being squeezed out almost entirely of the sector of which it was one of the great developers in the 1940s and 1950s and much of what has been done since was built on this work.  We find this very hard to take.  If the compensation mechanism which was agreed to by all political parties and operated so satisfactorily for so long will be removed in this way, the provisions for prize caps in the legislation must also go because this was the arrangement which was in place.  We will agree with the price caps to allow the Government to develop what it wants, provided this is done.  This was a business arrangement agreed to on all sides.  I am not saying it was a legal arrangement, but it was a business arrangement with which everyone acquiesced and we do not want it to be pulled away without discussion or comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900016#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Flannery"},{"type":"speech","time":1381314900,"counter":239,"content":"<p>We are having a discussion about it today which will be useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900016#S00600","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381314900,"counter":240,"content":"<p>If there is no compensation, there should be no prize cap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900016#S00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Flannery"},{"type":"speech","time":1381314900,"counter":241,"content":"<p>That is why, I am sure Mr. Flannery will agree, this process is so useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900016#S00800","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1381314900,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Will the delegates outline what it will mean for service delivery if the fund is eliminated and the cap remains in place?

The County Tipperary venue is probably a very good example of a resort casino on an international and European scale and it would probably be useful to indicate what this is.  As it has received planning permission, to a large extent, the aesthetic urban argument is now history.  With regard to the benefits of a resort casino over those of a stand-alone casino, a resort casino merges activities; as such a unique site would no longer be created for the purposes of gambling, as it would be incorporated as a normal piece of entertainment in a much larger setting where there were diversions all the time.<\/p><p>  The County Tipperary venue is set on a site of approximately 1,000 acres and is a very big development.  It has a 350-bed resort casino hotel.  A casino hotel differs from a standard hotel; while it has all of the tourist attractions of a standard hotel, it also contains as part of its core a casino floor.  This is a segregated area on the basis that it is controlled.  There is also an uncontrolled area, as well as many common areas which operate between them.  There are also banqueting and function rooms.  The industry which comes with it is associated with conferences.  As all projects need a specific feature to identify them, in this case it is the fact that James Hogan, the architect of the White House, was born close by.  He was one of the first Irish pure architects and a student of Thomas Ivory, the famous Cork classical architect.  He designed the White House for Washington who intended it to be a banqueting suite to avoid it being characterised as a palace, in which every month 500 citizens of the United States would be banqueted.  This never happened, but it was Washington's intention and the building was designed for this purpose.  Our intention is to replicate the building as it was in 1829 when Hogan died.  It will form an essential part of the resort casino and be one of its key theme areas.<\/p><p>  The resort will also incorporate horse racing and Horse Racing Ireland has endorsed it.  It was seeking an international racecourse to replace the three venues close by in County Tipperary with one major racecourse for Munster.<\/p> <p>That is incorporated, with the support of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, into the project.  We also have Horse Sport Ireland, which has come into it on the equestrian side of horse sport.  There will be an international scale venue for Horse Racing Ireland.  Bord na gCon is also supporting it and there is a back-to-back arrangement with diversity, using the grandstand on one side for a greyhound track and on the other a horse racing facility.  It is a diverse development that is modern and highly flexible.  It is a resort development on the basis that all the infrastructure provided - the supply of water and sorting of drainage, for example - will be the equivalent of a small town in scale.  That is what a resort casino is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900016#S01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381315500,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Could we get back to the heads of the Bill?

Virtual racing was introduced to the market in January 2003 and evidence was given to the committee last week that it was a response to the foot and mouth disease outbreak in the country in 2001.  That is not completely true, as it was introduced in 2003 as a response by the UK bookmakers when they tried to formulate a mechanism to avoid paying a levy on live horse racing to the horse racing levy board in the United Kingdom.  Virtual racing was introduced to the market by a company called 49s Limited, which was wholly owned by the three major bookmaker organisations in the UK.  It was broadcast to the market - as we heard in evidence last week - by a company called Satellite Information Services, SIS, which was almost totally owned by the UK headquartered bookmakers.<\/p><p>  I will read from the 49s Limited virtual racing blurb.  It states: \"Virtual racing is a computer-generated presentation of a horse or greyhound race.  A random number generator determines the first, second, third and the rest of the finishing order after the start of each race.\"  The result is known before the event is over.  It continues, \"All runners have fixed odds that reflect their chance of winning.\"  With this betting proposition, the company promoting it is owned by a bookmaker and the company that broadcasts it is substantially bookmaker-owned.  The result is known at the start of the event and not at the conclusion.<\/p><p>  The advocates of virtual racing would lead us to believe the entire process is supervised and monitored by a firm of auditors.

It was acknowledged by spokespersons for the Government of the day that this was the wrong decision.  The fixed odds betting terminals are acknowledged by many betting observers to be highly addictive, although the betting industry has argued there is no evidence for this and has challenged unresourced voices of concern to produce evidence-based research in this respect.  We argue that the substantially resourced betting industry should provide the evidence-based research that these terminals are not addictive and harmful to individuals in society.<\/p><p>  Based on the audited accounts published by the private limited company bookmakers in the United Kingdom with regard to operations in that district, and not converting the figures from sterling to euro, we estimate that if the terminals were legislated for in Ireland and permitted in betting shops, they would take &euro;150 million in profits out of the Irish economy.

There is an issue legislators must consider relating to what are called late bets and uncollected winnings.  A late bet occurs when a bet is placed by a punter after the advertised off-time of a race.  Despite the fact that almost all betting shops have the most technologically advanced EPOS, electronic point of sale, systems in their shops which print out the time the bet is placed by the hour, minute and second - this information is printed on the customer's receipt - the technology apparently does not extend to the rejection of late bets at the time the punter attempts to place them.  This is very convenient for the industry, because the first time the punter knows that his or her bet of &euro;2 or &euro;10 is late is when they go to the counter to present their receipt and ask for their &euro;22 winnings.  They are then told the bet was late for payment, that they will not be paid any winnings and their &euro;2 or &euro;10 is returned.  Their money will be repaid but they will not be paid any winnings.  Interestingly, this phenomenon of punters not being paid on allegedly late bets appears to be particularly prevalent with bets placed on virtual racing.<\/p><p>  The majority of punters lose.  That is a fact.  It was said in evidence last week that the off-course industry gives back approximately 87% of what it takes in.  That is correct.  However, that does not mean that 87% of the people who gamble in betting shops get their money back.  In fact, the vast majority of that 87% goes to the people who are clever and know what they are doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013100900018#U01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1381316100,"counter":284,"content":"<p>To return to the heads of the Bill, how are we dealing with this in the Bill?

It is difficult to quantify the amount of late bets or uncollected winnings, but one source estimates it to be approximately &euro;1 million per annum.

In the course of his presentation to the committee last week the Secretary General of my Department, Mr. Tom O'Mahony, briefed members on developments at European Union level since 2012, including developments in and progress on the Department's key dossiers during Ireland's EU Presidency.  This included the key outcomes of the June and March Councils.<\/p><p>  The running order of agenda items for tomorrow's Council meeting has changed since the version provided for the committee by the Department.  For convenience, however, I will refer to the items according to the numbering in the circulated documentation.  I do not propose to go over the same ground as Mr. O'Mahony last week; rather, I will focus on the agenda for tomorrow's meeting, going briefly through the main headed items and some of the important any other business items.  I will be pleased thereafter to take questions from members.<\/p><p>  The main agenda item for the meeting of the Council is an orientation debate on the Commission's proposal for a new regulation on air passenger rights.  The new regulation will amend EU Regulation 261\/2004 on compensation and assistance provided for passengers in the event of denial of boarding or cancellation or long delay of flights.  EU Regulation 2027\/97 on air carrier liability in respect of the carriage of passengers and their baggage by air will also be discussed.  The proposal was published in March and my officials appeared before the committee to discuss it in May.  It was formally presented by the Commission to Ministers at the last meeting of the Council during the Irish Presidency on 10 June.<\/p><p> This is very important legislation.  Good connections for business and travel generally are essential.  At the same time, however, the rights of passengers to proper treatment in the event of delay, cancellation and denial of boarding must be respected fairly and consistently throughout the European Union.<\/p> <p>However, in meeting these obligations we must ensure the burden on carriers is not excessive, especially where delay, for example, is caused by factors outside their control.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals aim to clarify a number of grey areas in the existing regulation that led to a significant number of cases being brought to the European courts.  It also introduces the concept of burden sharing so that the cost of obligations does not fall on carriers alone when it comes to events outside their control.<\/p><p> The Presidency has tabled a number of specific questions to guide the orientation debate at the Council, focusing particularly on the provisions on missed connections in Article 6, how compensation for long delays should be regulated and whether compensation levels should be linked to ticket price.  The Government has concerns about the proposals concerning missed connections in Article 6.  Under the proposals as currently drafted, the smaller airlines in the EU that feed traffic into the main hubs will have to bear the entire cost of compensating passengers for the full journey in cases in which they miss their connecting flights.  This has the potential to undermine interlining arrangements between carriers and could encourage carriers to take a much more conservative approach to connectivity.  Such a conservative approach, if adopted by the airlines, would not be in the best interests of passengers.  Our key concern is to ensure that passengers' rights are protected, that airlines comply with their obligations and that the system is fair and proportionate and reflects the protections offered in other modes of transfer.  We are open to considering linking the levels of compensation to the ticket price in some way and will urge the Commission to do further work on examining this.  <\/p><p> Agenda item 5 deals with a proposal to extend until 2024 the mandate of the European agency that is progressing the development of the technology side of the single European sky.  The agency is called the SESAR Joint Undertaking and it is a public private partnership first established in 2007 whose mandate is due to cease in 2016.  There is no particular delay in the work of the SESAR Joint Undertaking but, following a detailed examination, it is considered necessary to extend its remit in order to ensure continued effective co-ordination of research activities beyond 2016.  To date, some &euro;2 billion has been spent on research in the area and it is estimated that a further &euro;1.5 billion will be spent in the period to the end of 2024.  Ireland shares the view on the importance of ensuring good co-ordination of this considerable level of research activity to prevent duplication and overlap.  Therefore, we will support the proposal for an extension.<\/p><p> Item 6 on the Council agenda deals with the fourth railway package.  Ireland fully supports harmonisation of the EU rail network within reason.  The proposal for a directive on railway safety, recast, provides for standardisation of the process of safety certification of railway undertakings and the safety authorisation of infrastructure managers.  Ireland had reservations that the imposition of the model applicable to the continental European services would be disproportionate to our relatively small network.  Trains from Great Britain and mainland Europe cannot cross the sea so it does not make sense to standardise everything just for the sake of it.  We have settled on an amendment to Article 11 to better accommodate our position.  Our reservations are being addressed in the draft of the directive that will be presented to the Council for agreement.  The proposals contained in the directive will apply only to the rail service operated by Irish Rail.  The EU proposals will not cover Luas or heritage railways.  The process of safety certification of railway undertakings and the safety authorisation of infrastructure managers for such railways is overseen by the Railway Safety Commission under the Railway Safety Act 2005.<\/p><p> Agenda item 7 concerns a proposal to streamline the work of the European agency dealing with Galileo, Europe&rsquo;s satellite navigation programme.  Maintaining effective security of the Galileo system and its operation is one of the more important aspects of the work of this agency.  There is, therefore, a need to ensure appropriate internal separation and independence of those activities within the agency from the other activities of the agency.  Ireland agrees that the proposals will improve the governance of the agency and, accordingly, we have no difficulty in endorsing this proposal.<\/p><p> Likewise, Ireland has no difficulty with agenda item 8 on multi-annual funding for the European Maritime Safety Agency, EMSA.  The objective of the current proposal is to renew the multi-annual pollution funding programme for the period 2014-20.  An amount of &euro;160.5 million has been proposed by the Commission.<\/p><p> Under agenda item 9(a), any other business, the Commissioner will report to Ministers on progress on the outcome of discussions at the triennial assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, in Montreal last week on tackling the environmental impact of global aviation.  The EU brought aviation within the remit of its emissions trading system on 1 January 2012 but there has been significant opposition globally to the extraterritorial application of the EU&rsquo;s scheme to airlines from outside the EU.  The issue has been the subject of much debate in ICAO over recent years.  The EU has been encouraging ICAO and its member states to adopt market-based mechanisms to tackle emissions from aviation on a global scale.  The good news from the assembly is that the member states of ICAO have committed to developing a market-based mechanism by 2020.  This is later than the EU would have wished.  However, no consensus was reached on the measures to be applied prior to the application of a global scheme in 2020.  The Commission must now assess the outcome of the ICAO assembly before deciding on the next steps with regard to its emissions trading scheme.  I expect the Commissioner will provide us with an update of his initial thoughts on the matter at Council.<\/p><p> Agenda item 9(d), on monitoring, reporting and verification of greenhouse gas emissions from international maritime transport, is at an early stage in the legislative process.  Ireland, along with many other member states, is very much at the point of seeking clarification from the Commission regarding definitions and implications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013100900003#D00300","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381307700,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the detail he provided.  With regard to the first item on the agenda, the Minister said there were concerns about some of the proposals as they might have an impact on interlining arrangements between airlines if the airlines believe the sanction for a late transfer would ultimately mean that the carrying airline pays the full cost of the journey.

There is no argument that if someone misses a connection, the airline is responsible for making sure the person can get the next available flight.  If the person is delayed for a certain period of time, he or she should be provided with assistance or meals.  We have concerns about cash compensation on top of that.  Our concern is that if airlines are required to pay too much cash compensation too often, it may create a perverse incentive.  If someone is flying from Shannon to London and on to Bangkok but misses a connection in London and is delayed by four or five hours, the airline may be hit with a compensation bill of several hundred euro.  The airline may come to the view that it would be better not to provide connecting flights at all.  That is the perverse incentive I am talking about.<\/p><p>  The compensation airlines are required to pay under this proposal is much higher for a delay than for a cancellation.  An airline might take a financial decision that it is less costly to cancel a flight than to pay out compensation for the delay.  Even though this is intended to enhance the rights of passengers, there is a risk it could create perverse incentives that make the situation worse for passengers.  That is what we will ask the Commission to bear in mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013100900004#E00300","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1381307700,"counter":385,"content":"<p>The concern relates to the compensation rather than the effort the airline must make to ensure the passenger gets to the destination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013100900004#E00400","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1381307700,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013100900004#E00500","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1381307700,"counter":387,"content":"<p>What level of interaction has the Minister had with Irish airlines in respect of the impact it will have?

The nature of Irish politics is that people think that a European funding stream can always be applied to a local project.  However, this is not the case, by and large.  A trans-European network means precisely that; it refers, for example, to the corridor from Athens to London.  The opportunities for Ireland probably arise in two areas, those being the harbours and ports to which the Deputy referred, some of which have received funding, and railways.  Cork received funding for a study but the proposal to link the railway to Shannon-Foynes, unfortunately, did not receive funding.  However, they will make another request for funding early next year and I will support the request.  Irish Rail submitted a request for funding for aspects related to a future DART underground project.  For example, a request for funding for the proposed new station in Ashington-Ashtown and O'Reilly's Crossing was not successful for a number of reasons.  It was regarded more as a local project than a trans-European project.  We disagree because if and when DART underground is completed it will link Belfast to Dublin and Cork so it is more than a local railway project.

The objective always is to ensure that passengers' rights are respected.  However, one must be careful not to go too far with any of these regulations because there is a danger that business will suffer.  One does not want to put companies out of business.  I need to study the regulation more.  I have been talking to people who are frequent travellers and they advise me that their primary concern is to have care and assistance if they miss a connection or a flight.  They want the airlines to pull out all the stops to get them to their destination as quickly as possible and to treat them with a bit of respect and dignity while that is happening.  I do not meet many people who want a couple of hundred euro in cash; they just want to complete their journey as quickly as possible.  It may a different case if one misses a day of a holiday but, by and large, those who are delayed for four or five hours are not looking for a cheque as compensation.<\/p> <p>They are looking for the airline to make a genuine effort to get them to the destination as soon as possible and treat them well in the process.

There is a different piece of legislation which has only just been started - I cannot remember if it is a directive or regulation - which deals with clean power.  It will consider everything from electric vehicles to clean power in ports, and it could potentially provide European funding for the establishment of natural gas facilities in ports which could be used to fuel ships.  I have been told it is a clean fuels directive and I am very keen on it, although many people feel it is overly ambitious.
