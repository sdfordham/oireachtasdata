Reduction of the annual rental bill and reduction in the overall property footprint occupied by the Civil Service are being pursued in tandem, and significant results have been achieved to date on both objectives. <\/p><p>  Since 2008, the OPW has surrendered a total of 194 leasehold premises and reduced the office property footprint by 745,400 sq.ft (68,250 sq.m.). The number of car spaces has also been significantly reduced with 1,668 car spaces surrendered between 2008 and quarter 3, 2012. No new property was acquired to accommodate staff from surrendered office space. Where alternative office space was required, staff have been consolidated into OPW owned office buildings as far as possible or in a number of cases, Departments have been re-located into long term leasehold premises where rent reductions have been negotiated with Landlords.<\/p><p><b><i>Savings achieved to date<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  Over &#8364;27m has been saved through OPWs lease surrender programme since 2008. <\/p><p>  The total annual value in savings in rent negotiated so far this year was &#8364;5.3m.<\/p><p>  The Government's Public Service Reform Plan sets out commitments relating to Property Asset Management to drive public service-wide efficiency and ensures that optimal value for money is achieved in the management of the State's property portfolio.<\/p><p>  With regard to the broader public sector, <\/p><p>(a) the Office of Public Works chairs a Steering Group drawn from public service property interests to promote greater efficiencies and develop a property management plan with particular focus on office accommodation. The Government's rationalisation programme of State bodies and the reduction in public service numbers generally has resulted in a reduced requirement for office space. Addressing these changes will involve a comprehensive review of public service accommodation policies particularly in relation to space norms, open plan accommodation and efficiency drivers. A cross-disciplinary committee in the Office of Public Works is currently developing a set of standards for office accommodation and space norms in accordance with international best practice.<\/p><p>(b) The OPW is also defining a map-based Public Service property inventory and web portal for State property to facilitate data sharing. This web application will be used to integrate property data generated by a variety of public bodies to manage the State's property assets more effectively across the service.<\/p><p>(c) The OPW aims to intensify savings and efficiencies in the Civil Service office portfolio through new policies currently being finalising.  Revised policies in the areas of space allocation and standardisation of workplace fit-outs and refurbishments are being formulated in light of best practice and experience in both public and private sector office providers. Both of these policies will, when fully implemented, lead to greater flexibility in the office portfolio and more efficient use of valuable office space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100061#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Private Partnerships","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100061#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[51638\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100061#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the demand he sees for participation in public private partnerships; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>Ireland has a well established track record and a mature and well developed Public Private Partnership (PPP) arena in particular in the road sector and the education sector.

This streamlining included 48 rationalisation measures to be implemented by the end of 2012, as well as a further 46 critical reviews to take place by the end of June 2012. Details of the bodies involved are set out in Appendices IIa and IIb of the Plan which can be found on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>My Department is monitoring progress on the implementation of the 48 agency rationalisation measures outlined in the Public Service Reform Plan.  I recently updated my Cabinet colleagues in relation to progress on implementation across all Departments up to end-Q3.  I am satisfied that significant progress has been made by the responsible parent Departments on the implementation of these measures.  While, the Government has decided not to proceed with the absorption of the National Cancer Registry into the Department of Health at this time, I am confident, based on the progress to date, that the other 47 measures will be completed, at a minimum, on an administrative basis by end-year.  All of my Ministerial colleagues and their Departments are working to this end.  The specific progress on each of the 47 measures is outlined in a table which will be made available to Deputies, along with a copy of this answer.  If Deputies have further queries on the progress or want further detail on individual measures, this information should be sought from the relevant Minister.<\/p><p>To ensure that the momentum is maintained and to build on this progress, I asked the Government to agree that no separate funding be available for those entities not merged \/ rationalised by end-year, unless in a programme agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>I also recently updated my Cabinet colleagues on the 46 Critical Reviews of further potential agency rationalisation measures which were undertaken by the Departments as part of commitments made in the Public Service Reform Plan.  The outcome from these reviews are listed in a table which will be made available to Deputies, along with a copy of this answer.  Broadly speaking:<\/p><p>24 of the critical reviews (involving a total of 116 bodies) recommended proceeding with merger \/ rationalisation.  I requested my Cabinet colleagues to bring forward a timeline for full implementation of these mergers\/rationalisations by end 2013.<\/p><p>10 reviews did not recommend proceeding with the proposed actions.  I have asked these Departments to bring forward alternative proposals to improve shared services, operational synergies etc., between the bodies mentioned, where appropriate;<\/p><p>4 reviews are ongoing and due to report by end-year; and<\/p><p>8 reviews were deferred due to wider external factors.  These reviews are predominantly in the Health Sector and will be considered in due course once the final health landscape becomes clearer.<\/p><p>Regarding savings, let me first state clearly that this programme of agency rationalisation is about reform and not a simple cost-saving exercise.  I have always maintained that the while this programme will deliver savings to the taxpayer, the real benefits lie in the simplification of the administrative landscape, thereby ensuring greater accountability, less duplication of effort and more transparent lines of responsibility of public servants.<\/p><p>The Public Service Reform Plan indicated that savings of 20 million euro in enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money were envisaged from the rationalisation programme and I am confident these savings will be achieved.  I wish to emphasise that these savings will be, for the most part, largely derived from a reduction in staff numbers leading to greater efficiency.<\/p><p>There will of course be other cash savings realised over time as organisations, financial systems, office accommodation etc. are rationalised into leaner, more coherent structures.  Such savings, some of which will be once-off, will be factored into the overall budgetary framework as they arise.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><b><i>Table 1 -  47 Measures to be implemented by end 2012 (Progress to end Q3 2012)<\/i><\/b>Department <\/th><th>Ref No.[[1] See Appendix IIa of Public Service Reform Plan<br \/>1] <\/th><th>Body and Action<\/th><th>Status <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Education and Skills<\/td><td>1 to 3<\/td><td>Amalgamation of Further Education and Training Awards, Higher Education and Training Award Council and National Qualifications Authority of Ireland <\/td><td>Amalgamation provided for in the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, passed in July 2012. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>4<\/td><td>Reduce Number of VEC&#8217;s from 33 to 16<\/td><td>Enabling Bill currently before D&aacute;il<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>5&amp;6<\/td><td>Merge Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology and Council for the Humanities and Social Science into consolidated single council under HEA.<\/td><td>Merger complete March 2012<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation<\/td><td>7 &amp; 8<\/td><td>Amalgamate the Competition Authority and <br \/>National Consumer Agency<\/td><td>Draft Heads of Bill approved and due before D&aacute;il.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>9-13<\/td><td>Rationalise the industrial relations \/ employee rights institutions (Labour Court, Labour Relations Commission, National Employment Rights Authority, <br \/>Employment Appeals Tribunal, Equality Tribunal)<\/td><td>Significant progress made to date on new two tier-model.

The proposed amendments to the Valuation Act 2001 are designed to accelerate the valuation process and to streamline the appeal procedures available to ratepayers. As part of the efforts to accelerate the revaluation process the legislation will also provide the legislative basis for carrying out a revaluation based on self-assessment by ratepayers and also for the external delivery of elements of the valuation process.<\/p><p>  The revaluation programme aims to provide up-to-date valuations for individual properties across all economic sectors that are subject to local authority rates. It is an important programme, especially given the significant changes in rental values following the economic downturn of recent years. The revaluation process is the mechanism whereby economic changes that take place in the property market are reflected in the valuation lists for rates purposes and in individual ratepayers&rsquo; rates liabilities. The new features also include provisions for the streamlining of the valuation appeals process. <\/p><p>  The Valuation Act, 2001 sets out the procedures and basis for assessing the valuation of properties for rates purposes. The Act does not deal with liability for rates, including the ability or otherwise of ratepayers to pay the rates, which is an area covered in rating and local government law and which falls outside the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Valuation. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority and does not come within the remit of the valuation system which is solely concerned with the determination of property valuations. Therefore, it is not proposed to include a provision in the Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill, 2012 which would affect the rates collection system and its attendant aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100063#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Recruitment","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100063#WRC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[51645\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100063#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he is concerned by the potential long term impact on recruitment and retention in the public sector from the range of reductions in pay scales and allowances for newly recruited staff; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>The reduction by 10% of the salary scale and fixed allowances for new entry grades to the public service was implemented by the previous government with effect from 1 January 2011 and remains in place.

The Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, governs the carry over of the statutory minimum (4 working weeks) within the leave year in which it is accrued, or with the employee&rsquo;s consent, within six months of the start of the leave year. <\/p><p>  Carry over of leave, in excess of the statutory minimum, may be allowed on the basis of a three year cycle as follows: at the end of the first year of the cycle or of any year in which an officer's leave allowance is the standard allowance, any relevant untaken leave may be carried forward to the next leave year; the carried forward leave should be taken in the second year of the cycle.  If this is not possible the untaken balance of the total leave allowable may be carried forward to the third year; at the end of the third year of the cycle, carry-over will be limited to the difference (if any) between the statutory minimum annual leave allowance (4 working weeks) and the officer&rsquo;s normal annual leave allowance which has been accrued during the third year of the cycle. <\/p><p>  Therefore, there are existing mechanisms in place to limit the carry over of annual leave.

Furthermore, at the end of the three year cycle, carry over is limited to the difference (if any) between the statutory minimum annual leave allowance and the officer&rsquo;s normal annual leave allowance which has been accrued during the third year of the cycle. <\/p><p>  I would emphasise that carry over of annual leave should only happen in exceptional circumstances and is not the norm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100066#WRF00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100066#WRF00650"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[51546\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100066#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he intends to review current public sector pension abatement legislation.","asker":"1028","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>Abatement in the public service<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>is intended to ensure that a pensioner's combined income from salary and occupational pension does not exceed the salary he or she would have had if he or she had not retired from the civil or public service. The practice goes as far back as the Superannuation Act 1834.  The Deputy should note that the application of abatement has widened recently, insofar as it may be applied in respect of any public service employment obtained by a public service pensioner; previously abatement could normally only apply where the pensioner returned to same public service employment or pension scheme from which his or her pension was payable. <\/p><p>  This extension of pension abatement was provided for in section 51 (Abatement and reckoning of pensionable service) of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012. That section provides that where a pension is payable by a public service body to a public service pensioner and the pensioner receives any remuneration from any public service body, then during this time no more of the pension shall be paid than so much as, with that remuneration, equals the pensionable remuneration which the pensioner would have received if he or she was once again working in the position in which he or she served in the public service.<\/p><p>  The legislation also allows me to remove any doubt or question arising in the application<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>of abatement<font color=\"#0000FF\">, <\/font>and to waive the abatement provision if persons with particular training and experience are required for particular work in the public service body concerned and it is not practicable to meet that requirement otherwise than by the employment of the pensioner. <\/p><p>  I recently signed an Order (Statutory Instrument No. 393 of 2012) which activated the extended abatement arrangements under section 51 of the 2012 Act.

To this end, in November of last year, I established a dedicated Reform and Delivery Office in my Department, led by an externally recruited Programme Director who has many years of experience in leading change in the private sector.  Other key skills have also been brought into this office, for example on shared services and external service delivery.  The key role of the Reform and Delivery Office is to lead, support and co-ordinate the reform programme across the Public Service.  Good progress is being made in this regard, as set out in the Progress Report published on 6 September.  In addition, each Department or major Office has its own Change Delivery Team to manage and drive the reform process at organisational and sectoral levels.<\/p><p>  In terms of formal governance, the key driver of the reform programme is the Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform which provides political direction and accountability for reform.  The Cabinet Committee, which is chaired by the Taoiseach and which I convene, meets on a quarterly basis to consider priority issues and ensure overall progress is being achieved.  An Advisory Group of Secretaries General has also been established, which provides support and advice on strategic and policy issues to the Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform.  In addition, a Reform and Delivery Board, primarily comprising Assistant Secretaries responsible for leading reform in each Department and major Office, meets regularly to oversee and monitor the delivery of Public Service Reform at a strategic level and to provide assurance to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and to the Cabinet Committee that Public Service Reform is being successfully delivered.<\/p><p>  In line with best practice governance, Project Boards have been established for many of the projects which are being implemented under the Reform Plan, for example for the various shared services projects.  In addition, each of the actions in the overall Reform Plan is assigned to a lead official, with Senior Responsible Owners appointed to lead the Major Projects which have been identified as being of strategic importance.  The Reform and Delivery Office in my Department is also working closely with each of the main sectors to ensure they have effective governance arrangements in place to drive and oversee the delivery of the reform programmes for those sectors.  In conclusion, the Government is strongly committed to its ambitious programme of Public Service Reform.  I believe that a robust governance framework is in place to ensure its successful implementation.  Reform of our public services is an ongoing process.  My Department will regularly evaluate these governance structures with a view to achieving maximum delivery of the reform programme over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100067#WRG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100067#WRG00350"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[51554\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100067#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will set out the amendments that he intends to make to the Construction Contracts Bill.","asker":"1080","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":126,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce new legislation to protect small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies.

I am also advised by the Commissioners that in general claims about the size of illegal markets need to be treated with caution.    <\/p><p><b>Tobacco<\/b><\/p><p>  The strategy employed by Revenue to tackle the illicit tobacco trade is multi-faceted. It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and inland, in order to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.<\/p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.<\/p><p>  Revenue also carries out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations. Revenue both provides and receives intelligence from other customs administrations and works closely with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in its efforts to tackle the illicit sale of tobacco at an international level. This international cooperation and sharing of intelligence and expertise plays an important role in combating tobacco smuggling on a global basis.<\/p><p>  There is close cooperation between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in targeting the illicit tobacco trade. In addition, the relevant agencies in the State and in Northern Ireland work closely together, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to combat the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.<\/p><p>  Considerable success has been achieved in combating the illegal trade in tobacco products. In 2010 and 2011 seizures of cigarettes were, respectively, 178.4 million and 109.1 million. Seizures of other tobacco products in those years were 3,367 kilograms (2010) and 11,158 kilograms (2011). Seizures to date in 2012 amount to more than 91 million cigarettes and more than 4,000 kilograms of tobacco.<\/p><p>  In 2012, to the end of October, there were 52 convictions for tobacco smuggling, resulting in fines of &#8364;88,550 and 22 custodial sentences, 6 of which were suspended. There were, in addition, 60 convictions connected with the sale or keeping for sale of unstamped tobacco products, resulting in fines of &#8364;106,300 and 22 custodial sentences, 14 of which were suspended.<\/p><p>  The fines that may be imposed where a person is convicted on indictment for an offence under mineral oil tax or tobacco products tax law, or for the evasion or attempted evasion of excise duty, were increased substantially by the Finance Act 2010. The penalty to be imposed in any particular case where a person is convicted is a matter for the Courts.<\/p><p><b>Oil<\/b><\/p><p>  The main form of criminality in the fuel sector is the laundering of marked gas oil and the sale of the laundered product as auto-fuel. Just like the illegal trade in tobacco products, this poses a serious threat to the Exchequer and to legitimate businesses. In addition, laundered fuel can seriously damage the engines of vehicles in which it is used, and the waste sludge produced by the laundering process is an environmental risk.<\/p><p>  Given the links of organised criminality with the illegal fuel trade, Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating it. Searches undertaken as part of intelligence-led operations have resulted in a considerable number of seizures of diesel and the closure of laundering plants, particularly in border counties.<\/p><p>  A Cross-Border Task Force, involving the relevant agencies from the State and from Northern Ireland is also in place in respect of the illegal fuel trade and facilitates and enhances cooperation in dealing with this form of criminality. Arising from its work, a number of groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels, which operate in both jurisdictions, have been specifically targeted for investigation.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners advise that, in 2011, 9 laundries were detected and 327,000 litres of fuel were seized, along with 9 oil tankers and 29 other vehicles. 16 persons were arrested in the course of those operations and files have been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has to date issued directions to prosecute in a number of these cases.<\/p><p>  In 2012, to the end of October, 11 laundries were detected and shut down and 199,000 litres of oil were seized, along with 28 vehicles and 5 trailers. There were 10 arrests in the course of those operations.<\/p><p>  In addition to the ongoing enforcement action against the illegal fuel trade, steps are being taken to ensure enhanced control and supervision at all stages of the fuel supply chain. <\/p><p>  Key actions include a strengthening of the licensing arrangements for businesses selling auto-fuel, and of the enforcement of licensing requirements. 32 premises were closed in 2011 for trading without a licence or for breach of licence conditions, and a further 49 have been closed to the end of October this year. In addition, new licensing requirements are in force since 1 October for anyone dealing in marked fuels. As well as these important licensing changes, there will be a requirement, as and from 1 January 2013, for all fuel traders to make electronic monthly returns to revenue on their fuel transactions. This will facilitate Revenue in detecting unusual or anomalous patterns of activity.<\/p><p>  Work is proceeding also, in close collaboration with Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs, on obtaining an improved fuel marker. The closing date for receipt of proposals for development of a new marker is 30 November.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners will continue their extensive work against the illegal fuel and tobacco trades, and, in addition to ongoing enforcement activities, will continue to develop innovative ways of combating those responsible for this criminal activity.<\/p><p><b>Counterfeit<\/b><\/p><p>  The role of the Revenue Commissioners in respect of counterfeit or pirated goods concerns cases where such goods are either being imported from or exported to any country outside of the EU. In 2011, Revenue seized 146,000 counterfeit or pirated items with an estimated value of over &#8364;9 million. In 2012, to the end of September, 76,800 items, with an estimated value of more than &#8364;3.7 million, were seized. The range of goods seized is extensive and includes perfumes and cosmetics, shoes, clothing and personal accessories, mobile phones, electronic and computer equipment, CDs, DVDs, toys and medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100068#WRH00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100068#WRH00850"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[51720\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100068#WRH00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider making defibrillators a zero rated or VAT exempt item; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>The VAT rating of goods and services is constrained by the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.

Evidence of the high import content of final demand can be seen in the Balance of Payments figure, which shows the current account moving from a deficit of -5.7% of GDP in 2008 to a surplus of 1.1% in 2011.

When performing these functions, the NTMA is known as the State Claims Agency (SCA). <\/p><p>  Under the general rule of State indemnity enacted through statutory provisions above, certain State bodies are indemnified by the Minister for Finance for the following:<\/p><p>- Personal injury to employees of the State;<\/p><p>- Personal injury to third parties (the public) &#8211; this includes injury resulting from medical negligence;<\/p><p>- Third party property damage &#8211; this includes claims arising from road traffic collisions (RTC&#8217;s).<\/p><p>  Since 2001 the remit of the SCA has been expanded through various delegation orders based on a value for money analysis.  More recently in 2010 the management of Health Service Executive (HSE) personal injury (non-clinical) and third party property damage claims was delegated to the State Claims Agency (SCA) under the National Treasury Management Agency (State Authority) Order 2009.  13 other State authorities were also newly delegated to the SCA in 2011.<\/p><p>  Additionally, the following classes of claims were delegated to the State Claims Agency with effect from 7th February 2011:<\/p><p>- Bullying\/harassment claims by state employees, which allege personal injury;<\/p><p>- Claims by members of the Defence Forces alleging personal injury whilst serving abroad &#8211; includes stand alone PTSD cases; and<\/p><p>- In-cell sanitation claims by current and former prisoners.<\/p><p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Claims Management Function) (Amendment) Order 2012 formally delegated management of Thalidomide and nimesulide (Aulin) claims to the State Claims Agency on 3rd April 2012. <\/p><p>  In conjunction with the State, the SCA has a strong track record in reducing the cost of managing claims under its remit.  For example, during 2011 the SCA achieved significant savings on claims and related legal costs associated with the management of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS).  An independent actuarial assessment projected that &#8364;106 million would be required to satisfy CIS claims and related costs in 2011.

Only approximately &#8364;1 million has been expended to date in the management of such claims since 2010, yielding a cash flow saving of &#8364;41 million.  Based on the current outstanding estimated liability associated with these delegated claims since 1st January 2010, a long term saving of at least &#8364;15 million will be achieved for the State by managing these claims on the &#8220;pay as you go&#8221; basis operated by the SCA. <\/p><p>  Currently, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in contact with all Government Departments to identify, on the basis of a cost benefit analysis, what other State agencies should be delegated.

Several Government-supported third-level institutions around the country have been developing expertise in Additive Manufacturing and have invested in equipment to support companies exploring options in this area. <\/p><p>  Just last week, together with Minister Sherlock, I announced Science Foundation Ireland's Infrastructure Awards 2012, where one of the successful infrastructure investment projects relates to Additive Manufacturing.

The purpose of the Act, which implements EU Directive 2002\/14\/EC of the 11 March 2002, is to provide for the establishment of a general framework setting out minimum requirements for the right to information and consultation of employees in undertakings with at least 50 employees. It provides a general right to information and consultation for employees from their employer on matters which directly affect them. <\/p><p>  The Act also transposes into Irish law an optional provision of EU Council Directive 2001\/23\/EC of 12 March 2001 dealing with the safeguarding of employees&#8217; rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses, or parts of undertakings or businesses.<\/p><p>  The Act provides employees, in undertakings with at least 50 employees, with a general right to information and consultation from their employers.  The intention behind the Act is to ensure that information and consultation is provided by employers systematically so that employees are able to acquire an informed understanding of the challenges faced by the business.  The Government recognises that timely information and meaningful consultation are prerequisites for the improved adaptability of Irish workplaces, which is vital to meet the challenges created by the globalised economy.    <\/p><p>  Research both at home and abroad demonstrates the tangible benefits that effective and meaningful information and consultation arrangements can bring to both the business and the individual.  In modern society, organisations are undergoing continuous change driven by a complex combination of factors.  It has been shown that effective information and consultation arrangements can help organisations improve their capacity to anticipate and manage change, leading to improved organisational performance and competitiveness.<\/p><p>  Under Section 7 of the Act either an employer can initiate negotiations or employees can request negotiations to establish information and consultation arrangements.  The Act provides the maximum flexibility to employers and employees to devise arrangements which best suit their own particular circumstances.  So while providing certain legal requirements, the Act allows for the Irish voluntarist tradition to be maintained. It presents an opportunity to foster and deepen customised partnership-style approaches to anticipating and managing change.<\/p><p>  Following enactment of the legislation in 2006, my Department published an Explanatory Booklet for Employees and Employers on the Provisions of the Act. This was later complimented by a Code of Practice (S.I 132 of 2008 Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Information and Consultation) (Declaration) Order 2008) which was developed by the Labour Relations Commission.

The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus. It will add value to other Government schemes of support for entrepreneurs and unemployed persons, such as the Back to Work Allowance, the range of training programmes and the Seed Capital Scheme. <\/p><p>  The Fund will provide support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. <\/p><p>  Microfinance Ireland (MFI), the company set up to operate the Fund, will work closely with the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) \/ Local Enterprise Offices which provide assistance with training and preparing business plans for entrepreneurs.  They will carry out an initial evaluation of the quality of business proposals\/loan applications from entrepreneurs before sending same on to MFI for decision.   The addition of microfinance will now enable the CEBs to deliver a wider suite of services to all entrepreneurs, namely grants, mentoring, soft supports and access to loan finance.<\/p><p>  MFI and the CEBs are very conscious of the particular difficulties the youth sector faces with regard to credit history, previous business experience etc. and where they can assist young entrepreneurs, they will. However, the potential viability of the business proposal is the dominant factor in any credit decision made by Microfinance Ireland.  <\/p><p>  In addition to MFI and the CEBs, other sources of funding are available for example, the Seed Capital Scheme, business angels and E.I.I.S. While access to start-up finance through the various channels outlined is important to support youth entrepreneurship, other policy actions are equally important such as fostering entrepreneurship in students while at school or in third level education.  Over 20,000 students now participate annually in the various CEB&ndash;supported programmes implemented in the education sector. <\/p><p>  The Government continues to monitor the requirements of all business sectors regarding access to finance and in that context will continue to assess the needs of youth entrepreneurs in the light of the operation of the Microfinance Loan Fund and the availability of support from sources such as the EU, EIB and IMF.

Many of our traditional strengths have survived the recession intact, including our pro-business enterprise regime, our supportive tax regime and our productive workforce. <\/p><p>  The World Economic Forum (WEF) rankings showed Ireland&rsquo;s position improving 2 places to 27th last September, while the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook released in May showing Ireland&rsquo;s headline position recovering back into the top 20 (up from 24th)  and 8th out of the 24 EU countries featured.   Ireland was ranked first by the IMD in a number of areas, including in relation to investment incentives, skilled labour and attitudes towards globalisation while the WEF ranked Ireland first for the business impact of FDI rules, FDI and technology transfer and inflation.<\/p><p>  However, the NCC advises that Ireland must continue to focus on implementing a range of structural reforms across all sectors of the economy, including in relation to the labour market, competition policy, taxation, education and skills.  The report also highlights the importance of ensuring that our banking system is appropriately structured to provide an adequate supply of credit for enterprise and the need to embed pro-competitiveness reforms in sheltered areas, such as healthcare and legal services.<\/p><p>  The 2012 and the coming 2013 Action Plan for Jobs includes an extensive range of measures across Government which will address many of the reforms highlighted by the NCC as necessary to ensure a continued and structural improvement in our competitive position.  In relation to my own areas of responsibility, I have taken a number of specific actions which are directly aimed at improving the competitiveness of enterprises.  These include:<\/p><p>- reforming the Joint Labour Committee\/Registered Employment Agreement system, <\/p><p>- the introduction of a number of initiatives to improve access to finance for business,<\/p><p>- the reduction in business burdens which will yield potential savings of &euro;206 million per annum for business,<\/p><p>- through the National Consumer Agency, encouraging greater transparency in the pricing of professional services to business.<\/p><p>  In addition, one of the key actions being undertaken by Forf&aacute;s this year under the Action Plan for Jobs is to identify a set of competitiveness indicators and actions to improve Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness rating.<\/p><p>  Further measures to achieve the structural reforms identified by the NCC to improve our international competitiveness will be contained in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs which I am currently preparing in consultation with my Government colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100075#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[48025\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100075#WRP01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if the economic unit within his Department has considered the recent EU report on competitiveness; the implications of the report for Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":294,"content":"<p>The European Commission&rsquo;s Competitiveness Report 2012 was published on 19 October last.

Given the scale of the fiscal crisis and because spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure, you will appreciate that savings have to be found in the social welfare system.<\/p><p>  The change to State pension rate bands means that pension payments made, will reflect PRSI payments made over a working life. Before the rate band changes where introduced in September 2012 a person with an average of 20-47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. That was neither fair nor equitable.  From September 2012, a lower pension is payable to new applicants for State pension who have a yearly average of less than 48 PRSI contributions which better relates to their PRSI record. This measure introduces additional rates bands for State pension to more fairly reflect the proportionality of attachment to the workforce by the claimant.<\/p><p>  The maximum rate will remain unchanged and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year will also remain unchanged. <\/p><p>  However, those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension but it should be noted that while expectations may need to be adjusted, a rate of pension will be still be payable. Claimants with an income need, may, following a means test, qualify for a State pension (non-contributory).   The maximum rate of the (State pension non-contributory) is &euro;219.00 per week.   <\/p><p>  This change to rate bands introduced in September 2012, moves somewhat closer to a &lsquo;total contribution approach&rsquo; where those who pay more, benefit more.  The &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo; to State pension will be adopted to replace the current averaging system.   The current proposed date for its introduction is 2020.   Under this system, the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.<\/p><p>  The current arrangement was announced in Budget 2012 and came into effect in September 2012. At that time  it was estimated that savings in 2012 would be in the region of &euro;0.5m, &euro;2.8m in 2013, &euro;5.5m in 2014 and &euro;8.2m in 2015. These estimated costs factor in those who will avail of other social welfare schemes. Detailed savings by year for the period in question are not available at this stage.<\/p><p>Numbers affected:<\/p><p>Average weekly recipients in 2012, 1,100<\/p><p>Average weekly recipients in 2013, 3,650<\/p><p>Average weekly recipients 2014, 7,200<\/p><p>Average weekly recipients 2015, 10,750.<\/p><p>  There is also an important long-term policy context for the proposed changes to State pension as the challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant. The recently published review of the Social Insurance Fund identified that in the medium to long term, pension related expenditure will account for an increasing proportion of the Social Insurance Fund expenditure - rising from 57% in 2011 to 85% in 2066.    <\/p><p>  The pensioner support ratio is projected to decline from 5.3 workers for every individual over pension age in 2010 to 3.9 workers by 2020 and to 2.1 workers by 2060  People aged 65 years and over will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion of working age is expected to decline.  People are living longer with healthier lives and growing numbers of people want to work, or may need to work beyond State pension age.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population. This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.   <\/p><p>  In terms of value for money the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund identified that  for those who take time out of the workforce, the report confirms that social insurance benefits offer excellent value for money for those:<\/p><p>- on the lower part of the income distribution,<\/p><p>- those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women<\/p><p>- and the self-employed.  <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the changes in the contribution rules and associated rates of payment which were introduced in September 2012, those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund.  This can be of particular benefit to women.  <\/p><p>  The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system, and these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to secure economic recovery, promote growth and employment.  To this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy and the pension reform measures underway contribute significantly to this strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100077#WRR00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100077#WRR00350"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[51675\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100077#WRR00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when an application for invalidity pension appeal will be finalised in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1087","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":327,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an Appeals Officer, having fully considered all the evidence, disallowed the appeal of the person concerned by way of summary decision.  <\/p><p>  Under Social Welfare legislation, the decision of the Appeals Officer is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed by the Appeals Officer in the light of new evidence or new facts.  <\/p><p>  Following the submission of additional evidence the Appeals Officer has agreed to review the case.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  <\/p><p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for the State pension (contributory) easier by disregarding time spent out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994.   Eligibility for the homemaker's scheme is conditional on firstly meeting the standard qualifying conditions for State pension. <\/p><p>  Backdating the scheme to 1964 would involve considerable costs.  The most recent analysis of this was published in the 2007 Green Paper on Pensions. This identified that the cost of  backdating the homemaker's scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced in Ireland, would be in the region of &euro;160m and to 1973\/73, an estimated  &euro;150m.<\/p><p>  Updating these estimates would involve considerable effort which would not be warranted at this time.

The volume of FIS claims on hands and the delays in processing are a consequence of continued strong claim intake.<\/p><p>  An in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project has recently been completed for the FIS scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the elimination of backlogs.  Part of the project was a detailed examination of workloads and a full assessment of existing capacity within the area and what capacity is needed in order to process the volumes of claims, both new and renewal, being received on a weekly basis.<\/p><p>  A plan has now been devised and implementation commenced on 5 November 2012.  This plan sees the normal weekly new claim and renewal intake processed without delay while the backlog is ring-fenced and a focused team assigned to this work with a clear plan for its elimination.<\/p><p>  The first step taken to permanently eliminate the built-up of backlogs of FIS claims is to put in place sufficient capacity and suitable structures and processes to deal with the weekly intake of work.  This has been done in the case of the FIS scheme and the first week of operation has been very successful in this regard, achieving its target output.<\/p><p>  This is not to say that the backlog of claims awaiting decision is being ignored or that work has ceased on it.  On the contrary, a separate team including additional temporary resources has been identified and is already assigned and working on the claims in question.  This team is fully focussed on the elimination of the backlog of claims in the shortest possible timeframe, concentrating in the first instance on those claims which were previously in payment but where payment has expired.  <\/p><p>  It is expected that the backlog will be fully eliminated by the end of March 2013.

The terms of reference for the Commission are set out below. Membership of the Commission is yet to be finalised however there will be approximately 15 members drawn from relevant organisations\/stakeholders involved in or with an interest in Rural Development. They will not receive any remuneration for their participation in the Commission.

As part of its work it will conduct a comprehensive public consultation exercise and examine all relevant information available in order to reach its conclusions. The public consultation process will include a number of public meetings to be held across the country from January to April 2013. In addition, there will be a number of individual stakeholder meetings with civil society organisations.

The loss of revenue to the State through these illicit activities has implications for the funding of our public services. The involvement of organised crime also presents a further challenge to the State in targeting these activities.<\/p><p>  Of course, the lead role in combating cigarette smuggling, fuel laundering and counterfeit goods in this jurisdiction rests with the Revenue Customs Service, in the context of the investigation of revenue offences which occasion significant financial losses to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>  Having said that, both the Revenue Customs Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do continue to make significant efforts, separately and together, to disrupt the activities of those involved.<\/p><p>  With regard to the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this area, the Policing Plan for the year 2012 sets out the continued commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in criminal activity, including organised crime activity. In this regard, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to target groups and individuals engaged in organised criminal activities, including those involved in the smuggling of cigarettes and the laundering of fuel.  In particular, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to provide ongoing support to the Revenue Commissioners in tackling this criminal activity.<\/p><p>  In addition, multi-disciplinary approaches are applied to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted, including through the use of the proceeds of crime legislation, money-laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.<\/p><p>  As highlighted in the Cross Border Threat Assessment for 2012, fuel laundering and tobacco fraud continues to be a serious concern for authorities, North and South. Recognising these shared concerns, both a Cross-border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group and a Cross Border Tobacco Enforcement Group Task Force have been established to target these activities on an all island basis.<\/p><p>  These Groups comprise representatives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue Customs, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (UK), the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Criminal Assets Bureau and have had many successes in tackling these forms of criminality.<\/p><p>  I would like to take the opportunity to commend the law enforcement agencies, North and South, in their continued commitment to this form of enhanced joint cooperation.<\/p><p>  For my part, I will continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in all their efforts to bring about the successful disruption and dismantling of those involved in these organised crime activities.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of increasing the penalties for offences relating to these activities. The applicable penalties for such offences are provided for in the Finance Acts. Any amendment to the penalty provisions contained in those Acts is, of course, a matter for my colleague Mr. Michael Noonan TD, Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100078#WRW02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Committees","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100078#WRX00150"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[51717\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100078#WRX00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the names all of the independent human rights committees other than the European Court of Human Rights under the aegis of the Council of Europe and under the aegis of the United Nations for which his Department has a primary liaison or reporting role, and for each one of those committees if mechanisms exist for removing a member when information comes to light after the person's appointment or election which raises significant questions over the suitability of that person to serve on such a committee, and if such mechanisms do exist if he will set out the procedures or where information on them can be publicly accessed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":455,"content":"<p>My Department provides periodic reports and responses to requests for comments on reports and other material to a range of Council of Europe and United Nations bodies and committees.

The loss of revenue to the State through these illicit activities has implications for the funding of our public services. The involvement of organised crime also presents a further challenge to the State in targeting these activities.<\/p><p>  Of course, the lead role in combating cigarette smuggling, fuel laundering and counterfeit goods in this jurisdiction rests with the Revenue Customs Service, in the context of the investigation of revenue offences which occasion significant financial losses to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>  Having said that, both the Revenue Customs Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do continue to make significant efforts, separately and together, to disrupt the activities of those involved.<\/p><p>  With regard to the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this area, the Policing Plan for the year 2012 sets out the continued commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in criminal activity, including organised crime activity. In this regard, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to target groups and individuals engaged in organised criminal activities, including those involved in the smuggling of cigarettes and the laundering of fuel.  In particular, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to provide ongoing support to the Revenue Commissioners in tackling this criminal activity.<\/p><p>  In addition, multi-disciplinary approaches are applied to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted, including through the use of the proceeds of crime legislation, money-laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.<\/p><p>  As highlighted in the Cross Border Threat Assessment for 2012, fuel laundering and tobacco fraud continues to be a serious concern for authorities, North and South. Recognising these shared concerns, both a Cross-border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group and a Cross Border Tobacco Enforcement Group Task Force have been established to target these activities on an all island basis.<\/p><p>  These Groups comprise representatives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue Customs, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (UK), the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Criminal Assets Bureau and have had many successes in tackling these forms of criminality.<\/p><p>  I would like to take the opportunity to commend the law enforcement agencies, North and South, in their continued commitment to this form of enhanced joint cooperation.<\/p><p>  For my part, I will continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in all their efforts to bring about the successful disruption and dismantling of those involved in these organised crime activities.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of increasing the penalties for offences relating to these activities. The applicable penalties for such offences are provided for in the Finance Acts. Any amendment to the penalty provisions contained in those Acts is, of course, a matter for my colleague Mr. Michael Noonan TD, Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100082#WRW02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Committees","counter":692,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100083#WRX00150"},{"type":"question","counter":693,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[51717\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112100083#WRX00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the names all of the independent human rights committees other than the European Court of Human Rights under the aegis of the Council of Europe and under the aegis of the United Nations for which his Department has a primary liaison or reporting role, and for each one of those committees if mechanisms exist for removing a member when information comes to light after the person's appointment or election which raises significant questions over the suitability of that person to serve on such a committee, and if such mechanisms do exist if he will set out the procedures or where information on them can be publicly accessed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":694,"content":"<p>My Department provides periodic reports and responses to requests for comments on reports and other material to a range of Council of Europe and United Nations bodies and committees.
