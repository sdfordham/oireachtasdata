Discussions are ongoing between the two parties on a range of bilateral issues. <\/p>  <p>  Despite these positive developments, fundamental restrictive measures remain in place.  The US embargo on Cuba is codified in legislation, and therefore requires the approval of the US Congress in order to rescind it.  President Obama has repeatedly called on Congress to end the embargo, not least during his visit to Havana this year.  <\/p>  <p>  On 27 October 2015, Ireland joined all other European Union member states in voting in favour of a Cuban resolution at the UN General Assembly in New York, calling for an end to the US embargo on Cuba.  Consistent with our policy on this issue, it is the Government's intention to vote for a further resolution on ending the embargo in the UN in the coming days. <\/p>  <p>  I was pleased to have the opportunity to discuss these issues as well as positive developments in Ireland-Cuba relations with the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Bruno Rodr&iacute;guez Parrilla, en marge of the UN General Assembly in September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500057#WRA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":45,"content":"<p>Question No. 43 answered with Question No. 37.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":46,"content":"<p>Question No. 44 answered with Question No. 26.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Syrian Conflict","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500057#WRA04500"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[30278\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500057#WRA04600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his Department has made any efforts to work with the Russian and Iranian ambassadors regarding the current situation in Syria; if he has discussed with each of those ambassadors their country's role in the current conflict; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[30279\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500057#WRA04700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the way he has made his concerns known to the Russian and Iranian ambassadors here in view of the escalation in the conflict in Syria, particularly the escalation in bombings of civilians, aid convoys, water and electricity supplies; if he has called them to a meeting on these matters; and, if not, when he will do so.

Strengthening the EU's peace-keeping capacity in support of the United Nations is an integral part of this effort.  This will be done through the further development of the Common Security and Defence Policy as defined in the EU Treaties.  The Strategy also has a positive focus on the Middle East Peace Process, disarmament, gender, the UN and importance of multilateralism more generally.

It operates across a range of areas including allowing for free movement between Ireland and the UK, voting rights and access to social welfare.<\/p>  <p>  The eventual departure of the UK from the EU means that the only land border between the EU and the UK will be on the island of Ireland.  It will be geographically isolated from the rest of the EU and, as it will be outside the Schengen arrangements, the integrity of the border controls of the Schengen area will not be affected in any way.  Furthermore it will be part of a pre-existing British-Irish arrangement that has long been recognised, the CTA.  However, the CTA has only ever operated where both Ireland and the UK were either outside of the EU, or within it.<\/p>  <p>  The CTA is an arrangement that is valued on both islands and both Governments will work hard to preserve its benefits.  It will be a key issue for Ireland in the context of negotiating new terms and conditions for the EU's relationship with the UK.  We will prioritise this matter in the context of a new relationship between the EU and the UK, and in bilateral discussions with the British Government.  So whilst it cannot be stated with certainty at this stage that no immigration controls at borders will be introduced, we would hope that arrangements can remain as close to the current regime as is possible.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding trade, we are all acutely conscious of the importance of the UK market to Irish exporters and every effort is being made to protect existing trade and to continue to grow it. <\/p>  <p>  In my role as Minister for Trade, I am also intensifying our efforts on other markets, near and far.

This is done by using two statutory valuation processes known as &ldquo;revaluation&rdquo; and &ldquo;revision&rdquo;. Firstly, revaluation is a process where all rateable properties in a Local Authority area are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date. After the first revaluation of a Local Authority area is completed, revaluation is then scheduled to take place every five to ten years to reflect changes in economic circumstances since the last revaluation took place. Revision, on the other hand, is intended to reflect structural changes to individual properties or the addition to the valuation lists of new properties between revaluations. <\/p><p>The national revaluation programme currently underway is the first general revaluation of all commercial property in the state since the middle of the 19th century. It is a very significant undertaking involving the valuation of some 146,000 commercial rateable properties. Completing the first revaluation and getting properties in every Local Authority area onto the five to ten year cycle of revaluations provided for in the legislation represents a sea-change for the valuation system.<\/p><p>  All rateable properties in the Dublin, Waterford and Limerick local authority areas are now re-valued. In addition, 13 public utilities representing some of the largest ratepayers in the State have been revalued on a global basis. This represents approximately 57% of the national rateable valuation base in monetary value terms or 33% in numerical terms.  The Commissioner has recently made valuation orders for the revaluation of 10 Local Authorities in respect of some 29,500 commercial properties. The revaluation in two of these County Council areas, Carlow and Kilkenny (5,000 properties approx), is being conducted on a pilot basis using external resources (outsourcing). This approach was provided for in the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, in order to augment the in-house capacity of the Valuation Office. <\/p><p>The Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 also provided for the Commissioner to conduct a revaluation with the assistance of the occupiers of property using elements of self-assessment. This provision &ndash; known as &ldquo;Occupier Assisted Valuation&rdquo; - is one of the provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme. This approach, though readily used as a means of assessment in personal and corporate taxation codes, has not been used in comparable jurisdictions in relation to the valuation of commercial properties for rating purposes. The Commissioner is in the course of establishing a pilot project in County Laois (2,300 properties approx) using &rdquo;Occupier Assisted Valuation&rdquo;.  The Valuation Office has conducted the necessary statutory consultations with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and with Laois County Council and is developing appropriate technical and statutory systems of valuation which will underpin the pilot project and allow for its initiation in 2017. <\/p><p>While the revaluation programme has been underway, the Valuation Office has continued to carry out revision work and, during 2015, some 5,438 applications for revision were processed. Also, any backlog of revision work is cleared during the revaluation of a local authority area. As already mentioned, revision of valuation is the process by which the valuation lists are maintained between revaluations and reflects changes to property of a structural nature and the addition to the valuation lists of new properties. The number of outstanding applications for revision of valuation received by the Valuation Office on a yearly basis is indicated on Table 1 hereunder. Table 2 shows the current age profile of these applications.  The provision of information regarding the square footage of these properties is not possible at this time as this information is obtained during the revision process. <\/p><p>It has been a priority for the Valuation Office to enter into collaborative arrangements to ensure that an efficient and effective revision programme can be conducted on an ongoing basis with all Local Authorities. The Commissioner has implemented a number of initiatives to enhance the capacity of the Valuation Office to deliver a high-quality and timely revision service. During 2015, the Office carried out a revision pilot project involving four local authorities which was designed to improve data exchange with local authorities in general.  Following the conclusion of the pilot project, this approach is being rolled out to all local authorities and online services have been enhanced to facilitate more effective data exchanges between those bodies and the Valuation Office.  <\/p><p>I am advised by the Valuation Office that the current number of valuer staff engaged on valuation work is 71. The Valuation Office recently commissioned a review of its revaluation and revision processes which was jointly conducted by the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation (IRRV) and the International Property Tax Institute (IPTI). That review made a number of recommendations in line with best international practice and which are based on methodologies and processes for handling statutory valuation work in other jurisdictions. These recommendations will now form the basis of an implementation plan which is being put in place by the Valuation Office. The review also proposed, among other recommendations, the establishment of a separate, permanently resourced, Revision Unit which would be responsible for the processing of revision work and the ongoing assessment of properties falling under this category.  In this regard, following the receipt of a business case from the Valuation Office seeking the provision of additional funding to allow for the establishment of such a dedicated Revision Unit, I was pleased to be in a position to announce as part of the recent budgetary provisions, the allocation of an additional &euro;750,000 for this purpose.  This development, which will involve the appointment of a number of additional staff, in tandem with the rollout of improved online facilities and enhanced processes and procedures, is specifically intended to address backlogs in conducting revision assessments and to enable the Valuation Office to provide timely and high quality revision services to Local Authorities and ratepayers into the future. <\/p><p>The Deputy has requested information in relation to the potential loss to each local authority affected by delays in assessing properties for rates. The collection of rates is solely a matter for local authorities and the financial implications of the revision programme is a matter for individual local authorities. The amount would ultimately be dependent on each authority's Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) and its overall income and expenditure decided on at its annual budget meeting.  The Commissioner has no mandate or part to play in these arrangements.<\/p><p><b>Table 1 - Revision Applications Outstanding by Year Received<\/b><table><tr><th>Local Authority<\/th><th>Prior to and

levels of service to be provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are set out each year in the annual policing plan.  The independent Policing Authority is required under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (the Act), as amended, to determine priorities and targets for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in performing its functions relating to policing services. In developing the policing priorities for 2017 the Authority has had regard to the programme for Government, the Strategy Statement for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na 2016-2018, the Garda public attitudes survey, consultation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, concerns expressed by members of the public and civil society and in the media, and priorities for previous and comparator policing plans. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner published An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on 9 June 2016. The Programme is the Commissioner's response to the recognised demand for reform from both inside and outside the Garda organisation. Its implementation will result in a restructured organisation to ensure it can meet present and future policing and security challenges.  It is anticipated that implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme will feature amongst the policing priorities for 2017 and will address the issues around garda deployment which the Deputy raises in her question. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's question on the process for developing the annual policing plan I can advise that this is clearly set out in Section 22 of the Act. When producing her policing plan, the Commissioner is required to have regard to the priorities determined by the Policing Authority. The Authority shall then, with my consent, approve the plan and send a copy to me to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is expected the Policing Plan for 2017 will be received by my Department in early December for my consent.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, the Garda Inspectorate is commencing a review to examine the dispersement and use of resources available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities and to make recommendations to provide a more effective, visible and responsive policing service. This review will consider demographic changes and is being overseen by the Policing Authority.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel and vehicles, among the Garda Regions, Divisions and Districts. I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public. In regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the significant resources that have been made available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021 which will help facilitate the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme.  In particular, some &euro;205 million for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  The Government has approved a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which has as its centrepiece a vision of a police service comprising 15,000 garda&iacute;, 4,000 civilians and 2,000 reserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500059#WRC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Regulations","counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500059#WRC03750"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[31477\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500059#WRC03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the maximum number of days that a person can be segregated from the general prison population under rule 62 of the prison rules 2007; the opportunities for a review of their segregation that are available to a prisoner while segregated; if there is provision for an automatic review of a prisoner being segregated; if so, the number of days after which such a review takes place; and the person or body it is conducted by.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":160,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007 allows for the removal of prisoners from structured activity or association on the grounds of maintaining good order or safe and secure custody.

The Garda approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. The Deputy will appreciate that I do not have a role in relation to Garda policing strategies in any particular local area but have brought the Deputy's specific concerns to the attention of the Garda Authorities.<\/p><p>  I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.

This represents a dramatic improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013.  This improvement has come about as a result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in providing this service, including an increase of over 80 percent in staffing levels and the roll out earlier this year of an e-Vetting system.<\/p>  <p>  In April this year I commenced the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 and in tandem with that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched the e-Vetting system.  E-Vetting facilitates the on-line processing of applications and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications.  I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that the vast majority of vetting applications, over 85 percent of applications, now received by the Vetting Bureau are received and processed via the e-Vetting system.<\/p>  <p>  One very important feature of the e-Vetting system is that the individual applicant can track the progress of their own vetting application on-line and can, therefore, see when their application has been processed and returned to the relevant registered organisation.<\/p>  <p>  There are a small number of registered organisations who are not yet operating the e-Vetting system and continue to use the old paper format for applications.  For vetting applications that continue to be submitted in paper format, the average turnaround time is in the order of four weeks from the receipt of the application by the Vetting Bureau and this represents a minimum time frame given the administrative input required.  The Garda Authorities continue to work with the organisations who are not yet operating the e-Vetting system to encourage and support them to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Processing times for any given application can be longer in individual cases when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary or where errors have been made in the application.  It is important to note that delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda Authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the vetting service is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the importance of protecting children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, the current processing period is not unreasonable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500060#WRD04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":212,"content":"<p>Question No. 105 answered with Question No. 87.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500060#WRD04450"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[31613\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500060#WRD04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of a type D visa application by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the visa application referred to was created on-line on 19 August, 2016.

As the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources at her disposal, the review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. The review  concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation's resource base would best meet public demand.

In relation to the proposed pilot scheme, I have requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions in relation to the distribution of Garda resources in the State, to identify for reopening 6 stations that were closed under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na District and Station Rationalisation Programme.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to funding for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  I secured &euro;1.583 billion for the Garda Vote for 2017.

This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff. The Garda Inspectorate, in its 2015 report  \"Changing Policing in Ireland\"  has estimated that there may be up to 1,250 Garda&iacute; currently in such posts and the Government's plan aims to return as many of these Garda&iacute; as possible to front-line duties over the next five years.

As the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources at her disposal, the review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. The review  concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation's resource base would best meet public demand.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that these closures allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion particularly with regard to various targeted police operations. <\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits the Government to asking the Policing Authority to oversee a review of, amongst other things, both the boundaries of Garda districts and the dispersement of Garda stations in rural areas.  In addition, the Government is committed to launching a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. I have asked the Authority to initiate the proposed review and<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b>I have previously stated that I will put the results of the review before the House.  <\/p><p>In relation to the proposed pilot scheme, I have requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions in relation to the distribution of Garda resources in the State, to identify for reopening 6 stations that were closed under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na District and Station Rationalisation Programme.<\/p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the Programme recognises that community policing is the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing a means of recognising that every community, both urban and rural, has its own concerns and expectations.  It commits the Government to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing in every community, including the most minimal response times possible.<\/p><p>In this context, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the significant investment of some &euro;46 million in the Garda Fleet under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021 which provides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles to ensure that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime. Indeed, since the beginning of the year, some 520 new vehicles have come on stream for use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500061#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Juvenile Offenders","counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500061#WRE02350"},{"type":"question","counter":260,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[31690\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500061#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of juvenile offenders in each county; the programmes under her Department's remit in place in each county to combat juvenile offences; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

As such, the reports include details of, inter alia, the number of incidents and individual children and young people referred to the Diversion Programme and the outcomes of such referrals, including a geographical breakdown by Garda region and division. <\/p><p>  In its 2014 Report the Committee reported that 9,991 children and young people were referred to the Diversion Programme. This compares with 10,420 children and young people referred in 2013 and continues the downward trend in the number of children and young people referred to the Programme in recent years. I understand that the Monitoring Committee's 2015 report is expected to be finalised shortly.<\/p><p>  The Diversion Programme operates in accordance with Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, and is under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner.  The aim of the Diversion Programme, through the network of  Juvenile Liaison Officers, is to deal with young people who offend, by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the young offender away from the Courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending.  The Programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting children and young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to them and their families.  This is evident from the continuing fall in the number of children and young people being referred to the Programme in recent years. <\/p><p>  In support of the operation of the Diversion Programme, my Department through the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) funds and oversees the operation of the national network of Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) across the country. The national network comprises over 100 projects, six of which incorporate Local Drugs Task Force (LDTF) projects. As the Deputy may know, GYDPs are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in criminal or anti-social behaviour. <\/p><p>  My Department, again through the Irish Youth Justice Service, also supports the work of the Probation Service through a network of community based Young Persons Probation Projects (YPPs).  There are currently 18 YPPs developing  and delivering services to young offenders in their communities. The management and monitoring of the YPP projects is undertaken directly by the Probation Service. These projects offer services to offenders who would otherwise not be in a position to avail of a mainstream service opportunity, thereby enhancing the work of the Probation Service in changing offending behaviour.<\/p><p>  Just under &euro;17 million has been allocated in 2016 to support the operation of all of these community based projects. In addition, some &euro;2.8 million additional funding has been made available in 2016 under the Dormant Accounts Scheme to further support the operation of  these community based youth crime prevention projects.  The ongoing investment by my Department in these projects is playing a significant part in the continuing fall in the number of children and young people involved in offending and anti-social behaviour in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500061#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Retirements","counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500061#WRE02550"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[31692\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500061#WRE02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; that have applied under each early retirement scheme introduced in the past five years, by location and rank; the number of garda&iacute; who have voluntarily retired, by location and rank; the number of compulsory retirements, by location and rank; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 150 will attest later this year.<\/p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner.  The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year. It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017. <table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Com<\/th><th>D\/Com<\/th><th>A\/Com<\/th><th>C\/Supt<\/th><th>Supt<\/th><th>Insp<\/th><th>Sgt<\/th><th>Gda<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>56<\/td><td>116<\/td><td>196<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>78<\/td><td>131<\/td><td>238<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>80<\/td><td>141<\/td><td>249<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>85<\/td><td>179<\/td><td>297<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>115<\/td><td>260<\/td><td>424<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>106<\/td><td>280<\/td><td>438<\/td><\/tr><\/table>*as of 20.10.16<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Voluntary<\/th><th>Compulsory<\/th><th>Early retirement <\/th><th>Total <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>*2016 <\/td><td>180<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>196<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>222<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>238<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>236<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>249<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>279<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>297<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>417<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>424<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>428<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>438<\/td><\/tr><\/table>*as of 20.10.16<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500061#WRE02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":265,"content":"<p>Question No. 128 answered with Question No. 102.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Joint Policing Committees Membership","counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500061#WRE02850"},{"type":"question","counter":267,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[31708\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500061#WRE02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will review the qualifications for membership of the joint policing committees to allow the chambers of commerce to be represented.

Under the single procedure, an applicant will make only one application, and will have all grounds for seeking international protection and to be permitted to remain in the State examined and determined in one process.  The single procedure will replace the current multi-layered and sequential protection application system, and this reform is designed to significantly simplify and streamline existing arrangements and allow us to grant international protection in a significantly shorter timeframe to those who are entitled to it while identifying, at a much earlier stage, persons who have no entitlement to stay in the State and who can safely return to their country of origin.  All preparations are currently being made by my Department for the commencement of the Act. <\/p>  <p>  Under the new legislation, a dedicated unit of my Department, to be known as the 'International Protection Office' will be the determining authority at first instance for applications for international protection, replacing the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC).

In this regard significant efforts have been placed on dealing with those who are longest in the system and at this stage the vast majority of those who are over 5 years in the system and who do not have any impediments to progress, such as pending judicial challenges, have now had their cases processed to completion.

This Part, comprising sections 7 to 36, deals with the establishment of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its membership, appointment, functions, staffing and other matters including disqualification or removal from membership.  The Authority comprises eleven members of whom a majority, including the Chairperson, are to be lay persons. <\/p><p>The selection process is intentionally built around a framework of ten prescribed nominating bodies set out in section 9 of the 2015 Act.  This framework was introduced by the Government by way of ensuring the independence of the new Regulatory Authority in terms of both its appointment and its functions.  It also seeks to represent a balance of interests, in the membership of the Authority, between legal practitioners and those clients who avail of their services.<\/p><p>The ten bodies concerned are, the Citizens Information Board; An t&Uacute;daras um Ard-Oideachas; the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission; the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission; the Institute of Legal Costs Accountants; the Consumers Association of Ireland; The Bar Council; the Legal Aid Board; the Honorable Society of the King's Inns and Law Society.  The Law Society has two nominees reflecting the fact that solicitors outnumber barristers being regulated under the 2015 Act by five to one &ndash; upwards of 10,000 practising solicitors as compared to upwards of 2,000 practising barristers.<\/p><p>Each of the prescribed nominating bodies puts forward one primary and one substitute nominee for consideration for membership of the Regulatory Authority under the terms and criteria set out in the 2015 Act.  This includes by reference to their relevant expertise as set out in section 9(3) and with regard to the objective of there being no fewer than four members who are women and four members who are men under section 9 (6).  This is with the exception of the Law Society which, again because of the ratio of solicitors practising in the State which I have just mentioned, puts forward one nominee of each sex.<\/p><p>While members of the new Regulatory Authority are duly appointed by the Government under these procedures, under section 9 (2)(a) of the 2015 Act, a resolution approving such appointment has first to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Resolutions of both Houses approving members of the Authority were passed in July 2016 with resolutions concerning one remaining alternative nominee passed by the Houses on 6 October 2016.<\/p><p>The ten prescribed nominating bodies, therefore, have put forward their nominees under the procedures set out in Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, as appropriate to their functions and objectives as may be set out, in each case, under legislation or under common law.  It is for each of those bodies, in the first instance, to identify their nominees for membership of the new Regulatory Authority under their applicable internal governance procedures.  Specifically, it is for any of these entities which is a private body to competently conduct the indoor management of its board or council and to oversee the conduct of its own business in accordance with its own rules and procedures. <\/p><p>There has been some correspondence on the nominations aspect with my office to which I have replied directly and my Department has, at its own request, received formal written confirmation from the nominating body concerned that it is satisfied that the internal procedures in respect of its nominations to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority were followed.

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. In regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Westmeath Division, on 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 247.  There are also 14 Garda Reserves and 20 Civilians attached to the Westmeath Division. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

","asker":"1263","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>The position is that there are statutory safeguards in place relating to the sale to and the consumption of intoxicating liquor by persons under the age of 18 years.  The law in this area was amended most recently by the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 which amended the Licensing Acts and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 with the aim of tackling excessive consumption of intoxicating liquor as well public disorder and antisocial behaviour. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (as amended), it is an offence for a licence holder to sell or deliver, or permit another person to sell or deliver, intoxicating liquor to a person under 18 years of age.  Moreover, it is an offence for a person to purchase intoxicating liquor for delivery to, or consumption by, a person under the age of 18 years or to deliver intoxicating liquor to such a person, except where the intoxicating liquor is to be consumed in a private residence with the explicit consent of the young person's parent or guardian.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 1988 Act it is also illegal for a person under 18 years to buy intoxicating liquor or to consume it in any place outside their home (or in another person's home where they are present by right or with permission).  Where a Garda suspects that a person is under 18 years and that person, or anyone accompanying that person, is in possession of intoxicating liquor for the purpose of consuming it in a place other than a private dwelling, the Garda may seek an explanation and if not satisfied with the reply, he or she may seize the intoxicating liquor if it is not handed over voluntarily. <\/p>  <p>  The Garda National Age Card scheme is an important proof-of-age mechanism in relation to the sale of intoxicating liquor.  The scheme is administered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and has facilitated the Garda&iacute;, in cooperation with the licensed trade, to address and combat underage consumption of intoxicating liquor.  The 1988 Act, as amended, also makes provision for the test purchasing of intoxicating liquor.  The primary objective of the scheme is to enable the Garda&iacute; to target licensed premises which are suspected of engaging in illegal sales of intoxicating liquor to persons under 18 years of age. <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 (as amended) also permits An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to seize bottles or containers containing intoxicating liquor where there is a reasonable apprehension of public disorder or damage to property and require a person to leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner.  Incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour arising from the abuse of intoxicating liquor are investigated by the Garda&iacute; and dealt with in an appropriate manner, including by caution, fixed charge penalty notices or commencement of proceedings. <\/p>  <p>  As regards introduction of a coding system along the lines suggested by the Deputy, implementation of such a measure and its enforcement could be expected to encounter significant difficulties in practice.  Apart from the administrative costs involved in recording purchasers' details at point of sale, practical difficulties would also arise at retail level in cases where several individual containers are packaged together for sale, e.g. an enclosed six-pack of bottles; a plastic-wrapped tray of cans; or a wooden box containing bottles of wine.  This raises the question of whether a unique code could be attached earlier in the supply or distribution chains rather than at the point of sale.  However, this would create logistical difficulties for importers and distributors and in the case of imports from EU countries, any additional labelling requirements would be regarded as infringing internal market rules relating to free movement of such products.<\/p>  <p>  For the sake of completeness, I should add that the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015, which falls within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Health and is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the Seanad, contains proposals for restrictions in relation to sponsorship and the advertising of intoxicating liquor and confers powers on the Minister for Health to make regulations for the purpose of prohibiting or restricting the sale of intoxicating liquor in certain circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500062#WRF03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Overtime","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500062#WRF03250"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[31957\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500062#WRF03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the cost of Garda overtime in the Dublin metropolitan west region for the period 2011 to 2016; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

This has proven hugely beneficial in attracting increasing numbers of tourist and visitors to our shores.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the BIVS, Ireland has partnered with the UK to enable visa applications to be initially lodged at a large number of centres in China and India and to also have biometrics captured at these centres.  The use of these Centres provides greater accessibility to applicants in these countries as they can make visa applications at locations nearer to them.  They also greatly increase the visibility of Ireland as a destination for tourism, business or education purposes across a wider geographical area in very large countries or countries where our consular representation is not physically present.  For example, in India there are a total of twelve Centres established across the country where applications for both Irish and United Kingdom visas can be made and where initial processing of documentation is carried out.  Similar arrangements apply in China where applications for Irish visas can be submitted in one of thirteen Centres (including Hong Kong).<\/p>  <p>  The applicant can choose the Centre most convenient to their home or business address, and for a small extra charge, can choose to have the visa returned by courier to their home or business address.

Therefore there is no VAT on the fee charged to the patient by the doctor providing the service regardless of whether the doctor is an employee, self-employed or a partner in a medical practice.<\/p><p>In general, the tax treatment of payments to doctors or locum doctors depends on whether the individual is engaged under a contract of service as an employee or under a contract for service as a self-employed taxpayer. If the doctor is self-employed in relation to the services provided, then the individual is assessable under Schedule D, Case II under the self-assessment system. If the doctor provides the medical services as an employee, then his or her remuneration from that engagement is subject to deductions at source under the PAYE system. For example, where a doctor is engaged for short-term work in a GP practice, these engagements are considered to be a contract of service. The locum doctor is an employee and payments made to them by the GP are subject to the appropriate deductions under the PAYE system.

In these circumstances the company does not provide the medical diagnosis or carry out the medical procedures.

This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.<\/p>  <p>  Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of income tax as a separate and unconnected individual. Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, tax credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership, which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.<\/p>  <p>  From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting and it would\u00a0be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.\u00a0 Furthermore, while there may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the partial transferability of the standard rate\u00a0band and\u00a0tax credits,\u00a0their legal status as spouses\/civil partners\u00a0has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.\u00a0To counter tax avoidance, numerous\u00a0restrictive provisions regarding transactions between \"connected persons\" are contained\u00a0in the various Tax Acts and the definition of \"connected persons\" extends to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners.\u00a0Such provisions could be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition.<\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.<\/p>  <p>  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Mr. Leo Varadkar TD. However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples. This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500063#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Help-To-Buy Scheme","counter":366,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500063#WRG01350"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[31620\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500063#WRG01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the new first time buyers scheme announced in budget 2017 is to be made applicable to persons who signed contracts on new homes before 19 July 2016 but only close the sale after 19 July 2016; the position on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[31746\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500063#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"to outline the way the help-to-buy tax rebate for first time buyers will be reckoned in full in the calculation of the deposit required in view of the fact that one of the requirements laid down by the Revenue Commissioners is that mortgage approval details are made available, including loan-to-value ratio, in order to obtain the rebate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":369,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[31747\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500063#WRG01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when, in the process of buying a newly built house, a first time buyer will receive the help-to-buy tax rebate; if it will be when the deposit is placed or when the contract to buy the home is signed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":370,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163, 176 and 177 together.<\/p>  <p>  To be eligible for the Help to Buy scheme, a first-time buyer must\u00a0sign a contract to purchase a new residence on or after 19 July 2016 and on or before 31 December 2019.\u00a0 In the case of a person constructing a new residence on their own behalf (self-build), the first-time buyer must\u00a0draw down the first tranche of the relevant mortgage loan on or after 19 July 2016 and on or before 31 December 2019.\u00a0 The date of 19 July was chosen as it was the date of the launch of 'Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness'.\u00a0 The backdating of the incentive was announced at that time with a view to avoiding any potential interruption in the housing market while purchasers waited for details of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the process for a first-time purchaser will involve two stages.

In making the initial Application, it is anticipated that a person who intends to avail of the scheme may not yet have made his or her final decision regarding the particular residence he or she wishes to purchase or the choice of lending institution. In order to facilitate first-time buyers in making those decisions, Revenue will, following receipt of an Application, and subject to the applicant satisfying the terms of the scheme, notify the applicant of the maximum tax rebate that may be available to them. The prospective purchaser will then be able to share this information with a lending institution when negotiating a loan.<\/p>  <p>  When the purchaser has determined the choice of residence and negotiated their mortgage, they can complete their Claim for Rebate. \u00a0At that stage, they will be in a position to provide Revenue with details of the property, the purchase price and the mortgage approval. \u00a0A key requirement is that the minimum loan-to-value ratio of 70% must be observed.

This shows that\u00a0where a borrower actively engages with their lender with a view to agreeing a sustainable arrangement to address their mortgage arrears, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that borrower will be able to remain in their family home.<table><tr><th colspan=\"7\"><b>Repossessions 2011-2016 - Central Bank Data<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>Primary Dwelling Homes (PDH) Repossessions<\/b><\/td><td>2011<\/td><td>2012<\/td><td>2013<\/td><td>2014<\/td><td>2015<\/td><td>2016 to end Q2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Properties repossessed on foot of an order  <\/td><td>196<\/td><td>194 <\/td><td>251 <\/td><td>315 <\/td><td>726 <\/td><td>240 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Properties voluntarily surrendered\/abandoned<\/td><td>412 <\/td><td>409 <\/td><td>515 <\/td><td>996 <\/td><td>809 <\/td><td>578 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOTAL <\/td><td><b>608 <\/b><\/td><td><b>603 <\/b><\/td><td><b>766 <\/b><\/td><td><b>1,311 <\/b><\/td><td><b>1,535 <\/b><\/td><td><b>818 <\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Buy-to-let (BTL) Repossessions<\/b><\/td><td>2011<\/td><td>*Q3 &amp;amp; Q4 2012<\/td><td>2013<\/td><td>2014<\/td><td>2015<\/td><td>2016 to end Q2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Properties repossessed on foot of an order  <\/td><td><\/td><td>50 <\/td><td>100 <\/td><td>170 <\/td><td>562 <\/td><td>312 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Properties voluntarily surrendered\/abandoned<\/td><td><\/td><td>112 <\/td><td>183 <\/td><td>290 <\/td><td>279 <\/td><td>295 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOTAL<\/td><td><\/td><td><b>162 <\/b><\/td><td><b>283 <\/b><\/td><td><b>460 <\/b><\/td><td><b>841 <\/b><\/td><td><b>607 <\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOTAL PDH &amp;amp; BTL <\/td><td><b>   <\/b><\/td><td><b>765 <\/b><\/td><td><b>1,049 <\/b><\/td><td><b>1,771 <\/b><\/td><td><b>2,376 <\/b><\/td><td><b>1,425 <\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table>*Buy -To- Let Data was only published by the Central Bank from Sept 2012 onwards <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500063#WRG02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Budget Contribution","counter":389,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500063#WRG02950"},{"type":"question","counter":390,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[31554\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500063#WRG03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"to set out the contributions made by the Exchequer to the EU or EEC each year since joining the EEC in 1973; the amounts received by the exchequer from the EEC or EU each year in the same period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":391,"content":"<p>EU Budget payments and public sector receipt data are published annually by the Department of Finance in the Budget Statistics bulletin.

Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes, which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions delivered by fully-qualified professional teachers with the support of special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.<\/p><p>The 1998 Education Act requires Boards of Management of each school to publish the policy of the school relating to participation by students with special educational needs, including students who are exceptionally able.  The measures schools take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan.  It is the duty of the Board of Management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students.<\/p><p>Schools at both primary and post primary level use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able.<\/p><p>The revised primary curriculum recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils.  Syllabi and curricula for second-level schools have been designed in such a way to enable teachers cater for the wide range of pupil ability.<\/p><p>Content is outlined in the curricula at both levels and process is also heavily emphasised.  Enabling children to learn how to learn is stressed and facilitated.  The development of language skills, investigatory and problem-solving skills, higher-order thinking skills and working individually, and as a member of a group, are all encouraged at both levels. <\/p><p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), in collaboration with its counterparts in Northern Ireland, the Council for Curriculum Examination and Assessment (CCEA), produced guidelines entitled &quot;Exceptionally Able Students &ndash;\u00a0Guidelines for Teachers&quot; which issued to all Primary and Post Primary schools in November 2007 along with a questionnaire for feedback. <\/p><p>The NCCA\/CCEA guidelines are designed to raise awareness of the social, emotional and academic needs of exceptionally able students and to assist teachers in planning their teaching and learning.  The guidelines provide advice to schools on identification of gifted children, set out profiles of students, and whole school and classroom strategies and case studies which demonstrate how schools can best meet the needs of such students.  The general strategies include differentiated teaching, acceleration and enrichment approaches in the context of participation in mainstream schools. <\/p><p>Whole School Evaluations (WSEs) are carried out in primary and post-primary schools. During these inspections, the quality of the school management and leadership, the quality of teaching, learning and assessment, and the school's own planning and self-review is evaluated, including\u00a0special education provision.  The way in which schools are inspected during WSE varies somewhat with slightly different processes in primary and post-primary schools.  Sometimes the inspection has a subject or curriculum focus and at other times,\u00a0concentration is on a range of different lessons across a wide range of subjects.  Oral feedback is provided to the school community at the end of these inspections and a printed report which is published on\u00a0my Department's\u00a0website is also provided.<\/p><p>The Special Education Support Service (SESS), under the management of my Department, provides support for teachers to assist them in meeting the needs of all pupils with special educational needs, including those pupils who are exceptionally able.  The service is available to schools who may be seeking advice or support relating to a specific special education issue in the school.  More information on the range of programmes offered by the SESS is available on <i>www.sess.ie<\/i>. <\/p><p>In addition, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), also under the management of my Department, provides training in differentiation, in terms of differentiating for all pupils, whether less able\/more able.

In accordance with Section 38 of that Act, the Council reviews and, where appropriate, accredits programmes of initial teacher education (ITE).  The Council's criteria for accreditation are set out under a range of headings including Programme Inputs, Processes and Outcomes. Under the heading &ldquo;Programme Inputs&rdquo;, programme providers seeking accreditation are required to detail, inter alia, the way in which methodologies, pedagogical content knowledge and studies in relation to philosophy of education are integrated into their programmes.<\/p>  <p>  In carrying out its statutory accreditation role, the Teaching Council seeks to ensure a level of consistency across all ITE programmes provided in Ireland.  This does not imply uniformity, and it is open to providers of ITE programmes to incorporate different philosophies of education, including Montessori education, into their programmes of Initial Teacher Education.  As such, there is considerable variety across programmes, and the Teaching Council welcomes this.<\/p>  <p>  The Teaching Council has considered how Montessori education can be best positioned in the continuum of teacher education, and has consulted and recently met with Montessori teacher educators with the ultimate aim of supporting students' learning. It understands that a provider is currently considering a redesign to its programme so that it might meet the Teaching Council's ITE criteria, and its graduates could be eligible to register as primary teachers.  The Council is happy to engage further with the provider in question, and awaits a submission applying for accreditation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500066#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Supply","counter":550,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500066#WRK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":551,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[31971\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500066#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide EpiPens to primary and post-primary schools (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1357","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":552,"content":"<p>The question of whether\u00a0medication such as EpiPens should be made available to schools is primarily a public health matter and would therefore be a matter for the Department of Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500066#WRK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Site Acquisitions","counter":553,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500066#WRK02000"},{"type":"question","counter":554,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[31974\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500066#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the delay in land acquisition for a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1279","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":555,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, a site acquisition process in respect of a building project for the school to which he refers is currently underway.<\/p><p>This acquisition\u00a0process is currently at\u00a0conveyancing stage and is very well advanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500066#WRK02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Delays","counter":556,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500066#WRK02300"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[31995\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500066#WRK02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason a SUSI application was delayed pending a document from the Revenue Commissioners despite having the document already (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":558,"content":"<p>As part of a comprehensive customer service and communications strategy provided by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI), to ensure that all necessary avenues are open to applicants to receive the information they need, a dedicated email and phone line service is provided by SUSI for Oireachtas members.

Acquisition and leasing options are also available to local authorities to ensure that households needing accommodation may be provided with that accommodation. <\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, has overall responsibility for regional and rural matters and is advancing a broadly-based rural development strategy, in the context of<i>A Programme for a Partnership Government.<\/i>In conjunction with this overarching Strategy, the development of a rural resettlement programme will be considered further in the context of taking forward the range of measures set out in the <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i><i>Action Plan<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500066#WRK05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":587,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500066#WRK05400"},{"type":"question","counter":588,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[31606\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500066#WRK05500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the cost per annum of all private sector rental schemes since 1991, including, but not limited to, the rental accommodation scheme, the housing assistance payment, the social housing current expenditure programme, previously the leasing scheme, and expenditure on emergency accommodation, in tabular form.","asker":"1259","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":589,"content":"<p>The information requested is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy in accordance with Standing Orders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500066#WRK05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":590,"content":"<p>Question No. 241 answered with Question No. 237.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Issues","counter":591,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500066#WRK05800"},{"type":"question","counter":592,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[31474\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500066#WRK05900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if there are supports from his Department for a person who was in the process of buying a house until they were made redundant recently.","asker":"1250","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":593,"content":"<p>It is open to households who have difficulty in meeting their housing needs to apply to their local authority for social housing support.

As the Board was established to take cases out of the Courts, it endeavours to secure enforcement initially by non-judicial means. <\/p>  <p>  While there is no legal obligation on the RTB to enforce, the Board takes the issue of non-compliance with determination orders very seriously.  In 2015 alone, it referred 312 cases to its legal advisors for enforcement proceedings.  It is also open to parties to pursue enforcement independently through the Courts, including the seeking of a garnishee order.  It should be noted that going to Court does not of itself ensure successful enforcement and more particularly, recoupment, of an award.

It is anticipated that other local authorities will come into the scheme on a rolling basis, with full roll-out expected within 6 months.   <\/p>  <p>  AHBs have a proven record in managing the refurbishment of properties and being good landlords puts them in an excellent position to play a key role in the success of the scheme.

Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or the AHB.  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.   <\/p>  <p>  A property owner can either choose to arrange a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.

The declaration can be made on-line at <i>www.motortax.ie<\/i>or through the local motor tax office.  The National Vehicle and Driver File, under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, issues renewal notices at the beginning of the final month of tax or a previously made declaration of non-use to remind motorists that the vehicle must be taxed or declared off the road for a further period.<\/p><p>Where a declaration of non-use is not made in the final month of a tax disc or previously made declaration of non-use, a vehicle must be taxed for the minimum period provided for in motor tax legislation for the category of vehicle concerned.  A new declaration can then be made at any stage during the final month of the new motor tax disc if the vehicle is thereafter not going to be in use in a public place.<\/p><p>These arrangements were well publicised at the time of introduction of the legislation.<\/p><p>The legislation does not provide for exemptions from the foregoing requirements.  This is to protect the revised arrangements; allowing an owner to declare a vehicle off the road after the expiry of a current declaration of non-use could potentially be a move back to the system of retrospective declarations, thereby undermining the overall objective of the legislative change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500068#WRM02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes","counter":696,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500068#WRM02050"},{"type":"question","counter":697,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[31947\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500068#WRM02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if there is a national policy in relation to the granting of planning permission for developments in towns and villages where OPW flood relief schemes have been completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":698,"content":"<p>The decision as to whether to grant planning permission in any particular case is a matter for the relevant planning authority in the first instance and for An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the event of an appeal.<\/p><p>In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including current guidelines issued by my Department under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended). <\/p><p>In November 2009, my Department issued Guidelines for Planning Authorities on the Planning System and Flood Risk Management which are aimed at ensuring a more consistent, rigorous and systematic approach to flood risk identification, assessment and management within the planning system. <\/p><p>These guidelines provide, <i>inter alia<\/i>, that development in areas at risk of flooding, particularly floodplains, should be avoided, unless there are wider sustainability grounds that justify appropriate development and where the risk can be reduced or managed to an acceptable level.

In this regard, the Programme incorporates a range of specific actions to help address vacancy and dereliction, for example, proposals to:<\/p>  <p>  - introduce a similar scheme to the &ldquo;Living City Initiative&rdquo; to regenerate town centres and villages throughout the country;<\/p>  <p>  - establish a national register of derelict sites, in addition to the register of vacant sites required under the new vacant site levy provisions, to bring vacant and under-utilised sites into beneficial use for housing and regeneration purposes;<\/p>  <p>  - mandate local authorities with better land management powers, including the possibility of additional Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) capabilities;<\/p>  <p>  - reclassify and incentivise the use of under-utilised or vacant areas over ground-floor premises in towns, for both residential and commercial use; and<\/p>  <p>  - reform the Derelict Sites Act 1990, and tackle the under-use and hoarding of derelict land by the State, semi-State and private sectors. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Action 5.1 of the Government's Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness - Rebuilding Ireland undertakes to develop a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy by early 2017.  To this end, the Housing Agency, which has lead responsibility for co-ordinating the development of the Strategy, has established a working group with senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself.  Its first meeting was held on 30 September and it is due to meet again later this month. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Housing Agency are liaising with local authorities and with the Central Statistics Office in order to obtain a better understanding of the numbers, characteristics and reasons why homes are vacant.  A number of local authorities have commenced, or are planning to commence, pilot programmes to identify vacant homes and bring them back into use; these pilot programmes will inform the Strategy.  In addition, the Strategy will be informed by international best practice and experience, and research is being undertaken in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, a number of new initiatives have recently been announced which specifically target vacant properties.  The new Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) is aimed at assisting local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to bring vacant private houses into social housing use, providing homes for families on local authority waiting lists.  The new Scheme will operate initially in Waterford and Carlow and my Department will work closely with other local authorities to roll it out around the country over the course of the next six months.  I have secured &euro;140 million for the successful implementation of this Scheme over the next five years.  This Scheme has significant potential and I am hopeful that it can bring at least 3,500 vacant houses back into productive use between now and 2021. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, under a new &ldquo;Buy and Renew&rdquo; initiative, my Department will support local authorities and AHBs to purchase private housing units in need of remediation, and renew them with the aim of making them available for social housing use. \u00a0An initial capital provision of &euro;25 million will be available for this initiative in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the question of supports to obtain CPOs to buy key vacant and derelict sites, it should be noted that a large number of State bodies and authorities already have CPO powers, all of which are underpinned by different statutes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500068#WRM02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing","counter":705,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500068#WRM02650"},{"type":"question","counter":706,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[32019\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500068#WRM02700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the amount his Department has allocated in 2016 for the refurbishment of vacant local authority social housing units; the number of applications for funding for\u00a0vacant\u00a0social housing refurbishment that were received by his Department in 2016; the local authorities which these were from and the number of units; and the number of applications for individual units which were refused.

The 2011 Regulations set the maximum net income limits for each housing authority in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.<\/p>  <p>  The determination of the bands and the authority area assigned to each band was based on a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation and takes account of the variation in the cost of private rented accommodation across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The principle used to determine what was reasonably affordable for any household was the relationship of household income to the cost of providing suitable accommodation in the private sector, where the percentage of net income required in order to pay for accommodation costs did not exceed 30%. <\/p>  <p>  The limits set in 2011 also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all housing authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge.

A &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment for all social welfare payments will commence from March, with proportionate increases for qualified adults and those on reduced rates of payment (including jobseekers on age-related reduced rates of payment).  <\/p>  <p>  Approximately 1.5 million people will benefit from this increase, from pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents, maternity and paternity benefit recipients and jobseekers.<\/p>  <p>  Jobseeker's allowance (JA) and Supplementary Welfare Allowance claimants under the age of 26 generally receive age-related reduced rates of payment.  Age-related reduced rates of payment do not apply in certain circumstances, however, such as when the claimant has a dependent child, or transferred to JA from Disability Allowance, or was in State care during the 12 months prior to applying for JA.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing the &euro;100 and &euro;144 rates by &euro;5 per week, instead of proportionate increases, would cost an additional &euro;3 million in a full year.  This includes the cost of increasing the qualified adult rates from &euro;100 to &euro;105 per week in the case of those on the &euro;100 rate, and from &euro;124.80 to &euro;128.10 per week, for those on the &euro;144 rate.  <\/p>  <p>  The long-standing practice of my Department is to award proportionate increases for people who are on reduced rates of payment and for qualified adults.  If the full increase was awarded to some categories of people on reduced rates, and not to others, this would not be fair to others on reduced rates of payment.  <\/p>  <p>  The rationale for having reduced rates of payment for young jobseekers in receipt of a means-tested jobseeker's payment is to prevent young people from entering welfare dependency by providing a strong financial incentive to take up a job, or a training or education programme.<\/p>  <p>  Financial incentives already exist for young people taking up education, training and employment supports.  Young people participating in employment programmes such as Community Employment, T&uacute;s and Gateway already receive the full adult rate of payment, which is currently &euro;210.50 per week and will rose to &euro;215.50 next year. <\/p>  <p>  From next September, when a young jobseeker participates in my Department's Back to Education scheme, he or she will be entitled to receive the full maximum rate of jobseeker's payment which will then be &euro;193 per week (for people of any age), as against the &euro;160 which they are currently on. <\/p>  <p>  This 21% increase represents an extra &euro;33 a week, and demonstrates the State's support for young jobseekers who seek to enhance their skills.  The rate payable to young jobseeker's who participate on Solas training courses is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  The number of young people on the Live Register on jobseekers payments was close to 90,000 in 2010 and is now down to 34,000.  There is a continuing strong downward trend this year with the numbers down from 42,000 to 34,000 since the beginning of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Youth unemployment has fallen by 5 percentage points in the last year alone and it is now below the EU average.  Of course more remains to be done and I am determined that we help more young people in the most effective way possible, by helping them into the workforce or education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500069#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Personal Micro Credit Scheme","counter":732,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500069#WRN00450"},{"type":"question","counter":733,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[32105\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500069#WRN00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the action his Department has taken to assist the credit unions in the roll out and extension of the personal microcredit scheme, as promised in the programme for Government.","asker":"1327","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":734,"content":"<p>A Personal Micro Credit Scheme providing for small scale loans by Credit Unions to borrowers who have difficulty accessing low cost credit has been piloted in 30 credit unions.

The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for the necessary amendments to increase the State pension age in line with the National Pensions Framework as set out in the EU\/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  It provided for an increase in the age for qualification for the State Pension from 66 years to 67 years from 2021, and a further increase to 68 years from 2028.  It also discontinued the State Pension (Transition) for new claimants with effect from 1 January 2014.<\/p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  While its abolition would not realise that saving in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments (although at a lower rate than that of the State pension), and some may have claimed an Increase for a Qualified Adult on their spouse's pensions, it is estimated that well over half of that cost may have been saved each year as a result of this measure.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 is likely to be in the region of &euro;75-80 million.<\/p>  <p>  2. &ldquo;Developing the National Pensions System &ndash; Final Report of the National Pensions Board&rdquo; published in 1993, recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 (i.e. 10 years) and the necessary legislation to effect these recommendations was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997 which provided for their implementation in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002, rising to 520 from April 2012.<\/p>  <p>  At the time this measure was introduced, the Exchequer annual savings were expected to be in the region of &euro;6m per annum in the short term, but rising substantially on a cumulative basis in the long term.  It is not possible to state how much has been saved by this change now, as people who are below the current threshold will not generally make a claim to SPC.<\/p>  <p>  3. As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for SPC were introduced.  The new bands, which replaced the bands which were in place from 2000-2012, more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to these changes, someone with a yearly average of 47 contributions qualified for the same rate of payment (98% of the maximum rate) as someone with a yearly average of only 20 contributions, despite generally their much more significant PRSI record, and regardless of their means.  A person with an average of 48-52 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 more than someone with a yearly average of 20 PRSI contributions.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the exchequer savings arising from the current rate bands (relative to the ones in place from 2000-2012) will be at least &euro;50 million in 2017, and that this will rise at a rate of some &euro;10m annually.  This figure represents only the savings in respect of current SPC claims, and does not include savings where the person has claimed an alternative payment as a result of the bands, such as a Non-Contributory Pension or an Increase for a Qualified Adult.<\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a full rate SPC, they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;222, which is 95% of the maximum rate of the SPC.  Alternatively, if a person's spouse or civil partner is in receipt of an SPC they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;209, which is 90% of the maximum personal rate of the SPC.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500069#WRN02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions Payments","counter":756,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500069#WRN02050"},{"type":"question","counter":757,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[31529\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500069#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the estimated annual cost of providing the full rate of contributory pension to all recipients of the reduced rate of the state pension contributory; and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"1318","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":758,"content":"<p>The State pension (contributory) SPC is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.    <\/p>  <p>  A yearly average of 48-52 weeks contributions is required to qualify for a 100% rate pension of &euro;233.30, and banded payments apply for those with lower yearly averages.  For example, where someone entered insurable employment aged 16 and had 2,000 weekly contributions (38.5 years) paid and\/or credited, they would have a yearly average of 40, and would receive a pension at 98% of the full rate (for those in the 40-47 band).<\/p>  <p>  People who qualify for lower band rates may, if they satisfy the means-test, qualify for the State pension (non-contributory), the maximum rate of which is 95% that of the State pension (contributory).<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that the additional cost of paying all current State pension (contributory) payments at the maximum rate would amount to just over &euro;309 million per annum.  However, this would not be the full cost to the Social Insurance Fund of such a move.  These costings do not take into account people who qualify for a reduced rate of State Pension Contributory, but instead are paid a State Pension (non-contributory), or an Increase for Qualified Adult payment, due to receiving a more favourable rate.  It is thought that a significant number of such pensioners would qualify for a full rate State pension contributory instead, if that became payable to everyone who satisfied the relevant criteria, and that the additional cost of that change could be expected to be quite significant.<\/p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the 'yearly average' system with a 'total contributions approach'.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from around 2020.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior its implementation.  The position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons will be considered very carefully in developing this reform.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500069#WRN02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Assist Scheme","counter":759,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500069#WRN02250"},{"type":"question","counter":760,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[31530\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500069#WRN02300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if the new farm assist criteria announced in budget 2017 will be applied to new farm assist applications; if not, the date when the new criteria will come into effect; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":761,"content":"<p>The farm assist scheme provides support for farmers on low incomes and is similar to jobseeker's allowance.

There are currently some 80 persons receiving this allowance.<\/p><p>Expenditure figures for the both rent supplement and the rent allowance scheme from 1999 to date are provided in the attached tabular statement; expenditure data for the years 1991 to 1998 is not maintained.<\/p><p><b>Tabular Statement<\/b><\/p><p><b>Table 1 - Rent Supplement: Expenditure: 1999 to Present<\/b><table><tr><th><b>Year<\/b><\/th><th><b>Cost &euro;000<\/b><\/th><th><b>% Change<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>1999<\/b><\/td><td>128,240<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2000<\/b><\/td><td>150,590<\/td><td>17.4%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2001<\/b><\/td><td>179,438<\/td><td>19.2%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2002<\/b><\/td><td>252,203<\/td><td>40.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2003<\/b><\/td><td>331,471<\/td><td>31.4%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2004<\/b><\/td><td>353,762<\/td><td>6.7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2005<\/b><\/td><td>368,705<\/td><td>4.2%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2006<\/b><\/td><td>388,339<\/td><td>5.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2007<\/b><\/td><td>391,466<\/td><td>0.8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2008<\/b><\/td><td>440,548<\/td><td>12.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2009<\/b><\/td><td>510,751<\/td><td>15.9%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2010 <\/b><\/td><td>516,538<\/td><td>1.2%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2011<\/b><\/td><td>502,747<\/td><td>-2.7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2012<\/b><\/td><td>422,536<\/td><td>-16%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2013 <\/b><\/td><td>372,909<\/td><td>-12%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2014<\/b><\/td><td>338,208<\/td><td>-9.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2015<\/b><\/td><td>311,059<\/td><td>-8%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>Table 2- Rent Allowance: Expenditure: 1999 to present<\/b><table><tr><th><b>Year<\/b><\/th><th><b>Cost &euro;000<\/b><\/th><th><b>% Change<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>1999<\/b><\/td><td>599<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2000<\/b><\/td><td>761<\/td><td>27.0%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2001<\/b><\/td><td>736<\/td><td>-3.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2002<\/b><\/td><td>666<\/td><td>-9.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2003<\/b><\/td><td>675<\/td><td>1.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2004<\/b><\/td><td>754<\/td><td>11.7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2005<\/b><\/td><td>855<\/td><td>13.4%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2006<\/b><\/td><td>839<\/td><td>-1.8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2007<\/b><\/td><td>792<\/td><td>-5.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2008<\/b><\/td><td>732<\/td><td>-7.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2009<\/b><\/td><td>725<\/td><td>-1.0%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2010 <\/b><\/td><td>804<\/td><td>10.9%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2011<\/b><\/td><td>700<\/td><td>-12.9%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2012<\/b><\/td><td>663<\/td><td>-5.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2013 <\/b><\/td><td>653<\/td><td>-1.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2014<\/b><\/td><td>530<\/td><td>-18.8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2015<\/b><\/td><td>550<\/td><td>3.8%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500070#WRO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Eligibility","counter":791,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500070#WRO00500"},{"type":"question","counter":792,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[31623\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500070#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the financial assistance available to a person (details supplied) who has recently commenced a course and was previously on jobseeker's allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":793,"content":"<p><b><\/b>The person concerned is currently a student attending a full time third level college course.

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under that scheme.  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory.  One of the conditions of the State pension (contributory) is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  <\/p><p>Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim. <\/p><p>Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p><p>Work is underway to replace the 'yearly average' system with a 'total contributions approach'.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from around 2020.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior its implementation.  The position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons will be considered very carefully in developing this reform. <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500071#WRP00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":857,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500071#WRP00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":856,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500071#WRP00350"},{"type":"question","counter":857,"qnumday":334,"qnumall":"[31498\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500071#WRP00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will consider introducing a less expensive shorter-term passport renewal system for older persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":858,"content":"<p>It is the norm internationally to issue passports of a ten year standard period of validity to all adults.

At the Foreign Affairs Council meeting, Ireland and the EU strongly condemned the excessive and disproportionate attacks by the regime and its allies against civilians.  Ministers also called on Russia to demonstrate all efforts to halt indiscriminate bombing by the Syrian regime, restore a cessation of hostilities, ensure immediate humanitarian access and create the conditions for a credible and inclusive political transition.  This is critical to save the lives of Syrian citizens, particularly those who remain in Aleppo.  Ministers were also united that the situation in Syria should be referred to the International Criminal Court in order to ensure legal accountability for the victims of the unspeakable crimes that have been committed against them.  I believe that the only viable and sustainable way forward remains a comprehensive end to violence and a Syrian-own and Syrian-led political resolution, based on a real political transition process.  That remains my objective and that of the EU, and is reflected in the conclusions adopted by the FAC. <\/p>  <p>  Ministers also exchanged views on the follow up to and implementation of the EU Global Strategy (EUGS).  I stressed the need to carry forward work on each of the elements of the Strategy &ndash; including our approach to resolution of conflicts and crises - in an integrated way.  I also welcomed the commitment in the Strategy to continue to mainstream human rights; women, peace and security and gender equality in EU policies.  These two important elements were reflected in the Conclusions adopted by EU Foreign Ministers.  The security and defence aspects of the Strategy will be presented to Foreign and Defence Ministers at the November FAC meeting.  This will focus on enhancing the EU's peace-keeping capacity in support of the United Nations through the further development of the Common Security and Defence Policy as defined in the Lisbon Treaty.<\/p>  <p>  The Council discussed progress in implementing the EU response to the migration crisis.  The EU has made a lot of progress in the past 18 months; however, this needs to be complemented by a more determined and coherent effort to address the root causes of recent mass migration to Europe.  Strengthening our collective capacity to promote and protect human rights, development cooperation, conflict resolution and global governance externally will help build societies that are more responsive to their citizens' needs.

The conflict in Syria is the greatest humanitarian crisis of our generation.  Since 2012, Ireland has provided a total of &euro;62 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria and the region.  At present, it is Ireland's largest response to any humanitarian crisis. <\/p>  <p>  At last week's European Council, EU leaders strongly condemned the ongoing aerial attacks on Aleppo by the Syrian regime and Russia and urged both states to bring an immediate end to the atrocities being committed.  They repeated calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities and stressed that all necessary steps be taken to ensure humanitarian access to Syria.  The need to ensure that those who have committed atrocities and breached humanitarian law are held to account was also highlighted.  The question of sanctions in response to Russian and Syrian actions in Aleppo was also discussed.  It was agreed that the EU would consider all available options should the atrocities against the people of Aleppo continue.   <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach stressed Ireland's concerns over the crisis in Syria and in Aleppo in particular.  I would underline that Russia is bound by international law to ensure the protection of the civilian population and unimpeded humanitarian access.<\/p>  <p>  Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU's humanitarian response in Syria.  The EU is a leading donor in the international response to the Syrian crisis, and has pledged to contribute &euro;445 million in humanitarian assistance in 2016. The EU's funding inside Syria is focused on providing medical emergency relief, protection, food and nutritional assistance, water, sanitation and hygiene, shelter, health, and logistics services to civilians in need.

This joint EU-UN initiative includes two main elements: firstly, to facilitate the urgent delivery of basic life-saving assistance to civilians in eastern Aleppo; and secondly, to ensure the medical evacuations of wounded and sick, with a focus on women, children and the elderly. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland and our EU partners will continue to monitor the situation closely, and given its complexity and severity, I would expect that Ireland will provide additional support for people affected by the crisis in the coming months. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500071#WRP02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid Provision","counter":895,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500071#WRP02950"},{"type":"question","counter":896,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[32085\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500071#WRP03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which previous commitments towards the alleviation of hardship in Haiti in the wake of the earthquake disaster of some years ago have been honoured in full by each EU country; if a better response can be achieved in the aftermath of the recent hurricane there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":897,"content":"<p>On 12 January 2010, Haiti was struck by one of the most devastating earthquakes in recent history, causing some 230,000 deaths and 300,000 injuries.  The earthquake destroyed much of Port-au-Prince and the surrounding areas, left about 1.5 million people homeless and caused losses estimated at &euro;5.9 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Two months after the earthquake, the international community pledged US $4.5 billion at a donor conference in New York in response to a UN appeal for $1.5 billion.  UN figures indicate that, by the end of 2014, $3.52 billion had been provided.  <\/p>  <p>  Many donors however, were slow to release funds and aid did reach all affected communities.  There have been numerous reviews of aid delivery to Haiti post-earthquake and the findings were that the international community could have responded quicker and more effectively.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, however, met its commitments to the people of Haiti in full. By the end of 2012, Ireland's pledge of &euro;13 million had been exceeded, with support reaching almost &euro;14 million.  In total, in the period 2010-2015, Ireland provided &euro;23.9 million in humanitarian and longer term development funding to Haiti.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2010, the European Commission has provided a total of &euro;272.95 million to assist victims of the earthquake, responding to humanitarian needs and supporting the improvement of basic social services.  A key focus of support was to strengthen local capacities in disaster preparedness. <\/p>  <p>  Although there has been significant progress since the 2010 earthquake, including the rebuilding of infrastructure and the restoration of livelihoods, Haiti remains vulnerable to natural hazards, such as Hurricane Matthew in recent weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  The impact of Hurricane Matthew has been devastating, causing widespread flooding, damage and displacement.  Through the leadership of the Government of Haiti, the international community has responded rapidly to address urgent humanitarian requirements, while also considering the longer terms needs of the affected communities.   <\/p>  <p>  Ireland responded quickly and effectively.  Through Irish Aid, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade organised an airlift of humanitarian supplies from Ireland's prepositioned stocks in Panama, to provide relief to 1,000 families in one of the worst affected areas.  So far, Ireland has provided &euro;1.76 million in funding to longstanding NGO partners, best placed to respond in Haiti for the provision of life saving assistance, including shelter, water, sanitation and health activities, and distribution of food.  A further airlift of non-food emergency supplies is planned.<\/p>  <p>  The UN issued a Flash Appeal seeking $119 million for the provision of life-saving assistance to 750,000 people over the coming three months.  The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund has released $5 million to address urgent needs. Ireland last year provided a total of &euro;11.75 million to the Central Emergency Relief Fund, and is its eighth highest donor.<\/p>  <p>  The EU Civil Protection Mechanism was also activated in response to a request from the Government of Haiti.  This led to the deployment of a Civil Protection Team, with twelve experts from five countries.  Ireland's Rapid Response Corps, managed by my Department, stands ready to deploy.  The EU has released funding of &euro;1.75 million in response to the hurricane.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the UN, the EU and the international community remains vital, ensuring that the people of Haiti can recover quickly and rebuild their livelihoods.

There is also a serious developing trend of forcing young girls to engage in suicide bombings.<\/p>  <p>  While exact numbers of those abducted is difficult to confirm, the UN estimates that thousands of women and children have been abducted by Boko Haram since 2012.  As of February 2016, 1,010 of these children had been rescued. Ireland, with our EU partners, continues to call for all parties to work together in securing the release of those that have been abducted. <\/p>  <p>  In particular, Ireland has consistently called for the release of the Chibok Schoolgirls, who were abducted in April 2014.  In that regard, I welcome the recent news of the release of 21 of the girls and join with my EU colleagues in congratulating Nigeria on the success of the negotiations.  I also commend Switzerland and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for their important role in facilitating this process. The release has brought the total number of the Chibok Schoolgirls freed in 2016 to 22.<\/p>  <p>  While it is the responsibility of the Nigerian Government to ensure that a secure environment is provided to its citizens, Ireland, in cooperation with our EU partners, has continued to support the Nigerian Government in its efforts.

Ireland is experiencing intense competition globally and from private providers for nursing and medical personnel due to this shortage, and the international standing of Irish nursing and medical graduates. While a number of innovative measures have been taken to support recruitment and retention of health employees, it is not considered feasible to give effect to the Deputy's proposal given employees rights to free movement.  <\/p>  <p>  The ability of the HSE and the health service to attract and retain high quality frontline staff shapes the extent to which the HSE can maintain and develop the health services. The MacCraith Group, established  in 2013 to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures, made a series of recommendations aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system and planning for future needs. The implementation of the Group's recommendations is being actively pursued and monitored. Doctors in training actively participate in the implementation and monitoring of these recommendations through the Forum of Irish Medical Postgraduate Training Bodies Trainee Sub Committee.<\/p>  <p>  A number of specific measures have been taken in relation to pay that will support the recruitment and retention of Irish nursing and midwifery graduates. Measures to date  include the first stage of pay restoration under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, additional pay in return for taking on some duties from doctors and an increase in the rate of pay for the student nursing placement to 70% of the first point of the staff nurse pay scale.<\/p>  <p>  This month the Government approved restoration of incremental credit for all nurses in respect of the 36 week clinical placement undertaken by fourth year student nurses in the context of the 2017 Estimates. This decision means that all nurses and midwives will have incremental credit for the 36 week placement restored from 1 January 2017, restoration of the credit to 2016 and future graduates having been approved earlier this year. It is estimated that the inclusion of 2011 to 2015 graduates will benefit around 4,000 nurses who are currently working within the public health service and potentially another 3,000 who may wish to return to the public system in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is focused on offering graduating nurses and midwives permanent posts and on replacing agency staff with permanent staff. Recruitment of additional nurses is the subject of considerable ongoing activity by the HSE and voluntary hospitals.  Recruitment campaigns are underway in Ireland and abroad with a relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 available to nurses who return from overseas. Campaigns include recent and ongoing international, national and local interviewing of General Nurses, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Children's nurses and midwives. <\/p>  <p>  There was an increase of 3,661 personnel employed in the public health service (101,917 to 105,578) between August 2015 and August 2016.

These beds will continue to be very much needed over the coming years as the number of older people increases in line with demographic trends.  It is therefore essential that they are put on a sustainable footing and that the fabric of the buildings from which they operate is modernised and improved. <\/p>  <p>  The Capital Programme announced earlier this year provides for the replacement and refurbishment of public nursing homes across the country over the next five years.  Significant work was undertaken by the HSE in determining the most appropriate scheduling of projects over the 5 year period from 2016 to 2021, within the phased provision of funding, to achieve compliance and registration with the Health Information and Quality Authority.<\/p>  <p>  Under this Capital Programme it is proposed to deliver a 130 bed unit at Letterkenny to replace the 3 units referred to by the Deputy in Donegal. All healthcare infrastructure developments, including this development, must comply with relevant Public Sector Guidelines and EU Directives and will require a lead-in time to complete the various stages.  This includes appraisal, project brief, design feasibility, detailed design, and finalisation of financing and review of costing estimates.  <\/p>  <p>  There has been no proposal to close any of the units in question. However, they may not be suitable for upgrading to the Standards required by HIQA for long stay residential care.  Given the requirement for additional services to provide for the needs for older persons right around the country, including Donegal, there will, in parallel with residential beds, be an on-going need for the provision of short stay services, such as rehabilitation, respite, step up, step down facilities, all with a view of maintaining older people in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  It is in the context of this planning for the coming years that the future use and purpose of the current buildings in Ramelton, Lifford and Stranorlar will be considered in order to ensure that an appropriate service is provided for the older people living in their own community in Donegal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500075#WRT01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Recruitment","counter":1128,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500075#WRT01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1129,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[31661\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500075#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a unit (details supplied) is to be staffed; if a recruitment process has started; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1130,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community. Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.<\/p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>'Transforming Lives'<\/i>, the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.

The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women. I want to provide assurances to these young women and their families that they are eligible to seek medical attention and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms. The HSE are currently developing a care pathway for young people who are experiencing these types of symptoms and will be in a position to facilitate access to specialist services tailored to the needs of each individual.<\/p>  <p>  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the same time that they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter's condition.<\/p>  <p>  The vaccine used in the school immunisation programme is Gardasil and over 220,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction.  Gardasil is a fully tested vaccine which was licensed by the European Medicines Agency in 2006.<\/p>  <p>  While no medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised nationally and at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review, in which the Health Products Regulatory Authority participated, focused on two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.  The review found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions.  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the EMA stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information which is now binding in all member states.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the issue referred to by the Deputy it concerns a complaint made by the Nordic Cochrane Centre concerning the EMA.  The EMA is a decentralised agency of the European Union (EU) responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on any complaint made by a third party concerning an EU agency. <\/p>  <p>  Health care professionals are advised to continue using HPV vaccines in accordance with the current product information and I would encourage all young women to receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500076#WRU03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Obesity Strategy","counter":1219,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500076#WRU03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1220,"qnumday":454,"qnumall":"[31883\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500076#WRU03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of bariatric surgery in the State; if, following the publication of A Healthy Weight for Ireland - Obesity Policy and Action Plan, there will be additional funding for such surgery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1330","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1221,"content":"<p>Bariatric services are provided in three public hospitals &ndash; St Vincent's University Hospital (SVUH) in Dublin, St. Columcille's Hospital (SCH) and Galway University Hospital (GUH). <\/p><p>A multidisciplinary weight management clinic is run in SCH with patients requiring surgery being referred to SVUH.

The Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff\u00a0schemes support the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind. In 2015, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has estimated that\u00a025.3% of electricity was generated by renewable sources, of which 22.8% was generated by onshore wind.\u00a0<\/font><\/p><p>In addition to our onshore wind resource, bioenergy, solar, offshore wind and other technologies may play a critical role in diversifying our renewable generation portfolio over the period to 2030.

In-depth economic analysis is underway to inform the actual cost of a new scheme and, while no decision has been taken on the precise renewable technologies to be supported, the cost and technical viability of solar photovoltaic (PV), bio-energy and offshore wind are being examined as part of the assessment process. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">While I am aware that there have been some recent competitive bids for offshore wind in other EU members states which is to be welcomed, it would be important to understand whether this is a one-off phenomenon or indicative of an underlying trend. If it is the latter, and the price continues to fall,\u00a0then the Deputy will appreciate it is vitally important that if a support tariff is to be offered for offshore wind it is struck at a level that is competitive and minimises the cost to consumers.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">  Once the detailed economic analysis is complete, there will be an additional public consultation phase on the design of the new scheme.

Article 29.8 which states that the State may exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction in accordance with the generally recognised principles of international law, does not appear to be relevant in the context of CETA.  <\/p>  <p>  CETA is an international agreement that will not be part of the domestic law of the State.  Notwithstanding this, the Constitution sets down a number of substantial and procedural requirements that must be strictly followed whenever an international agreement is being concluded.  In accordance with Article 29.4.1 of the Constitution, the conclusion of CETA is an exercise of the executive power of the State in connection with its external relations and is therefore concluded by, or on the authority of the Government.  <\/p>  <p>  Article 29.5.1 provides that every international agreement to which the State becomes a party shall be laid before D&aacute;il Eireann.  Article 29.5.2 provides that the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement have been approved by D&aacute;il Eireann.  CETA is an international agreement between Canada, the EU and the EU Member States.  Consequently, the provisions of Article 29.5 of the Constitution apply to CETA.  Article 29.5 does not provide any role for Seanad Eireann in this process.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, the Council Decision provides that the provisions in CETA in relation to investment protection and investment dispute resolution will be excluded from provisional application.  However upon full entry into force, involving the approval of all 28 Member States, CETA provides for the establishment of a permanent Tribunal of fifteen Members to hear claims for violation of the investment protection standards established in the Agreement.  The operation of this Tribunal could give rise to a possible charge on public funds as part of the EU Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500082#WRAA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Workplace Relations Commission","counter":1612,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500082#WRAA03650"},{"type":"question","counter":1613,"qnumday":593,"qnumall":"[31743\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500082#WRAA03700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of workplace inspections by sector in 2015 and in the latest period in 2016 for which figures are available; the total amount of wages recovered by sector in these periods; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1614,"content":"<p>The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) was established on 1<sup>st<\/sup>October 2015 under the Workplace Relations Act 2015.

This attendance snapshot window of 4 weeks is an expansion on the one week permitted in previous years.

When the Bands have been assigned and approved on the PIP system, the parents, through their childcare service providers, will have a further 4 weeks in which to appeal their Band decision.

However, on the other hand, the community providers running the CCS programme are informed of their annual CCS allocation based on the verification process, which may or may not increase following appeals.  The childcare service may then organise their financial planning for the year.  Their CCS funding for the year may only decrease if the service manager releases the CCS funding if a child leaves or if they choose to close earlier in the year than planned.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to add that the Department is currently looking at the possibility of providing more flexibility for community childcare providers with regard to the submission of registrations under the CCS programme in advance of the introduction of the Single Affordable Childcare Programme which should allow for rolling registrations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500083#WRBB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Funding","counter":1643,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500083#WRBB01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1644,"qnumday":604,"qnumall":"[31519\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500083#WRBB01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if, in view of the increased funding of 5.5% to &euro;712.9 million to Tusla, she will ensure that funding of &euro;21 million is made available to the family resource centres to cover their programme costs for 2017 as identified by the FRC national forum; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1645,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, I recently announced a significant increase in the funding allocation to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency for next year.

The Committee has an advisory and consultative role to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in matters to do with youth work, including the coordination of youth work programmes and services.  In line with these provisions, a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee was appointed by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with a term of office of one year with effect from 28 January 2013.  The Committee continued to work with my Department and assisted with the development of the new National Youth Strategy, in particular in identifying in what ways the youth work sector can contribute to shared policy objectives for young people. <\/p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 was published on 8th October, 2015.  The strategy sets out Government's aims for young people, aged 10 to 24 years, so that they are active and healthy, achieving their full potential in learning and development, safe and protected from harm, have economic security and opportunity and are connected and contributing to their world.  The implementation structures established by my Department under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures (BOBF), the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People will oversee the roll out of the National Youth Strategy.  There is no doubt that the youth work services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the National Youth Strategy as part of a cross sectoral, whole of society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.  For this reason, the key youth sector interests are represented on the structures established by my Department to support the implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures.  At national level, representatives of the voluntary youth services have been appointed to the Advisory Council of BOBF.  At local level, youth sector representatives participate in the Children and Young People's Services Committees.  Key Government departments and agencies that have an interest in children and young people and that had served on the National Youth Work Advisory Committee are represented on the Children and Young People's Policy Consortium and on the Sponsors Group that have been established under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures to drive the effective implementation of the policy framework. <\/p>  <p>  There have been other significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services and the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee since the 2001 Act was passed.  These include, the setting up of the North South Education and Training Standards Committee for youth work and the introduction of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 which, inter alia, provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.  At EU level, the Council of Ministers for Youth has adopted an EU Youth Strategy and has taken a number of policy initiatives to promote quality in the provision of youth work services.  The National Strategy on Children and Young People's Participation in Decision-making 2015-2020, which was published by my Department in June, 2015 is particularly relevant.  I am deeply committed to ensuring that young people are involved in the preparation, planning and implementation of policies that impact on their lives. <\/p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the youth work sector, the voluntary youth services, the Education and Training Boards, other government departments and agencies and consults with young people themselves in the development and delivery of policies and services for children and young people. <\/p>  <p>  I intend that the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee will be kept under consideration in the light of these developments and in relation the implementation arrangements in place to achieve our national strategies' objectives to secure the best possible outcomes for young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500083#WRBB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Work Supports","counter":1655,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500083#WRBB02250"},{"type":"question","counter":1656,"qnumday":608,"qnumall":"[31573\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500083#WRBB02300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the current policy on the consolidation of youth projects and the duplication of youth services in smaller areas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1287","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1657,"content":"<p>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.

I also met recently with some volunteers from Westmeath Civil Defence.  I understand the Council are reviewing the situation and in the interim have provided temporary training facilities for Westmeath Civil Defence.   <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Defence will continue to engage with the Westmeath County Council in an effort to ensure that appropriate accommodation is provided for the Civil Defence Unit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500083#WRBB04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Army Barracks","counter":1685,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500083#WRBB04250"},{"type":"question","counter":1686,"qnumday":618,"qnumall":"[32137\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500083#WRBB04300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he has considered renting block O or block P of Columb Barracks, Mullingar to a club (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Therefore, the current financial and administrative burden resulting from the retention of the Barracks cannot be sustained.  As it is planned to dispose of the property, it would not be appropriate to facilitate any further community groups in using the Barracks.  However, in the context of the Barracks' potential future use contributing to the positive development of Mullingar, my Department remains open to viable proposals to these ends.  I would suggest that local groups should engage with Westmeath County Council to explore such opportunities.  Should no viable local proposals emerge in the near future my Department will proceed to dispose of the property by public auction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102500083#WRBB04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"}]
