For the 2014-2020 period, the countries which qualify for the Cohesion Fund are Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.  As a budget contributor, Ireland does not qualify for Cohesion funding.<\/p>  <p>  I am, however, fully engaged in exploring future EU funding options for the transport sector. Following the publication of the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework, Minister Donohoe and I wrote a joint letter in February to Transport Commissioner Bulc and Regional Policy Commissioner Cretu emphasising the considerable challenges facing Ireland in the transport sector and setting out how the NDP and NPF will inform future investments into the regions, including the West, Border and North West regions which will be particularly impacted by Brexit.  We made the point that investment in infrastructure has the potential to mitigate the implications of Brexit in these regions.  <\/p>  <p>  Over the coming years, Ireland will continue to prioritise key projects on the Core and Comprehensive networks under the National Development Plan with the objective of enhancing connectivity between the Comprehensive and Core networks and thereby enhancing the sustainability and connectivity of our outermost regions and our connectivity to Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Connecting Europe Framework (CEF) is the EU funding instrument developed specifically to direct investment into European transport, energy and digital infrastructures to address identified missing links and bottlenecks.

The full terms and conditions of the SCP are available on my Department's website.<\/p><p>The Revenue Commissioners operate a tax relief scheme for donations to certain sporting bodies under Section 41 of the Finance Act 2002. Obtaining the tax relief is a three stage process.  Firstly, the club or group must apply to the Revenue Commissioner to become an &quot;approved sports body&quot;. Secondly, the approved body applies to my Department for their project to be an &quot;approved project&quot;.  The possible project types include acquiring land or buildings for sports purposes, developing sports facilities, purchasing fixed non-personal equipment for sports activities, or repaying a loan for any of these purposes.  Finally, PAYE donors fill out a certificate and supplies this to the club.  The club may then apply to Revenue for the tax relief on this donation.  While the exact amount of relief is a matter for Revenue, I understand that relief is given at the higher rate of tax on a &quot;grossed-up basis&quot;.  In the case of a donation made by an individual who pays tax on a self-assessment basis, the individual will be entitled to claim a tax deduction for the donation in computing his or her total income and there is no grossing up arrangement.

Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including close to 3 million people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas. Over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region. There have been repeated breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law. There have been numerous instances of denial and diversion of humanitarian aid, the use of medieval &lsquo;starve or surrender&rsquo; siege tactics and the use of chemical weapons. I am aware of the petition on the Syria conflict to which Deputy Murphy refers and I fully concur with the sentiment of concern expressed by the petitioners about this appalling situation.<\/p>  <p>  The apparent chemical attack in Douma on 7 April was a particularly shocking and sickening development. Like many, I was horrified by the images of entire families who had died in the basements where they had sought shelter, and I publicly and unreservedly condemned the attack. In response to that horrific attack on civilians, and following Russia&rsquo;s veto of meaningful UN Security Council action to ensure accountability for such attacks, a number of states took action against facilities related to the production of chemical weapons. I note that their stated objective was to ensure that such attacks do not recur. <\/p>  <p>  Last week I discussed the situation in Syria, including these most recent developments, with my EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council. We condemned in the strongest possible terms the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and stressed the need to ensure full legal accountability for those responsible for such crimes. We also reiterated our support for the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict, and the urgent need to reinvigorate the political track. I reaffirmed the need to avoid any escalation of the situation in Syria, and the importance of ensuring accountability for the use of chemical weapons. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU provide political and financial support to a broad range of measures which aim to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria. This includes the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism established by the UN General Assembly to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes under international law committed in Syria, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria established by the UN Human Rights Council, and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Fact Finding Mission and Joint Investigative Mission with the UN. In addition, Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures. <\/p>  <p>  Obviously a comprehensive, sustainable, Syrian-owned and Syrian-led resolution to the conflict will be required to provide lasting relief to the suffering of the Syrian people. UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura is leading political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254. Ireland and the EU fully support this process. The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;95 million to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, including &euro;25 million in 2017 alone. The EU and its Member States have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.6 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort. The EU is hosting a further donors&rsquo; conference for Syria this week, and Ireland will use that opportunity to announce our pledge to the humanitarian effort in response to the Syria crisis in 2018. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400062#WRD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Staff","counter":204,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400062#WRD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":205,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[17546\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400062#WRD03500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is a recruitment process in place in Northern Ireland for 18 new customs officers; if he has discussed this with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland; if there are contingency plans in place to increase the recruitment of customs officers here; if so, the estimated number of custom officers required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":206,"content":"<p>I am aware of the recruitment of UK Border Force officials, to which the Deputy refers.<\/p>  <p>  There were specific concerns raised about the requirement for applicants to hold a British passport and whether this was in line with the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement which recognises the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves or be accepted as Irish, or British, or both.

An AEO is an economic operator who is deemed reliable in the context of his or her customs related operations. There is no legal obligation for economic operators to become an AEO, it is a matter of choice for each operator based on their specific situation.<\/p>  <p>  Under the UCC the status of AEO consists of different types of authorisations: AEO for Customs Simplifications (AEOC) and AEO for Security and Safety (AEOS). An economic operator can apply for both.  The criteria for approval as an AEO are as follows:  <\/p>  <p>  - Record of compliance with customs legislation and taxation rules, including no record of serious criminal offences relating to the economic activity of the applicant;  <\/p>  <p>  - Demonstration of a high level of control of its operations by the applicant and of the flow of the goods, by means of a system of managing commercial and, where appropriate, transport records, which allows appropriate customs controls;  <\/p>  <p>  - Proven financial solvency.<\/p>  <p>  And depending on the type of AEO:<\/p>  <p>  - Practical standards of competence or professional qualifications directly related to the activity carried out (AEOC); <\/p>  <p>  - Appropriate security and safety standards (AEOS).<\/p>  <p>  Applications are assessed on a case by case basis. There is no fee for application, nor is there any required size or scale of business.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status, and customs authorisations for simplifications, are normally granted by the customs authority of the Member State in which the trader is established and are automatically recognised in all Member States.  While AEO status allows a holder to apply for simplifications in another Member State, the status is of most benefit in connection with the customs procedures of the country of residence of the AEO, significantly simplifying the process of import and export.  Thus some 89% of third country imports to Ireland are carried out by the 146 AEOs resident in Ireland and authorised by Revenue.  Many of these AEOs are customs agents or carriers who take responsibility for import formalities on behalf of traders located in Ireland or abroad.<\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to say in absence of an application how many registered hauliers would meet the criteria for authorisation as AEO.  Of the 146 economic operators currently holding AEO status in Ireland, some 65 are in the business of freight forwarding, transport and related businesses.  Revenue is aware, however, that the majority of hauliers have insignificant levels of business with countries outside the EU at the moment, and so they would derive little benefit from AEO status at present.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Government wide response to Brexit, Revenue is meeting with representatives groups, including hauliers, and attending industry seminars to discuss the potential issues resulting from Brexit. Revenue has advised businesses to examine the possible impacts of Brexit on their supply chains and to consider applying for one or more of the authorisations or simplifications available that best suit their business model.  <\/p>  <p>  Advice and assistance on customs authorisations and simplifications is available on the Revenue website and Revenue will continue to engage with representative groups, taking account of developments in the ongoing EU-UK negotiations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400063#WRE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Abolition","counter":244,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400063#WRE02200"},{"type":"question","counter":245,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[17411\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400063#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the tax relief on union subscriptions which was withdrawn in 2011 and failed to be reviewed in 2016 will be restored; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1218","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":246,"content":"<p>A review of the appropriate treatment for tax purposes of trade union subscriptions and professional body fees was carried out by my Department in 2016 and included in the 2016 report on tax expenditures published on budget day 2016.

However, if the purchase takes place first, then stamp duty will have to be paid but can subsequently be refunded when the sale takes place. <\/p>  <p>  A number of qualifying conditions must be satisfied before the relief can apply. The most important condition is that Teagasc must issue a certificate stating that a sale and purchase or an exchange of farmland was made for farm consolidation purposes. This is the certificate that is currently required in relation to the capital gains tax relief available\u00a0on farm consolidations. The criteria to be used by Teagasc for this purpose and the information to be supplied to Teagasc are contained in guidelines published by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. <\/p>  <p>  A purchaser of farmland must retain ownership of the farmland for a period of five years and must use the land for farming. Where any part of the land is disposed of before the end of this five-year holding period, the stamp duty relieved can subsequently be recovered by Revenue, or partly recovered as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The measure will apply to all transactions which took place after on or after 1 January 2018 and on or before 31 December 2020, so farmers who consolidate their holdings prior to the commencement of the relief, but within those dates,\u00a0will still be eligible.<\/p>  <p>  Consideration of\u00a0the administrative\u00a0and EU state-aid requirements arising is ongoing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400063#WRE02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland Investigations","counter":250,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400063#WRE02800"},{"type":"question","counter":251,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[17503\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400063#WRE02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number and nature of investigations the Central Bank has carried out with regard to overpricing or overcharging on commercial loans in the past ten years; the financial institutions involved; the result of such investigations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":252,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Central Bank that this can be considered both from the broader enforcement perspective and in terms of consumer protection.

For example, on a Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) basis, 2017 was the fifth consecutive year of inflation below 1 per cent. This phenomenon is not restricted to Ireland. Low inflation has been a feature of advanced economies in recent years. However, in 2017, inflation on a HICP basis across the euro area accelerated to 1.5 per cent, from 0.2 per cent in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  This acceleration did not occur in Ireland, with inflation on a HICP basis averaging just 0.3 per cent in 2017. The divergence between inflation in the euro area and Ireland can in part be attributed to the impact of euro-sterling appreciation on consumer prices in Ireland. In turn this reflects the importance of the UK as a source of imports of consumer products.<\/p>  <p>  While average inflation is low, that masks considerable variation across the components which make up the index. For example, the price of goods is declining. In 2017, goods inflation averaged -2.1 per cent. The decline in goods is driven by declining prices for non-energy industrial goods and food. In contrast, energy prices increased on average by 4 per cent last year.<\/p>  <p>  While goods prices on the whole are falling, those for services are increasing. For example, services inflation averaged 2.5 per cent last year. One important factor driving the increase in services inflation is strong growth in rent prices. Rent inflation averaged 6.7 per cent last year, a moderation from the 8.7 per cent increase in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  While inflation is not categorised by the CSO or Eurostat into discretionary or non-discretionary elements, both institutions publish detailed inflation data at a sub-component level according to the United Nations (UN) Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP). \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400063#WRE04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies Establishment","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400063#WRE04900"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[17750\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400063#WRE05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of applications received for the home building finance Ireland scheme; the number of successful applicants; the amount issued to date; the interest rate applied; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[17751\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400063#WRE05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of NAMA staff transferred to home building finance Ireland to date; the estimated operating costs of home building finance Ireland in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":273,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[17752\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400063#WRE05200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the targeted amount of homes due to be built under home building finance Ireland financing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":274,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125, 126 and 127 together.<\/p>  <p>  In my Budget speech on 10 October 2017, I announced a proposal to establish a new dedicated fund, Home Building Finance Ireland (&lsquo;HBFI&rsquo;) to provide funding on market terms to viable residential development projects whose owners are experiencing difficulty in obtaining debt funding. <\/p>  <p>  In answering the Deputy&rsquo;s questions it is first necessary to recognise that Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) is in the process of being established. The draft scheme of the HBFI Bill was approved by Cabinet at the end of January and drafting is currently being undertaken by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in conjunction with my officials. It is expected that the Bill will be published shortly and I am hopeful that the Oireachtas will be in a position to pass the HBFI Bill in the first half of 2018, with a view to HBFI commencing operations later in 2018. The passage of legislation establishing HBFI is a priority for the Government.<\/p>  <p>  While HBFI will be an independent legal entity established under the Companies Act 2014, in order to ensure that the fund is established in the most efficient manner possible it is proposed that HBFI will harness the considerable expertise and skills amassed through NAMA&rsquo;s existing residential funding programme. It is envisaged that this will be achieved by enabling the NTMA to allocate current NAMA staff with the relevant skills and experience to HBFI where appropriate and subject to the need to ensure that achievement of NAMA&rsquo;s own statutory objectives is not adversely affected. The allocation of NAMA staff will be commensurate to the level of demand for lending from developers and staff will only be assigned where the skills and experience match those that are sought by the Board of HBFI. However as HBFI&rsquo;s establishing legislation has not yet been enacted it follows that no NAMA staff have been transferred to HBFI to date.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been engaging with stakeholders including the Construction Industry Federation and other market participants who welcome the proposed scheme. Formal applications for funding will commence once the entity is up and running later this year. While it will ultimately be up to the Board of HBFI, when it is constituted, to determine the terms and conditions of the fund's lending, the success of an application will depend on, inter alia, the risk profile of each project, the quality of collateral and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In order to comply with EU State aid rules, lending will be provided at market equivalent rates and will not constitute subsidised funding for residential developers.<\/p>  <p>  Once HBFI is established it is estimated that the fund&rsquo;s proposed allocation of &euro;750m could have capacity to fund about 6,000 homes in the coming years. This delivery estimate is based on an assumed delivery cost of &euro;250,000 per unit and an assumption that HBFI would recycle the allocated funding once over an estimated three year time horizon. The current estimated shortfall in residential supply is 15,000 &ndash; 20,000 units per annum and, accordingly, HBFI, with an annual average delivery of 2,000 homes, could help reduce this shortfall by about 10%.<\/p>  <p>   HBFI&rsquo;s operating costs will include salary costs, the cost of providing legal, financial reporting and other services in addition to loan servicing costs, audit fees, Board fees, office accommodation and systems costs. While it is too early to estimate operating costs in advance of a business plan which has been endorsed by the future Board of HBFI, it is envisaged that these costs will be commensurate with those of NAMA&rsquo;s residential funding programme and costs typically incurred by other market participants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400063#WRE05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":276,"content":"<p>Question No. 128 answered with Question No. 122.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Data","counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400064#WRF00300"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[17858\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400064#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the progress he and his officials have made on examining the impact of the EUROSTAT reclassification of tier 3 AHBs to become part of the local government subsector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1215","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>Since the decision by the Central Statistics Office to reclassify 15 Approved Housing Bodies as part of the local government sector, i.e. within the general government, my officials have engaged with these bodies in order to obtain the required inputs to compile the fiscal forecasts for the period 2018 - 2021.

These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the\u00a0Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and F&Oacute;RSA, have signed up to that agreement.  As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant.  Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school \/ ETB.<\/p><p>Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his\/her employer that s\/he is to be made redundant then s\/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs.  The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2017\/2018 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0042\/2017 which issued on 25 May 2017 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address:<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0042\/2017 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectoral, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed.  Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment.  If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a redundancy payment.  Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his\/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58\/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.<\/p><p>It should be noted that this does not prevent any person, including newly qualified SNAs, from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.<\/p><p>The Supplementary Assignment Panel arrangements are reviewed by my Department on an annual basis in conjunction with an independent Supplementary Assignment Manager,\u00a0the school management bodies and the two unions representing SNA staff (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU).<\/p><p>My Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400066#WRH02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[17441\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400066#WRH02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the 950 jobs for special needs assistants will become available.","asker":"1347","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":413,"content":"<p>975 additional SNAs posts were made available for allocation to schools from September 2017 which was a 7.5% increase to meet the demands for the\u00a02017\/18 school year.

In meeting the demands of unprecedented societal and educational change, it is important to review and update the curriculum to ensure children are afforded a high-quality, coherent, and more relevant mathematics education that will contribute towards their personal and academic learning and development.\u00a0 The Primary Mathematics Curriculum will aim to develop learners&rsquo; conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, strategic competence, adaptive reasoning and productive disposition.  Equipping learners with these five strands of Mathematical proficiency will provide them with vital life skills and a foundation for citizenship in the 21st century.<\/p><p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) began developing the new Primary Mathematics Curriculum in September 2016.  This curriculum is for all children and is underpinned by the view that every child is capable of engaging with mathematical concepts and ideas from birth. Initial work focused on junior infants to second class.  Consultation on a draft of this part of the curriculum began in October 2017 and finished in mid-March 2018.\u00a0 Consultation included online questionnaires, consultation seminars in Limerick, Sligo and Dublin, written submissions and a network of schools working with the draft curriculum.<\/p><p>Work has begun on the analysis of the data gathered through the consultation.  This work will be presented in a consultation report which will be published on the NCCA website before the summer. The report will also set out next steps for work on the primary mathematics curriculum including work on the senior classes.<\/p><p>The Department of Education and Skills recently agreed to a proposed revised schedule for the implementation of the new Primary Mathematics Curriculum, whereby the curriculum will be introduced to schools as a single-stage implementation, from Junior Infants through to 6th class, rather than in two stages, Junior Infants to 2nd class and then 3rd class to 6th class, as originally planned.\u00a0 The revision arises in good part from learning from the implementation of the Primary Language Curriculum, including listening to extensive feedback received from that process.  While the revised approach to implementation of the new Primary Mathematics Curriculum will impact on timing at the initial stages, the proposed date for full implementation of the curriculum in all years of primary, September 2021, remains unchanged.<\/p><p>Following the recent changes made by the to the implementation plans, the NCCA will publish the draft curriculum for junior infants to sixth class in late 2018 for consultation.  This draft will incorporate work carried out on foot of findings from the recent consultation.  The second consultation will again include work with a network of schools. <\/p><p>For further information including the extensive body of mathematics research which informed the development of the draft curriculum, see<i>.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400066#WRH03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Refurbishment","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400066#WRH03900"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[17465\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400066#WRH04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the grant support available to a board of management of a secondary school in need of substantial refurbishment and housed in a protected structure of historical value; if there is a new scheme available for such schools; the process by which they apply; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":426,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that applications for major capital projects, including applications from\u00a0schools with protected structures, will be considered on receipt of an application for Major Capital Works (form SLE).

The first step is the identification of potential site options.  My Department works closely with local authorities in the identification of school sites and, in addition in line with relevant circulars, also considers the potential of existing properties in the ownership of my Department or other state agencies.  <\/p>  <p>  Where a suitable site or property is identified, negotiations with the relevant landowner follow with a view to obtaining agreement on the terms of\u00a0the land acquisition; this includes price but can also\u00a0include other aspects such as technical issues arising from the development of the site.  This process can take some time but once the terms of the acquisition are agreed, i.e.  \"agreement in principle\" obtained, the process moves to conveyancing stage.  <\/p>  <p>  The point at which \"agreement in principle\" is reached with a landowner in respect of a proposed site acquisition is a very positive step in the acquisition process.\u00a0 However, it is also the point that the conveyancing process to formalise the transfer (or lease) of the property commences.  <\/p>  <p>  Property conveyancing can be a time-consuming process depending on the variables in an individual case such as title issues and easements.  Due diligence has to be applied to the transfer in order to ensure that good and marketable title is obtained in the interests of the Exchequer.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition in cases\u00a0where an acquisition is subject to planning permission, while contracts may be signed in\u00a0advance, the transfer of ownership of the property occurs once planning permission has been granted.  The planning process also includes the planning appeal process.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, where there is relative certainty in relation to finalising matters, for example where the land is in public ownership or where\u00a0planning permission is being submitted\u00a0but contracts not yet\u00a0finalised, my\u00a0Department\u00a0sometimes\u00a0can inform the school authorities of the proposed school location at this point on the basis that &ldquo;agreement in principle&rdquo; has been obtained.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s general approach is to inform the school authorities of the potential location of the\u00a0new school at as\u00a0early a stage as possible, provided that this would not jeopardise the potential acquisition.  In general, where a site is in public ownership or where there is relative certainty in relation to completion of the acquisition, the school can be informed at the point when \"agreement in principle\" has been obtained and prior to contracts being signed.  In some cases, particularly where the land is in private ownership, due to commercial sensitivities it may not be appropriate to confirm\u00a0the site location at the point at which agreement in principle is reached.  For example, title issues may come to light at conveyancing stage which means that the acquisition may not proceed;\u00a0if this information were in the public domain it could potentially jeopardise any subsequent disposal of the land by the owner.  Similarly in some cases prematurely announcing the site location could jeopardise completion of the acquisition process due to commercial or other issues.  <\/p>  <p>  I trust\u00a0this explains the context in which the school site acquisition process operates, and the reasons why school site acquisition progress can be referred to as having reached the point of \"agreement in principle\" while the formal transfer process has not completed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400069#WRL04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Refurbishment","counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400069#WRL04700"},{"type":"question","counter":597,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[17933\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400069#WRL04800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of improvement works and extension plans required at a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":598,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, very substantial funding was granted to the school in question in May 2014 to provide additional accommodation.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In February 2015, additional money was approved to address significant abnormal works identified by the school authority and further increased in December 2016 to carry out remedial works to the heating system.<\/p>  <p>  The school has maintained contact with\u00a0my Department in relation to specific accommodation requests, such as Pastoral Offices, Student Social Area and a new PE Hall.\u00a0 The school has also referred in general to overall accommodation\u00a0issues such as corridors, student locker areas and classroom conditions.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0wish to advise the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s current priority, within the limited funding available, is the provision of essential classroom accommodation in areas where significant demographic need has been established to ensure that each child will have access to a physical school place.

There are also\u00a042 Garda Reserves and\u00a069 Garda civilian staff attached to the Cork City Division as of the 28 February 2018.

To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 48 have been assigned to the Cork City Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 200 of whom attested last month. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Ireland voluntarily opted into the two EU Council Decisions on Relocation (2015\/1523) and (2015\/1601), which provided for the EU wide relocation of 160,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece.<\/p><p>By the end of the two-year EU Relocation Programme in September 2017, across the Union, a total of 37,000 asylum seekers were eligible and registered for relocation in Italy and Greece, of which 78% (approximately 29,000) had been relocated to other EU Member States including Ireland. This is significantly lower than the 160,000 expected to be made available under the programme for relocation and resettlement.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, Ireland has remained committed to the target of 4,000\u00a0refugees and asylum-seekers\u00a0and has taken its own steps to meet those commitments. The arrival of Ireland's relocation persons was completed in March 2018 with 1,022 people having arrived from Greece and work continues to house such persons in communities.  267 people have arrived under relocation in 2018.<\/p><p>Under Resettlement, Ireland pledged to admit 520 people under resettlement by 2017. We surpassed that figure in 2016\u00a0and this enabled the Government to further increase\u00a0its commitment under the programme.  A total of 1,040 persons under the European Commission&rsquo;s July 2015 Resettlement scheme\u00a0will have been admitted by the end of this year, which is\u00a0 a doubling of\u00a0the\u00a0original commitment of 520.<\/p><p>792 people have already arrived and the remaining refugees\u00a0are due to arrive in the coming months. The European Commission recognises Ireland as being one of only seven EU Member States to have fulfilled their resettlement pledges from the July 2015 Agreement.<\/p><p>In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government also committed to taking up to 200 unaccompanied minors (UAMs) from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais. Unlike any other Member State, Ireland also offered these young people programme refugee status.<\/p><p>Following 13 missions to France, a total of\u00a041 young people ultimately expressed an interest and were assessed as suitable to come to Ireland under the programme.  They have all arrived in Ireland and this programme has been completed. These young people<b><\/b>were taken in under\u00a0the care of Tusla who have\u00a0statutory responsibility for minors.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of the 28 February 2018, the latest date for which figures are available,\u00a0the strength of the\u00a0Cork West Division was 298.  There are also\u00a08 Garda Reserves and\u00a026 Garda civilian staff attached to the\u00a0Cork West\u00a0Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed\u00a0Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>I can assure the\u00a0Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members.<\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 20\u00a0have been assigned to the Cork West Division.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.  <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested last month.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.  <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Cork West Division.<\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p><p>I have set out in the table the number of new Garda recruits assigned to each Garda station in the Cork West Division in each of the years 2014 -2017 and to date in 2018.<table><tr><th>Probationer Garda Allocations 2015 &ndash;

To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.<\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have entered\u00a0already this year.\u00a0In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested last month.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that projected departures from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are kept under continuing review and the level of recruitment adjusted as necessary in order to achieve the desired strength.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.  <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

In addition, the Act allows for judges to impose such sentences consecutively on persons found guilty of such offences.  <\/p><p>In June 2015, following a number of serious assaults on prison staff, the State Claims Agency (SCA) commenced a review of assaults on prison staff by prisoners in accordance with Section 8 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, 2000.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In November 2016, the SCA presented the report to the then\u00a0T&aacute;naiste.  The report noted many positive findings including that given the number of committals in 2015 the ratio of assaults to the number of prisoners in the system was very low.  The role of a prison officer is a difficult and challenging one.  Prison staff must deal with a wide range of complex issues and there are occasions when they are subjected to unacceptable acts of violence.<\/p><p>The report contains a large number of recommendations.  These recommendations were accepted and implemented - an undertaking that has been included as a Key Action in the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Strategic Plan 2016-2018.

In addition, the Service is committed to ensuring that any staff member who is subject to or witnesses an assault is given the necessary supports in the aftermath of the incident.<\/p><p>Given the substantive nature of the recommendations, the Irish Prison Service has an implementation plan in place and\u00a0is in the process of implementing these recommendations.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400072#WRO06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting","counter":775,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400072#WRO06100"},{"type":"question","counter":776,"qnumday":296,"qnumall":"[18047\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400072#WRO06200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that under new vetting procedures garda&iacute; are no longer vetting all staff and board members operating in children's organisations and that only certain roles must go through the vetting process; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that there are no guidelines available as to the way in which to define roles or space on the forms to achieve this (details supplied); the way in which he plans to address these gaps in the new system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":777,"content":"<p>As Deputy will appreciate, the primary purpose of the employment vetting carried out by the Garda National Vetting Bureau is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.

Emails sent by designated public officials in my Department indicate that the sender is a designated public official and that the recipient may need to assess whether any particular communication with them requires to be registered in accordance with the Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Regulation of Lobbying Act places responsibility for assessing whether any particular communication\u00a0may constitute lobbying, and for\u00a0recording details of any lobbying carried out, with the lobbyist.

Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and the\u00a0Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.\u00a0 The objective of the Group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State Aid rules.\u00a0 To date, the Working Group has met four times and in between these meetings, there has been engagement on specific issues to continue to progress matters.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State Aid rules, this will be raised as part of the Working Group discussions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A notified Rescue and Restructuring (R&amp;R) scheme was approved by the Commission in late November 2017. This scheme has been put in place as it is considered prudent to have contingency measures in place so that we can respond swiftly to changing circumstances as necessary.\u00a0 Under the scheme, which will run until 2020, Enterprise Ireland can provide restructuring support to SMEs in severe financial difficulties.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As part of the deliberations of the Technical Working Group on State Aid, it was agreed that\u00a0Ireland should extend the R&amp;R scheme to include temporary restructuring support for those SMEs with acute liquidity needs.\u00a0 This extension has been notified to the Commission and\u00a0approval is expected\u00a0early in Q2 2018.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department is carrying out extensive work to prepare for all Brexit eventualities. Informed by detailed research, my Department is\u00a0putting in place a package of measures that will allow us to respond to the needs of businesses including the Brexit Loan Scheme which was launched last month and which will provide affordable working capital financing to eligible businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future. <\/p>  <p>  The recent signing of the counter guarantee from the EIB group (through its InnovFin Guarantee) means that the &euro;24 million exchequer funding announced in the 2018 Budget (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) can be leveraged to provide a fund of &euro;300 million. The Brexit Loan Scheme, which was launched last month, is open to businesses of fewer than 500 employees which can demonstrate that they are significantly exposed to the impact (or potential impact) of Brexit. They must be a viable business, doing business in Ireland, and they must have a business development strategy demonstrating that they plan to innovate or adapt in response to Brexit.\u00a0This scheme will be operated within De Minimis State Aid Regulation.<\/p>  <p>  My officials are also examining policy proposals for a new longer-term Business Investment Loan Scheme to support businesses to invest strategically for a post-Brexit environment and a\u00a0new Business Finance Advisory Hub service which would focus on business development.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Agencies of my Department are at the forefront in working with firms to ensure they are equipped to deal with Brexit and to enhance their performances in an increasingly competitive global trading environment through lean programmes, skills development and reducing business costs. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) has launched the 'Brexit SME Scorecard', an interactive online tool which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit. \u00a0EI is also offering a 'Be Prepared Grant' of up to &euro;5,000 to support clients to develop a Brexit Action Plan and it continues to support clients to improve their competitiveness, acquire new markets and enhance management skills. <\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are organising workshops, seminars and training to assist companies to better understand the challenges of Brexit and have a range of supports to help clients to respond to those challenges, to become more competitive and to source new markets.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland is also working to minimise the impact of Brexit on north-south trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400074#WRQ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":818,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400074#WRQ03000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":817,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400074#WRQ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":818,"qnumday":330,"qnumall":"[17871\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400074#WRQ03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to extend general practitioner cards to all carers in receipt of the respite care support grant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1268","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":819,"content":"<p>In December 2017, the Government\u00a0announced that additional funding would be provided to enable all carers in\u00a0 receipt of Carer's Allowance to qualify for a GP visit card.\u00a0 Government approval was given earlier this month to provide GP services without fees to persons in receipt of either full or half rate Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit and to draft the Heads of Bill to legislate for this provision.\u00a0 It is intended that this measure will be implemented this year, subject to the drafting and enactment of the necessary legislation.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to extend GP visit Cards to persons specifically in receipt of a Carer's Support Grant (formerly known as the Respite Care Grant), however it is noted that many persons in receipt of this Grant will qualify for a GP visit card as the Carer's Support Grant is paid automatically to persons in receipt of Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400074#WRQ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commencement of Legislation","counter":820,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400074#WRQ03200"},{"type":"question","counter":821,"qnumday":331,"qnumall":"[18041\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400074#WRQ03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 134 of 18 April 2018, the nature of the technical drafting issue that has come to light in relation to Parts 2 and 3 of the Child and Family Relationships Act 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":822,"content":"<p>A number of technical drafting issues have come to light in relation to Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.<\/p><p>Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, in Ireland, more plasters were being used in than the entire UK National Health Service. In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.<\/p><p>Following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from September 2017, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant must apply to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. In the case of a negative reimbursement decision, the treating clinician can appeal the decision. Once a patient is approved for reimbursement support, irrespective of the indication, there will be no expiry on the duration of treatment. This also applies to applications already approved by the MMP.<\/p><p>As of 29 March 2018, there have been 5,747 online applications from clinicians requesting the reimbursement of Versatis. Of these applications, 1,205 patients (over 21%) have been approved. Of 672 online appeals, over 71% of patients have been approved for reimbursement. The MMP has sought further information on another 41 appeals. Accordingly, since 1 September 2017, 1,681 patients have been approved for reimbursement of lidocaine plasters, based on the clinical case made by their GP or consultant.<\/p><p>It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters.<\/p><p>The HSE notified prescribers and pharmacies of the introduction of the new system in August 2017. This advice was re-issued recently, and information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE Medicines Management Programme website at\u00a0<i><i>www.hse.ie\/yourmedicines<\/i><\/i>.<\/p><p>This reimbursement decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400074#WRQ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Procedures","counter":828,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400074#WRQ04200"},{"type":"question","counter":829,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[17398\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400074#WRQ04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a procedure for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":830,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The HSE's 2018 National Service Plan provides for a target of some 17.094 million home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people, which compares with last year's 16.34 million hours delivered to 50,000 people (home help and home care package funded\u00a0hours combined).  This is an increase of 754,000 hours to 500 more people.  In addition 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.<\/p>  <p>  Following the recent significant adverse weather the HSE provided about 350 extra Home Support Packages across 13 specific hospitals over a five week period.<\/p>  <p>  Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow.  It is important to note that the allocation of funding for home support across the system, though significant, is finite and services must therefore be delivered within the funding available.  In this context, I acknowledge that access to the service may take longer than we would like.  However, the HSE monitors the delivery of home support on an on-going basis, to ensure that activity is maximised relative to individual clients&rsquo; assessed care needs within the overall available resources for home support and having regard to demand throughout the year.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to promoting care in the community so that people can continue to live with confidence, security and dignity in their own homes for as long as possible.

I asked Teagasc from an early stage to work locally with affected farmers in areas with fodder difficulties and support them on fodder budgeting for the winter ahead. I prioritised the payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cash flow.  In this regard my Department has paid out over &euro;1.6bn to Irish farmers under Pillar I and Pillar II and will continue to make residual payments.<\/p>  <p>  As a further early intervention, and to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the issue of fodder availability in affected areas, I convened a fodder\u00a0group chaired by Teagasc, and comprising of all the main stakeholders including feed merchants and co-ops, banking, farm bodies etc.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I introduced a targeted &lsquo;Fodder Transport Support measure&rsquo;\u00a0on 29 January 2018 to provide additional assistance to those livestock farmers in parts of the West and North West severely affected by on-going fodder shortages.  The main purpose of the measure was to support the cost of transporting fodder between those areas where it was plentiful and those where it was scarce. It is operated primarily through the Co-operative structure.<\/p>  <p>  The continuation of cold wet weather throughout March resulted in a serious delay to the onset of spring. Grass growth remained negligible, ground stayed wet and livestock had to remain housed in many cases.  This resulted in the fodder problem extending countrywide with a consequent tightening of fodder availability nationally.<\/p>  <p>  In response I extended the fodder transport measure to all counties and also introduced a Fodder Import Support Measure, to ensure that there was adequate fodder available to feed the national herd.  This measure was introduced on 5 April to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage (hay, silage, haylage etc.) from outside the island of Ireland.  Northern Ireland is excluded.  The measure is operated through Co-operatives and other importers approved by the Department . It covers fodder imported up to 30th April 2018. Support under the measure will substantially reduce the cost to farmers of imported fodder by approximately one third.  This initial allocation will support the importation of up to 20,000 tons of fodder into the country and this will be kept under on-going review until the current crisis is over.  Together these two measures address remaining issue around fodder availability. <\/p>  <p>  Root crops are not eligible under the Fodder Import Support Measure or Fodder Transport Support Measure.

In addition, to date, there have been no compulsory acquisitions of land for mining development.<\/p>  <p>  -  The text of my Department&rsquo;s letter to the Cavan Mining Objection Group, dated 28 September 2017, identified the environmental safeguards that have been put in place to guard against the possibility of any potential significant environmental impacts arising.

Sentiment in the industry both overseas and here at home is generally positive for the remainder of 2018.  Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s aim is to grow overseas tourism revenue by a further +5% this year and to increase the number of overseas visitors by 2%.<\/p>  <p>  The early signs are promising, with the CSO reporting in its Overseas Travel release that overseas trips to Ireland for the first two months of the year, at almost 1.2 million visits, were up 7.9% on 2017, as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Visits from North America were up by 4.2%;<\/p>  <p>  - Visits from Mainland Europe were up by 17.6%;<\/p>  <p>  - Great Britain registered an increase of 4.0% in visits; and<\/p>  <p>  - Visits from the rest of the world (long-haul) decreased by 3.8%.<\/p>  <p>  While the data only covers two months and it is too early to predict how the rest of the year might fare, it is a welcome start which indicates that we are well placed to build further on the outstanding growth of recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to offer strong support to the industry, as demonstrated most recently by F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s launch of the new brand for the Midlands, Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands.  This will enhance the Midlands as a tourism destination for both domestic and overseas visitors.  We have also invested an additional &euro;2 million in Tourism Ireland this year to support its digital marketing infrastructure.  This investment recognises the fact that we are operating in a hugely competitive international marketplace in which it is vital that we maintain a strong presence.<\/p>  <p>  Despite positive visitor numbers from Britain in early 2018, Brexit continues to be a concern for tourism.  I am aware that the tourism agencies are keeping a very close eye on developments in the British market.  Nevertheless, it highlights the importance of market diversification as we continue to attract greater numbers of visitors from European, North American and long-haul destinations.  The inaugural direct flights from China, due to commence in June, will be vital in exploiting the potential of this massive market.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot be complacent about continued growth in tourism.  We must aim to deliver growth which is sustainable, from an economic, social and environmental perspective.

As with other Departments and agencies across the State, my Department and its agencies are preparing for the different potential outcomes, including contingency planning for a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; scenario.  <\/p>  <p>  Irish ports and airports, and the airlines and shipping companies that use them, operate as independent commercial companies and planning and preparations in the context of Brexit are operational matters for each. Air and shipping services are market driven. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to shipping, in the past shipping operators have responded to economic developments and increased or reduced capacity in response to market demands. I am confident that shipping services can be expected to adapt to changing market demands and we have seen the evidence of this over recent months with the actual and planned increase in shipping capacity on direct routes to continental ports.<\/p>  <p>  However, a significant proportion of goods destined for EU markets use the UK landbridge to access these markets. The efficiency of these routes could be affected by Brexit, particularly if there are procedures and associated delays at UK ports or airports. The Irish Maritime Development Office, in conjunction with my Department, is currently finalising a study into the use of the UK landbridge by Irish importers and exporters. The purpose of this research is to establish the volume of traffic using the UK landbridge at present, the likely consequences that Brexit will have on landbridge usage and the various alternative options that may be viable. This research is expected to be completed shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to infrastructural requirements, the Government&rsquo;s recently published Project Ireland 2040 recognises the role and infrastructural plans of ports and airports in supporting continued enhancement of Ireland&rsquo;s high-quality international connectivity.

BusConnects will be delivered by the National Transport Authority (NTA) and will initially address the transition of bus fleets operating within the Greater Dublin Area with potential expansion to other urban centres - towards new low-emission vehicle technologies. It is expected that by 2023, half of the bus fleet (approximately 500 buses) will be converted to low-emission vehicles, with plans for full conversion by 2030. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also established a Green Public Transport Fund to support the uptake of energy-efficient technologies for PSO operators within the public transport sector; specifically, to support pilots, trials and demonstrations of emerging low emission technologies by covering the price differential between the cost of conventionally fuelled buses and the cost of an alternatively fuelled vehicle, as well as any associated refuelling or recharging infrastructure. I understand that the NTA intends to access this Fund before end 2018 to facilitate trials of a range of technologies in urban bus fleets.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA has recently undertaken a market consultation assessing a broad range of alternative fuels and technologies.

This strong move towards electrification in the commuter rail sector which began with DART and was added to by LUAS will be reinforced and further developed through the new Metro Link and the Dart Expansion Programme set out in the National Development Plan. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I recently established a new electric vehicle (EV) grant scheme to support the transition of the Taxi\/Hackney\/Limousine sector to EVs. This new initiative will help to stimulate the uptake of EVs in the SPSV industry by giving drivers up to &euro;7,000 towards the purchase of an EV.

Hotel bed occupancy nationally grew from 56% to 60% between 2016 and 2017 while the aggregated bed occupancy rate for other types of accommodation was significantly lower at 42%.<\/p>  <p>  Occupancy rates for hotels are considerably higher in Dublin and have increased as a result of the increased visitor numbers to Ireland in recent years.  This has led to capacity issues at times of peak demand.  However, a significant programme of hotel building is underway in Dublin to meet this demand.  In this regard, research commissioned by F&aacute;ilte Ireland shows that significant additional tourist accommodation stock, in the order of 5,500 rooms through new builds and extensions, is being brought on stream in Dublin, the bulk in 2018 and 2019. <\/p>  <p>  In response to consumer preferences and in order to boost the economic rationale for investment in hotel developments, F&aacute;ilte Ireland revised its hotel regulations. These changes make investment more attractive by allowing hotel operators provide more rooms per square metre and operate at a lower cost base, thereby improving hotel capacity, competitiveness and profitability.  Consumers benefit from increased room capacity, more competition and a wider range of accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  I am not aware of any issues with regard to the availability of restaurants.  However, I should point out that they are not required to register with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.

Family welfare conferencing is a tool that harnesses the power of the extended family to create durable solutions for children and young people. With the support of an independent facilitator, FWCs enable families to make choices and to take ownership of a situation and its solutions. For example, in the case of relative foster care, a FWC might be used to ascertain the views of the child and their family on who in the extended family might be best placed to offer care to the child and thus lessen the impact and dislocation of entering care. Family Welfare Conferences are also an integral part of the Children Act 2001. The approach recognises the centrality of parental and family relationships and informal support networks in promoting the welfare of children and ensuring their safety, while enabling the Agency to meet its statutory and co-ordination functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400085#WRBB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency","counter":1422,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400085#WRBB02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1423,"qnumday":540,"qnumall":"[17548\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400085#WRBB02900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if Tusla will conduct a case review of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1424,"content":"<p>I can advise the Deputy that I am aware of this case.

The four week time frame may be extended if there is a delay due to Garda vetting requirements.  <\/p>  <p>  As the person in question was selected for JobPath on the 17 March 2018 and his start date for a CE scheme was not within 4 weeks of the start date he is must participate on the JobPath programme and as such is currently ineligible to take up his placement on a CE scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  I wish to take this opportunity to advise the Deputy that I have made changes to the eligibility criteria for CE\/T&uacute;s and JobPath participants from 1 June 2018, whereby  a person can take up an opportunity under CE\/T&uacute;s and participate on JobPath at the same time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400086#WRCC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Applications","counter":1477,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400086#WRCC02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1478,"qnumday":558,"qnumall":"[17409\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400086#WRCC02700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when an application will be processed for a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1272","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1479,"content":"<p>This domiciliary care allowance application has been finalised.

Where a child is being cared for by someone other than their parents, the person looking after the child may apply for a guardian&rsquo;s payment.  The purpose of the guardian&rsquo;s payment scheme is to provide income support in respect of those children whose parents are unable to provide for them, through death or other circumstance.  <\/p>  <p>  Currently, there are around 1,600 people receiving guardian&rsquo;s payments in respect of approximately 2,300 children.  Expenditure on guardian&rsquo;s payments schemes (contributory and non-contributory) was &euro;19.7 million in 2017.  A budget increase of &euro;5 per week per orphan, implemented from March 2018, brings the weekly rate to &euro;181 per orphan; the highest rate of weekly child income support paid by my Department.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has a number of payments available to assist families with children, including &ndash; <\/p>  <p>  - Child  Benefit, a universal payment made in respect of children aged under 18, payable monthly at the rate of &euro;140 per child; <\/p>  <p>  - Family Income Supplement, a means-tested payment income support for families where one or more adult is working. (Importantly, when establishing family means for the purpose of family income supplement, any payments received in respect of guardian&rsquo;s payment or child benefit are disregarded); <\/p>  <p>  - Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance, an annual payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when children start school each autumn.  The allowance is paid at the rate of &euro;125 for children aged 4 to 11 and &euro;250 for children aged 12 or over attending secondary school.  Any payments received in respect of guardian&rsquo;s payment or child benefit are disregarded in determining household income for eligibility purposes; and <\/p>  <p>  - Supplementary Welfare Allowance which includes payments to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  <\/p>  <p>  While the aim of Guardian&rsquo;s Payments is to meet income support needs, it is acknowledged that the supports required by some orphans and guardians may extend beyond that of income support and additional family support services may be required.  Under the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, &ldquo;National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, 2014-2020 &ndash; Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures&rdquo;, responsibility for supporting and promoting the development, welfare and protection of children and the provision of family support services lies with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  <\/p>  <p>  The Guardian&rsquo;s Payments scheme was last reviewed in 2011 and there are no plans to conduct a further review at this time.  Although neither my predecessor nor I have formally met with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs or the Minister for Health on the matter to date, the feasibility of extending further (non-financial) supports to those in receipt of Guardian&rsquo;s payment is under consideration by officials of my Department and the Department of Children &amp;amp; Youth Affairs.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies these matters for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400086#WRCC05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":1503,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400086#WRCC05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1504,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[17543\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400086#WRCC05500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the need to progress an application for a carer's allowance by a person (details supplied) in view of exceptional circumstances will be examined; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1505,"content":"<p>Carer's allowance (CA) is a means-tested social assistance payment made to a person who is habitually resident in the State and who is providing full-time care and attention to a person who has such a disability that they require that level of care.  <\/p><p>An application for CA was received from the person concerned on 20 July 2017.  <\/p><p>The evidence submitted in support of this application was examined and the deciding officer decided that although a certain level of care was being provided the level involved did not amount to full-time care.  <\/p><p>The person concerned was notified on 7 November 2017 of this decision the reason for it and her right of review and appeal.  <\/p><p>My Department were notified on 4 December 2017 that the person concerned had appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).

Once a person is registered to SAFE2 they can be issued with a Public Services Card (PSC). <\/p>  <p>  While it is a matter for each public service provider to determine the appropriate level of identity verification required for each of its services, it is Government policy that SAFE 2 registration is required for access to services that need substantial proof of a person&rsquo;s identity.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform recently published the eGovernment Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2020 which lists a number of public services for which SAFE 2 registration will be required.  Others are likely to be listed in the future.  The transition plans, including communications, will be developed by the Departments\/agencies concerned working with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  At present, a Public Services Card (PSC) cannot be requested by any public or private body or person not included as a specified body in Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended).  The PSC can only be used by public bodies specified in the legislation in the context of conducting a public transaction with the person concerned.  At this time there are no immediate plans to expand the range of specified bodies.  Any increase in the number of specified bodies would have to be provided for in legislation and consequently would have to undergo Oireachtas scrutiny prior to enactment. <\/p>  <p>  However, one of the provisions set out in Section 5 of the Social Welfare, Pensions, and Civil Registration Bill 2017 would, if enacted, enable customers to volunteer their PSC where they wish to use it as a form of proof of identity and\/or age.  However, it is important to note that a non-specified body could not request or demand the production of a PSC. <\/p>  <p>  The proposed legislation would not change the number of specified bodies that can request the PSC.  It would simply give individuals the option to use their PSC if they wished, as proof of identity and\/or age, in transactions with non-specified bodies.<\/p>  <p>  As the law currently stands, even if a card holder volunteers their PSC, a non-Specified Body such as a private sector organisation would be committing an offence by accepting it.  Customer feedback is that they should be allowed to volunteer the card to non-Specified Bodies if it suits them to do so, for the purposes of ID verification such as when signing up to a utility company contract or opening an account with a financial institution.  Customers often report that private companies insist on a State-issued photographic ID such as a Passport or Driver&rsquo;s License which they might not have and which are costly.

The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  <\/p>  <p>  The headline target, Ireland&rsquo;s National Social Target for Poverty Reduction (NSTPR) is to reduce the number of people in consistent poverty to 4% by 2016 (interim target) and to 2% or less by 2020, from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.3%.  In addition, the Irish contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target is to reduce by a minimum of 200,000 the population in 'combined poverty' (i.e. consistent poverty, at-risk-of-poverty or basic deprivation) between 2010 and 2020. My Department is currently reviewing NAPinclusion, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  As part of this update, my Department is also reviewing the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review is being undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  Under NAPinclusion, my Department engages in a number of activities to monitor progress on social inclusion and poverty reduction.  These include ongoing monitoring through the biennial Social Inclusion Report and the annual Social Inclusion Monitor, and engagement in stakeholder consultation with the community and voluntary sector and people experiencing poverty and social exclusion at the annual Social Inclusion Forum.  <\/p>  <p>  Data from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), which forms the basis for reporting in the Social Inclusion Monitor, indicate that consistent poverty rose sharply after 2010, to a peak of 9.1% in 2013.  The latest SILC 2016 data, released by the CSO in December 2017, indicate that this had reduced to 8.3%.  A reduction of 6 percentage points would therefore now be required to meet the 2020 poverty target.

The MIS is defined by the VPSJ as &ldquo;the gross income a household needs in order to reach their minimum essential standard of living&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  The VPSJ&rsquo;s Minimum Essential Standard of Living 2017 (MESL) is derived from a negotiated consensus, based on focus groups with representative households, and discussions with policy-makers and experts.  According to the VPSJ, it is a standard of living which meets an individual's \/ household's physical, psychological and social needs, calculated by identifying the goods and services required by different household types in order to meet these minimum needs.  The costs incorporate factors such as food, clothing, personal care, health, household goods, household services, communications, social inclusion, education, fuel, transport, personal costs, insurance, savings and contingencies.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the MESL for welfare households assumes that households are eligible for a medical card, and as such, health and insurance costs are reduced accordingly, although the cost of over-the-counter medicines and prescription charges remain.  The model for pensioners assumes that the pensioners have the Free Travel pass and the Household Benefits package.  <\/p>  <p>The Minimum Income figures from the Minimum Essential Standard of Living 2017 (the latest publication available) finds that social welfare pensioners in urban areas have adequate levels of income.  This is the case for contributory and non-contributory pensioners, living alone and in a couple (Appendix 6A).<\/p>  <p>  For social welfare pensioners living in rural areas, the VPSJ finds adequate income levels for non-contributory and contributory pensioner couples.  However, it reports inadequate income levels for social welfare pensioners living alone (Appendix 7A).  Excluding housing costs (as housing supplements are separate to weekly social welfare payments), the weekly income gap is reported at &euro;32.65 for non-contributory pensioners living alone.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that, in Budget 2018, I announced a number of improvements for pensioners.  The maximum weekly rate of the State Pension Non-Contributory (SPNC) increased by &euro;5 per week in March, from &euro;227 per week to &euro;232 per week.  The fuel allowance season was extended by one week, from 26 to 27 weeks.  A Christmas Bonus of 85% was also paid in late 2017 &ndash; for a person on the maximum rate of SPNC, this was a payment of &euro;193.<\/p>  <p>  I am also introducing a new telephone support allowance of &euro;2.50 per week, which is directly targeted at people in these circumstances.  Payment of this allowance will commence in June and will be paid automatically to those who are in receipt of both the living alone increase and fuel allowance, i.e., pensioners and people with disabilities of limited means.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, since the publication of the report, Budget improvements have likely reduced the identified gap.

The Central Bank is not prescribed as a Specified Body under Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, so therefore cannot ask for or accept the Public Services Card as a proof of identification.  The PSC can only be used by public bodies specified in the legislation in the context of conducting a public transaction with the person concerned.  At this time there are no immediate plans to expand the range of specified bodies.  Any increase in the number of specified bodies would have to be provided for in legislation and consequently would have to undergo Oireachtas scrutiny prior to enactment. <\/p>  <p>  However, one of the provisions set out in Section 5 of the Social Welfare, Pensions, and Civil Registration Bill 2017 would, if enacted, enable customers to volunteer their PSC where they wish to use it as a form of proof of identity and\/or age.  However, it is important to note that a non-specified body could not request or demand the production of a PSC. <\/p>  <p>  The proposed legislation would not change the number of specified bodies that can request the PSC.  It would simply give individuals the option to use their PSC if they wished, as proof of identity and\/or age, in transactions with non-specified bodies.<\/p>  <p>  As the law currently stands, even if a card holder volunteers their PSC, a non-Specified Body such as a private sector organisation would be committing an offence by accepting it.  Customer feedback is that they should be allowed to volunteer the card to non-Specified Bodies if it suits them to do so, for the purposes of ID verification such as when signing up to a utility company contract or opening an account with a financial institution.  Customers often report that private companies insist on a State-issued photographic ID such as a Passport or Driver&rsquo;s License which they might not have and which are costly.  In contrast, the PSC is free of charge.   Furthermore, and for the sake of absolute clarity - this proposal in no way allows a private sector body to access the customer data on the card chip or on any government database - simply to view\/accept the card as a form of identity and to stop it being an offence for them to accept it.  This measure would be beneficial to holders of the PSC, most especially those who do not hold a driving licence or a passport.  <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, this alternative approach would give power to the individual to control access to and use of their PSC rather than the organisation that they are dealing with.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400088#WREE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","counter":1572,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400088#WREE01300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wastewater Treatment","counter":1571,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400088#WREE01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1572,"qnumday":592,"qnumall":"[17417\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400088#WREE01300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount in fines levied against Ireland for breach of the urban wastewater treatment directive.","asker":"1276","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1573,"content":"<p>The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive mandates EU member states to collect and treat urban waste water in towns and cities to protect public health and avoid pollution of rivers, lakes and coastal waters.

It requires the publication of a national low carbon transition and mitigation plan every five years and my Department is required to identify and develop sectoral mitigation measures for the built environment. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National Mitigation Plan published in 2017 takes account of measures to be implemented in the buildings sector required to meet the EU's energy related targets.  These measures take into account European and International climate change targets, including the Paris climate commitments referred to.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has lead responsibility for implementing the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.  This Directive sets the requirements at an EU level for Member States to improve the energy performance of buildings and to make an important contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  Article 9(1) of the Directive requires Member States to ensure that by 31 December 2020, all new buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. <\/p>  <p>  The Directive defines a Nearly Zero Energy Building, or &ldquo;NZEB&rdquo;, as a building that has a very high energy performance and that the nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, including energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby.  This definition was incorporated in the Building Regulations 1997 &ndash; 2017 last year through the Building Regulations (Amendment) Regulations 2017.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has progressively updated Part L of the Building Regulations, relating to the Conservation of Fuel and Energy in Dwellings, over the last decade in order to improve the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance of all new dwellings to achieve these &ldquo;NZEB&rdquo; performance levels.  These incremental improvements have effectively eased the transition and minimized the additional effort required to achieve the NZEB performance for dwellings.<\/p>  <p>  In 2007, Part L was revised to achieve a 40% improvement in the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance over 2005 performance levels for new dwellings and, in addition, a mandatory renewables requirement for new dwellings was also introduced.  This review also introduced a requirement that new and replacement fossil fuel boilers should be energy efficient condensing boilers, where practical. <\/p>  <p>  In 2011, Part L of the Building Regulations was further revised to achieve an improvement of 60% in the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance over 2005 standard for all new dwellings.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have recently published a public consultation on further improvements to Part L of the Building Regulations to achieve the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive NZEB performance requirements.  This review when implemented will represent an improvement of 70% in energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance over 2005 standards for all new dwellings commencing construction from early 2019, subject to transition arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  Currently 98% of all new dwellings are built to an A3 standard based on Building Energy Rating (BER) data as reported by SEAI in their recent &ldquo;Energy in the Residential Sector&rdquo; 2018 report.<\/p>  <p>  The new Part L performance requirement will equate to a typical new dwelling having a Building Energy Rating or BER of A2.  The amended Part L Building Regulations will stipulate that new dwellings can achieve the new standards by making provision for: - <\/p>  <p>  - A 70% improvement in energy efficiency for new dwellings (relative to 2005 base year standards).<\/p>  <p>  - A 70% reduction in CO2   emissions (again relative to the 2005 base year standards).<\/p>  <p>  - Providing for 20% renewables as a percentage of total building energy use.<\/p>  <p>  These requirements make it more attractive for builders and homeowners to further incorporate renewable technologies and move away from traditional fossil fuels. <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cumulative improvements to regulations mean that a dwelling built to the 2011 regulations would require 90% less energy than the equivalent dwelling built in 1978 to deliver the same standards of heat, hot water and light.  Very significant progress has, therefore, been made in this area, even before the new initiatives outlined above.   <\/p>  <p>  The move from fossil fuels to renewable energy for space heating is expected to continue as a result of the further improvements to Part L currently at public consultation, contributing significantly to meeting Ireland's climate change commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400088#WREE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":1583,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400088#WREE02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1584,"qnumday":596,"qnumall":"[17416\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400088#WREE02500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the number of unauthorised developments local authorities are dealing with are monitored by his Department; if so, the details of same by local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1585,"content":"<p>While planning statistics are compiled by each planning authority on an annual basis for collation and publication on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: , these statistics do not include planning enforcement and unauthorised development related information.<\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to get in touch with the relevant local authorities in relation to the status of their planning enforcement activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400088#WREE02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tenant Purchase Scheme Applications","counter":1586,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400088#WREE02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1587,"qnumday":597,"qnumall":"[17460\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018042400088#WREE02800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of applications for the tenant purchase scheme received by Tipperary County Council in 2016 and 2017; the number of transactions completed in the years concerned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1588,"content":"<p>The operation of the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 is a matter for individual local authorities, in line with relevant legislation, including the Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015.
