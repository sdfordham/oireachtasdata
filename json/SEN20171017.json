It was dangerous then when there was no tower, but it is twice as dangerous now.  <\/p> <p>We should look at legislation that would provide for people to be charged with reckless endangerment and, if necessary, put in jail.

The Taoiseach and his Minister have been a credit to this country.  However, there is always a downside.  This morning I listened to the Minister of State with responsibility for Defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, and was absolutely horrified that he would mislead the country in the way he did.  He spoke about engineering units being available in every barracks in the country to assist the local authorities.  There are no engineering units in counties Donegal, Galway, Limerick or Kilkenny.  A third of an engineering unit is available in Dublin, two thirds of an engineering unit is available in Athlone.  There is one full engineering unit, as we learned during the Donegal floods, available in Cork.  We know that because they brought the bailey bridge to Donegal.   The Minister of State spoke about members of the Defence Forces being available with chainsaws to cut down felled trees.  There are two qualified chain saw operators covering the entire northern section of the country in a line from Dublin to Galway.  I wonder how useful they will be in the entire counties of Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.

Last December, the very first motion put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in's social protection team was on the 2002 pension changes which amended the pension system such that it saw women being more likely to lose out.  They are far more likely to have smaller State pensions than their male counterparts and are less likely to have occupational or private pensions.  I see there is a motion on the subject tabled by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party which is to be discussed tomorrow night in the D&aacute;il, and I welcome that, although it is a bit late.  Fianna F&aacute;il refused to supported our motion in December and got out of it by supporting an amendment instead.  That amendment did not make a clear call and was useless.  I hope Fianna F&aacute;il will deal with urgency with the motion tomorrow night.<\/p> <p>I raise the issue of the detention of the Catalan independence leaders.

It truly is a tragedy for those families.  Like many others, I want to thank the services that turned out so well, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;nna, the ESB, Irish Water and the local authority workers.  I was looking at social media on Monday morning, and there were people criticising the local authority workers in Dublin for clearing up leaves.  I witnessed local authority workers in my area clearing leaves.  They were blocking gullies, which could have led to flooding.  It is so easy to criticise, but I want to commend the work done.  While many of us were safe at home, ambulance and fire brigade personnel and local authority workers were out doing their jobs.  We have to say thank you loudly and clearly to them, and stop nitpicking.<\/p> <p>I have to say that the Government got it right.  Ministers worked exceptionally well together and they worked hard to make sure there was a good response to the storm.  I will not nitpick.  By and large, the response by the Government was excellent.  Certainly, we always have lessons to learn, and we can improve.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, however, this is going to happen more often.  Climate change is a reality, despite Deputy Danny Healy-Rae denying it and saying God controls the weather.  Sea temperatures are increasing.  This storm formed over an area of sea, the temperature of which has risen by 2&deg; Celsius.  It is a one-in-50 year event.  All we can be certain about is that this is going to happen more often.  The House has a responsibility to show leadership.  We need to show very clear leadership in relation to climate change, and to plan for it.  Unfortunately, since we put climate change legislation through the Seanad and the D&aacute;il two years ago, very little has happened.  I am still waiting to see a proper plan from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, because transport emissions are increasing, not diminishing.<\/p> <p>I call on the Leader to pass on my compliments to the Taoiseach and the Ministers for working exceptionally hard over the weekend and, by and large, getting it right, although we can always improve, as I said.  However, I certainly would like a full debate in this House on the measures the people and the Government can take in relation to our carbon footprint and the effect that can have on climate change.   Ireland is a small country, but one thing we can show in relation to climate change is leadership.  We need to show that leadership, otherwise we will see this happening much more frequently.

I am delighted to join in congratulating them and our local authorities.  Our council in Cavan was very proactive in removing fallen trees and so on.  We did not get the worst of the storm but the council was exceptionally effective.  All of that is good.  I also congratulate Met &Eacute;ireann.  Everybody did their part and we can be proud, as a people, of the way it was handled.  Of course I want to convey my sympathy, as did others, to the three bereaved families.  For them it is a horrendous and shocking tragedy.  I agree with Senator Craughwell in respect of the people who were out on the pier in Salthill.  I could not agree more.  Action needs to be taken.  I agree with Senator Ardagh and also commend to the Leader that this question be looked at by way of a special debate.  <\/p> <p>I want to raise one very specific, distinct and new aspect in respect of the storm.  I personally find seeing nice trees along our roadsides aesthetically pleasing, beautiful, lovely and idyllic on some occasions.  They are part of the tapestry of rural Ireland and they are nice.  However, when we consider the three bereaved families today, I put to the Leader that the relevant Minister should come to the House to discuss the need to remove and ban trees within 40 m of either side of a roadway.  In other words they should be set back from the road a distance equal to the height of the tallest tree.  The logic of this measure is that we are going to have more of these storms, as has repeatedly been said in this debate and has been suggested by the science.  We cannot have a situation in which a tree can fall on a car.  It has the potential to kill somebody.  Despite aesthetics and the fact that we would love to have our trees there, they have to go.  That is a lesson from yesterday.  Had this been done, those families would not be in the position they are in today.  Into the future this must be done.  I commend a special debate to the Leader on removing trees from the side of the road to a distance equal to the length of the tallest possible tree.  We have no option on this.  Sadly, the reality is that we need to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#R00200","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I applaud all those people who visited their elderly neighbours yesterday and who asked them whether they needed any groceries from the shop before the storm hit, who helped them secure their homes and who ensured they had torches or candles at hand should the power fail.  These are small actions which made an enormous difference.  It is unfortunate that it takes something such as a major weather warning for us to realise our neighbours may need some assistance or even reassurance in some cases.<\/p><p>Recently physicians and researchers examined the impact of loneliness and social isolation on health, well-being and mortality.  The data are overwhelming and suggest &quot;a lonely person is significantly more likely to suffer an early death than a non-lonely one&quot;.  As a nation we are ageing and the percentage of people over 70 is growing faster than the rest of the population.  Added to this is the rise in single-person households.  We are beginning to see the impact of loneliness and isolation and therefore, new policy approaches are needed.  Much is said about rural isolation and lack of services, which of course is true, but when I worked as a general practitioner in Finglas, the exact same issues of loneliness and isolation existed in the heart of a busy community. <\/p><p>I recommend that Senators consider the Campaign to End Loneliness in the UK.  It is a powerful and evocative campaign that really makes one think about the human consequence of loneliness and isolation.  This highlights the need to look out for our neighbours not just during a storm, but every day. <\/p><p>The political scientist Robert Putnam wrote an excellent book called <i>Bowling Alone<\/i>in which he warned that our stock of social capital, that is, the very fabric of our connections with one other, has plummeted recently, damaging all our lives and communities.

As I stated, the people who engage in this behaviour put not only themselves but also put the first responders who have to deal with the fallout from their actions in danger.<\/p> <p>I raise the cases of people whose premises and businesses suffered severe damage, particularly those who cannot get insurance.  My understanding from those involved in horticulture - a major industry in my area that supplies more than 50% of vegetables to the country - is that it is nigh on impossible to insure a glass house or polytunnel.  Many horticulturists and nursery owners suffered severe damage to their property yesterday.  I hope the Government will take full advantage of the European Union fund established to deal with such natural disasters in order that we can put money aside to help people to deal with the losses they sustained as a consequence of yesterday's storm.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The most important thing today is to commend all the men and women who work in the services and the first responders who have performed such sterling work over the past 24 to 48 hours and who continue to do so.

We are all aware of the vital role of trees and their benefit to our economy and environment, particularly visually, as part of our infrastructure.  This is especially so in our cities.  However, the benefits are only achieved with strategic planting and aftercare.  I do not see a whole lot of aftercare when trees are planted in estates and at the sides of roads.  They are just left there to grow into monstrosities.  This can have a negative impact and lead to a variety of health and safety concerns.  Inappropriate species of trees on roads and streets need to be urgently addressed by the Minister with responsibility for the environment and local government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#T00400","speaker":"1423","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the disappointing manner in which the more than 8,000 special needs assistants, SNAs, in our primary schools are being treated by the Department of Education and Skills.

The problem is that special needs assistants in our primary schools do not know if they will have a job for the year.  If they do not get a post when the allocations are published, they are not in a position to apply for one in another school due to the delay in the publication.  IMPACT, which represents more than 8,000 SNAs countrywide, is of the opinion, with which I agree, that the Department could be in breach of employment law due to the manner in which SNAs are being treated.

I agree with the president of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, Joe Healy, who said that these measures are important to support the timely and structured transfer of family farms.  It is known that the Minister for Finance is likely to reverse the steep increase in stamp duty for non-residential land for a small group of farmers inheriting land from family members.  It is essential, however, that this action will serve those who do not currently qualify for the consanguinity exemption, that is, those who are to inherit active farming land from a family member who is over 67 years of age.  The <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>reported that one farmer's son from Tipperary, whose father was aged over 67, saw his stamp duty bill for taking over the farm rise from &euro;25,000 to &euro;75,000 and, to quote that farmer, Bill Burke, &quot;It makes it an unpayable amount.&quot;<\/p><p>People are often blinded by the value of farming assets but they forget how difficult it is to turn that farming asset into anything like a decent income.

A previous Defamation Bill was put forward in the House at the instigation of the press barons but I managed to derail it by way of a series of well-argued amendments.  One of the reasons I feel strongly about this was because of the last presidential election after which I took ten libel actions.

This is because the bigger groups are just that - bigger- and have more speakers.<\/p> <p>I used to be a member of the Irish Federation of University Teachers but when I went to lecture in Dublin City University, DCU, SIPTU informed me that if I took the job, I had to join it.  I was so innocent at the time that I did not take it on in the courts so I had to join the union to become a lecturer in DCU.  It is as if a person, even though he or she is an Independent, has to join a group within the Seanad in order to obtain proper speaking rights.  This is not an attack on the Cathaoirleach.  It is the form.  The Cathaoirleach is extremely flexible and good but it is the form and it is wrong.

With regard to Storm Ophelia, I would like to acknowledge the phenomenal work done by public servants on the ground in Limerick through Limerick City and County Council, the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and every other public body involved.  It was a day we could be proud of our public servants and the work they do.  I take grave exception to the behaviour of the people who abused and wasted valuable time for emergency services.  We will have to examine this.  There has to be a punishment if people waste valuable time when emergency services could be saving lives.  Unfortunately, three people lost their lives yesterday, which will have a significant impact on their families.  That demonstrates the power of nature.  What we must take out of yesterday is that this will become a recurring feature.  We were supposed to have floods every 100 years but we are now having them every five or six years.  We need to put a structure in place to ensure that if something like this happens again, the people who are abusing the time of the emergency services are held to account.  They should probably be brought to court in some form.  I took grave exception to this behaviour yesterday and we need to look at it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#Z00200","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Before I call the Leader, I would also like to offer my sympathies to the families of those who lost their lives in the storm.

They got it spot on and they more or less told us when the storm would hit the south-west coast, which is unusual for Met &Eacute;ireann.  They have often got a lot of stick for not getting it right over the years but, in this instance, they tracked the storm clinically and correctly for five days and they deserve credit for ensuring those in authority, the public services that were engaged and volunteers who did tremendous work were alert and active when the storm struck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#Z00300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank the 22 Members for their contributions.  Every Member made reference to the tragic deaths of three of our fellow citizens yesterday.  On my own behalf and on behalf of Fine Gael group and the House, I pay tribute to the memory of the late Ms Clare O'Neill, Mr. Michael Pyke and Mr. Fintan Goss who were tragically killed yesterday.  It illustrates the fragility of life and the way in which we must all take care.  These three innocent people were killed going about their business, one bringing her mother to safety, one going home to his family and the other doing what we would all do, which is to try to make life better by clearing an impasse on the road.  I express my deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of the three people who were killed.  Our hearts go out to the families of the bereaved.  It is only through standing together as communities that we can help them cope with their loss.  No words of ours will ease their pain but it will show them that the people are standing in solidarity with them.<\/p> <p>The collective work of those charged with managing, co-ordinating and planning for Storm Ophelia deserve to be commended.  It shows the importance of getting the message out and communicating.  As the Cathaoirleach said, Met &Eacute;ireann got it absolutely spot on and the Government, despite some people's criticism of school closures, was correct.  Code red means code red.  Yesterday, a school roof was blown off in Cork city.  The principal, Mr. Jim Long, acting in a spirit of civic-mindedness was in the school before, during and after the storm.  I fully support the Government's decision to close schools today because an assessment can only be made the day after such an event, not on the night of it or during it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I commend all the men and women in our public services who played a role, and in particular the national emergency co-ordination group under the chairmanship of Mr. Se&aacute;n Hogan.

We must also mention the men and women of ESB Networks, who were out in the eye of the storm along with garda&iacute;.  I lost power in my house early yesterday morning, but it was back this morning because of the ESB Networks workers.  I also pay tribute to the local authority workers and the maligned Irish Water personnel who put themselves at risk yesterday and today in ensuring the water supply.<\/p><p>Senators made reference to the importance of public service radio and television.  We saw it at first hand with RT&Eacute;.  I commend RT&Eacute; and the local radio stations on their work in providing such service.  In our case in Cork city, they extended the talk radio programme for two hours to give people information, to allow people to phone in and communicate.<\/p><p>It is important that we all stand united in condemning the silly irresponsible actions of those who were walking the promenade, swimming and kite surfing.  They may think they are thrill seekers and attention seeking.  However, they are putting their lives and those of the first responders at risk.  We need to look at how we can prosecute or put in place some type of mitigation where these people will not in the future be able to put themselves and others at risk.  I know it might not be popular but there is no place for that type of irresponsible behaviour.  Senator Mullen used the word \"l&uacute;dram&aacute;n\"; I would use a far stronger word to describe those people, but this is a national Parliament and I will not.  However, they should be condemned outright.<\/p><p>It is about ensuring that Government got the response right.  I accept that lessons have to be learnt.  The issue of climate change is a reality; it is not going away.  I agree with what Senator Humphreys said about the Government's response and that of agencies and Departments in the area of climate change.  We need to focus minds on the effects of global warming.  This is not a once-in-50-years event; this will be an ongoing event.  I agree with Senator Humphreys that we need to see action.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of the Defence Forces.  I know he is a champion of the Defence Forces.  I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, say that the Defence Forces are ready to assist in a multiplicity of ways.  I know the Senator does not want to politicise the House by having a vote this afternoon.  In the middle of the storm Defence Forces personnel were out assisting local authorities and local communities.  For example, 25 Army and Air Corps personnel were out assisting ESB Networks and HSE staff.  Members of the Third Infantry Battalion from Kilkenny travelled across the country.  Twelve personnel and five vehicles were out assisting.

The advice from the Government was for people to remain indoors and not to travel, and, thankfully, this advice was heeded.  In regard to the businesses that were open, some of them were manned by family members.  I cannot answer for the city of Dublin but I know that the city of Cork was pretty much closed, with the exception of one or two small shops.  If there are particular issues of which the Senator is aware, I would be happy to bring them to the attention of the Government.<\/p><p>On the issue of financial cost, the Taoiseach has said that local authorities will be assisted.

Following on from the raising of the issue with me yesterday by a member of staff from the Senator's office, I raised the matter with the Minister, Deputy Murphy, who acted immediately.  I welcome the members of the deaf community who are in the Visitors Gallery for the next item on today's agenda.  It is important that the deaf community is assisted in every possible way by the organs of the State, in particular RT&Eacute;.

Senator O'Reilly highlighted the issue of the close proximity of trees to our roadways and motorways.

We had a debate a number of years ago on the abolition of the Seanad.  When I was in opposition, I strongly supported the Senators in that campaign.  One of the reasons I supported them was because of work such as we are doing today.  It is very important work for Irish society and, in this context, it is great work for the deaf community.<\/p> <p>Senator Mark Daly has tabled a small number of amendments which do not reflect the Government amendments.  I hope that during the debate we will be able to reach agreement on these.  I have an open mind on these issues and I want to listen to what the Senator and others have to say.  I will be very open to accepting the consensus opinion of the House on each of these points.<\/p> <p>I have difficulty in principle with amendment No. 9.  If Senator Mark Daly is happy to accept my amendments instead, amendments Nos. 10 and 11, I will be able to reciprocate on the other issues on which we have slightly different approaches.  The amendments we are now discussing are all technical.  They include an amendment of the Title of the Bill to reflect other amendments which we will discuss this afternoon, and the deletion of definitions of words or phrases which will no longer form part of this Bill and are therefore unnecessary.  The rule, which is a sensible one, is that definitions must relate to words and phrases which are used in the Act and which must be defined for clarity.  <\/p> <p>Other amendments include a regulation-making power which relates to the definition of a public body in section 2, so that regulations can be made to include new public bodies, if necessary and if desired, in respect of section 2(h), which allows for additional public bodies to be prescribed; and a correction of the text of that section by deleting the words \"following consultation with the Commission\".

On the Order of Business today, the question of a signer for the emergency committee report that was broadcast on RT&Eacute; television was raised.  There was a signer, who was very noticeable.  I was interested in following his signage.<\/p> <p>I received a list of amendments proposed by the deaf groups and I signed them up immediately and sent them to the Bills Office.

Some 42 of 46 amendments originally proposed by the deaf community via Senator Daly have now been supported by the Government.  One of the four remaining amendments was ruled out of order as it would create an expense on the Exchequer and the other three are small matters that are up for agreement and the Minister of State has suggested compromise.

It was important for everyone else watching it to realise that some of our neighbours do not get the updates and do not know what is happening.

Our amendment proposes that it \"come into operation on such day or days not later than 3 years after the passing of this Act\".  While that may seem a long time off, the Government amendment does not give a date when it would come into operation.  It states that it: \"shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may appoint by order or orders either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision\".  The important point is that if the Government falls next year and the provisions of this Bill are not enacted, it may never be enacted.  We have seen, unfortunately, time and again, Bills passed by this House and the other House, which the Minister of State has supported, outlining regulations that should take effect but which have never come in.

It replaces a raft of sections about setting up a sign language council.  It requires that only qualified sign language interpreters can be hired by the State.  This follows discussions with the deaf community because even when interpreters brought into hospitals were not qualified or nearly fit to do the job, the State continued to employ them because it used an interpreting company for sign language and other languages and assumed that these people were qualified.

In response to the issues raised by the deaf community, the commitments to ISL in the national disability inclusion strategy have also been strengthened.  In addition to providing to the extension of working hours in the ISL remote interpretation centre to evenings and weekends, the new national disability inclusion strategy, which was published on 14 July, supports the legislation to ensure all public bodies provide ISL users with free interpretation when accessing or availing of their statutory services.  A new action will ensure that the sign language information service, SLIS, will be resourced to increase the number of trained sign language and deaf interpreters.  A quality assurance and registration scheme for interpreters will be established and there will be ongoing professional training and development provided for interpreters.<\/p> <p>As already announced, I have secured the funding for these actions, the details of which will be provided in 2018 and which will be worked out in dialogue with the SLIS, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Citizens Information Board.

One key provision of the Bill will be of critical importance in helping to ensure the users of ISL can, in practice, gain access on an equal basis with others to public services.  I have listened very carefully to the deaf community on how difficult it can be to gain access to public services and we have crafted this improvement to the Bill, which I hope we can agree to, so as to address that issue.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 11 proposes the deletion of the reference to the fostering, extension and transmission of deaf culture in section 2.  There are two difficulties here.  The first is a definitional one; it is not clear how one can define \"culture\" in this context.  The second is a more serious objection in that it is entirely wrong in principle for the Government or the Oireachtas to purport to have the right to say any group of people does not have the right to develop its culture or partake in cultural events.  People have the right to go about their lives without interference by, or the approval of, the State.  If we declare in legislation that the State grants the right to develop culture we could, equally logically, provide for a community not to have that right and this is a precedent we should not set.  If we were to insert \"we shall not have the right\" we would be including a provision that would amount to unconstitutional interference in the right of the deaf community to organise itself and live its life without such interference.  It is not necessary to legislate for something that people have an inherent right to do, unless there are special circumstances that impose a compelling logic.  There is no need to do so in this instance.<\/p> <p>I accept that the Senators might apply the same logic to the rest of subsection 2 and they may have a point in this, but the difference is that we are linking the right to use ISL with the obligation on public bodies to provide free interpretation so the positive statement in the rest of subsection 2 serves a useful purpose.  However, it is not necessary to make a similar statement in legislation in relation to the development and transmission of culture and the House should not set such an undesirable precedent.

While the amendment is due to be accepted, I want to add to Senator Daly's remarks and put a question to the Minister of State.  There is a duty in terms of culture that is not entirely outside the role of the State.  At a Council of Europe level, we have a document, In From the Margins, which states that there is a responsibility to ensure participation in cultural life is available to all.  While I understand absolutely that this may need to be amended in the Bill, I urge that as the legislation comes to pass, we do not simply restrict the availability of translation services to those very urgent and essential areas my colleague highlighted, including the courts, medicine and access to services.  We must also set an ambition for the State to ensure that those who are deaf are able to participate in and, importantly, contribute to other aspects of the cultural life of the State so that we in the hearing community can avail of translators also and the cultural perspectives of those who may be deaf.

A few months ago, we had a statement of recognition of the ethnicity of Travellers.  Having spoken to people in that community, I know it gave them a great lift and a great sense of inclusion.  I accept that we have a hell of a lot of work to do to implement the rights around that and if anybody wants to come at me on it, I will acknowledge that we need to do a lot more.  The level of exclusion that goes on regarding the deaf community is unacceptable.  The good news is that we are moving in the right direction, albeit we must, of course, move faster and ensure that we not only respect their cultural rights but also address the issue for the broader society.  Senator Dolan mentioned the impact of the sign language interpreters on television during the crisis over the last few days, not only on the deaf community but on the broader society.

The issue of access to the service for cultural and social purposes, in which regard there would be a voucher system, will be discussed under amendment No. 17, to which the Minister of State referred and which will be ruled out of order.  However, we hope to move it on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and get agreement so that we can put on a legislative footing a system whereby the Government would each year have to consider providing a fund in order that members of the deaf community could, for example, attend job interviews and cultural events.  Without it, they would be unaware of what was happening because neither they nor the organisations putting on the events could afford interpreters or might not even know that deaf people would be attending.

This is very important.  The purpose of what we are trying to achieve in amendment No. 17, which is ruled out of order, is to ensure access for members of the deaf community who are going to other events.  It is not just about access to the State; it is about access to society and to life outside of access to the State, which would form a very limited amount of their access but which is very important nonetheless.  While we agree to the amendment, we hope the Minister of State will be able to persuade Cabinet colleagues to put it on a legislative footing.

This is one of the key sections of the Bill.  We are creating an obligation on public bodies to provide free services to Irish Sign Language, ISL, users when users are accessing public services and entitlements.  This is a very important part.  Given the real constraints we face in regard to the availability of qualified people and the cost of providing interpreters who may have to travel at short notice, the Government amendment proposes that the provision of a remote web-based service shall be sufficient to meet the duty of public bodies under this section.  The sign language interpreting service, SLIS, provides a remote service which works well and is funded via the Citizens Information Board.<\/p> <p>I note Senator Mark Daly seeks to change this provision so that the consent of a user will be required if the service is not to be provided face to face.  From our discussions with the deaf community, we know that a remote service may not be suitable in all cases so I am open - I say this very strongly - to considering this suggestion of requiring the user's consent.<\/p> <p>I might also mention that in response to concerns raised by the deaf community, the commitments in regard to ISL in the national disability inclusion strategy have been strengthened, and this is something I myself am driving.  The new national disability inclusion strategy was published on 14 July.  We are meeting regularly and pushing many of these issues.  I have already asked every single member of the Cabinet to push the disability issue right across their Departments and they are coming back to me again on 8 December.  I wanted to let Members know that work is going on in the background.<\/p> <p>In addition to actions providing for the extension of the ISL remote service to evenings and weekends, and supporting this legislation to ensure that all public bodies provide ISL users with free services when accessing or availing of the statutory services, there is a new action which ensures that the sign language service will be resourced to increase the number of trained sign language and deaf interpreters.  A quality assurance and registration scheme for interpreters will be established and ongoing professional training and development will be provided for these interpreters.  As already announced, I have secured funding for the above actions.  The details of the funding to be provided in 2018, year one, will be worked out in dialogue with the SLIS, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Citizens Information Board.  This will ensure we have sufficient and sufficiently competent people available in order that the public bodies can meet their obligations and that the ISL user and the public body can both be confident that the interpreting service is of high quality.  As mentioned, we are aware of situations where this was a disaster.  Acceptance of this amendment has been agreed on the basis that we do not need the provision in regard to the establishment of a new public body, as I have mentioned.  I commend the amendment to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#LL00600","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 15:<\/p><blockquote>To delete subsection (4) and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;(4) Provision of or availing of a remote, web-based service shall, if the Irish Sign Language user consents, be sufficient to meet the obligations of a public body under this section.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>Moving an amendment to an amendment sounds a little like poetry or pedantry but I can only describe this amendment as legislative poetry.  Earlier in the debate on the Bill there was huge discussion and argument on the difference between &quot;required&quot; and &quot;reasonable&quot;.  The original amendment had been that &quot;A public body shall do all that is required&quot;.  The argument which was made by the writers of the poetry opposite me was that, in fact, because of the lack of capacity in terms of the number of sign language interpreters available to the State at present, we cannot put a burden on the State that we know is not reasonable, and we can only do what is reasonable.  It was suggested that, because of this legislation, there will be opportunities for sign language interpreters into the future but we must do all that is reasonable, and that is the balance of legislation.  Again, part of the poetry of the writing of this legislation was the issue of the very generous suggestion and proposal from the Minister of State's officials in regard to the headline.  The original headline in our proposal was &quot;Principles to guide public bodies&quot;, whereas the officials suggested the wording &quot;Duty of public bodies&quot;, which is far more important and forceful, and puts a greater onus on public bodies to ensure they do what they are required to do under the legislation.<\/p><p>We are proposing an amendment to the amendment, which is rare enough, but when we are writing this kind of poetry, we might as well use every rule in the book.  While we would all assume that, due to technology, one could have a sign language interpreter with an iPhone who could hear the conversation, there are, of course, situations where there is more than one person in the room discussing, say, a medical issue with a member of the deaf community who does not want another family member there.  For example, there might be more than one consultant and there might be a team of doctors in the room, and the same could apply in a legal situation where a person is getting advice or there is questioning from garda&iacute;.  Where there is more than one member of the deaf community and one other person, using web-based interpreting is not appropriate or practical.  Again, this proposal arose due to the discussions with the deaf community over the summer, including face-to-face meetings.  These discussions in themselves proved the point, in that if we were trying to have those discussions with web-based interpreting, it would have been impossible.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister of State will agree to the amendment to the amendment.  We are delighted to support the proposal on the duty of public bodies.  The amendment we ask the Minister of State to support states: &ldquo;Provision of or availing of a remote, web-based service shall, if the Irish Sign Language user consents, be sufficient to meet the obligations of a public body under this section.&rdquo;  It is with the consent of the sign language user that the web-based service would be provided, and this could be done in many circumstances.  However, in those circumstances where it is not practical and would not give the right outcome, we need to ensure the permission of the member of the deaf community is given.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#LL00700","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I second the amendment to the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#MM00100","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in supports the amendment to the amendment, which provides that \"provision of or availing of a remote, web-based service shall, if the Irish Sign Language user consents, be sufficient to meet the obligations of a public body under this section.\"  This means that the user will be in control of the decision as to whether the service is sufficient.

Even that jurisdiction is not happy with the education section of its Act.  New Zealand has also had this difficulty and did not include a provision for access to education in its equivalent legislation.  It is now going through the enormous process of trying to rectify that omission in legislation.<\/p> <p>It has taken a colossal effort on the part of many people to get this legislation this far.  The idea of even having to amend it at some future date would be enormously daunting.  This amendment will not stop provisions being changed by policy decisions, budgetary allocations or ministerial decision.  That could only happen, however, if there is onus on the Government to review this legislation every five years.  That would mean that the deaf community could list the parts of the legislation, or the parts of policy falling outside the legislation, which they feel are not working.  That report or review could then be debated in this House and there would be an onus on the Government to then implement the recommendations or requirements.  If that has not been done five years later, the recommendations will have formed a benchmark against which to measure implementation.<\/p> <p>This is not a perfect system but we have to live in the world of what is doable.  What matters is what works.  This works.  As I said, it is not what we started out with and hoped to achieve, which was to require a review every three years, but it is something that should be done with legislation because it allows for review and allows people to look at provisions which may not be working as intended.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to support our requirement for a review of the operation of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#NN03000","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Senators Conway-Walsh, Kelleher, Boyhan and Warfield wish to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#NN03100","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.

I was at one of the meetings in the Department with the Minister of State.  There was a big delegation led by Senator Daly.  It may have been one of the biggest delegations ever to Hawkins House.

As he said, this is a civil rights Bill.  It ensure that the citizens of this State who suffer from the most extreme marginalisation, as described by our Committee on Justice and Equality, have rights enshrined in law.  Members of the deaf community on this island are unable to access the most basic of services.  Citizens are excluded from participating in civil and economic society and activity because they are deaf.  When we pass this Bill, we will have enshrined in law the meaning of the 1916 Proclamation when it refers to \"cherishing all of the children of the nation equally\" and states that the Republic would guarantee religious and civil liberties, equal rights and equal opportunities and declare the resolve to pursue the happiness of all citizens.<\/p> <p>I thank the members of the Irish Deaf Society, including Eddie Redmond, Lianne Quigley and John Bosco Conama, and all those members of the deaf community who had input into this Bill.

There are too many Departments and public servants to name, but I will name two.  The Minister of State has already spoken about Deagl&aacute;n &Oacute; Briain.  He is an extraordinary public servant.  He is not just a civil servant; he is a public servant because he puts in long hours.  He put in every one of those six hours at that meeting in Hawkins House.  It was a long day which was not over until after 9 p.m.  He went through the Bill section by section and gave of his vast experience and expertise.  He improved the Bill and gave great advice.  Gerry Maguire, a most extraordinary individual, is in the Gallery.  Mr. Maguire was supposed to be on the Gerry Ryan show for ten minutes and ended up being on it for an hour telling his story.  He has written a book called <i>Walk Away &amp;amp; Forget Him<\/i>.  It is an extraordinary story.  It is the story of this Bill.  It is about people who suffered from extreme marginalisation and people who were left abandoned by the system.  We always need champions.  Gerry is a champion of this Bill and his mother was his champion.  I thank Gerry for his great work on this Bill.  His book describes the challenges he faces and the triumph over adversity, the battle for integration and the fight for independence, as well as fighting all the other demons that we all face.  He will be signing copies afterwards.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Minister of State for his support for the Bill.  It shows in a very bizarre way that new politics works.  It works slowly, tortuously so.  We had that big battle here on that day because that is the way old politics would have worked.  The Bill would have died on that day but new politics requires a lot more engagement.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State spoke about my staff.  I too have someone like Gerry Maguire who works tireless hours.  We do not have a big staff, myself and my parliamentary assistant, Grace Coyle, because we are the staff.  She is my boss and the chief of operations.  She was in charge of all the legislation, countless amendments and drafting and keeping people informed.  She has been working on this Bill since 2013, which is a long time.  We have been involved in some big issues such as flags for schools, which we organised with the Department last year.  She organised the event in Croke Park where 6,000 children showed up from 723 schools and were presented with a flag that flew from the building where the first tricolour was flown.  I was too busy getting re-elected so she was doing everything else, including getting me re-elected.  We did the report together on uniting Ireland, which was the first report of its kind in the history of the State.  That started on 1 January at 6.30.  She was also involved in getting a replica of the 1916 Proclamation put inside the Washington Monument which, I suppose, enshrines what we are trying to do here today.<br\/><br\/>It takes a team of formidable people to make history and to get this legislation passed.  If and when it goes through the D&aacute;il and is signed by the President, Senator Alice-Mary Higgins's father, hopefully before the end of the year, it will only be the 27th Private Member's Bill in the history of the State to achieve this.

He has stuck with it since 2013 and it is now 2017.  That is a remarkable achievement.  It does not surprise me.  It is his style.  He is known for his focus on specific topics.  He is persistent.  He referred to Grace Coyle.  I think I met her more often than I met Senator Daly to work on this issue.  She co-ordinated it and always stood with it and believed that she, Senator Daly and their team would get it over the line.  They are a formidable and successful team, as today demonstrates.  It is really important that the deaf community has a champion in Senator Daly.  They were right to believe he could see it through to the end.  He used every mechanism and tool in the book to put the pressure on.  He was right to do so.  That is the art and skill of politics.  Ultimately, there needs to be compromise.<\/p> <p>I want to acknowledge the Minister of State.  I remember the first day I came across all of this and the tensions that were there.  We have moved on and I thank the Minister of State and his team.  There is no question about their commitment.  He is right to point out the issues of funding and resources.  That aspect will become an issue.  All we can hope for is that the Bill will go through the Houses as quickly as possible and will be proactively pushed at every level so that there is no delay.  It is critically important.  It is about equality and access to so many aspects of personal and professional life and everything that goes with communication.  I acknowledge the enormous work and goodwill of the Minister of State and of everyone on all sides who took part in this debate.  It is a really positive step in respect of new politics.  I salute Senators Clifford-Lee and Mark Daly for the level of input they had into the amendments.  That made for the smooth transition of today's work.  I thank them and I thank the deaf community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#QQ00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I thank both the Minister of State and the team in the Irish Deaf Society.

I know from my communication with my own colleagues in Limerick, who were very vocal in putting forward their view, that it was down to everyone working together.

Reference was made earlier to the levels of poverty faced by the deaf community and I hope this will be a step forward for them to ensure independence, autonomy and better outcomes for the community as a whole.  I welcome the members of the deaf community who are here in the Gallery.  It is a big day for them and I particularly welcome Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona led by principal Marianne Brady, who is an old school friend of mine from Waterford.  She is doing great work up in Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona in Renmore in Galway.

Some of us were never polluted with the old politics.<\/p> <p>There are two wonderful things about this evening's debate.  First is the actual debate and the conclusion to it.  Second is this last piece, which is not focused on the legislation but rather is about recognising others and the contributions they have made.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is a colour piece about people who have been involved in the process.  I will not mention any of those in the Gallery or among Members whose names have already been well acknowledged, but it is important to bring this back to the part people have played with some bit of colour on their lives and backgrounds.<\/p><p>The issue of sign language interpretation arose yesterday and I wish to make a subtle point about it.  There was no unwillingness on the part of anybody on the State side, in RT&Eacute; or among those involved in the planning for Ireland's response, when the lack of sign language interpretation was raised as an issue with them.  Rather, it was a case of \"We never thought of that\".  I have been informed that as we have been dealing with the Bill this evening, many people from the Irish Sign Language community have been expressing their upset and anger that the Oireachtas is not broadcasting the debate with live interpretation on the Internet or television.  I will just leave it at that.  While there would be no huge difficulty with getting that to happen, it is the thoughtlessness that screws up people's daily lives again and again.  It is not that one will get a row from anybody as to why they cannot do this or that; it is simply that it was just not thought about.  The legislation, the UN convention and the strategy being implemented are about putting smacht on all of us involved in public services to ensure we think and think again.  The failure to think about simple and practical things is an injury to people who are already well outside the Pale in terms of any easy participation in life.<\/p><p>We have seen the same issue in public transport, as the Minister of State knows.  Even where there are accessible bus services and even when there is a day's or two days' notice, the system does not seem to be able to provide an appropriate bus.  It is the same torrid issue of simply being forgotten.  While I am labouring the point, it is an important one.  We often can do things, but fail.  We should be very clear that the compromise we are lauding here today is a price people who are deaf pay every single day.  Every day, they accept that while it is great that there are certain things they can now do, they must also accept that it is less than what they should have.  That is something we must keep in mind.  We talk about this from the perspective of what the State can afford and \"reasonable cost\" for the private provider, but we should flip that and ask about the unreasonable cost and compromise people must still make in their daily lives.  We must continually remind ourselves of that aspect.  Nevertheless, this remains a joyous occasion because we have moved to another stage.  Hopefully, the legislation will get through the other House sooner rather than later and be implemented.  In our happiness that we have concluded this well, we must remain conscious that it is not the end point and that there is a still a stretch to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#QQ00500","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I am very happy to see the Bill on Final Stage and I support its passing 100%.

My colleagues and I in the Civil Engagement Group in the House were happy to engage with them on the Bill and to offer our full support.
