The Taoiseach and his Minister have been a credit to this country.  However, there is always a downside.  This morning I listened to the Minister of State with responsibility for Defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, and was absolutely horrified that he would mislead the country in the way he did.  He spoke about engineering units being available in every barracks in the country to assist the local authorities.  There are no engineering units in counties Donegal, Galway, Limerick or Kilkenny.  A third of an engineering unit is available in Dublin, two thirds of an engineering unit is available in Athlone.  There is one full engineering unit, as we learned during the Donegal floods, available in Cork.  We know that because they brought the bailey bridge to Donegal.   The Minister of State spoke about members of the Defence Forces being available with chainsaws to cut down felled trees.  There are two qualified chain saw operators covering the entire northern section of the country in a line from Dublin to Galway.  I wonder how useful they will be in the entire counties of Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.

Last December, the very first motion put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in's social protection team was on the 2002 pension changes which amended the pension system such that it saw women being more likely to lose out.  They are far more likely to have smaller State pensions than their male counterparts and are less likely to have occupational or private pensions.  I see there is a motion on the subject tabled by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party which is to be discussed tomorrow night in the D&aacute;il, and I welcome that, although it is a bit late.  Fianna F&aacute;il refused to supported our motion in December and got out of it by supporting an amendment instead.  That amendment did not make a clear call and was useless.  I hope Fianna F&aacute;il will deal with urgency with the motion tomorrow night.<\/p> <p>I raise the issue of the detention of the Catalan independence leaders.

It truly is a tragedy for those families.  Like many others, I want to thank the services that turned out so well, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;nna, the ESB, Irish Water and the local authority workers.  I was looking at social media on Monday morning, and there were people criticising the local authority workers in Dublin for clearing up leaves.  I witnessed local authority workers in my area clearing leaves.  They were blocking gullies, which could have led to flooding.  It is so easy to criticise, but I want to commend the work done.  While many of us were safe at home, ambulance and fire brigade personnel and local authority workers were out doing their jobs.  We have to say thank you loudly and clearly to them, and stop nitpicking.<\/p> <p>I have to say that the Government got it right.  Ministers worked exceptionally well together and they worked hard to make sure there was a good response to the storm.  I will not nitpick.  By and large, the response by the Government was excellent.  Certainly, we always have lessons to learn, and we can improve.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, however, this is going to happen more often.  Climate change is a reality, despite Deputy Danny Healy-Rae denying it and saying God controls the weather.  Sea temperatures are increasing.  This storm formed over an area of sea, the temperature of which has risen by 2&deg; Celsius.  It is a one-in-50 year event.  All we can be certain about is that this is going to happen more often.  The House has a responsibility to show leadership.  We need to show very clear leadership in relation to climate change, and to plan for it.  Unfortunately, since we put climate change legislation through the Seanad and the D&aacute;il two years ago, very little has happened.  I am still waiting to see a proper plan from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, because transport emissions are increasing, not diminishing.<\/p> <p>I call on the Leader to pass on my compliments to the Taoiseach and the Ministers for working exceptionally hard over the weekend and, by and large, getting it right, although we can always improve, as I said.  However, I certainly would like a full debate in this House on the measures the people and the Government can take in relation to our carbon footprint and the effect that can have on climate change.   Ireland is a small country, but one thing we can show in relation to climate change is leadership.  We need to show that leadership, otherwise we will see this happening much more frequently.  The environment we pass on to our children and our great-grandchildren is certainly going to be far worse than what was passed on to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#Q00300","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

I am delighted to join in congratulating them and our local authorities.  Our council in Cavan was very proactive in removing fallen trees and so on.  We did not get the worst of the storm but the council was exceptionally effective.  All of that is good.  I also congratulate Met &Eacute;ireann.  Everybody did their part and we can be proud, as a people, of the way it was handled.  Of course I want to convey my sympathy, as did others, to the three bereaved families.  For them it is a horrendous and shocking tragedy.  I agree with Senator Craughwell in respect of the people who were out on the pier in Salthill.  I could not agree more.  Action needs to be taken.  I agree with Senator Ardagh and also commend to the Leader that this question be looked at by way of a special debate.  <\/p> <p>I want to raise one very specific, distinct and new aspect in respect of the storm.  I personally find seeing nice trees along our roadsides aesthetically pleasing, beautiful, lovely and idyllic on some occasions.  They are part of the tapestry of rural Ireland and they are nice.  However, when we consider the three bereaved families today, I put to the Leader that the relevant Minister should come to the House to discuss the need to remove and ban trees within 40 m of either side of a roadway.  In other words they should be set back from the road a distance equal to the height of the tallest tree.  The logic of this measure is that we are going to have more of these storms, as has repeatedly been said in this debate and has been suggested by the science.  We cannot have a situation in which a tree can fall on a car.  It has the potential to kill somebody.  Despite aesthetics and the fact that we would love to have our trees there, they have to go.  That is a lesson from yesterday.  Had this been done, those families would not be in the position they are in today.  Into the future this must be done.  I commend a special debate to the Leader on removing trees from the side of the road to a distance equal to the length of the tallest possible tree.  We have no option on this.  Sadly, the reality is that we need to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#R00200","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I applaud all those people who visited their elderly neighbours yesterday and who asked them whether they needed any groceries from the shop before the storm hit, who helped them secure their homes and who ensured they had torches or candles at hand should the power fail.  These are small actions which made an enormous difference.  It is unfortunate that it takes something such as a major weather warning for us to realise our neighbours may need some assistance or even reassurance in some cases.<\/p><p>Recently physicians and researchers examined the impact of loneliness and social isolation on health, well-being and mortality.  The data are overwhelming and suggest &quot;a lonely person is significantly more likely to suffer an early death than a non-lonely one&quot;.  As a nation we are ageing and the percentage of people over 70 is growing faster than the rest of the population.  Added to this is the rise in single-person households.  We are beginning to see the impact of loneliness and isolation and therefore, new policy approaches are needed.  Much is said about rural isolation and lack of services, which of course is true, but when I worked as a general practitioner in Finglas, the exact same issues of loneliness and isolation existed in the heart of a busy community. <\/p><p>I recommend that Senators consider the Campaign to End Loneliness in the UK.  It is a powerful and evocative campaign that really makes one think about the human consequence of loneliness and isolation.  This highlights the need to look out for our neighbours not just during a storm, but every day. <\/p><p>The political scientist Robert Putnam wrote an excellent book called <i>Bowling Alone<\/i>in which he warned that our stock of social capital, that is, the very fabric of our connections with one other, has plummeted recently, damaging all our lives and communities.

My understanding from those involved in horticulture - a major industry in my area that supplies more than 50% of vegetables to the country - is that it is nigh on impossible to insure a glass house or polytunnel.  Many horticulturists and nursery owners suffered severe damage to their property yesterday.  I hope the Government will take full advantage of the European Union fund established to deal with such natural disasters in order that we can put money aside to help people to deal with the losses they sustained as a consequence of yesterday's storm.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The most important thing today is to commend all the men and women who work in the services and the first responders who have performed such sterling work over the past 24 to 48 hours and who continue to do so.

We are all aware of the vital role of trees and their benefit to our economy and environment, particularly visually, as part of our infrastructure.  This is especially so in our cities.  However, the benefits are only achieved with strategic planting and aftercare.  I do not see a whole lot of aftercare when trees are planted in estates and at the sides of roads.  They are just left there to grow into monstrosities.  This can have a negative impact and lead to a variety of health and safety concerns.  Inappropriate species of trees on roads and streets need to be urgently addressed by the Minister with responsibility for the environment and local government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#T00400","speaker":"1423","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the disappointing manner in which the more than 8,000 special needs assistants, SNAs, in our primary schools are being treated by the Department of Education and Skills.

The problem is that special needs assistants in our primary schools do not know if they will have a job for the year.  If they do not get a post when the allocations are published, they are not in a position to apply for one in another school due to the delay in the publication.  IMPACT, which represents more than 8,000 SNAs countrywide, is of the opinion, with which I agree, that the Department could be in breach of employment law due to the manner in which SNAs are being treated.

I agree with the president of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, Joe Healy, who said that these measures are important to support the timely and structured transfer of family farms.  It is known that the Minister for Finance is likely to reverse the steep increase in stamp duty for non-residential land for a small group of farmers inheriting land from family members.  It is essential, however, that this action will serve those who do not currently qualify for the consanguinity exemption, that is, those who are to inherit active farming land from a family member who is over 67 years of age.  The <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>reported that one farmer's son from Tipperary, whose father was aged over 67, saw his stamp duty bill for taking over the farm rise from &euro;25,000 to &euro;75,000 and, to quote that farmer, Bill Burke, &quot;It makes it an unpayable amount.&quot;<\/p><p>People are often blinded by the value of farming assets but they forget how difficult it is to turn that farming asset into anything like a decent income.

A previous Defamation Bill was put forward in the House at the instigation of the press barons but I managed to derail it by way of a series of well-argued amendments.  One of the reasons I feel strongly about this was because of the last presidential election after which I took ten libel actions.

This is because the bigger groups are just that - bigger- and have more speakers.<\/p> <p>I used to be a member of the Irish Federation of University Teachers but when I went to lecture in Dublin City University, DCU, SIPTU informed me that if I took the job, I had to join it.  I was so innocent at the time that I did not take it on in the courts so I had to join the union to become a lecturer in DCU.  It is as if a person, even though he or she is an Independent, has to join a group within the Seanad in order to obtain proper speaking rights.  This is not an attack on the Cathaoirleach.  It is the form.  The Cathaoirleach is extremely flexible and good but it is the form and it is wrong.

With regard to Storm Ophelia, I would like to acknowledge the phenomenal work done by public servants on the ground in Limerick through Limerick City and County Council, the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and every other public body involved.  It was a day we could be proud of our public servants and the work they do.  I take grave exception to the behaviour of the people who abused and wasted valuable time for emergency services.  We will have to examine this.  There has to be a punishment if people waste valuable time when emergency services could be saving lives.  Unfortunately, three people lost their lives yesterday, which will have a significant impact on their families.  That demonstrates the power of nature.  What we must take out of yesterday is that this will become a recurring feature.  We were supposed to have floods every 100 years but we are now having them every five or six years.  We need to put a structure in place to ensure that if something like this happens again, the people who are abusing the time of the emergency services are held to account.  They should probably be brought to court in some form.  I took grave exception to this behaviour yesterday and we need to look at it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#Z00200","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Before I call the Leader, I would also like to offer my sympathies to the families of those who lost their lives in the storm.

They got it spot on and they more or less told us when the storm would hit the south-west coast, which is unusual for Met &Eacute;ireann.  They have often got a lot of stick for not getting it right over the years but, in this instance, they tracked the storm clinically and correctly for five days and they deserve credit for ensuring those in authority, the public services that were engaged and volunteers who did tremendous work were alert and active when the storm struck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#Z00300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank the 22 Members for their contributions.  Every Member made reference to the tragic deaths of three of our fellow citizens yesterday.  On my own behalf and on behalf of Fine Gael group and the House, I pay tribute to the memory of the late Ms Clare O'Neill, Mr. Michael Pyke and Mr. Fintan Goss who were tragically killed yesterday.  It illustrates the fragility of life and the way in which we must all take care.  These three innocent people were killed going about their business, one bringing her mother to safety, one going home to his family and the other doing what we would all do, which is to try to make life better by clearing an impasse on the road.  I express my deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of the three people who were killed.  Our hearts go out to the families of the bereaved.  It is only through standing together as communities that we can help them cope with their loss.  No words of ours will ease their pain but it will show them that the people are standing in solidarity with them.<\/p> <p>The collective work of those charged with managing, co-ordinating and planning for Storm Ophelia deserve to be commended.  It shows the importance of getting the message out and communicating.  As the Cathaoirleach said, Met &Eacute;ireann got it absolutely spot on and the Government, despite some people's criticism of school closures, was correct.  Code red means code red.  Yesterday, a school roof was blown off in Cork city.  The principal, Mr. Jim Long, acting in a spirit of civic-mindedness was in the school before, during and after the storm.  I fully support the Government's decision to close schools today because an assessment can only be made the day after such an event, not on the night of it or during it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=17\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I commend all the men and women in our public services who played a role, and in particular the national emergency co-ordination group under the chairmanship of Mr. Se&aacute;n Hogan.

We must also mention the men and women of ESB Networks, who were out in the eye of the storm along with garda&iacute;.  I lost power in my house early yesterday morning, but it was back this morning because of the ESB Networks workers.  I also pay tribute to the local authority workers and the maligned Irish Water personnel who put themselves at risk yesterday and today in ensuring the water supply.<\/p><p>Senators made reference to the importance of public service radio and television.  We saw it at first hand with RT&Eacute;.  I commend RT&Eacute; and the local radio stations on their work in providing such service.  In our case in Cork city, they extended the talk radio programme for two hours to give people information, to allow people to phone in and communicate.<\/p><p>It is important that we all stand united in condemning the silly irresponsible actions of those who were walking the promenade, swimming and kite surfing.  They may think they are thrill seekers and attention seeking.  However, they are putting their lives and those of the first responders at risk.  We need to look at how we can prosecute or put in place some type of mitigation where these people will not in the future be able to put themselves and others at risk.  I know it might not be popular but there is no place for that type of irresponsible behaviour.  Senator Mullen used the word \"l&uacute;dram&aacute;n\"; I would use a far stronger word to describe those people, but this is a national Parliament and I will not.  However, they should be condemned outright.<\/p><p>It is about ensuring that Government got the response right.  I accept that lessons have to be learnt.  The issue of climate change is a reality; it is not going away.  I agree with what Senator Humphreys said about the Government's response and that of agencies and Departments in the area of climate change.  We need to focus minds on the effects of global warming.  This is not a once-in-50-years event; this will be an ongoing event.  I agree with Senator Humphreys that we need to see action.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of the Defence Forces.  I know he is a champion of the Defence Forces.  I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, say that the Defence Forces are ready to assist in a multiplicity of ways.  I know the Senator does not want to politicise the House by having a vote this afternoon.  In the middle of the storm Defence Forces personnel were out assisting local authorities and local communities.  For example, 25 Army and Air Corps personnel were out assisting ESB Networks and HSE staff.  Members of the Third Infantry Battalion from Kilkenny travelled across the country.  Twelve personnel and five vehicles were out assisting.

The advice from the Government was for people to remain indoors and not to travel, and, thankfully, this advice was heeded.  In regard to the businesses that were open, some of them were manned by family members.  I cannot answer for the city of Dublin but I know that the city of Cork was pretty much closed, with the exception of one or two small shops.  If there are particular issues of which the Senator is aware, I would be happy to bring them to the attention of the Government.<\/p><p>On the issue of financial cost, the Taoiseach has said that local authorities will be assisted.

Following on from the raising of the issue with me yesterday by a member of staff from the Senator's office, I raised the matter with the Minister, Deputy Murphy, who acted immediately.  I welcome the members of the deaf community who are in the Visitors Gallery for the next item on today's agenda.  It is important that the deaf community is assisted in every possible way by the organs of the State, in particular RT&Eacute;.

Senator O'Reilly highlighted the issue of the close proximity of trees to our roadways and motorways.

I am delighted to be here again and to have been able to achieve consensus on this Bill.  I commend Senator Mark Daly for his magnificent work.  I also thank and commend members of the deaf community for all of the work put into achieving this consensus.<\/p> <p>It is important that I, as Minister of State, recognise the value of the work of the Seanad in respect of this issue, but also in respect of the broader issues in society.  We had a debate a number of years ago on the abolition of the Seanad.  When I was in opposition, I strongly supported the Senators in that campaign.  One of the reasons I supported them was because of work such as we are doing today.  It is very important work for Irish society and, in this context, it is great work for the deaf community.<\/p> <p>Senator Mark Daly has tabled a small number of amendments which do not reflect the Government amendments.  I hope that during the debate we will be able to reach agreement on these.  I have an open mind on these issues and I want to listen to what the Senator and others have to say.  I will be very open to accepting the consensus opinion of the House on each of these points.<\/p> <p>I have difficulty in principle with amendment No. 9.  If Senator Mark Daly is happy to accept my amendments instead, amendments Nos. 10 and 11, I will be able to reciprocate on the other issues on which we have slightly different approaches.  The amendments we are now discussing are all technical.  They include an amendment of the Title of the Bill to reflect other amendments which we will discuss this afternoon, and the deletion of definitions of words or phrases which will no longer form part of this Bill and are therefore unnecessary.  The rule, which is a sensible one, is that definitions must relate to words and phrases which are used in the Act and which must be defined for clarity.  <\/p> <p>Other amendments include a regulation-making power which relates to the definition of a public body in section 2, so that regulations can be made to include new public bodies, if necessary and if desired, in respect of section 2(h), which allows for additional public bodies to be prescribed; and a correction of the text of that section by deleting the words \"following consultation with the Commission\".  These words were included in error and are taken from the equivalent definition in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.<\/p> <p>I commend amendment No. 1 to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#EE00800","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#EE00900","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>By way of clarification, as the names of Senators Daly and Clifford-Lee were attached to this amendment before it was recommitted, I will be giving priority to those who originally moved the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017101700002#EE01000","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247000,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach.
