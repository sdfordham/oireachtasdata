This action plan will inform the direction of the development of the childminding sector and various supports, including whether or not ECCE is suitable long-term for childminders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300071#WRC05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Childcare Subvention Programme","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300071#WRC05700"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[25641\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300071#WRC05800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to increase substantially the maximum level of grant aid in respect of the provision of new childcare facilities in cases in which there is an identified need for additional places and in which the maximum level of grant aid under the present scheme would be inadequate to support a community childcare organisation to provide accommodation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":67,"content":"<p>Community childcare services has always been a key priority of my Department's capital programmes.

However there can be little doubt that homelessness is an extremely distressing experience, and that\u00a0 any\u00a0 medium\u00a0 to\u00a0 long-term\u00a0 period\u00a0 living\u00a0 in\u00a0 a\u00a0 hotel\u00a0 or other emergency accommodation seriously impacts on normal family life and is particularly detrimental to children. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be familiar with many of the initiatives undertaken by my Department and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to support children and families experiencing homelessness.  They include the introduction of free childcare for the children of families experiencing homelessness.  As part of the scheme a daily meal is provided for each child, the cost of which is included in the subvention rate.  The scheme is also designed to help those transitioning from homelessness to permanent accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla works together with other statutory and voluntary agencies to provide services and supports to children, young people and families experiencing homelessness.  Actions taken by Tusla include the provision of funding for child support workers and the appointment of a Homelessness Liaison Officer.<\/p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres, part funded by Tusla, are working with people who are experiencing homelessness and many have developed local responses to the needs of families in emergency accommodation.  These include, by way of example, family fun days, homework support, after school programmes, play therapy and transport services. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties associated with homelessness and school attendance, Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service offers a number of supports to children (and families) experiencing homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s joint protocol with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) covers child welfare and protection matters for children in emergency accommodation.  It is fully operational in the DRHE areas and it is intended to replicate this protocol across the State. A Joint Working Protocol has been signed between Tusla and Galway City Council. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that Tusla only intervenes in family life in exceptional circumstances.  Children who are with their families in emergency accommodation remain in the care of their parents or guardians.  Where Tusla has concerns regarding the welfare and development of any child they will provide family supports to assist that family and child.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, my concern is that we minimise and then eliminate the problem of homelessness.  In the meantime, I will continue to support measures to help those affected, to the greatest degree possible within my area of responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300071#WRC06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":76,"content":"<p>Question No. 53 answered with Question No. 28.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300071#WRC06900"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[25609\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300071#WRC07000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the average length of time of a care order placing children in care; and her views on whether care orders can be too long in duration.","asker":"1276","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>Under the Child Care Act 1991, where it appears to Tusla that a child is in need of care or protection that they may not otherwise receive, Tusla may apply to the Courts for a care order.

Another example is, sadly, where a child comes into care because they have been orphaned.<\/p><p>One of the key principles of best practice in child protection and welfare is that children should only be received into care as a last resort, where other means of protecting them have been exhausted.  The child's written care plan would address the possibility of reunification with their family, where appropriate. The priority in all cases should be the best interests of the child, and consideration of the child's express wishes where it is possible to do so.<\/p><p>It is important to recall that the Courts can review a care orders at any point, and can then make a determination made as to whether the continuation of the order is in the child's best interests.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>A court decision is not required in order for a child to be reunited with family, if it is deemed to be appropriate. In some circumstances, a decision may be made by social workers that in their professional opinion, it is in the best interests of the child to remain in the care of Tusla in line with the Court's decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300071#WRC07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Completion Programme","counter":80,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300071#WRC07200"},{"type":"question","counter":81,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[25649\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300071#WRC07300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the status of progress in implementing the findings of the ESRI report on the school completion programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":82,"content":"<p>I am very conscious that the School Completion Programme delivers a valuable service for some of our most vulnerable young people.

Underpinned by the current shared EU regulatory framework, cross-border trade at present represents the first export market for 73% of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s small and medium-sized companies.  More than 7,000 businesses trade from Northern Ireland across the island of Ireland, supporting over 165,000 jobs.Recent research has also shown a high degree of integration of the economies North and South, including in supply chains and trade in intermediary products.  Northern Ireland accounts for between ten and twelve percent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and seven to eight percent of imports.  Given that the population of Northern Ireland is less than three percent of the UK total, this shows the closeness of the economic ties between both parts of the island.<\/p>  <p>  This underlines the importance of securing an outcome in the Brexit negotiations that maintains an invisible border on the island of Ireland.  This objective goes beyond trade and is to protect the Good Friday agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process.

After its publication last week, Michel Barnier while also welcoming this step, raised questions and concerns about the proposal.  The absence of anything on regulatory alignment is clearly a major gap &ndash; though the UK has acknowledged that this aspect needs to be negotiated &ndash; as is the suggestion that the arrangement should be time-limited, though it is welcome that the date of end-2021 is aspirational.  The Commission, in its further analysis of the paper, has identified numerous issues related to the proposal&rsquo;s legal and technical viability, and to its compatibility with the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union. It is the Commission which is the Union&rsquo;s negotiator with the British Government on these  issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s focus remains on the outcome we need to see, of which a key element is ensuring the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. It is welcome that the UK&rsquo;s commitment to this is reaffirmed in its proposal , and that the commitments and guarantees provided by the UK in the joint progress report of December 2017 and repeated by Prime Minister May in her letter to President Tusk in March have been reiterated.<\/p>  <p>  While our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues, it remains essential that a backstop is agreed which provides certainty that in any circumstances, and no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the EU-UK future relationship, a hard border will be avoided.

Member States must introduce the ATAD exit tax, or bring existing exit taxes into alignment with the ATAD exit tax where relevant, no later than 1 January 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of the ATAD exit tax is to impose a charge to tax when a company migrates out of a State while holding assets, or makes certain transfers of assets out of a State, in circumstances where those assets have increased in value and therefore hold an unrealised capital gain.<\/p>  <p>  The potential yields of an exit tax from 2010 to date at the Deputy&rsquo;s proposed rates ranging from 1% to 5% cannot be determined with certainty as such a calculation would require information on the unrealised gains, if any, latent within the value of assets transferred.  Similarly, any potential future exit tax yield from assets on-shored in recent years would depend on the increase in value of these assets, if any, before any future transfer offshore.<\/p>  <p>  However I would note that in many cases, intangible assets such as licence rights and patents in the pharmaceutical and high-tech sectors have a finite life-span and depreciate over their useful lives &ndash; for example over the period for which a drug is protected by a patent or the period until an IT sector IP asset is superseded by technological advancements.

The report analyses globalisation&rsquo;s effect on growth across a total of 42 countries.   The report found that Ireland is the most globalised economy out of the 42 studied and is highly integrated especially in global capital markets.  The average annual per capita income gain from 1990 onwards was &euro;1,261 placing Ireland 4th of the countries studied.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is an open, highly developed and well-connected economy that is dependent on international trade and investment for sustainable growth.  I am well aware of the shifting and evolving global challenges which may affect us in the future.  No open economy like ours can be fully shielded against global impacts.  However, I am confident that we have the right policies to build resilience where possible and firmly strengthen our competitiveness and innovative capacity, thus ensuring the economy is properly positioned to meet any external challenges.  <\/p>  <p>  From a Trade policy perspective, the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo;, supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification.  This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.  We aim by 2020 to increase indigenous exports by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, including food, to reach &euro;26 billion, achieve 80% of indigenous export growth outside of the UK market and secure 900 new foreign direct investments.<\/p>  <p>  On the 12th of March, Enterprise Ireland announced that it is set to undertake over 200 international and domestic trade events in 2018 to accelerate the number of Enterprise Ireland clients diversifying into new markets, beyond the UK and into the Eurozone and global markets.  The number of trade events being undertaken represents a 50% increase on 2017, 70 of these export focused trade events will be led by Government Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our Enterprise Agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our all trading sectors.  The EU suite of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with third countries help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish based firms.  Brexit has reinforced the importance of accelerating the delivery of EU trade deals with leading economies and regional blocs.<\/p>  <p>  Most recently, the EU&ndash;Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) entered into force provisionally from the 21st September 2017.  This means that Irish companies may now take advantage of the all important provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access.<\/p>  <p>  The EU and Japan reached political agreement last year on an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) and the EU and Mexico reached political agreement earlier this year on the modernisation of the EU-Mexico Global Agreement.  The EU negotiations with the Mercosur countries continue.  Last month, EU Trade Ministers approved negotiating directives for free trade agreements with Australia and with New Zealand with the first formal negotiation rounds envisaged to take place in July 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements giving Irish based firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries, including SMEs.  To this end, my Department has commissioned a major examination of the economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland arising from EU Free Trade Agreements which will be available later this year.<\/p>  <p>  This week, the Taoiseach launched 'Global Ireland &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025' which represents the most ambitious renewal and expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s international presence ever undertaken, seeking to double the scope and impact of Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint in the period to 2025.

It is also one of the most effective ways a parent can protect the health of their child.<\/p>  <p>  Worldwide cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women and HPV immunisation is an important part of our childhood immunisation programmes which protects women from developing cancer later in their lives. Ninety nine percent of cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection of certain high risk types of the Human Papillomavirus, which is acquired during sexual contact. <\/p>  <p>  HPV is the most common infection transmitted by intimate or sexual contact in the world. Approximately 50 to 80% of people who are sexually active contract some form of HPV at least once in their lifetime.  There are over 100 types of HPV.  Around 40 types of HPV can infect the genital tract.  Some of these are low-risk types which cause genital warts, while others are high-risk types that are associated with the development of various cancers such as cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, penis and throat.  <\/p>  <p>  Cervical cancer impacts the lives of a large number of women in Ireland every year. It is the second most common cause of death due to cancer in women aged 25 to 39 years. In 2018 more than 90 Irish women will die from cervical cancer.  A further 280 women will need intensive treatment, such as surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, to help them overcome invasive cervical cancer. Unfortunately, 4 in 10 of these women will die within 5 years. A further 6,500 women will need hospital treatment to remove precancerous changes in the cervix.<\/p>  <p>  We are all aware of the old saying that prevention is better than cure, and this is especially true of cervical cancer. In September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools. In 2011 a catch up programme commenced for all girls in second level school and was completed in 2014.  Uptake rates for the HPV vaccine peaked at 87% in 2014\/15 and have fallen since then.<\/p>  <p>  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland - Gardasil and Cervarix.  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the Schools Immunisation Programme. It provides protection against two high-risk HPV types that cause 70% of cervical cancers and pre-cancers, and two HPV types that cause 90% of genital warts. It has been licensed worldwide since 2006 and is used in over 25 European countries, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of HPV immunisation has had a significant impact in many parts of the world.  Countries with high vaccine uptake rates have seen the highest impact: In Scotland where 90% of girls have been vaccinated since 2008 there has been a 90% fall in HPV infections in vaccinated girls. Precancerous growths of the cervix have been reduced by more than 50% in countries such as Australia, Sweden and Scotland.  Finland recently published the evidence that HPV immunisation protects against invasive HPV-associated cancer.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most important things we can do is to provide accurate and credible information to enable parents to make a fully informed decision concerning HPV vaccination. The HSE National Immunisation Office has developed a comprehensive range of materials for parents, schools and medical practitioners as part of the immunisation programme. The HPV website has been endorsed by the WHO. The HPV Vaccine Information Campaign helps parents access trusted sources of information.  This campaign will be supported through social and digital media activity and local and national radio advertisements.<\/p>  <p>  The initial evidence suggests that this campaign is having a positive effect. Provisional figures show uptake rates have increased by 11% this year to 62%.  While this increase is very welcome, we must continue to work to get back to we were before.  As recently as the 2014\/15 academic year the uptake rate for HPV was 87%.  <\/p>  <p>  This Government fully supports the HPV immunisation programme and recognises its benefits. We must continue to focus on increasing uptake rates as the best way of reducing cervical cancer, and I would encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300074#WRF04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists Data","counter":282,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300074#WRF04700"},{"type":"question","counter":283,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[25814\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300074#WRF04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the average waiting times for cataract surgery in County Limerick; the challenges adding to the waiting time; the solutions being put forward; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":284,"content":"<p>Reducing waiting time for patients for hospital operations and procedures is a key priority for the Government. <\/p>  <p>  The recently launched Inpatient\/Day Case Action Plan outlines the combined impact of HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) activity in 2018.

To support this, the Department of Health is currently engaged in the development of a new stand-alone statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-care. This will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to service-allocation. It will therefore be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner and will help to improve access to home-care services on an affordable and sustainable basis. The introduction of a system of regulation for home-care will help to ensure public confidence in the services provided. <\/p>  <p>  The development of a new home care scheme is a complex undertaking which will involve significant legislative, operational and financial resources. A significant amount of detailed work remains to be undertaken before final decisions are taken on the form of a home care scheme and the regulation of these services.  Work in relation to the cost of the new statutory scheme is ongoing as part of this process.  <\/p>  <p>  However, on the basis of current demand and demographic projections, it is likely that increased investment will be required to support the implementation of the new statutory scheme. The HSE home-care services budget for 2018 is &euro;408 million, which it is anticipated will support the delivery of 17.094m hours of home support to 50,500 people. It is expected that there will be a significant increase in demand for home-care over the coming years. Furthermore home-care service-users have increasingly complex care-needs and there are sustained cost-pressures within the sector which are likely to inflate in the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the request for an estimated cost I have asked the HSE to correspond directly with the Deputy to advise on the cost of servicing the current wait list for Home Help and Home Care Packages under the rules of the current scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300074#WRF05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Positive Ageing Strategy","counter":291,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300074#WRF05600"},{"type":"question","counter":292,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[25825\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300074#WRF05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the implementation of the national positive ageing strategy; the parts of this strategy that have been implemented; the parts which remain to be implemented; and the cost of implementing the remaining parts.","asker":"1269","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":293,"content":"<p>The National Positive Ageing Strategy (NPAS) published in 2013 provides a framework for cooperation to address age-related policy and service delivery across Government and society in the years ahead. The strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural, and family life in their own communities for as long as possible. The strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic, and environmental factors that affect the health and wellbeing of our ageing citizens.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the objectives included in this Strategy are quite broad and can be viewed as a set of principles to which Government has committed, and which will inform policies that affect older people on an indefinite basis into the future, rather than concrete objectives that can be delivered in the short term.<\/p>  <p>  New arrangements to implement and monitor implementation of NPAS were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform in 2016. The revised approach recommits to the core principles of the strategy, establishes a mechanism to give stakeholder groups effective and ongoing access to bodies and agencies relevant to older people through an annual forum for stakeholders, and monitors the effect of the implementation process through the publication on a regular basis of a Positive Ageing National Indicators Report. <\/p>  <p>  The inaugural stakeholder forum took place in 2017. Stakeholders were asked to identify key priorities to propose to Government to consider for its focus in the coming year. Through this forum, clear channels of communication between the stakeholder representative group and relevant Government Departments to discuss these priorities have been facilitated by the Department of Health. Based on the success of and interest in the forum, plans are currently advancing to hold another stakeholder forum in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy comprises four national goals, developed to address key aspects of older people&rsquo;s lives. The four goals, and examples of progress to date thereunder, follow.<\/p>  <p>  National Goal 1:<\/p>  <p>  - Remove barriers to participation and provide more opportunities for the continued involvement of people as they age in all aspects of cultural, economic, and social life in their communities according to their needs, preferences, and capacities.<\/p>  <p>  A key objective under this goal is to promote the concept of active citizenship and to encourage people of all ages to become more involved in their communities. Age Friendly, an organisation whose remit it is to help to create an inclusive, equitable society in which older people can live full, active, valued, and healthy lives under the guidance of the National Positive Ageing Strategy, have been very successful to date in this area. Age Friendly is a World Health Organisation inspired movement which embraces the challenges and opportunities of an ageing population. In Ireland each of the 31 local authorities have signed up to the Age Friendly Programme. Older People&rsquo;s Councils have been set up and are running throughout Ireland as part of this programme, as well, ensuring a voice for older people in local government and community concerns. Implementation on this front does not rest with Age Friendly alone; there are many NGOs engaged in making Ireland a better country in which to grow old and they do so with the objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy informing their work.<\/p>  <p>  National Goal 2:<\/p>  <p>  - Support people as they age to maintain, improve, or manage their physical and mental health and wellbeing.<\/p>  <p>  The National Positive Ageing Strategy is strongly embedded within the vision and actions set out for Healthy Ireland, the Government-led initiative which aims to create an Irish society where people of all ages can enjoy good physical and mental health, and where wellbeing is supported at every level of society. The Healthy Ireland Framework was launched in 2013 and seeks to provide people and communities with accurate information on how to improve their health and wellbeing and to make the healthy choices easier choices. Healthy Ireland takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and wellbeing and the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and a number of new structures have been put in place to ensure that all sectors of society are given opportunities to participate.<\/p>  <p>  Commitments within Government that further the strategy in relation to health and wellbeing include the development of a statutory scheme for homecare, which will aim to improve access to the homecare services that people need in an affordable and sustainable way, thus enabling people to continue to live in their own homes for as long as possible.<\/p>  <p>  National Goal 3:<\/p>  <p>  - Enable people to age with confidence, security, and dignity in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Across communities many initiatives, strategies, and schemes are in place that firmly support this goal. One such is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Older People Strategy, which aims to ensure the policing needs of older people in Ireland are met to the highest standards. This supports the objective of empowering people to live free from fear in their homes and communities, as they age. With regards to facilitating older people to live in homes which are suitable to their physical and social needs, the Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government and the Department of Health are consulting, through a Joint Committee on Housing and Health, on a framework for supported housing, to facilitate people to age well and healthily in place.<\/p>  <p>  National Goal 4:<\/p>  <p>  - Support and use research about people as they age to better inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the strategy implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative (HaPAI) has been established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies to measure the impact of the strategy and establish an on-going system for measuring and reporting on Positive Ageing. The Initiative monitors changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the goals and objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy. This is done primarily through the development of Positive Ageing indicators which are published every two years. The initiative is intended to provide evidence of the factors contributing to positive ageing, including at local level and ultimately inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland. The first Positive Ageing National Indicators Report was published in November 2016 and highlights many of the positive and negative aspects of growing old in Ireland. The second Positive Ageing National Indicators report is due to be published later this year.<\/p>  <p>  With regards to the cost of implementing the strategy, the HSE provide funding to many organisations that work with older people and further the objectives of the strategy. This funding is ongoing by its nature, as the strategy and the goals therein are intended as direction for future engagement for the continued promotion of older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300074#WRF05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Autism Support Services","counter":294,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300074#WRF05900"},{"type":"question","counter":295,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[25831\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300074#WRF06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an application by a person (details supplied) for an autism assistance dog will be investigated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":296,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.<\/p>  <p>  In light of\u00a0its significant health benefits, I decided to extend the ban to the entire territory of the State.\u00a0 This process necessarily involves discussion and consultation with a wide number of stakeholders, including with the European Commission, relevant Government Departments and Agencies and the residential fuel industry.

This will bring the total current youth funding available to my Department to &euro;58.9m.  The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people.<\/p>  <p>  My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff working in youth services and communities throughout the country. <\/p>  <p>  These schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, under which funding is made available on an annual basis to thirty national and major regional youth organisations.  The continued funding of voluntary youth organisations through the scheme is intended to ensure the emergence, promotion, growth and development of youth organisations with distinctive philosophies and programmes aimed at the social education of young people.<\/p>  <p>  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  <\/p>  <p>  The Local Youth Club Grant Scheme supports youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through the local Education and Training Boards. Each year, in the region of 1700 local youth clubs are eligible to apply under the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware my Department is managing the most significant reform of youth services ever undertaken.  This will provide an opportunity to identify need and to focus funding on young people most in need of intervention.<\/p>  <p>  Last year each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards (ETB), was invited to nominate locations within their catchment areas for the establishment of new services and to nominate a project or service to be considered for augmentation. In total twenty-eight applications for new services were received.  Subsequently I approved the establishment of ten new targeted youth services across the country and the expansion of a further seven to respond to new demand from increased population and needs of young people.  Funding was also allocated for the establishment of 5 new sample projects in 2016. These projects provide youth services in areas of need as identified by the Education and Training Boards with responsibility for those regions.<\/p>  <p>  Future development and investment in youth services will be informed by the mapping exercise completed last year which mapped youth service provision across the State.

They are only subject to the age-related reduced rate of &euro;152.80 per week when they reach 25 years of age.  My Department does not have statistics available on the number of young people who, having left the care of the State are subject to the lower rate of &euro;152.80 when they reach 25 years of age.  <\/p>  <p>  People who leave the care of the State and who inform my Department are dealt with on a case by case basis to ensure that they receive the rate of payment appropriate to their circumstances. My Department actively engages with Tusla and non-Government organisations in providing the necessary support to vulnerable young people leaving care who are experiencing homelessness or are in insecure situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300077#WRJ06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service","counter":528,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300077#WRJ06900"},{"type":"question","counter":529,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[25883\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300077#WRJ07000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of the future funding of the dedicated mortgage arrears service run by MABS when the current round of funding expires at the end of 2018; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":530,"content":"<p>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, provides assistance to people, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments, who are over-indebted and need help and advice with debt problems.

This is distinct from the interim TCA model being made available as an option for those affected by the 2012 rate band changes.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Deputy&rsquo;s question may be based on an inaccurate report in a national newspaper last month.  There is no basis to state that all workers retiring from 2020 will only get a full State pension if they made PRSI contributions for 40 years.  The criteria required for a full pension under that new approach have not yet been determined, and are currently subject to a public consultation which I launched on 28th May.  Issues such as the number of years required for a full pension, transitional arrangements and treatment of the self-employed are addressed in the consultation questions, and in the accompanying documentation.  <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, I outlined at the launch that these final details will not be decided upon until I have considered the submissions received in this process, a point which was re-emphasised by two of my officials, in their presentations to stakeholders and press who were present. It was explicitly stressed in those presentations that, whatever the final model, it would have to accommodate those who were self-employed before 1988.<\/p>  <p>  It might be noted that if such matters had already been decided upon, there would be little point in conducting a public consultation on the design of the final system.<\/p>  <p>  This public consultation is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and I would encourage all interested stakeholders to contribute to the survey there.  The materials included as part of the consultation examine issues such as the extension of compulsory PRSI for self-employed in 1988, and seeks the views of stakeholders on how best to ensure they are not disadvantaged as a result of this reform.<\/p>  <p>  The position regarding part-time workers is complicated.  As in most countries, there are thresholds below which employees and self-employed persons are not compulsorily covered for pensions under the PRSI system.  Generally, the people below these thresholds receive lower pay than can be received while on Jobseekers benefit, and so they will often be either in receipt of a jobseekers payment (and credited contributions) in respect of the days they do not work, or they will be people who would not qualify for a jobseekers payment.<\/p>  <p>  In April 1990, the threshold for employees changed from being based on time worked (i.e. less than 18 hours in a week) to a monetary amount.  Some were affected by this change at that time but many others were not.  However, over time this monetary amount has been very significantly eroded by inflation, and is now only &euro;38 in a given week.  <\/p>  <p>  It is not the case that this reform disadvantages part-time workers.  Most of those who fell below the PRSI threshold in the past (and who do not have credited contributions for those periods), whether in the 1990s or today, generally have significant gaps which result in reduced entitlements under the current Yearly Average system.  In most cases, such workers facing a reduced pension under the current system are expected to fare significantly better under the TCA approach.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300078#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","counter":536,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300078#WRK00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Finances","counter":535,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300078#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":536,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[25816\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061300078#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the level of debt at 31 December 2017 owed by each local authority by lender in each of the years 2010 to 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":537,"content":"<p>It is a matter for each local authority to manage its own finances in a prudent and sustainable manner.\u00a0In accordance with\u00a0the Local Government Act 2001, a decision to borrow money is a reserved function of the elected members of a local authority.
