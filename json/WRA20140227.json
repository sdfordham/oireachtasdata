This re-organisation of the protection application processing framework should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more &lsquo;straight forward&rsquo; and timely fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700052#WRA02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700052#WRA02450"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[9716\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700052#WRA02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will carry out an investigation into strong evidence that News International's Dublin offices were used as a hacking and phone blagging centre in the late 1990s and early 2000s.","asker":"1032","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate I have no role in the investigation of criminal offences, which is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The new measures provided for, combined with the requirement that judges must take a person&rsquo;s financial circumstances into account when setting a fine, should result in a reduction in the number of people committed to prison.<\/p><p>  When this Bill is enacted, it will be easier for people to pay a fine and where they fail to do so, there will be sufficient alternatives available to the courts to all but eliminate the need to commit anyone to prison for the non-payment of fines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700053#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":74,"content":"<p>Question No. 31 answered with Question No. 26.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission Issues","counter":75,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700053#WRB00600"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[9675\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700053#WRB00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on whether GSOC has been undermined, or strengthened, by the recent surveillance controversy; the action he proposes to take; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1015","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was established under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to provide independent oversight of complaints made against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

As the Deputy will be aware the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is a statutory independent body established under the Refugee Act, 1996 to decide appeals against negative recommendations in respect of applications for refugee status issued by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality in relation to whether or not refugee status should be granted. As the appeal in this case has been remitted for re-hearing by the Tribunal, the Tribunal has yet to make its recommendation in the case to me. In the circumstances, clearly any comment by me would be inappropriate.<\/p><p>  The management of the Tribunal is the responsibility of the Chairperson who under the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) is required &ldquo;<i>to ensure that the business of the Tribunal is managed efficiently and that the business assigned to each division is disposed of as expeditiously as may be consistent with fairness and natural justice<\/i>  &rdquo;.  The Deputy may be aware that in August, 2013 a new Chairperson of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal was appointed following a selection process run in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service. Since taking up his position, I understand that the Chairperson has begun a major review of Tribunal practices, procedures and guidelines.  In September, 2013 the Assigning Policy of the Tribunal was published, which details how cases are assigned amongst the various members of the Tribunal. The new Chairperson has also established a Tribunal Users Group which comprises of the Chairperson and representatives nominated by the Law Society and the Bar Council. I am informed that the group will meet on a regular basis to discuss matters of interest and\/or concern to users of the Tribunal.  I am advised that the Group has considered draft procedural guidelines which will set out the practice and procedure relating to how appeals are dealt with by the Tribunal. Other guidelines are also in preparation, including a comprehensive guideline for dealing with child applicants.<\/p><p>  Following on from the appointment of new Tribunal members and the expansion of the Tribunal's remit to the area of subsidiary protection under the  European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013, which I signed into law in November 2013, a comprehensive training programme has been undertaken by the Tribunal, to ensure that the new members are fully equipped to discharge their duties to the highest professional standards.<\/p><p>  I am informed that as part of this training programme, the Tribunal has been working closely with the UNHCR in developing a new decision template designed to enhance the robustness of the process and to assist Members in their difficult task. This process has been greatly enhanced by the participation, via the UNHCR, of an internationally recognised former Canadian refugee law judge who has been central to the training provided.  The Chairperson in his recently published strategy statement for 2014 - 2017 commits the Tribunal &ldquo;to consider and decide refugee, subsidiary protection and Dublin Regulation appeals to the highest professional standards.&rdquo; He has also committed to an ambitious reform programme to achieve the Tribunal&rsquo;s strategic goals and to undertaking a review of Tribunal policy on public access to Tribunal documents, including the Tribunal&rsquo;s database of previous decisions.  I am confident that the changes which I have outlined will have a major impact on the performance and perception of the Tribunal as they are integrated into its ethos and practices in the coming year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700054#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":110,"content":"<p>Question No. 45 answered with Question No. 42.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":112,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700054#WRC00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700054#WRC00450"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[10068\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700054#WRC00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide an update on the contact he has had with the Egyptian authorities regarding the release of an Irish citizen (details supplied) as a matter of urgency.","asker":"1015","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[10198\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700054#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the assistance his Department is providing to a person (details supplied) detained in Egypt; if his Department is working towards ensuring this person is released; and if he has personally raised the issue with the Egyptian authorities.","asker":"1037","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":114,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 51 together.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware this Irish citizen has been detained for over six months.

This would give rise to significant costs and place an administrative burden on oil traders, users and the Revenue Commissioners. It would also pose significant cash-flow costs for those currently using marked gas oil.\u00a0 In addition, repayment schemes by their nature are very vulnerable to abuse. The introduction of a wide-ranging scheme such as that proposed would not necessarily offer greater security against fraud than the current arrangements. If fuel for off-road use was not marked under the proposed new system, it could be diverted easily for road use; if it was marked, it could be laundered as at present.\u00a0 It would also be the case that marked fuel from Northern Ireland would continue to be available and could be laundered by fuel criminals.\u00a0 For these reasons, I am not proposing the cessation of current marking system or the introduction of a wide-ranging rebate system such as that proposed. <\/p><p>  While it is inherently difficult to estimate the extent of any illegal activity and there is no reliable estimate of the scale of illegal activity in the fuel sector, Revenue recognises that the laundering of the marker from marked gas oil represents a significant threat to the exchequer and to the legitimate trade. For this reason, Revenue has made action against this illegal activity one of its priorities and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem. Revenue's strategy includes the following elements:  \u00a0<\/p><p>  -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of the fuel criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market;<\/p><p>  -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, which is designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering;<\/p><p>  -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New requirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure data are available to assist in supply chain analysis;<\/p><p>  -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Following a significant investment in the required IT systems, new supply chain controls were introduced from January 2013. These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions. Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary;<\/p><p>  -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations; and<\/p><p>  -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 following a joint process, Revenue and HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs in the UK have identified a new product to mark rebated fuels in a move that will boost the fight against illegal fuel laundering in both jurisdictions.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Revenue also works with fuel sector representative bodies, which have been very supportive of the range of measures introduced to combat fuel laundering, to improve the integrity of the distribution system and minimise the risk of fraud. In support of this, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty evaded. This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying fuel recklessly to dubious customers.\u00a0 Revenue has recently published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group and has established regional sub-groups to facilitate traders reporting suspicious matters through their representative associations on a confidential basis.\u00a0 This information can assist Revenue in closing down the illicit trade by identifying traders supplying fuel to launderers and by identifying outlets that are selling laundered diesel.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Revenue's enforcement strategy in the fuel sector has already yielded significant results.\u00a0 In the period from mid-2011 to end January 2014, 123 filling stations were closed for breaches of licensing conditions.\u00a0 Since the beginning of 2011, over 2.7 million litres of fuel have been seized and 29 oil laundries detected and closed down, including 9 oil laundries in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700055#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tobacco Smuggling","counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700055#WRD00550"},{"type":"question","counter":148,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[10055\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700055#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will invest in more scanners to detect the illegal importation of tobacco products at our ports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[10277\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700055#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the plans that Customs and Excise authorities might have to purchase new X-ray machines for ports and airports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Not all Revenue interventions take the form of formal audits or investigations and in accordance with their risk-based approach cases are selected for intervention based on the presence of various risk indicators. Each Revenue intervention is intended to be in the form which is most efficient in terms of time and resources, and which imposes the least cost on the taxpayer, whilst addressing the perceived risk and consequently Revenue carries out Risk Management Interventions, which take the form of Aspect Queries and Profile Interviews.<\/p><p>  Revenue's objective in case working is to ensure that each case (taxpayer or business) is fully compliant with their legal obligations in relation to the keeping of proper books and records, the timely and accurate submission of required declarations and the prompt payment of tax and duty liabilities.\u00a0 This approach ensures that, as far as possible, the self-assessment system operates effectively and minimises instances of fraud or mistake.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The selection of cases in which to intervene is a critical step in Revenue's compliance programme and case selection derives from a variety of sources.\u00a0 In addition to specific projects like the shadow economy project, Revenue also uses extensive third party data, good citizens' reports and other intelligence to drive its compliance interventions.\u00a0 In the past two years, Revenue has also been using advanced analytics to help it identify indicators of fraud or error from taxpayer's filings and they are regarded as a leading tax administration in the deployment of these technologies. <\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the results from all the various projects undertaken by Revenue are reflected in the general audit and compliance results from audits, assurance checks, and other risk management interventions which are published in Revenue's Annual Report.\u00a0 The high level of success in securing settlements is a reflection of the targeted approach used by Revenue which is to focus its compliance resources on the areas of greatest risk. An associated strategy is to minimise the number of contacts with compliant taxpayers.  I am confident that the Revenue Commissioners have a very clear focus to target and confront those who do not comply, as set out in their Statement of Strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700055#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Social Charge Application","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700055#WRD01650"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[10157\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700055#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding the universal social charge for 2013 in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":165,"content":"<p> I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not have the details necessary to determine the position regarding the universal charge for 2013.

On 24 September 2012,\u00a0I made the necessary commencement order to give effect to this recommendation.<\/p><p>  Following consultation by the Central Bank with credit unions,\u00a0a Fitness and Probity regime for credit unions has been introduced, which requires that credit unions ensure that individuals who take up key board and management positions are fit and proper. The Fitness and Probity regime for credit unions prescribes two Pre-Approval Controlled Functions (PCFs) in credit unions: the office of chair of the board of the credit union and the office of manager of the credit union. The prior approval of the Central Bank is required before an individual can be appointed to a PCF role. The individual must complete an online Individual Questionnaire which is endorsed by the proposing credit union and then submitted electronically to the Central Bank for assessment.<\/p><p>  Individual Questionnaires are assessed within the Central Bank with input from the relevant credit union supervisors from the Registry of Credit Unions. Requests for further information may be issued and\/or an interview may be requested.\u00a0If the Central Bank refuses to approve a PCF application, this decision may be appealed to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.<\/p><p>  The Fitness and Probity regime for credit unions is being implemented in two phases. The first phase commenced on 1 August 2013 and introduced fitness and probity requirements for credit unions with total assets of greater than &euro;10m. The second phase will commence on 1 August 2015 when all remaining credit unions will be brought within the scope of the regime. Transitional arrangements will apply for the implementation of each phase of the regime.<\/p><p>  The Commission\u00a0on Credit unions also\u00a0highlighted the importance of volunteers to the success of the credit union movement. The Commission Report states that the difficulty in recruiting volunteers could be addressed through a planned effort by credit unions to seek-out potential candidates with the necessary levels of skill and commitment. Greater use of succession plans and volunteer development strategies are recommended.

Their work against this illegal activity includes a range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country.<\/p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.<\/p><p>  In carrying out this important work Revenue works in close cooperation with other relevant agencies, both nationally and internationally. There is extensive cooperation between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the agencies concerned in the State and in Northern Ireland work closely together, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to combat the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.\u00a0 In addition, cooperation takes place with other Revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes to tackle the illicit trade in tobacco products at international level.<\/p><p>  Considerable success has been achieved in combating the illegal trade. Details of the quantities of cigarettes and tobacco seized each year since 2010 are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>\u00a0-<\/th><th>Cigarettes<\/th><th>\u00a0-<\/th><th>\u00a0-<\/th><th>Tobacco<\/th><th>\u00a0-<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>\u00a0-<\/td><td>Seizures<\/td><td>Quantity (Million)<\/td><td>\u00a0-<\/td><td>Seizures<\/td><td>Quantity (Kgs)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>9,026<\/td><td>178.4<\/td><td>\u00a0-<\/td><td>1,171<\/td><td>3,367<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>10,581<\/td><td>109.1<\/td><td>\u00a0-<\/td><td>1,500<\/td><td>11,158<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>8108<\/td><td>95.6<\/td><td>\u00a0-<\/td><td>1,395<\/td><td>5,277<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>5,797<\/td><td>40.8<\/td><td>\u00a0-<\/td><td>1,085<\/td><td>4,453<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>  The quantity of cigarettes seized in a given year can be influenced significantly by the occurrence of a particularly large seizure or seizures, and the quantity of cigarettes seized in 2013 must be viewed against the background of a number of very large seizures in the preceding years. I understand also that Revenue participate actively in multilateral controlled deliveries of smuggled cigarettes and tobacco, resulting in the seizure of the illicit tobacco products in other jurisdictions before they reach Ireland.<\/p><p>  I am advised that the quantity of cigarettes seized has declined in most EU Member States over the last number of years, and that this reflects, in considerable part, a changed modus operandi adopted by the organised crime gangs that are responsible for a large element of the illegal trade. There has been a movement from large consignments in containers to smaller consignments in deeper concealment within groupage loads, and these can be more difficult to detect. The Revenue Commissioners and their counterparts in other EU Member States are working together to combat this form of smuggling and to ensure that the disruptive effect of seizures on the illegal trade is maximised.<\/p><p>  In relation to staff numbers I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, that they are a fully integrated tax and customs administration and that it is not possible to disaggregate resources deployed exclusively at any given time on customs work or on policing illegal cigarette smuggling. Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance. These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions imposed since 2009.\u00a0 Revenue s overall staffing levels have reduced from a total of 6,581(FTE) at the end of 2008 to its current level of 5,739 (FTE).\u00a0 Notwithstanding this reduction, Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities have been maintained at around 2,000, so that they now represent a larger proportion of Revenue s staff.\u00a0 The Revenue Commissioners have accorded a very high priority to the tackling of the illicit tobacco trade and they are committed to ensuring that, despite the staff reductions, this enforcement work will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700056#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Remuneration","counter":198,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700056#WRE01150"},{"type":"question","counter":199,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[10236\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700056#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total payroll savings that will be achieved by Bank of Ireland in 2014 and 2015 as part of the implementation of the Mercer report; the way this is broken down between pay and pensions; the number of persons who will experience a reduction in their remuneration; the total savings that will come from reductions in executive remuneration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[10237\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700056#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total payroll savings that will be achieved by AIB in 2014 and 2015 as part of the implementation of the Mercer report; the way this is broken down between pay and pensions; the number of persons who will experience a reduction in their remuneration; the total savings that will come from reductions in executive remuneration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":201,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[10238\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700056#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total payroll savings that will be achieved by Permanent TSB in 2014 and 2015 as part of the implementation of the Mercer report; the way this is broken down between pay and pensions; the number of persons who will experience a reduction in their remuneration; the total savings that will come from reductions in executive remuneration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":202,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 to 76, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  As the information requested by the Deputy is forward looking, I am not\u00a0in a position to provide this given its commercial sensitivity.\u00a0However the Deputy may be aware that both Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks are due to announce their 2013 annual results next week while permanent tsb is\u00a0scheduled\u00a0to announce its results\u00a0on 26th March.\u00a0I would expect that\u00a0each of the\u00a0banks will\u00a0give an update\u00a0on\u00a0their\u00a0progress\u00a0in delivering targeted cost\u00a0efficiencies on these dates.\u00a0<\/p><p>  In relation to the Mercer report specifically, I have stated in a\u00a0reply to an earlier\u00a0Parliamentary Question\u00a0\u00a0that based on the letters received from the banks\u00a0detailing\u00a0their\u00a0respective\u00a0strategies, and in light of the various subsequent industrial relations developments,\u00a0I was\u00a0satisfied that each of the banks would deliver remuneration cost savings of 6% to 10%.\u00a0<\/p><p>  Each bank's individual proposal can be summarised\u00a0as follows:<\/p><p>  Bank of Ireland\u00a0focused on changes to the defined benefit pension scheme that will affect all staff who are members of this scheme.

Moody's cited two reasons for the upgrade: <\/p><p>1. the growth potential of the Irish economy, which together with ongoing fiscal consolidation is expected to bring government debt ratios down; and <\/p><p>2. the Irish Government's exit from its EU\/IMF supported programme on schedule, with improved solvency and restored market access. <\/p><p>  Ireland is now at investment grade with all five credit rating agencies and this will attract investors which had hitherto been unable to buy Irish government debt due to their mandates. \u00a0As a result of the recent upgrade by Moody's, some Asian and Middle-Eastern investors, along with others in Europe including insurance companies, are likely to be in a position to consider investing in Irish Government debt in future.\u00a0 Market reaction to the Moody's announcement has been positive.<\/p><p>  The announcement by Fitch Ratings on 21 February 2014 affirming its rating has had no impact on Ireland's government bond yields and, in fact, there has been a modest rally since then. \u00a0It is clear that Ireland has rebounded from the bottom of the 'ratings cycle'. \u00a0There is a view that the credit rating agencies are catching up on the market in terms of their increasingly positive view of Ireland.<\/p><p>  On 7 January 2014 the National Treasury Management Agency issued a new 10-year bond by syndication. \u00a0The new &euro;3.75 billion benchmark bond was priced at a spread of 166 basis points over the 10-year German bund\u00a0at a yield of 3.543%. <\/p><p>  Although the order book amounted to &euro;14 billion, the NTMA decided to limit the size of the new bond to &euro;3.75 billion in order to leave capacity for bond auctions in its funding programme for 2014. \u00a0Some 400 investors participated in the transaction with the largest share of demand coming from abroad, particularly pan-European and US real money accounts. \u00a0There was notable demand from the UK (26%) and Nordic regions (15%) as well as the US (14%), with strong support from the domestic investor base (17%).\u00a0 49% of the take-up was from fund managers with banks comprising 27% and pension funds 10%.<\/p><p>  This transaction is part of the process of normalising Ireland's market access   it was necessary to demonstrate that Ireland had full market access having exited the EU\/IMF programme. \u00a0The intensive investor relations programme made it possible to bring the new 10-year bond to the market at very short notice   it had been made clear to investors that the NTMA intended issuing early in 2014.<\/p><p>  The successful execution of a scheduled series of bond auctions would complete the process of market normalisation. \u00a0The NTMA's working plan for 2014 is to raise a total of around &euro;8 billion, as prefunding for 2015, the remainder of which it is intended to be raised by way of a series of auctions, commencing on 13 March, involving the NTMA's network of Primary Dealers.<\/p><p>   In 2013, the NTMA issued &euro;2.5 billion of the existing 5-year benchmark bond by syndication at a yield of 3.32% in January and then in March sold &euro;5 billion of a new 10-year benchmark bond by syndication at a yield of 4.15%. This was the first new 10-year benchmark issuance since January 2010, prior to Ireland's entry into the EU\/IMF programme.<\/p><p>  Regular auctions of short-term Treasury Bills, which resumed in July 2012, continued throughout 2013 with eight auctions during the year. \u00a0Each auction raised &euro;500 million of 3-month money at an average annualised yield of 0.2%. \u00a0The next Treasury Bill auction is scheduled to take place on 20 March 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700056#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":215,"content":"<p>Question No. 81 answered with Question No. 58.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":217,"content":"<p>Question No. 82 answered with Question No. 65.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Mortgage Loan Book","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700057#WRF00175"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[10304\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700057#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the concerns of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, formerly Anglo Irish Bank mortgage holders over plans to dispose of these mortgages as part of the wind-up of IBRC; the implications such a sale will have for the individual mortgage customers, including for the protections they currently have under the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Mortgage Arrears Targets Programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":220,"content":"<p>I am aware of the concerns of borrowers about the sale of the mortgage book as part of the liquidation of IBRC and\u00a0in particular the concerns in relation to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.\u00a0  I have been advised by the Special Liquidators that the third party bidders who are bidding on the residential mortgage portfolios have\u00a0confirmed that they\u00a0will be directing that the mortgages are serviced in accordance with the terms of the CCMA.

The Tribunal is one of the front-line services directly affected by the current turbulence in the labour market.  The Tribunal hears claims under 18 separate pieces of legislation, some of which are lodged as direct claims to the Tribunal and others which come to the Tribunal by way of appeal or implementation of a Rights Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation\/decision.  I am informed that the waiting period for a hearing date at the Tribunal at the end of January 2014 in the region in question is 76 weeks.  This is a reduction of 5 weeks over the past year.  <\/p><p>  I understand that the Tribunal targets those areas with the longest waiting periods and highest level of claims outstanding, within the resources it has currently available. The Tribunal has been pro-active in driving efficiencies. Divisions of the Tribunal are sitting longer, hearing more cases per hearing and seeking to manage the caseload to maximise efficiency.  As part of the drive for efficiencies, the Tribunal streams cases that are envisaged to be more straight-forward. In this context the number of cases awaiting a hearing date in the region under question has been reduced in the past year by 27% and this includes new cases arising.  <\/p><p>  I understand that if the person in question believes that they have significant grounds to support an application, they may apply to a sitting Division of a Tribunal to have their case heard at an early date.  This is done by completing a form available from the EAT Secretariat, having given appropriate notice to the opposing parties and appearing before a Division of the Tribunal to set out the reasons as to why this case should be expedited and heard before other cases, which were received ahead of the case in question. It will be a matter for that Division to grant or refuse the application.  However, I would like to draw to the Deputy's attention that the policy of the Tribunal is to only grant such applications where circumstances of extreme urgency exist. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the efforts of the EAT to reduce backlogs and waiting times for hearings, I believe the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.  This is one of the reasons why I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five Workplace Relations Bodies.  My objective is to deliver a world-class workplace relations service which is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial, cost effective and provides for workable means of redress and enforcement, within a reasonable period of time.<\/p><p>  A new two-tier Workplace Relations structure will be established comprising two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five (i.e. the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court).

The person concerned has been notified of the arrangements for the hearing. <\/p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013.  <\/p><p>  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.  A major programme of process redesign and modernisation is also underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals. <\/p><p>  These measures have led to a significant improvement in appeal processing times. The average processing time for all appeals peaked in 2011 at 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.1 weeks for a summary decision.  In 2012, processing times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing was 39.5 weeks while there was a slight increase to 27.8 weeks for a summary decision.  This improvement continued in 2013 to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p><p>  In addition to improved processing times, the number of appeals finalised in the appeals office has also increased as a result of these measures from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.

Unfortunately, the ship has deteriorated substantially in the past 20 years and presents a real risk in the Grand Canal Basin, in the heart of Dublin's Docklands. In April 2013, a report on the hull condition of the vessel, commissioned by its owners, highlighted serious safety concerns. Based on the report&rsquo;s findings, the Irish Nautical Trust issued a &lsquo;<i>Notice to Vacate<\/i>  &rsquo; to both of the businesses that had been operating from the vessel.<\/p><p>  I am advised that very significant investment would be required to preserve the already unstable hull of the vessel and to bring the vessel to the point where it would be safe and insurable.

Oversight of the NEEAP is provided by the NEEAP Implementation Group, chaired by my Department. The Group evaluated the range of actions outlined by NEEAP   and the Plan is due to be updated later this year. As of end 2012, Ireland had achieved 11,419 GWh energy savings, which represents 36% of the national target to 2020.

The Directive requires that Member States set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) their trajectories towards meeting these targets and the measures to be taken to achieve these targets. Ireland's NREAP provides that 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power be produced from renewable sources. The first progress report on Ireland's NREAP was submitted in January 2012 and the second progress report, covering the years 2011 and 2012, was submitted to the European Commission earlier this month.

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  The Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigns the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake this metering programme.  The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water will be responsible for the collection of water charges from households and also provides that responsibility for the economic regulation of the water sector, including the setting of charges, be assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  The CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.<\/p><p>  As the metering programme will still be underway when charges are introduced, an appropriate approach to charging customers who are not metered at that stage will be put in place.  This will be structured in such a way as to ensure that it represents a reasonable proxy for usage and is fair.  The CER has indicated that in April 2014 it will be carrying out a number of public consultation s including the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs for both metered and unmetered properties.

Under the framework, sectoral plans will be developed by the relevant Government Department or Agency and adopted by the relevant Minister.

From an economic perspective, the Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of some 95,000 farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions.<\/p><p>  The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme was reduced from &euro;220 million to &euro;190 million and, in order to achieve the necessary saving in expenditure, specific changes to the Scheme eligibility criteria for 2012 were introduced. Making these technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria ensured that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Less Favoured Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme. <\/p><p>  There was no reduction in the maximum area payable &ndash; 34 hectares.

Despite continued slow demand from some key export markets, prices for prime steers and heifers have remained relatively stable even though the combined kill for these categories has increased by 11% to date in 2014 compared to same period in 2013. While the young bull trade is challenging at present as age and weight issues continue to adversely affect demand, the number of young bulls slaughtered at DAFM-approved plants has increased by 58% from 4,200 head in week 1 of 2014 to 6,700 head in week 7.<\/p><p>  Higher factory throughput is partly a result of cattle becoming fit for slaughter earlier than in previous years leading to a situation whereby factories are giving preference to certain types of stock that are better suited to the trade specifications demanded by their retail customers. The Irish beef industry is highly export dependent and the need to ensure that it is producing efficiently for overseas markets cannot be ignored. Finished cattle prices continue to be impacted by weak demand, particularly for manufacturing beef, in key export markets. One of the main difficulties in marketing young bulls over 16 months at age is that these animals are outside the specifications preferred by the UK market. This is a major disadvantage at present because the UK market has effectively become the highest-priced beef market in the EU.<\/p><p>  Delays in slaughtering some animals combined with a weakening of prices for those outside market specifications undoubtedly put pressure on producer margins. However, neither I nor any Agriculture Minister can interfere in a trade that is cyclical in nature and prone to short-term price fluctuations. Although I have no function in relation to commercial transactions between the meat factories and their suppliers, I met representatives of both sides in the last week to discuss the current situation. As a result of that interaction, I am hopeful that the factories, in collaboration with the farming bodies, will be able to resolve the various issues that have lately caused difficulties for some producers. At my request, Meat Industry Ireland (MII) member companies will ensure that their livestock offices are open to deal with farmers with any particular queries or concerns on the marketing of their stock.  MII member companies have  made available contact details for each their main plants to enable farmers to phone them directly.<\/p><p>  The relationship between processors and farmers is an interdependent one. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of both sides working together to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market so that the supply chain does not undermine the viability of beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers. The current situation clearly underlines the need for industry operators to improve communication on market trends and signals throughout the supply chain. An industry-led solution to the current uncertainty is essential to restoring confidence in the sector and I would encourage the various stakeholders to continue their efforts to reach a mutually acceptable outcome.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Food Harvest 2020 (FH2020) targets, the original goal to increase the output value of the beef sector by 20% was subsequently increased to 40% on the recommendation of the industry-led Beef Activation Group. The various targets under Food Harvest 2020 are monitored and reviewed on a continuous basis by the High Level Implementation Committee which I chair, and any modifications to the strategy for the development of the sector can be made as appropriate.<\/p><p>  For example earlier this month I announced the operational details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014. This package will include a &euro;23m for Beef Genomics Scheme, &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme, &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme and &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s investment is a strong vote of confidence in the suckler beef sector. It exemplifies the smart, green growth initiatives envisioned in the 2020 strategy and, coupled with additional support measures under the new Rural Development Programme, will underpin the development of a sustainable beef sector with long-term growth potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700068#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sheepmeat Sector","counter":618,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700068#WRR00800"},{"type":"question","counter":619,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[10216\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700068#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding a scheme to improve sheep breeds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":620,"content":"<p>I am well aware of the role played by the blackface mountain breed of sheep in the Irish sheep industry especially in our hill regions such as those in Co. Kerry. From a maternal point of view the characteristics of the blackface breed has made, and continues to make a significant contribution to the national breeding flock. Over many years various strains of the blackface breed have developed around Ireland in response to specific climatic and environmental conditions unique to certain regions. The Kerry Blackface mountain sheep is one such of example of this, where over many generations, through a combination of natural selection and management the strain has evolved to survive and thrive in the conditions that exist in the Kerry region. <\/p><p>  I am also aware that there are a number of threats facing the various families of Blackface that exist around the country; these include inbreeding and dilution by other sheep breeds and other strains of blackface mountain sheep. These strains have taken generations to evolve and their essential characteristics can very quickly be undone if incorrect decisions are made by farmers breeding these sheep. <\/p><p>  If the threats mentioned above are to be overcome by Blackface breeders it is essential that they begin a process of ancestry record keeping as soon as possible. Currently in Ireland there is a very well developed infrastructure funded by my Department to facilitate this process in the form of Sheep Ireland. Sheep Ireland, a sister organisation to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) provides a national sheep database in which Irish ram breeders currently record ancestry and performance data for their flocks. This data proves an invaluable resource to these breeders when making mating decisions each year especially with a view to avoiding any risk of inbreeding, while also helping them to identify genetics that will contribute positively to the performance and profitability of their flock. <\/p><p>  This national breed improvement programme being operated by Sheep Ireland is open to all interested groups of Blackface ram breeders. Detailed parentage records of lambs born are collected by all participating breeders which over time will provide a valuable database for future use.

","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":623,"content":"<p>Fishing through the winter is difficult in normal circumstances but I am acutely conscious that the severe weather has caused the fishing fleet to be tied up for quite an extended period, a longer period than would be the norm with more typical winter weather.  As the catching sector is by definition dependant on being able to go out and catch fish, and crews earn their living through a share of the catch, many fishermen have suffered financially because of this extended period restricted to port.  We have had some breaks in the weather during February and many of the vessels that were harbour bound due to the severe weather were able to return to fishing and to some extent make up for lost time.  No doubt we will continue to have intermittent stormy conditions in the weeks and months ahead, as is normal for this time of year, but I am hopeful that fishermen will be able to put to sea on a regular basis so that they can put that difficult period behind them.<\/p><p>  On 12 February 2014, I informed the House that as part of its overall co-ordinated response to the impact of the recent unprecedented weather conditions, the Government had decided to allocate an additional &euro;8.8 million for the repair of the publicly owned pier, harbour and slipway network linked to fisheries and aquaculture and to allocate up to &euro;1.5 million to assist inshore fishermen in replacing lobster and shrimp pots lost or destroyed in the storms. In light of the additional funds now available, on 18 February my Department invited applications for funding from Local Authorities in respect of repair to fishery and aquaculture related harbours, piers and slipways damaged in the recent storm events.  In relation to inshore fishermen, BIM has opened for applications a new scheme providing aid of up to &euro;2,400 for the replacement of pots lost in the storms. The Deputy will agree that these are significant interventions in the current economic circumstances and are a clear indication of this Government's commitment to assisting rural coastal communities and the inshore fishing sector with their recovery from the storms.<\/p><p>  In relation to any specific payments to compensate for lost earnings, the Minister for Social Protection has overall responsibility for funding income support to individuals and families in all sectors who have been unable to work because of adverse weather conditions.  <\/p><p>  As income from fishing is derived from landings of catch, the amount that can be caught and therefore the income from most fisheries is determined by the EU quotas which are restrictive, and made available under our management arrangements with catch limits set for whitefish each month.   The quotas are managed to allow for access to quota for the full twelve months of the year, as far as possible.  This may mean in many cases that the allocations made available for certain months are set at low levels, certainly less than Industry would like and would be capable of landing.   <\/p><p>  I always work very closely with, and I am advised by industry when setting catch limits during the year.  Each month, a quota management advisory committee, involving Industry representatives and my Department, meets and examines available quota, uptake levels and the market situation and make recommendations to me on catch limits for the following month.  The quota uptake figures for January 2014 and for the first part of February are significantly down.  In order that vessel owners and their crews are enabled to compensate as early as possible for these low catch levels, allocations for March were set for a number of the key economic stocks at a higher level than in February.   The level recommended by industry took account of concerns not to glut the market with very high landings in a single month and on that basis the arrangements recommended and put in place involve increases in key whitefish stocks including cod, haddock and whiting in the Celtic Sea, monkfish and megrim in the Celtic Sea and the hake stock in the Celtic Sea and the north west.  <\/p><p>  These increased quotas and fishing opportunities for March will help to re-balance the landings to bring them more into line with planned annual spread of quota uptake.  They can be further adjusted in April to take into account of the low level of landings in the first 6 weeks of the year.  <\/p><p>  The approach adopted by the UK is a matter for that Government and I am not in a position to comment in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700068#WRR01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farms Data","counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700068#WRR01400"},{"type":"question","counter":625,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[10239\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700068#WRR01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on carrying out an audit of the bureaucratic burden on farmers with a view to bringing forward proposals to minimise the burden; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":626,"content":"<p>Mindful of the benefits to farmers, particularly the reduction in paperwork, but also the reduction in the level of clerical errors that ultimately delay payments, my Department has concentrated on the ongoing roll-out and improvement of online services for farmers.

Other benefits of iNet include immediate acknowledgement of receipt of applications by my Department, the significant reduction in the ability to make simple clerical errors, due to the built-in system of controls and the ability to view maps and correspondence. In 2013, over 73,000 applications were submitted online, representing a ten-fold increase since iNet was launched.<\/p><p>  I would urge anyone considering availing of the on-line facility to make enquiries via the website,    or, alternatively, the dedicated Helpdesk at Lo-call 1890 252 118. There is no down-side in registering for on-line either individually, or through an agent, as farmers still retain the right to submit a traditional paper application, should they so choose. However, I am convinced that those who do sign-up will be readily impressed with the systems user-friendliness. <\/p><p>  I must also refer to the current campaign to encourage more farmers to sign-up for my Department&rsquo;s text messaging service, with a mail campaign having been launched recently. Currently some 70,000 SFP applicants are signed-up this service, which during 2013 was used to advise farmers of the SFP closing date, receipt of individual SFP applications, payments, Nitrates, etc. The benefits are very clear. There is no down-side to the service, so I would strongly urge all those not yet signed-up to do so immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700068#WRR01600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Horse Slaughtering Data","counter":627,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700068#WRR01700"},{"type":"question","counter":628,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[10286\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700068#WRR01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on setting up a scheme whereby horses with stamped out passports can be slaughtered at a registered abattoir, tested for banned substances, and, depending on the result, allow the meat either enter the food chain or be sent for destruction; if this process could be operated on a similar basis to the system used for the BSE testing of cows; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is made available on an annual basis to 31 national and major regional youth organisations.Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2,   Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2014, funding of &euro;50.530m including &euro;750,000 capital funding has been provided to my Department for these schemes. The capital funding comprises &euro;250,000 for play and recreation initiatives and &euro;500,000 for staff-led youth projects under the various schemes funded by the Youth Affairs Unit of the Department.<\/p><p>  In 2014, funding of &euro;14.4m has been allocated to the Special Projects for Youth Scheme under which grant aid is made available for out-of-school projects for disadvantaged young people and youth work initiatives for young homeless people, young people at risk of substance misuse and young travellers.<\/p><p>  The allocations for youth services and schemes, including the Special Projects for Youth Scheme are determined, in the first instance, by my Department having regard to the available budget. My Department in line with Government policy has been required to achieve significant savings on all funding schemes, including the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE). In the determination of the annual allocations for the schemes, my Department, while having regard to the CRE, has sought to ensure that the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are maintained and protected, as far as is possible, from the impact of the necessary reductions in funding. In a context of the very difficult budgetary constraints that have arisen in recent years there have been no new applications for the funding of new projects since 2008.<\/p><p>  With regard to the future development of provision for young people, my Department is undertaking a comprehensive Value for Money Review of youth funding schemes that support  services to disadvantaged young people. The findings of this review will shape the future direction of youth funding provided by my Department and will aim to ensure quality effective value-for-money services that secure best outcomes for young people. My Department is also developing a new youth strategy. The new youth strategy will take into account the changes in the demographic situation and in the profiles of young people and the evidence about what works best in the provision of youth services to meet young people's needs. It will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.<\/p><p>  The Leixlip Youth Project is one of a number of projects operated by Kildare Youth Service under the aegis of Youth Work Ireland. The project has been allocated funding of &euro;86,264 in 2014. This is a reduction of 3.75% on the allocation available to the project in 2013.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the challenges that the budgetary constraints raise for the youth services throughout the country including the Leixlip Youth Project. Officials from my Department  have met Youth Work Ireland in relation to the challenges which local projects face in meeting the needs of young people. I have met and will continue to meet with many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to ensure the most effective and efficient use of the resources available in order to continue to support the provision of quality and responsive youth services for young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700069#WRS00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Juvenile Offenders","counter":653,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700069#WRS00650"},{"type":"question","counter":654,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[10243\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700069#WRS00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"in view of the the cost of keeping juvenile offenders in custody, if she is working with the Department of Justice on additional measures over and above the Garda Youth Diversion Projects; if so, if she will outline same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Action Plan will form part of the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework (CYPPF) currently being developed in my Department and will also form part of the National Anti-Crime Strategy currently being developed by the Department of Justice and Equality.

The Tobacco Directive will set mandatory safety and quality requirements e.g. on nicotine content, ingredients and devices, as well as refill mechanisms etc., for e-cigarettes; make health warnings and information leaflets obligatory; introduce notification requirements for manufacturers and importers of e-cigarettes; impose stricter rules on advertising and monitoring of market developments.<\/p><p>  In view of the lack of sufficient research and information regarding e-cigarettes,  my Department will continue to monitor existing and emerging evidence on the potential harm and the potential benefits of e-cigarettes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700069#WRS01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":665,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700069#WRS01450"},{"type":"question","counter":666,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[10032\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700069#WRS01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the allocation of resources to healthcare by county and region and by type of spending for example human resources, infrastructure and so on ","asker":"1034","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":667,"content":"<p>The HSE published its 2014 National Service Plan, setting out the type and volume of health services it proposes to deliver during the course of this year on the 18th December last, after consideration at Government and approval by the Minister for Health.

The purpose of the report was to assess the feasibility of using the HIPE system to derive healthcare quality indicators that could be used in the future to measure the quality of the care provided in our hospitals.  The analysis and the report is about the quality of the selected indicators and data not the quality of care. <\/p><p>  This analysis of HIPE data was a process that involved ongoing discussion with the HSE. During 2011 the analysis highlighted a number of variations with a small number of hospitals being identified as outliers for certain indicators. There are a lot of possible explanations for these variations including issues relating to the coding of the principle diagnosis, coding of the healthcare records to the HIPE system, inclusion of confounding factors in the analysis of the indicators and quality of care. However, this analysis of the data does not allow for an underlying variation in the quality of care to be excluded. Therefore it was necessary for this information to be reflected back to the hospitals as only the hospitals are in a position to assess their data to determine the reasons for the variation. This information was communicated through the Quality and Patient Safety Directorate, HSE to the hospitals in mid 2011. <\/p><p>  My Department has been assured by the HSE that the hospitals have had the opportunity both to correct their data and address any quality of care issues. <\/p><p>  This report confirms the value of the HIPE system as a resource for the development of indicators of quality of care in our hospitals but it also shows that hospital data and the indicators need to be further refined before they can be used for this purpose.  Measuring the quality of our healthcare and publicly reporting how our services are performing is part of my Government&rsquo;s commitment to improved accountability and continued improvement in our health services.  It is my intention that my Department will publish a report on quality healthcare indicators at national, regional and hospital level later this year which will be based on corrected data and will identify hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700071#WRU00400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Expenditure","counter":726,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700071#WRU00450"},{"type":"question","counter":727,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[10199\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700071#WRU00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount that has been spent in the past three years on taxis bringing blood to Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":728,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700071#WRU00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Staff Provision","counter":729,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700071#WRU00650"},{"type":"question","counter":730,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[10201\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700071#WRU00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the number of nurses working in the Health Service Executive (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":731,"content":"<p>The numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets. Currently there are 34,300 nurses employed.  This number has to be considered in conjunction with the numbers of Health Care Assistants which now stands at 2,878.  In order to mitigate the impact on frontline services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  The additional working hours provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement are a pivotal element in this regard. The increase in nursing hours available under the Agreement equates to nearly 1,400 additional nurses.<\/p><p>  The Agreement also includes the Graduate Nurse\/Midwife Initiative.  This supports the retention of graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system and enables them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation.  Participants will have access to a variety of care settings while gaining clinical experience.  Up to 1,000 two-year contracts are being made available under this initiative and about half of these have been filled.  A Support Staff Intern Scheme also allows for the recruitment of a similar number of staff.  The scheme facilitates the intern achieving the appropriate FETAC level 5 qualification, which will be an invaluable asset in their professional development.  I have been advised that the HSE is processing large numbers of Intern applications at present. Once in situ these interns will provide vital support to healthcare professionals, including nurses, in the healthcare setting.<\/p><p>  Ireland possesses an exceptionally well trained nursing profession.  Indeed Ireland was to the fore in recognising the relationship between  nurse education and patient safety and was one of the first countries in the world to embrace an all graduate profession within the introduction of the under-graduate pre-registration programme in 2002.  This also has to be taken into account when considering nursing numbers.  I have embarked on a significant reform programme in the health services, including the establishment of the Hospital Groups.  This and other initiatives in train will greatly assist in the optimum use of resources including nursing staff across hospital groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700071#WRU00800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":732,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700071#WRU00850"},{"type":"question","counter":733,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[10219\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014022700071#WRU00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the application for a full medical card will be reviewed in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":734,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.
