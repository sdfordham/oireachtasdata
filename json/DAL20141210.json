He is probably aware that approximately 71,800 people currently receive rent supplement.  Of particular interest to Deputy O'Dea is the fact that there are approximately 2,500 rent supplement recipients in Limerick, of whom 860 came into the scheme in the past year.  Obviously people are able to access the rent supplement scheme, given that 34% of people in the Limerick area in receipt of the supplement joined the scheme in the past year.<\/p><p>  There is considerable experience within local community welfare offices and we have been in regular contact with them on this issue.  As recently as this week, we contacted officers on the ground with front-line experience to tell them that they have flexibility in the context of rent allowance payments.  The most important element of this is to make sure that families currently in receipt of rent supplement are able to stay in their rental properties and keep abreast of what is happening in the rental market.  The best way for that to happen is to use the local experience and knowledge of community welfare officers to meet the needs of families.  I am constantly monitoring the situation and the Department is in constant contact with community welfare officers on the ground.  It is our intention to ensure that people will be able to access homes.<\/p><p>  We must be extremely careful, however, not to give landlords a charter to increase rents.  There are many low-income families and individuals in the private rental market and there is a significant supply problem.  In that context, we must be very careful to ensure that we strike the right balance in order that people in receipt of rent supplement are able to access homes in the private rental market as well as those on low incomes.  While the majority of landlords would not do so, there are some who would take advantage of the current situation and increase rents further.  We are using local expertise and knowledge and giving flexibility to local officers to ensure that people are able to stay in the private rental market.  In the longer term, we must develop mechanisms to assist people in receipt of rent supplement back into employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000003#A00500","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1418203800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

The Deputy's question stems from a newspaper article in <i>The Mirror<\/i>on the percentages.  We do not set rent allowances on the basis of what appears in <i>The Mirror<\/i>, even though it is a reputable newspaper.  We have different caps across the State reflecting the market.  For example, there are two different caps in County Wicklow depending on how close one is to the city.  The largest differential within the question the Deputy asked was in the Wicklow area.<br\/><br\/>As I have noted to the Deputy previously, &euro;344 million was spent on rent supplement last year.  We are currently carrying out a review on the cap, which should be completed shortly.  In the meantime, I want to ensure that there is a flexibility right across the market operated by community welfare officers who will look at market conditions in particular areas.  However, I want cognisance to be taken also of the need to avoid allowing rents to inflate throughout the country on foot of any increase in the caps, as has happened before.  There are many low-income families and students within the Dublin area who could be priced out of the market if the caps were lifted.  Certainly, the caps within social welfare set the bottom of the market.  All landlords look at what the Department of Social Protection caps are and build their rents on top of that.  It is not surprising as the Department takes approximately one third of all rental units across the State and we must be careful not to create rent inflation.<br\/><br\/>That is why I am communicating regularly with the regions and community welfare officers to ensure that they take local circumstances into consideration.  In many ways, they are the very ones who are best placed to do that and to work with people on an individual basis.  Not only is there a problem in relation to rental income, but it is another element of helping people to get back into the workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000004#B00600","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1418204400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's statement that there is a problem.

In fact, the opposite is the case.  The problem is that we have a crisis, especially in Dublin and other areas where the rent cap set by the Department is out of sync with the rents being sought by landlords.  In that event, people end up in homelessness or, as they have done for years, having to make an under the counter payment.  The problem is that the gap between rent and the rent supplement cap has grown to such an extent that even those who have made a top-up payment in the past can no longer do so.<\/p><p>  My specific question is on the Department's rent supplement initiative and family protocol, which I welcomed.  I am not opposed to it.  The problem is that some of the people who availed of it in the first place are being timed out as it was a temporary initiative.  Can it be extended?

In Ballyfermot, which is my own area, and in general across Dublin, the rent for a three-bedroom house is &euro;1,300 to &euro;1,400 while the maximum rent allowable under the cap is &euro;950.

The treatment of workers involved in the fishing industry depends on whether they are regarded as an employee or self-employed or, if self-employed, are a share-fisherman-woman for social insurance purposes.  A fisherman or woman who is paid a fixed wage or salary may be regarded as an employee of the boat owner or skipper and, similar to employees in other sectors, is liable to pay PRSI contributions at class A.  Class A employees pay PRSI at 4 % and have access to the full range of social insurance benefits, including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  In addition, their employer makes a PRSI contribution of 10.75%.<br\/><br\/>Fishermen or women who are not employees may be regarded as self-employed for social insurance purposes.  Once annual income exceeds &euro;5,000, they are liable to PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, subject to the minimum payment of &euro;500.  This gives entitlement to a more limited range of long-term but valuable benefits such as the State pension, contributory, and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension, contributory, as well as maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and guardians payment, contributory.<br\/><br\/>A person who works in the fishing industry on a self-employed basis and is paid solely by the &quot;share&quot; of the value of the catch is regarded as a share-fishermen or women.  In addition to their liability to pay class S PRSI contributions, they also have the option to pay additional PRSI contributions at class P.  This contribution is over and above the PRSI paid under class S and is charged at 4% of all income over &euro;2,500, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;200.  Class P entitles the contributor to limited jobseeker's benefit up to 13 weeks in each calendar year, limited illness benefit up to 52 weeks and treatment benefit.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>In 2012, 16 individuals opted to pay class P contributions.  Class P was introduced to reflect the very unique characteristics of share-fishing whereby, following a 1986 High Court ruling, the skipper and crew are regarded to be in partnership.  A fisherman who owns his own boat is not precluded from opting to pay class P provided he or she is remunerated by way of &quot;sharing&quot; the catch with his or her crew.  Extension of additional entitlements, such as class P entitlements, to other categories of fishermen-women not engaged in share-fishing activities could only be considered in the context of extension of entitlements to other categories of self-employed, whose activities do not have the same unique characteristics which prevail in share-fishing.<br\/><br\/>Self-employed workers, including share fishermen-women, who cannot work because of poor weather conditions can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during periods of unemployment.

However, it is important that those availing of these freedoms are not intent on abusing the welfare systems of other counties and, specifically, the welfare system of this country.  The right of residence afforded citizens from other EU countries is not unconditional and is governed by the terms of the EU residence directive.  Under that directive, EU citizens from other countries have an unqualified right of residence in another member state for up to three months.  There is no obligation on a member state to provide social assistance to the person or their family during that initial period, with some limited exceptions, or for longer in the case of jobseekers who have not worked here.  Thereafter, the right of residence of people not in employment or self-employment depends on them having sufficient resources for themselves and their families so as not to become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the State.  Our social insurance system is based on the contributory principle of all our contributors paying in.  It is largely confined to the contributors.<br\/><br\/>The judgment in the Dano case is very welcome as it clarifies the relationship between the equality provisions of EU regulations on the co-ordination of social security systems and rights under the residence directive of 2004.  Ms Dano is an EU migrant who moved to Germany but was not in employment.  She had argued that, under the EU social security regulations, she was entitled to benefits on the same basis as German citizens in a similar situation. <br\/><br\/>In its judgment, the court concluded that if it was the case that non-active persons who do not have a right of residence could claim social assistance under the same conditions as nationals of the host member state, this would undermine an objective of the residence directive, which is to prevent nationals of other member states from becoming an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the member state.

This not only impacts on migrants who are genuinely claiming benefits here, but also on Irish citizens in a similar position in other member states.

The reason for this is very simple, namely, there is a new problem in the private rental market.  Given that the Government intends to be dependent on this going forward, it has to address the problem that much of the rental market is now controlled by a small number of players because NAMA and the banks have sold many of the apartments that are up for rent to investors, many from outside the country.  The truth of the matter is that, unless the Government actively controls the private rental market in some way, this problem is not going to be solved, given that so few players have such control over a huge chunk of the private rental market in Dublin.

My experience, certainly in my Dublin city centre constituency, is that the vast number of those taking rent supplement are in the buy-to-let area, where a single person had bought the property for their pension or otherwise.  Some describe them as hobby landlords and, in many cases, that created problems because they did not give a professional service and there was not the required scale.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Durkan outlined, there is a real problem of rent inflation within the city centre and we are in constant communication in that regard.  I have seen this in the Ringsend-Pearse Street area because of the huge growth in employment in the IT sector.  There has also been huge rent inflation in the central Dublin area, which started in the Docklands and has spread out very much from there.  Therefore, I am not surprised by Deputy Wallace's point about rent increases in Dominick Street and areas like that.<\/p><p>  I am not sure if Deputy Wallace was in the House when I explained this, but we have written to the front-line staff this week, asking them to operate under section 38 and to utilise the flexibility contained therein.

It is obvious this is happening in Dublin, but it is also happening outside Dublin in places where there is pressure and there has been little built during the recession.  I hope the &euro;2.3 billion outlined in the 2015 budget indicates again the start of the capital programme of building local authority houses.  I hope this will happen as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000010#H00700","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418208600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Written Answers follow Adjournment.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Homelessness: Statements","time":1418208600,"counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000011#J00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1418208600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank the House for providing me with this opportunity to update Deputies on the further actions we are taking to address the issue of homelessness.  I assure Deputies of the commitment of my Government colleagues to taking on the issue in a focused and co-ordinated way.  I commend and thank politicians on all sides and political persuasions for the manner in which they have worked with me over the recent period on this issue.  I appreciate their co-operation, which goes beyond politics, and commend everyone on their contributions and co-operation over the past number of weeks.<\/p><p>  Last week, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, and I convened a special forum on homelessness.  We met with the Catholic and Church of Ireland Archbishops of Dublin, Deputies from this House, officials and politicians from the Dublin local authorities, a vast number of people from the NGO sector involved in the delivery of homeless services and officials from a range of Departments and State agencies.  I want to express my appreciation and gratitude to all of those who attended and contributed.  It was an excellent forum and we all learned a significant amount about the issue in a collaborative way and we will be stronger as a result.  <\/p><p>  I have often said that nobody has a monopoly on solutions to homelessness and this was proved at the forum, where new measures were proposed, immediate responses were identified and additional resources were committed.  At the end of the forum, I was well placed to outline some of the measures identified and a roadmap of the next steps we need to take.  Since then, I have worked with all the stakeholders involved to develop and implement the action plan on homelessness approved by the Government on Tuesday.<\/p><p>  Yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, and I announced details of the Government&rsquo;s 20-point action plan to address homelessness and a copy of this plan is available on my Department's website.  The plan commits to &euro;20 million plus in additional expenditure and includes the immediate provision of over 260 additional emergency beds for people sleeping rough in Dublin, a &quot;Nite Caf&eacute;&quot; to provide a contact point for homeless people who do not want to be placed in emergency accommodation and the provision of transport with support services to bring people sleeping rough to emergency accommodation where they will be cared for and provided with the health and care supports they need.  A number of measures have been identified and will be put in place in other cities and urban areas also.  We are aware this issue is not confined to Dublin, although there is an acute issue there.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the efforts by all who are making properties and beds available to meet the urgent need.  Some of these 260 beds are already in place while works are being carried out to other properties to ensure that all beds will be available before Christmas.<\/p><p>  While every effort is being made to provide beds, the provision of emergency accommodation is not a viable long-term solution to homelessness.  The Government&rsquo;s homelessness policy statement emphasises a housing-led approach to homelessness, which is about providing permanent housing as the primary response to homelessness.  This approach is also articulated in the Government's implementation plan on the State's response to homelessness.  Increasing the supply of housing is critical to addressing housing need and homelessness.  This will be achieved through the Government&rsquo;s construction 2020 plan and the Government's six year social housing strategy which I recently launched.  This strategy will deliver in excess of 35,000 new social housing units over a six year period.  There is also a significant programme of work identified and committed to for the period to the end of 2016 under the Government&rsquo;s implementation plan on the State&rsquo;s response to homelessness.<\/p><p>  In the short term, however, it is essential to increase the volume of housing supply that is being made available to homeless households.  Therefore, I will issue a direction to the four Dublin housing authorities to allocate 50% of all housing allocations to homeless households and other vulnerable groups for the next six months, taking account of the time spent by these households on the homeless and other housing lists as at 1 December 2014. <\/p><p>  It is worth noting that funding, which is being provided through my Department, will result in a significant number of vacant local authority properties being brought back into productive use.  In addition, I will sign regulations next week to provide for the new housing assistance payment to be rolled out in the Dublin region on a pilot basis and this is specifically focused on homeless households.  This pilot will ensure that homeless households in the Dublin region can access accommodation in the private housing market.  These three measures will have a significant positive impact on the homeless households on the Dublin local authorities&rsquo; homeless and housing waiting lists.<\/p><p>  Prevention is an important aspect in the response to homelessness.  The prevention campaign launched by Dublin City Council last June has been very successful in stemming the flow of families becoming homeless and in assisting families and others in dealing with private rented accommodation issues.  The interim tenancy sustainment protocol involving the Department of Social Protection, the Dublin local authorities and Threshold has made significant interventions on behalf of families at risk of homelessness.  This has made a difference and will continue.  I fully support this excellent initiative.  A &quot;Stay in your Home&quot; campaign will be put in place to raise further awareness of tenants' rights and ensure that families and other individuals at risk of losing their tenancies will be assisted to stay in their homes.  The support service currently operated by Threshold in Dublin will be provided with additional staff this week and the service will be extended to Cork imminently.<\/p><p>  Homelessness is not just a Dublin issue but it is most acute in the Dublin region.  We will respond on issues in other cities and urban areas also.  Housing authorities in our other cities are urgently assessing the scale of action they need to take and we are in touch with them constantly.  However, homelessness is not just about accommodation.  A number of other responses must also be implemented to ensure that the necessary supports are in place for households whose accommodation needs have been met.<\/p><p>  The integrated services hub, which currently provides a one-stop shop service for homeless persons in the Dublin region, will further develop its case management model with the Department of Social Protection to include income support and job activation measures.  I was in Parkgate Street yesterday and I saw at first hand the excellent model of collaboration involving the State and non-State sector in assisting clients who are homeless or facing homelessness as they grapple with the difficult situation they find themselves in.  I would encourage and would accompany Opposition spokesperson on this issue to visit and see the worthwhile work going on there.<\/p><p>  Homeless families are of particular concern to me and my colleagues.  Their situation is not acceptable.  Our agencies, charged with responsibilities for child protection and welfare needs and others, must co-ordinate operations to ensure that services are fully responsive to the particular protection and welfare needs that might arise for families in emergency accommodation. <\/p><p>  The special forum shone a spotlight on how we co-ordinate our services, both in terms of housing supply and our health and care supports.  In this regard, the HSE plays a key role and co-ordination of health services for the homeless will be co-ordinated at senior management level in the Dublin region from 15 December.  Specialist consultant-led mental health and primary care services will be streamlined in quarter one of 2015 to ensure in-reach services into all emergency accommodation settings across the Dublin region.  This will make it easier for homeless people to access the services, as service providers will come to them rather than the other way around.  The HSE will also put in place a formal discharge protocol with Dublin hospitals and homeless services to ensure that, as far as possible, no patient will be discharged into homelessness.  This will be operational early in the new year.<\/p><p>  The purpose of last week&rsquo;s forum on homelessness was to step outside of the current response and implementation models to see what could be done in the immediate short term.  I believe there is an opportunity for our businesses and companies &ndash; large, medium and small &ndash; to get involved as well and to focus their corporate social responsibility programmes on responding to this issue.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>I am open to any offers that anybody wishes to come forward with and will listen to them very carefully.<\/p><p> Together with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, I have stressed the need for collaborative action by Departments, State agencies, NGOs and the wider voluntary sector.  That is the spirit with which we approached the forum and which runs through the action plan I have announced.  We brought together all stakeholders involved in this issue on a policy and operational basis.  We asked them for their views, what needed to be done and to come forward with real and tangible contributions to a solution.  The Government has not been found wanting.<\/p><p> In addition to the &euro;55 million allocated for tackling homelessness nationally in 2015, we approved a further &euro;20 million for an urgent targeted action plan to tackle rough sleeping in Dublin and throughout the country, and to provide everyone who needs emergency overnight accommodation with it before Christmas.  Anyone who is sleeping rough will have accommodation if he or she wishes to choose it.  We will also provide other services to ensure that everyone's dignity can be maintained, such as the Nite Caf&eacute; and transport services, to ensure people have options and do not feel that if they turn down accommodation, they have nowhere else to go.  The Nite Caf&eacute; is an important initiative, given the fact that it can hold more than 50 people.  It is a step in the direction I feel is necessary given the circumstances and complex issues of many people who are homeless and sleeping rough.<\/p><p> A comprehensive and effective response to homelessness is an obligation shared by all in the House.  I have said that on previous occasions.  I compliment and thank everyone who has made a contribution, including Members opposite.  It goes beyond any action by the Government and its agencies.  It is an obligation on all of us in our communities and as individuals.  In our communities we must be prepared to reach out a hand to each homeless person and not to shun him or her on the other side of the street.<\/p><p> I ask communities and public representatives everywhere to accept and work with the emergency solutions we are putting in place.  This is above and beyond political thought and the usual day-to-day raggle-taggle of political discussion in the House.  This is a very human issue.  It is about people's dignity, putting together a quick plan to back up the homeless action plan which is in place and backing up the social housing strategy.<\/p><p> These are not just people who are homeless.  Only for a quirk of fate, any of us in the House or any of our families could be in the same situation.  They are fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, and are all part of a family.  I ask all of us to engage with that sense of responsibility and respect people's dignity.  I am willing to work with everybody inside and outside of the House to ensure that we deliver the best service possible to these very vulnerable people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000011#J00400","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418209200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Barry Cowen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000012#K00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1418209200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Deputy Cowen has published a policy document on housing.  One of the points we have made consistently in this House is the fact that we are falling way behind in regard to the number of housing units we need to build per year.  We have raised the issue of homelessness on many occasions, and I submitted a Topical Issue matter on it last September.  Dublin is always quoted as a very serious issue, but it is not the only part of the country which has serious housing problems.  There are a range of proposals, some of which the Minister has referred to, from different sources to tackle these issues.<\/p><p>  COPE in County Galway was one of the first organisations to propose an allocation of &euro;500 million for the social housing building programme.  It wanted a portion of the funding ring-fenced for homelessness, in particular for the Government proposal to eliminate long-term homelessness and the need to help people who are sleeping rough, and for this to be done by 2016.  This week I read in local newspapers that while COPE welcomed the funding, it emphasised the short-term situation and the need to deal with the issue of people who need help immediately, not in two or three years' time.<\/p><p>  The death of Jonathan Corrie showed all of us the scale of the challenge we face.  There have been social welfare cuts and rents have escalated, in particular in Dublin, which has led to people becoming homeless.  I refer in particular to older people.  The CEO of ALONE indicated that 25% of the calls to his organisation related to housing need for older people.  It is a measure of the seriousness of the situation that more than 4,700 older people in this country are in need of housing.  It is just one aspect of the issue.<\/p><p>  I know from colleagues and people I have met that entire families are now living in hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation and hostels in Dublin.  I found it interesting that Brother Kevin Crowley, founder of the Capuchin Day Centre for homeless people, talked about the urgent need for emergency accommodation in the city and the cessation of the night bus service.  Will the Minister refer to that in his conclusion?  The night bus service was very important, as Brother Crowley pointed out, and there was provision to include the ring-fencing of money for accommodation.  I hope the very vulnerable people to whom he referred will not be pushed to the bottom of the housing list when it comes to dealing with the housing crisis.<\/p><p>  The Simon Community has put together a ten-point plan.  It referred to the long-term plan under the social housing strategy and the current homeless crisis, in particular the private rented sector and rent supplement.  It is concerned about the strategy, which involves 75,000 households being provided for in the private rented sector, and about the capacity in the private rented sector to deliver on that.  It made the point that prevention and early intervention services are important but are also very expensive.  I appreciate that and I am sure the Minister knows that.<\/p><p>  The situation regarding NAMA properties and the approved housing bodies is always used as an example of what we could do to increase the supply of housing.  I suggested during the previous debate that every local authority should have a dedicated NAMA transfer unit.  We were told two years ago that 2,000 housing units could be made available through NAMA for people on the social housing waiting lists, but this has not happened.  In fact, large numbers of apartments have been sold by NAMA to developers.<\/p><p>  In the case of approved public bodies, there is an issue in terms of trying to get finance through the capital assistance schemes to provide houses.  The Simon Community is correct when it states that the private rental sector is imploding, rents are rising and the number of properties available is reducing.  In a recent RTE television programme, &quot;Through the Roof&quot;, comments about it being a good time to be a landlord and a sad comment that single people would not even bother asking where they were on the housing lists were made.  The issues of housing, mental health and drugs are not being linked by the Government.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to the Nite Caf&eacute;, which I welcome, but people like Father Peter McVerry have spoken about restorative practices to tackle the problems and to try to deal with situations where relations have broken down and people feel they had to leave home.  I welcome the debate.  We have a lot of issues to deal with and I hope we can make progress because we all know the seriousness of the situation.  The problem is not just about Christmas.  A long-term approach is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000012#K00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1418209200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I, like the previous speaker, welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues.  I thank the Minister for the manner in which he responded to the crisis which existed last week on foot of the unfortunate death of Jonathan Corrie.  I pay tribute to the stakeholders who engaged with the Minister and his staff, and to Archbishop Martin who was quick out of the traps and showed some leadership on this issue when he made available a property and initiated the forum which ensued.  I welcome what has come from that, the programme announced by the Minister and what is contained within it.  The fact that he has reacted accordingly and listened to many of the initiatives proposed during the course of events over the past week is welcome.<\/p><p>  It is unfortunate that it took the death of a homeless person to lead to this.  There has been a failure by Government to address the issue and to end homelessness.<\/p><p>The one issue that has failed to be addressed and that I ask the Minister to revisit is that of rental assistance.  It will be necessary on a temporary basis to give consideration to the subjects of rent caps and rent allowance to address the crisis that exists at present and the numbers of people who find themselves in the position whereby they cannot meet the commitments being asked of them in the marketplace.  This call emanates both from my party and from many other parties in opposition and from many of the stakeholders the Minister met last week, which have made the same point.  To deal with the situation in a temporary manner and in the absence of the measures announced in the strategy coming into effect, it will be important that the Minister makes every effort to deal with the issue in the short term.  In time, there may be an option to reduce that thereafter.<\/p><p> Another issue I will mention is the failure on the part of NAMA to provide the sort of social dividend that was predicted by that body and the Government in this regard.  In any debates that have taken place over the past two to three years, the Minister of State with responsibility in this regard, of whom there have been three, has always given the commitment that up to 2,000 or 3,000 units would accrue to the State as a social dividend.  This has not happened and the State has been lucky to get between 400 and 500 units since the process began.  This is in no way reflective of the needs that exist and I ask the Minister to consider the prospect of each local authority having a dedicated unit to deal with this issue to garner the type of dividend that had been envisaged and some success might ensue from so doing.<\/p><p> Overall, it is important to acknowledge the effort and commitment by the Minister and his Department to react to the crisis, unfortunate as were the circumstances that provided the opportunity to so do.  Nonetheless, one must recognise the effort and commitment, as well as the &euro;20 million.  I also ask the Minister to consider rolling out a similar effort and programme in other cities and throughout the local authority network.  Various stakeholders, such as Simon Communities Ireland, for example, have a mechanism in place to deal with homelessness in the midlands and other regions nationwide.  It is important that the Minister carries on the progress that has been evident over the past week in other regions to ascertain whether the same effort and commitment can be given to those areas to meet the immediacy of the problem that is obvious on the ground.  The programme and strategy announced by the Minister last week was late in coming to the table but Members must acknowledge its presence and that there is a commitment to expend considerable funds.  Aligned to that programme and strategy, I hope to see in the coming weeks and months a programme coming from each local authority that will be ready to meet the demands of that strategy and how it might be reflected in those areas.  In addition, a roadmap should be put in place for effective delivery of units because obviously, housing units are what will solve this problem.  However, I acknowledge the immediacy that existed and the problems that were there, as well as the effort by the Government to address that.  As I stated, it would be well received were the Minister to make the same commitment to other regions and cities and in parallel, were the local authorities and the Minister to work in tandem and allow Members to see there is a prospect of delivering units throughout the country and that they could see that effort in tangible form.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000012#K00500","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418209800,"counter":119,"content":"<p>At the recent summit with the Minister, Deputy Kelly, the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, officials, managers of local authorities and politicians, Sinn F&eacute;in outlined that an immediate response and provision of emergency accommodation was essential.  My party also outlined how it envisaged this issue could be tackled and put forward a number of suggestions.  Sinn F&eacute;in did not want the forum to be a talking shop but also wished to make clear why homelessness was now such a big problem and that longer-term and short-term solutions were needed urgently.  My party outlined that the haemorrhaging of people from the rent supplement scheme and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, needed to be stopped.  Sinn F&eacute;in also noted the cases of many people who have lost their homes or are under the threat of losing their homes due to their landlords' mortgage difficulties, as well as people with distressed mortgages who have been obliged to give up their homes or have had them repossessed.<br\/><br\/>Much of this problem comes down to rent rates, which clearly are too high.  Although demand can usually push a product to a price ceiling above which no one will pay for it, housing is different and landlords have shown an unwillingness to set fair rents for their tenants and are even leaving residences idle because no one possibly could afford the rates being asked.  If one looks on <i>Daft.ie <\/i>right now, modest flats and houses are going up in price by the hundreds.  The Government has a responsibility to protect tenants and ensure the market is reasonable and fair.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in has ardently demanded rent controls both within and between tenancies.  These are not rent freezes or rent caps <i>per se<\/i>.  They are simply regulations that ensure the rent being charged on accommodation reflects the quality of that accommodation and is affordable now and in the longer term.  Deputy Rabbitte recently stated he believed it was necessary as an emergency measure and Fr. Peter McVerry has also stated it is needed.  Focus Ireland and Threshold also have weighed in with their support.  Opposition to this measure does not truly take into account the human cost of allowing things to continue as they are.<br\/><br\/>However, we also have a crisis in emergency accommodation right now that can only be solved by providing more places immediately.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been telling the Government for years that the bodies providing these beds are at bursting point and are operating at capacity.  They also have been making this point and things have only got worse.  Part of this is down to the Government's failure to move people out of homelessness and emergency accommodation into housing.  Emergency accommodation must be truly for an emergency and real housing must be provided for those people who have been in emergency accommodation for an extended period.  Otherwise, the personal problems that homelessness causes only deepen and others who need emergency accommodation must go without.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the announcement of 260 extra beds in Dublin by Christmas, which is late in coming but is necessary.  The night caf&eacute; is also a welcome initiative for those who do not want to be in hostels but need support.  I note also that 50% of housing allocations in Dublin for the next six months will be focused on people in homelessness but how much does that actually represent?  The Government has a miserable record on delivering housing.  People are waiting for years to be allocated homes and are living in terrible conditions.  How many people actually will be allocated homes in Dublin in the next six months?  In addition, while this plan sounds good, what of the people who have been on the housing list for ages and are in bad accommodation they can no longer afford?  These will be the new homeless and the Minister might well just create a vicious cycle in which some are housed while others are forced out of housing.  The local authorities have medical priorities, welfare priorities and other priorities, many of which involve people who have been waiting for several years.  What does the direction to the local authorities mean?  Does the Minister have the powers to direct local authorities to devote 50% of the allocation to homelessness?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000013#L00200","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1418209800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000013#L00300","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1418209800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Local authorities have a scheme of letting that is signed off by councillors and is in place.

The Government thus far has failed to do all of these things and that is why we are in this crisis.

All sides in this Chamber are willing to work with him as the Minister with responsibility to try to resolve this issue once and for all.<\/p><p> Homelessness is multifaceted.  One is dealing with families who have lost their homes through the economic crash, people with mental health issues and people with drug addiction so no one solution will fit everyone.  I want to focus on one cohort of people, namely, people who suffer from drug addiction, because it is very close to my heart.  I know heroin addicts who have worked extremely hard to get their lives back on track, gone to rehab, left their families, made tough decisions on a personal level to get clean and to come off methadone or prescription drugs and spent three months in a rehab centre in Carlow with no contact with the outside world.  I know a person who came out of that centre feeling energised and that he had got his life back.  He wanted that helping hand to get back on the right track to try and make a positive contribution to society.  The first issue he faced when he came out of that rehab centre clean after having been on heroin for a number of years was the fact that he had nowhere to live.  He ended up going back into a homeless shelter - emergency accommodation - where the temptation of drugs was under his nose every day.  Despite that, he battled on and was able to get rent allowance because he was registered as homeless.  He went looking for a property to rent.  We should remember that this is a man who is in a very fragile state of mind and has just kicked a very serious addiction.  He needed those supports and persons to help him through that difficult period.  He needed them to be close to him.  He could not find accommodation to fit the rent allowance.  It was impossible to find it so he had no choice but to stay in the homeless shelter.  Eventually, he found accommodation that came under the rent allowance limits but this was 30 miles away from his case worker and the treatment centre he needed to attend daily so he was left with a decision.  He either stays where he is and faces the temptation of drugs every day while trying to resist that temptation and regain the social skills he needs to get back on a normal footing or he moves 30 miles away from the very people he needs to support him.  Those are the tough decisions that people who are coming out of addiction face.  <\/p><p> While the &euro;20 million and the extra emergency bends are very welcome, we need to go further in the longer term.  We need to ensure that people who come out of rehab centres and who are trying to get their lives back on track have suitable and affordable accommodation available to them.  That is not happening.  Rents are running away from people.  The rent allowance people get is not sufficient.  Until we deal with that, which is the one glaring omission from the Minister's 20 point plan, people will face those tough choices - either take accommodation that they can afford 20 miles away from their key workers and the supports they need to help them stay off drugs or leave themselves in a position where they must remain in a homeless shelter where those temptations are there every day.  <\/p><p> I ask the Minister to look at that.  I know he cannot do everything at once and as I said, everything he has done is welcome but there are real challenges facing people.  It is not just about putting a roof over their heads.  We are talking about people who are very fragile, whether it is through mental health problems or drug addiction.  As I said, it is an issue that is very close to my heart.  My own sibling is one of those individuals and he faces that battle every day.  Unless we deal with it, it will be a tragedy for my family and it is not something I want.  I plead with the Minister to look at those issues in the longer term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000013#L00500","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418210400,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Like everybody else, I believe the moves the Minister made last week must be welcomed.  It is a step in the right direction.  There was a lot of focus on homelessness last week.  For some people, having ten or 20 houses would not solve the underlying problem.  Having experienced somebody belonging to me coming through a situation like this, I know that the underlying problems that must be addressed.  There is a general acceptance in this country of a drinking culture.  When one tries to help someone, barriers are put in front of one every way one tries to do it.  I am firm believer that when somebody has a genuine problem that needs to be addressed and if two or three doctors are prepared to put it on the line that there is a major problem, we must take action.  I am a firm believer that people must be put on courses whether they like it or not.  They talk about skid row and I understand all that but if we do not start to address that problem, there will be more of what happened last week.  I know civil liberties groups will say that people are entitled to this, that and the other but sometimes in the best interests of a person, one needs to be cruel to be kind.<\/p><p>  There are 80,000 people looking for houses.  If one looks at people in arrears, one can see that there are approximately 37,000 more.  Last week in the west of Ireland, 380 letters went out for repossession orders.  We can bury our heads in the sand as long as we want but the reality is that another 20,000 people are about to lose their homes in the next three to six months.  If there is no initiative from the Government to resolve this, those 80,000 people waiting on the housing list will basically become homeless again.  There is an old saying down the country and I am sure the Minister often heard it - &quot;when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window&quot;.  One then has rows, people going to pubs and family break-ups.  <\/p><p>  A proposal about which I have been thinking in the past few weeks is that we need to do something for the 20,000 people and indeed all people in mortgage distress.  We need to look outside the box and bring something in that will give them a 30, 40 or possibly 50-year mortgage.  I have seen in my own area how people were evicted from their property and the State has paid for the past five years.  These people are within &euro;7,000 of what that house made but somebody else owns it.  I know the Minister is making moves to resolve the social housing problem but given the land banks that exist, we need to tie in a certain price at which houses are built for the simple reason that people around the country need houses they can afford.  <\/p><p>  There are also situations where councils or housing agencies do not know who is to buy the house.  We have seen scenarios where one will start bidding against the other.  Clear direction needs to be given in the next few months to start tackling this problem, particularly from the beginning of next year.  There is no point in having drawings and planning permission and then waiting for the following year.  We need to give people in the different councils around the country the scope and basically the go-ahead to get planning permission ready and get everything in place to make sure we avert a bigger crisis coming down the tracks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000014#M00200","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1418210400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I note that on 24 November 2014, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Christy Burke, was very angry that the Minister cancelled a meeting with councillors about the homelessness crisis in the capital.  It was only a couple of days afterwards that the tragic situation outside the House happened.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister bringing those groups together along with the Lord Mayor and Members of this House so quickly.  Some of the proposals made are quite positive.  Given the acute situation, next week we should have a similar debate to discuss the week-to-week progress on the emergency accommodation and establishing the night caf&eacute;.  When we come back we should have another 20 minute or half-hour debate with the Minister reporting regularly to the House on the matter.  That is the sort of attention that is needed.  We need to see the figure of 158 rough sleepers reducing - we know it is more because many people hide their night sleeping on the streets.<\/p><p> I saw a report that Focus Ireland and the Peter McVerry Trust had set up emergency accommodation providing initially 30 beds and then another ten beds to get rough sleepers off the streets over the winter.  I was amazed to read at the very end of that report that these beds would be closed down in March when the weather gets better.  I presume those people will be going into longer-term accommodation in housing rather than finding themselves back on the streets again when the weather gets better, which is what we have seen repeatedly over recent years when there is a knee-jerk reaction with no longer-term provision.<\/p><p> Some Deputies spoke about the longer-term problems.  We have 90,000 on housing lists - it is probably more now.  We have another 100,000 people in mortgage distress.  We know that many of them will be evicted.  The Minister did not accept the Private Members' Bill forcing the banks to adhere to the code of conduct - they are only guidelines at the moment and the banks are not adhering to them.  The Government had an opportunity to force the banks to implement this and give people the alternative of staying in their homes rather than going on local authority housing lists and finding themselves homeless.<\/p><p> I raised this during the week and I want to emphasise it today.  The need for rent control is becoming more urgent.  I got an e-mail from a resident in a big apartment block in my area stating that on 27 November every person in the complex received notice that they were facing a rent increase from &euro;1,300 to &euro;1,600, a 23% increase.  There are many people in the complex on rent supplement and many people who are privately renting.  Only weeks ago these apartments were transferred from NAMA to IRES REIT, backed by a foreign investor.  These people are being regarded as cash cows now as opposed to people who need a home to live in.  These investors are coming in and increasing rents dramatically.  We propose that these people go to the PRTB as a collective force to fight their case, as this is way above the market rent at the moment.  We need to get more feedback on what is happening with rent increases in communities and complexes.<\/p><p> I would like us to get an update next week on the number of beds put in place for rough sleepers, particularly those who find themselves in emergency accommodation, including families in hotels.  We need to keep an ongoing check on it.  Through those debates and discussions we might all be able to come up with better ideas to deal with these issues in the longer term.  I do not believe we have sufficient resources for social housing to be built, but that is another day's debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000014#M00300","speaker":"1193","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418211000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I call Deputy McFadden, who is sharing time with Deputy Fitzpatrick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000015#N00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1418211000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I commend the recent work of Minister, Deputy Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, in addressing the crisis in Dublin.  I point out that the crisis is not just confined to Dublin, but is a nationwide problem.<br\/><br\/>The Government's 20-point action plan to tackle emergency and short-term homelessness has committed &euro;20 million to provide 260 additional emergency beds for people sleeping rough in Dublin and a night caf&eacute; to provide a contact point for homeless people who do not want to be placed in emergency accommodation.<br\/><br\/>The programme for Government contains a commitment to end long-term homelessness by using a housing-led approach by 2016.  Following a request by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Dr. Eoin O' Sullivan published a paper entitled Ending Homelessness: Towards a Housing-Led Approach.  The paper was critical of homeless services that were focused primarily on providing hostel accommodation as opposed to supporting people to attain their own homes.<br\/><br\/>Funding is very important but we also need to adopt a systematic approach to addressing long-term homelessness.  For example, the midlands Simon Community has shown this through its very successful regional settlement service which is based on the housing first model.  This model provides the stability of a home is the first step in helping people overcome the issues of homelessness.  This model is not just proven to be an efficient and cost effective method of helping people move out of homelessness, but has also proven to benefit the lives of service users.<br\/><br\/>The midlands regional settlement service operates in the counties of Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath in conjunction with the four local authorities and in partnership with HSE, and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  The service works with individuals, couples and families who are referred to the service by the local authorities.  They are supported to move out of homelessness and into a home of their own through the development of a personal action plan.<br\/><br\/>I strongly agree with the recent comments of Midlands Simon Community CEO, Mr. Tony O'Riordan, who has said that homelessness in the midlands is an invisible problem.  In Dublin, we can see the problem in a visible way.  As Mr. O'Riordan has said, in the midlands, people sleep in their cars, on couches or on the floors of friends' homes, none of which appears in any official statistics.<br\/><br\/>An official report in 2011, Review of Services Addressing Homelessness in the Midlands 2011, found that despite receiving the lowest level of section 10 funding from the national homelessness budget, the midlands region achieves very significant outcomes and results.  Unfortunately, this review found that funding for the midlands region was well below the State average on a <i>per capita<\/i>scale and the basis of the amount spent on each service user.  Ongoing data that the midlands region regularly provides to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government show that the region continues to perform competently with meagre resources.<br\/><br\/>In the context of doing a lot more with few resources, I compliment the work of Westmeath County Council, which is the lead authority on behalf of the midlands homelessness region which also covers Longford, Offaly and Laois.  Unfortunately, the low level of overall funding for the midlands region continues to put huge pressure on services at a time when there has been a 30% increase in demand for these services.  I ask the Minister to be cognisant of the efficiencies and value in the delivery of homelessness services in the midlands and for this to be acknowledged with increased resources when the national budget is approved.<br\/><br\/>In the week 20 to 26 October 2014, data provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government showed that 2,580 individuals were homeless and accessing emergency accommodation nationally.  This figure does not include people sleeping rough.  Charities working with homeless people nationally also estimate that up to 5,000 people could be homeless in this country.  It is very clear the scale of the problem is huge.<br\/><br\/>The Government's plan envisages the delivery of 2,700 units between now and the end of 2016.  Some of the main mechanisms identified in the plan include bringing vacant properties back into use; ensuring that local authority allocation schemes give priority to vulnerable groups such as homeless families and individuals; working with NAMA and the voluntary sector to ensure that units are prioritised for homeless households; and ensuring that leasing arrangements facilitate the use and accessibility of these properties by homeless households.<br\/><br\/>It is imperative that the momentum we have now to address this crisis is sustained until we achieve meaningful results right across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000015#N00300","speaker":"1194"},{"type":"speech","time":1418211600,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this matter today.  Homelessness in Ireland is a growing problem not only for the homeless themselves, but also for their families and friends.  It causes great stress and worry for all concerned.  As a society we have to deal with this issue.  It is not an issue for the Government alone but for each and every one of us, from all sides of the political divide and all sections of the community.  It is not an issue that should be used for political gain or for playing party politics.  It is a human issue first and foremost.<\/p><p>  In my home town of Dundalk, I recently visited some of the many voluntary bodies that deal with homelessness.  They include the local Simon Community, the local counselling centre in Seatown Place, and St. Patrick's parish soup kitchen in Roden Place.  All these organisations are providing a wonderful service and some truly inspirational people give their time to help the homeless around Dundalk.<\/p><p>  Although the problem of homelessness is mainly centred in our capital city of Dublin, it is also important to highlight the issue in smaller regional areas and towns.  As I said, homelessness is an issue for each and every one of us.  As a Government, we will not eradicate the problem of homelessness on our own.  Money alone will not solve this matter and neither will raising the rent supplement cap.  We need the help and support of all sections of society. <\/p><p>  In many cases those who have become homeless have lost all contact with their family and friends.  We must try harder as a society to ensure that this does not happen.  We must help those families who have sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, mothers or fathers who have become homeless.  <\/p><p>  We must remove the stigma of homelessness.  In many cases people who find themselves homeless cannot face their families or friends, so the problem escalates.  This must not be allowed to continue.  How can society help to solve the homelessness issue?  First and foremost, we need to understand the reasons for homelessness and ask why it is happening.  Why are certain sections of society more vulnerable?  Why do people make it a choice to be homeless?<\/p><p>  The Government is trying to tackle this problem and has made available an extra &euro;10.5 million in funding for accommodation in 2015.  Work has started on converting 245 vacant units back to their original state with an additional 410 being converted over the coming four to six months.  In addition, funding for housing is being increased by 40% to &euro;800 million in this year's budget.  That is an increase of over &euro;230 million on the previous year.  The Government is committed to building 7,500 new homes in 2015, as well as contributing &euro;30 million in 2014 in order to make available 1,800 vacant properties for housing needs. <\/p><p>  As I have already stated, money alone will not solve this issue.  We need to act as a society to ensure that the problem of homelessness in Ireland will eventually become a thing of the past.  We need to look out for our families and friends who may be in danger of becoming homeless.  We also need to support the many wonderful organisations that are fighting this issue on a daily basis.<\/p><p>  In Dundalk, much good work is being done by those voluntary bodies.  I recently met volunteers with the St. Patrick's parish soup kitchen who work six days a week.  Working alongside the Simon Community and the housing officer, those volunteers are feeding homeless people every day, giving them soup, sandwiches and dinner, as well as runners and other footwear.  They ensure that whoever calls does not leave with an empty stomach.  Such volunteers may be called by the Simon Community or a housing officer who seek their help in accommodating homeless people.  They will ensure that a homeless person gets a bed for the night.<\/p><p>  The only funding that voluntary organisations receive is from public donations.  The St. Patrick's parish soup kitchen will have church gate collections on Sunday, 20 December in the Dundalk and Blackrock areas.  I call on people to support them.  That is only one example of the work undertaken by voluntary bodies all over the country.  We would be lost without these volunteers.<\/p><p>  We must not give up on the homeless who, now more than ever, need our support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000016#O00100","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1418211600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the speed with which the Government reacted in the past week.  It is a poor reflection on all of us in this House, however, that it took the death of Jonathan Corrie to provoke such a reaction.<\/p><p>  Far too often, both Government and Opposition react and are not out in front leading the charge.  I cannot imagine the loneliness, isolation and anxiety of people who must live on our streets and sleep rough at night.  If anything positive is to come from the death of Jonathan Corrie we must have a lasting solution to the problem of homelessness.  At a minimum, the State should provide the basic human need and human right to a roof over one's head.<\/p><p>  We all know that homelessness arises for a variety of reasons, including substance abuse, mental health issues, marital breakdown and the loss of a job.  We now need to ensure that a holistic approach is taken to this crisis.  While in the region of 200 people are sleeping rough in our city streets at the moment, the problem is much wider and greater than that.  While we could have 200 extra beds in the morning, not everybody will accept a bed in emergency accommodation.  That is a fact.  All the money in the world would not encourage some people to accept such accommodation, for whatever personal reasons and experiences.  <\/p><p>  There is a bigger issue out there.  Over 1,500 people are staying in emergency accommodation.  They have lost their homes and they include children who do not know where to call home.  Those children should be excited about the arrival of Christmas, but they do not know if Santa will come to them due to the uncertainty over accommodation.  <\/p><p>  I do not want to make a political issue of this, but people have lost their homes as a result of policy decisions.  When one cuts rent allowance, it has a drastic effect on someone who is reliant on that payment.  In addition, banks have been heavy handed in evicting people from their homes.  The buy-to-let market is so volatile that banks are moving in and landlords are left with no choice but to sell rented properties.  That, in turn, is forcing people out into emergency accommodation.<\/p><p>  The homeless person is not just the stereotype suffering from substance abuse or psychological issues.  People from all walks of life are currently in emergency accommodation.  Some of them are bedding down and sleeping on couches.  Two weeks ago, a woman was in my constituency office.  She is holding down a full-time job but her marriage broke up and she is trying to sort out a house in negative equity.  That lady in her 50s is bunking down in accommodation with her son who is sharing with five other people.  Those are the type of problems we are facing at the moment.<\/p><p>  The Minister's oversight group, which was established last year, talked about moving people away from emergency accommodation to free it up for others.  However, some people are bed-blocking by staying in emergency accommodation longer than they should.  They are doing so because there is no other accommodation for them to move into.  We need to examine that situation.<\/p><p>  The Minister said one of the answers to the problem is to get more houses in the private rental market, but that system has failed.  It has failed all the more spectacularly in recent years as rents have increased.  I have never seen anything like it in my own constituency clinic over the last 12 months.  People are coming in because their houses are being sold from under them.<\/p><p>The banks are forcing landlords to sell property and rental accommodation schemes are being terminated at an unprecedented rate in local authorities because those authorities have not been provided with the funding to ensure they can continue to supply houses.<\/p><p> The forum was a welcome initiative last week but it was unfortunate that it focused mainly on Dublin.  The problem is clearly more profound in Dublin but the issue is nevertheless much wider.  I take this opportunity to highlight a concern in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath, where there are two homeless facilities operating.  Bethany House provides 19 places for women with mental health issues, young women leaving residential care, people suffering from drug and alcohol abuse or people fleeing domestic violence.  St. Martha's hostel provides 11 emergency short-term places for men.  These two facilities are helping men and women at a time when they face very challenging personal circumstances and homelessness.  Both facilities are running a deficit in excess of &euro;100,000 for the past 18 months.  That deficit comes as a result of a reduction in section 10 funding to those services.  The &euro;100,000 deficit has been met in the past 18 months by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, but that is no longer in a position to meet the deficit.  These two institutions - Bethany House for women and St. Martha's hostel for men - need additional funding to ensure the services in the midlands can be put on a sustainable footing.  The necessary funding should be put in place to ensure these services can be kept open.  The crisis may be more profound in Dublin and other large urban areas but there is still a crisis throughout the country.<\/p><p> The Minister must also examine how these institutions are funded and how funding is allocated to various regions.  My region of the midlands has the second lowest allocation of funding in the country at &euro;649,707.  Meanwhile, the neighbouring north-east region, which services a smaller population, has funding of &euro;1 million.  That does not add up.  I conclude by wishing the Minister well in his endeavours to eradicate the homelessness crisis.  He will have the full support of all Members of the House in ensuring this awful crisis is solved.  It is unfortunate that it took the death of a man for the Government to find the additional &euro;20 million needed to tackle the crisis.  I hope that when the news moves on, the sense of priority and urgency witnessed in recent days will remain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000016#O00200","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418212200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>As we were delayed starting the business, is it agreed to allow the Taoiseach his full allocation of ten minutes?

On Camden Street, Harcourt Street, South Great George's Street, Smock Alley and Temple Bar, there were no bells from the church, no urban foxes and no first snowflakes, just the sound of music in the distance and rats skittering across the sodden blankets and beds of needles.  On the journey I travelled, there were people laughing and enjoying themselves, making the most of their night out under Christmas lights strung high on the streets over strung-out people in some cases.  On Grafton Street, the Gucci sign beamed out over the remnants of humanity, only \"remnants\" is the wrong word.  That night, I discovered the richness of humanity with the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Mr. Burke, and his team.  I found it both in the team which did this night after night on a voluntary basis and, signally, in the men and women wrapped in their blue sleeping bags and to whom food is brought, along with comfort and a degree of company.  Above all, the message was that we recognise these people's personal dignity.  With this team, these people have an ear and a voice; they are not alone.<\/p><p>  I pay particular tribute to the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Mr. Burke, and his team on behalf of everybody.  People administer to these men and women, often very young, who have no home.  It is an example to the city and the country in what are powerful works of mercy.  I say &quot;having no home&quot; deliberately as the terms &quot;homeless&quot; and &quot;homelessness&quot; have become a kind of anaesthetic or political or social general absolution, as if the homeless and homelessness were sorts of conditions within our society.  Of course, they are not.<\/p><p>  In the early hours of Friday morning in the cold and rain I met alcoholics, drug addicts and returned emigrants.  Some of them shook my hand and a young man thanked me for looking after his sleeping bag while he went to find and use facilities nearby.  There were men and women with addiction, heroin addicts, people on methadone and so on.  They were still able to find a kind word.  They said: &quot;I have to rob, I have to beg; I need this to keep me going.  Do you understand me?&quot;  I do, to an extent.  On Thursday night and Friday morning, I experienced a sobering reflection on what is happening to some people on some streets in this city.  It is a replica of what happens in other places.<\/p><p>  I have listened to some of the debate involving Members of the House and the causes of homelessness are myriad and complex.  Both the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, will do all they can with new major co-operation across the Departments of Social Protection, Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Finance, Justice and Equality, Education and Skills, and the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We are now spending more than &euro;50 million in tackling homelessness, and we all have a responsibility to ensure the resources and work are co-ordinated in the best possible way.  That is why part of the Government's 20-point plan, adopted on the recommendation of the Minister, Deputy Kelly, yesterday is to review the homeless sector, service delivery and co-ordination arrangements early next year.<\/p><p>  Crucially, there is to be &euro;2 billion in investment for social housing, and although results will not be achieved overnight - I accept there are processes to be followed through - there is a willingness by some who will use their expertise in property management and accommodation provision to help alleviate current bed and housing difficulties.  The Minister and Minister of State will work with those people.  I have listened to parents who are without a home and, to a woman and a man, they tell me that they need immediate shelter but it is not sufficient in the long term.  Their children and the family need a home so they can have a life.  The unprecedented capacity and potential of more than &euro;2 billion in investment means we will now have the opportunity to provide for that.<\/p><p>  I will say a word or two about how soul-destroying it is for people in emergency accommodation.  They grieve not alone for what they had but, more crucially, for what they used to be when they had the privacy and dignity of a family life.  I spoke a few weeks ago at a conference on mental health and suicide and I was heartened that the views expressed drew a serious and passionate response from practitioners in the area.  Many men and women sleeping rough on our streets do so because of the disintegration of their interior life.  That can be caused and medicated by an addiction to drugs, gambling, alcohol and so on.  They sleep in the wet and cold because of the breakdown of their lives, caused by the break-up of a marriage or family.  There are blue dots on the streets because of depression or more serious disturbances in mental well-being which can be so finely balanced and which so many can take for granted.  These people huddle in doorways, under arches and in the open under the eye of closed circuit television.  They are just out of prison or out of the State's care, too often with nowhere to go.  Maybe they are just emotionally or psychologically fragile, with the glue to reality or normality removed by the death of a sibling or parent, for example, or a family row.  Perhaps they are paralysed by disappointment as because of what they did or was done to them, life did not turn out as they dreamed or imagined it should be.<\/p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> The shift we see in many countries and across Europe has at its heart something far bigger and deeper than just politics itself.  In the rush to abandon the architecture we have had and have taken for granted, sometimes people tend to run away from something but the question is, what are they running towards?  In the years ahead, issues of identity, dignity and belonging will come very much more to fore as the ground shifts beneath us and as we write a new blueprint for public life and for a kinder and more equal and a better society.  In all, it is clear that our shared humanity as people and our shared values of what constitutes a good life are what is important.  That is a bond that has to be developed to a far greater extent between the Irish people and their Government.  It is a restoring of the old form of the concept of d&uacute;thracht, the care and the active and responsible connection between people and all of those who attend around us.<\/p><p> When one meets these people in these circumstances and they look at one through yellowed eyes or have shivering hands, it is not the bond yields, the debt equity or the economic sovereignty in which they are interested but another opportunity for five more minutes of oblivion. As many people have pointed out, these are very complex and individual cases.<\/p><p> We need a strong and sensible economic policy, which I hope Ministers will implement, together with all the agencies.  We also need a new human and social chemistry, in particular in that interface between public and private lives.  Even when the Celtic tiger was deafening, men and women died on the streets of our country.  In a way, the homeless crisis is a kind of autopsy of our national life and of our priorities.<\/p><p> Mr. Jonathan Corrie died on the D&aacute;il's and the nation's doorstep just a few days ago.  His death and the manner of it does not make Mr. Corrie or his story public property and in the outpouring of sadness for him and the way he lived and died, we have to be careful to protect his boundaries.  He was clearly a man of intelligence, depth and insight.  He was also a man of great dignity and I believe the best way we can honour his life is by acting, once and for all, on this issue of homelessness, right now in the emergency shelter, in the long-term housing plan, in addressing the causes of pain and alienation in our society.<\/p><p> I thank the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Mr. Christy Burke, and the men and women I met last Friday morning for the opportunity they gave me and the generosity they showed me.  I was privileged to be able to walk with them as they attended to those less fortunate in our society.  For my part, I have assured every one of them that the efforts of the Minister, Deputy Kelly, the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, and all of the agencies will deal with this effectively and in the most human and best way we can.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for this opportunity to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000017#P00300","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1418212800,"counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000018#Q00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1418212800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>The House will be united today in anger, shock and horror at the revelations in \"Prime Time: Inside Bungalow Three\" last evening.  I commend RTE and \"Prime Time\" for an excellent example of public service broadcasting at its best.  The revelations were shocking and they represented violations of human rights of senior citizens with intellectual disabilities.  These citizens, Ivy McGinty, Mary Garvan and Mary Maloney, among others, had their basic human rights violated to an extraordinary degree.  They were subject to torture, physical abuse and emotional abuse and the treatment was without question degrading.  They were kicked and dragged, at times they were shouted at and they were not even allowed to attend to the basic necessities of life, which was revealed harrowingly in the programme.<\/p><p>  There are many lessons to be learned from it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, said to the programme that she could not give an assurance that this type of behaviour was not happening in other centres.  I put it to the Taoiseach that we need to give that assurance and the Government needs to work very quickly, in terms of devising an action plan for every centre, to ensure we can give that assurance to other relatives of people with intellectual disabilities in similar centres across the country.<\/p><p>  Professional staff should be recruited.  It has emerged that the staff in bungalow three, for example, had at most ten hours training which, in itself, is disgraceful.  One could see that from the programme itself.  The culture that was allowed to fester should be wiped out completely. I feel for the relatives because they trusted the HSE and people to care for their loved ones, people with severe intellectual disabilities, and that trust has been breached.  It is clear we need an independent inquiry, separate from the HSE and even from HIQA, into &Aacute;ras Attracta, into what happened and into the culture and practices there so that we can learn lesson for the future. <\/p><p>  In June 2011, a report was published by the congregated settings working group which fundamentally challenged the existence of these congregated settings and stated that &quot;Congregated provision is in breach of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under UN Conventions.  The provision contradicts the policy of mainstreaming underpinning the Government's National Disability Strategy&quot;.  It also stated that &quot;The ethical case to move people from isolation to community, and in some cases, from lives lived without dignity, is beyond debate&quot;.  There were approximately 32 recommendations in that report from June 2011 and I believe a national implementation group was established.  Can the Taoiseach outline the progress in implementing those 32 recommendations? A seven-year plan was outlined for the implementation of the recommendations, which involves all the stakeholders and all the groups working with the HSE.  <\/p><p>  The report stated that the case for taking action now to address the situation of people living in congregated settings is powerful and unassailable.  It also mentioned to the ethical case to move people from isolation to the community.  Will the Taoiseach outline the progress made in regard to the implementation of those recommendations?  Will he also answer my question on the need for an independent inquiry?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000018#Q00400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1418212800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Stop cutting respite services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000018#Q00500","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1418212800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Last night's programme was another example of what we had in Leas Cross some years ago.

It was not an example of care but an example of control of fragile, vulnerable and voiceless people.  I found it sickening.<\/p><p>  The situation here is that following a HIQA inspection earlier in the summer, 59 recommendations were made to be implemented and they have all been implemented, including 400 hours of training.

As the Taoiseach has quite properly acknowledged, this programme has deeply upset and disturbed citizens, not least the relatives of those involved and those with family members and loved ones in care.  What we witnessed was nothing less than the physical, mental and emotional abuse of the most vulnerable of our citizens.<\/p><p>  HIQA has stated that following an inspection of &Aacute;ras Attracta last February, it raised its concerns with the HSE which then put in place an action plan.  HIQA also states that it found substantial improvements during a follow-up inspection in May.  The Minister for Health says the HIQA recommendations were implemented.  If this was the case, the systems in place in care homes have been a catastrophic failure.  Does the Taoiseach know what, if any, oversight mechanisms are in place in these institutions?  While the HSE has ordered an investigation under an independent chairperson, Inclusion Ireland, the national association for people with intellectual disabilities, has said this is not adequate.  Inclusion Ireland says it is not appropriate for the social care division alone to investigate its own service.

He knows as well as I do that if an inspection arrives from HIQA or any other agency, attitudes can change within a facility very quickly.  That is why the HSE chief executive has pointed out the possibility of continuing to have undercover agents, whistleblowers and far greater scrutiny of what happens within the facilities.  There is a requirement for a person dealing with vulnerable adults in each facility and for a safeguarding team in each region.  It is impossible to guarantee that some other incident has not happened or does not happen in any other facility.  What do we have to do to ensure that families and particularly the individuals concerned are not being treated in the inhuman way that we saw on television screens yesterday?  What is the best thing to do?  Deputy Martin pointed to the report on congregated settings.  Many people have moved on from congregated settings but not as many as we would wish.<\/p><p>A regime of unannounced inspections is needed to ensure there is a continual stream of information about what happens here.  When whistleblowers come forward, they must be protected and the information they provide must be acted upon quickly, efficiently, properly and professionally in the interests of the people who are in these facilities.  As we have mentioned, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in spoke very movingly yesterday evening about his knowledge, which is based on family circumstances, of the challenges that face workers and individuals in these cases.  I have to say I found it traumatic to see people who are completely voiceless and helpless being treated in this fashion.  It is a case of not having any political division about what needs to be done here.  We must do the right thing and do it effectively.  The Garda and the HSE have been notified.  The 59 recommendations made by HIQA have been implemented.  It has been pointed out that the 100 hours of training that were given here were not implemented in any fashion by people who were professionally qualified nurses and FETAC 5 level qualified health care workers.  This is just not acceptable.  It has got to be dealt with and it will be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000019#R02300","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418214000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I think the Taoiseach understands that when something like this is highlighted, his responsibility is to reassure citizens, particularly those affected and their families, that the Government is on the job and knows what to do.  We do not expect the Taoiseach to have all the answers.  When I come here to ask questions, I do not expect him to trot out all the answers.  I asked the Taoiseach two questions.  I asked whether he knows what, if any, oversight mechanisms are in place.  If he does not know, that is okay, but he did not answer me.  I also asked whether the Government will put in place an independent inquiry into this matter.  We all know that the treatment of citizens with disabilities is a scandalous legacy on which we need to act.  The cut in the respite care grant is an example of this treatment.  The State has yet to sign up to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The reason we have not signed up to it is that we do not have the legislation in place to allow us to do so.  The Taoiseach acknowledged a moment ago that the congregated settings review has not been implemented.  These are our responsibilities.  What happened in &Aacute;ras Attracta needs to be dealt with properly.  As the Taoiseach has said, there should be no division across the Oireachtas about our responsibilities.<\/p><p>  I would like to revisit some of the recent details.  HIQA says it has received an average of three complaints a week since it took responsibility for the regulation of these services in November 2013.  It is reported that 160 complaints relating to care facilities for people with disabilities have been made but have not been fully investigated.  It is claimed that some of these cases involve the type of abusive treatment shown in last night's RTE documentary.  HIQA has admitted that individual complaints are not being probed and are merely being filed away.  Why is this?  Could it be the case that this failure allowed the abusive practices in &Aacute;ras Attracta to continue until they were exposed by the very fine RTE investigation?  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has said that the safety of citizens in care homes cannot be guaranteed.  I understand why she made that statement.  In light of all these aspects of the matter, will the Government commit to a root and branch inquiry into care facilities for people with intellectual disabilities in this State?  I repeat that I do not expect the Taoiseach to have all the answers to all these questions.  It is now our responsibility.  It has been brought to our attention.  We have to respond to it appropriately.  These are the most vulnerable citizens in this society.  They and their families depend on us.  We have to respond appropriately.  Given that the National Association for People with an Intellectual Disability has said a fully independent root and branch investigation is needed, surely that is the least the Government can do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000020#S00200","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1418214000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I do not think we have a disagreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000020#S00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1418214000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Except on the inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000020#S00400","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1418214000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>What affects people when they see something like this going on in this kind of setting and do not do something about it?

I am just making the point that we do not have any disagreement here.  In times gone by, the State always denied these kinds of issues.  This has happened.  We know it has happened.  The question is what is the best, right, correct and most effective thing to do now.  I recall meeting Christy Lynch a number of years ago.  I found him to be quite an extraordinary person.  He has the capacity to do a really effective job here.  The HSE has immediately responded by getting him to carry out an investigation.  I understand three investigations are going on.  The first thing we have to do is let that continue.  An action team from abroad is working on this at the moment.  The results of the &Aacute;ras Attracta investigation and analysis will be applied elsewhere.  The legislation referred to by the Deputy will be debated on Committee Stage here early in the next session.  The other point is that HIQA does not investigate individual complaints.  When individual complaints are received, they are always part of the overall investigation into facility X or Y that takes place.  The HSE has written to the chief executive of each individual service provider.  They are all being called together on Tuesday.  They have already been warned about this.  It is something that is intolerable.  Can I give a guarantee to the House here today that this has not happened in some other facility around the country?  I do not know.  Am I supposed to know?  I suppose it could be said that I am.  We have to put in place a system whereby the Minister of State with responsibility and the HSE have a continuous stream of up-to-date information about what is happening.<\/p><p>  I was struck by what Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said last night.  These people are voiceless.  They are completely vulnerable.  We saw it on our television screens.  The question is what we will do about it.  There are three investigations going on.  It is possible that criminal charges will be levied here.  That does not solve problems for the future.  The lessons learned from &Aacute;ras Attracta will apply to the rest of the system.  The legislation will be dealt with on Committee Stage early in the new year.  The action team led by an international expert in challenging behaviour is already doing its work.  The chief executive of KARE, Christy Lynch, who has complete independence, is already drafting his report.  I am not ruling out the question that Deputy Martin asked.  It is important to let these investigations conclude so we can find out what is there and what further needs to be done.  I do not rule it out, but we need to conclude what is under way at the moment in terms of these investigations so we can see what happens.  We can then put that in the system so this should not happen anywhere else.  I know this is a cause of great concern for the families of people in other facilities.  I am sure the health care workers in the other units in &Aacute;ras Attracta feel very damaged when they consider that this happened in the complex or campus in which they work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000020#S00700","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1418214000,"counter":169,"content":"<p>As we speak, thousands of people are making their way to Dublin for this afternoon's protest.

Yesterday, the Taoiseach claimed once again that all the issues of concern with regard to water charges have been addressed.  I hate to break it to him that the thousands of people who will be outside Leinster House this afternoon disagree with him.  I agree with the Taoiseach that this is about more than water.   Many people, including some who are in favour of water charges, have major concerns about the circumstances surrounding the creation of Irish Water and the awarding of the metering contracts.  They want some very specific questions to be answered, but those answers do not appear to be forthcoming.  I asked some of those questions when I spoke on the Water Services Bill 2014 in this House last week, but I am still waiting to receive answers.  I have also tabled parliamentary questions.<\/p><p>One of my parliamentary questions was flatly refused and the answer to the other was so anemic that it was a non-answer.  The questions referred to the circumstances surrounding the awarding of the Irish Water metering contract and how the company, Millington Limited, was able to acquire Siteserv and, thus, GMC\/Sierra Limited at a significantly reduced cost from IBRC, a deal that saw the State lose &euro;105 million.  GMC\/Sierra went on to win the metering contract.<\/p><p> There are some known facts.  We know that the bids had to be in by 30 June 2013.  We know that one of the companies awarded one of the major contracts did not exist until 15 July, weeks after the closing date for bids.  As such, I wish to ask some of the questions that I asked but to which I have not managed to get answers.

Those concerned need our full support to deal with the issue of early school learning.<\/p><p>  The Minister will be aware that the school completion programme is a targeted initiative that aims to retain in school those most at risk of early school leaving.  The programme was introduced in 2002 as a follow-up to the SSRI programme at senior cycle level.  Initially, the programme was partially funded by the European Social Fund and also the Department of Education and Science.  Later, the programme was funded through the Department of Finance with the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>  The programme was introduced in the Donaghmede-Ayrfield-Edenmore area in November 2002 and is now an integral part of the work of the schools in the area.  It is aimed at the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children in those schools.  Nationwide, it caters for between 35,0000 and 53,000 children.  As the Minister knows, the programme provides excellent services to children at risk.  It provides funding for the breakfast clubs and school curriculum supports, including drama, music, yoga, trips, attendance awards and attendance tracking and monitoring.  It also supports excellent after-school curricular supports, including homework clubs, study support and games and activities, including boxing, football and gymnastics.  It also supports out-of-school supports and summer camps.<\/p><p>  Since 2008, the national budget for the programme has been cut from &euro;32.9 million to &euro;24.7 million.  This is a massive cut of 33%.  There are eight schools in the cluster that I mentioned.  They have had to tolerate a cut and survive on &euro;47,000.  In light of the amount of funding allocated nationally, this is a small sum.  The schools, comprising two secondary schools and six primary schools, are doing an excellent job and have targeted 1,800 children.  The good news from the assessment of the programme is that it has increased school attendance.  In many cases, the attendance rate has increased to 95%.  This is amazing among children who come from economically and socially disadvantaged families.  Many of the families are homeless and some are living in temporary accommodation, including hotel bedrooms.<\/p><p>  It is important that there be no further cuts.  Since the project is so excellent, the Minister needs to protect the &euro;24.7 million available nationally.  In light of the review by Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, he needs to consider seriously increasing the funding for the project in question.  It has been proven by bodies such as the ESRI that it works and is very positive.  I ask the Minister again to reinstate the funding as the programme is seriously doing something about economic disadvantage, particularly on the north side of Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000024#X00300","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1418216400,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy knows, the school completion programme aims to retain young people in the formal education system until their completion of the senior cycle and to improve generally their school attendance, participation and retention in education.

The projects within the school completion programme are each managed and directed by a local management committee, which includes representatives of schools, parents, and other education stakeholders in the locality.  The programme's project model approach gives local communities the autonomy to devise innovative approaches to address the needs of young people most at risk of early school leaving.  That is critical.<\/p><p>  Typically, projects offer homework clubs, breakfast clubs, mentoring programmes, learning support, social and personal development programmes for young people and out-of-school supports including music, art and sports and a range of activities during holiday periods.<\/p><p>  Since 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has had operational responsibility for the school completion programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects.  In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million has been provided for the programme.  The agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014-15 academic year.  The first instalment of 2014-15 funding was issued to local projects last September.  Further payments, totalling approximately &euro;9.5 million, will be issued this month, with a third instalment in May 2015.  The Child and Family Agency will continue to work closely with local management committees, schools and local school completion programme co-ordinators to assist projects through the process and offer support in the delivery of their plan for young people.<\/p><p>  The school completion project in the area mentioned by the Deputy comprises six primary schools and two post-primary schools.  I am advised that &euro;214,184 was allocated by the agency to the project for the school year 2014-15.  The amount provided for 2014-15 takes account of the savings requirements in the comprehensive review of expenditure for the period 2012 to 2014.<\/p><p>  The allocation of the funding across the range of interventions planned for young people and between the local schools in the school completion programme project for the area is a matter for the local management committee.<\/p><p>  The Estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;635 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation.  My Department will issue a performance statement this month under section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.  This will include my priorities for consideration in the development of the agency's 2015 business plan.  The business plan will set out the agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the school completion programme, in light of the moneys available.<\/p><p> The Deputy may be aware that a review of the school completion programme has commenced.  The review is an important initiative in planning for the future development of the school completion programme.<\/p><p> It is anticipated that the review will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to both consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future and in line with the aims of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, and ensure that available funds are targeted to those services that provide the greatest contribution to good educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of educational disadvantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000024#X00400","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418217000,"counter":341,"content":"<p>The balance of the Minister's statement will be made available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000025#Y00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1418217000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response to my query on the school completion programme.<\/p><p>  I would make a number of points on the review.  First, an issue that must come up as well is that there are non-DEIS schools that form part of this project.  Some seem to think that if one is not in a DEIS schools, one does not have disadvantaged children.  I had a meeting with a number of people on Monday night last in my constituency office in Donnycarney and they emphasised that there is a constant stream of poor and disadvantaged pupils in non-DEIS schools.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that they are not excluded in the review and that the funding is not solely targeted at schools in a particular category.<\/p><p>  I have a feeling from the response from the Minister - I hope I am right - that deep down he knows that the school completion programme is a good programme.  It is important that we say so.  Representatives of one of the schools said to me on Monday night last that, because of the cuts to the programme, the school had to cut back its homework clubs, from four days to two days a week, which is having an adverse effect on the pupils and on their parents and guardians.  They also advised me that since the introduction of the programme in my constituency in 2002, the attendance figures have increased by over 8% and these cutbacks could undo all the good that has been done to date.  In this regard the Minister referred to a business plan.  Even though in one school attendance has increased by 8%, another school had been forced to let go its attendance officer and it can no longer pay for a teacher for in-school support.  These are the kind of real issues on the ground.<\/p><p>  I would like to see the reversal of the overall national 33% cut, but also that the Minister would look at it objectively and let the review group see that the project services 1,800 children in disadvantaged communities.  They need our support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000025#Y00300","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1418217000,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I echo the Deputy's sentiment that they need our support.  I fully subscribe to that.<\/p><p>  I will refer to the review for a moment because I think it is making people nervous and it should not.  It is being overseen by a steering committee involving officials of the Child and Family Agency, my Department and the Department of Education and Skills, and it is being carried out by the Economic Social Research Institute following a procurement process which was managed by the agency.  The review will seek to examine the programme and how it can best support an integrated approach to address early school leaving.  It will analyse the interventions provided and make recommendations for evidence informed supports designed to secure the best educational outcomes for young people.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed during the 2014-15 academic year.<\/p><p>  I note what Deputy McGrath stated about deprived children at risk in non-DEIS schools.  I am pleased to say that I was invited by Deputies Regina Doherty and Helen McEntee to visit Kells where we looked at one such school completion programme and I was impressed by what I saw.  There were young men and women who are interested in what they are learning in these situations around cooking, for which they fortunately have a Ballymaloe trained chef, and woodwork.  They have an excellent sculptor too.  It is important when we bring children back into the educational system that we make available subjects that are of interest to them and with which they can engage, and thereby also bring in the other issues around literacy and numeracy.<\/p><p>  This is an important scheme.  If I were to put it in one simple line, the review is about finding out what is working and transposing that across the entire scheme to ensure, as we are duty bound to, that the money we spend is achieving the best outcomes for the children we hope to serve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000025#Y00400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Safety","time":1418217000,"counter":344,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000025#Y00450"},{"type":"speech","time":1418217000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle selecting this important Topical Issue matter for debate.  The Minister will be aware that one of the national newspapers today highlighted the serious situation that Childline faces.  Childline is the only 24 hour free-of charge listening service of its kind and because it is in such a precarious financial position, for the first time since 1998 the voices of the most vulnerable children will be silenced.  There is a shortfall of &euro;1 million and if that is not found before the end of the year, the service risks being closed, from 3 p.m. to 8 a.m.<\/p><p>  This 24-hour service has been in place since 1998.  It provides an invaluable and critical service to children who are in distress and who may be suffering from abuse, fear and isolation.  The ISPCC estimates that 11% of the calls are received at night.  Some of the most harrowing tails are received at night time.  It is because of domestic arrangements that some of these calls can only be made at night.  If this service ceases, 45,000 calls will go unanswered in 2015.  These represent 45,000 children who are suffering from isolation, distress and perhaps abuse.  A range of issues will go unanswered.<\/p><p>  The Government pats itself on the back for initiating the children's referendum.  That constitutional amendment, which the people voted for, ensured the rights of the child were enshrined in the Constitution, ensured the voice of the child must be heard and ensured that the best interests of the child is of paramount consideration.  Childline is providing a service that the State is failing to provide.  We have no out-of-hours social work.  According to the ISPCC, up to October of this year, 74 cases have been referred on to the Garda and 38 cases have been referred to the Child and Family Agency.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach is on record pledging the protection of children as a national priority.  He stated that children are the most precious possession of all and that safeguarding their integrity and innocence must be a national priority.  Earlier this year, in March, the Minister's predecessor, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, launched Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 - 2020, which states, &quot;Our vision is for Ireland to be one of the best small countries in the world in which to grow up and raise a family, and where the rights of all children and young people are respected, protected and fulfilled; where their voices are heard and where they are supported to realise their maximum potential now and in the future&quot;.<\/p><p>  Childline survives primarily on the generosity of the people.  Unfortunately, because of scandals in CRC and Rehab, there has been a notable drop in contributions.  The State only contributes 5%.  I ask the Minister, in light of his overarching policy, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the key objective of which is providing a safe environment and protecting children from harm, and ensuring their voices are heard and supported, what funding he will ring-fence to ensure the protection, retention and expansion of this critical service, Childline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000025#Y00500","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1418217000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Troy for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity to clarify the Government's approach to the funding of ISPPC services, including Childline.  The Irish Society for the Protection of Cruelty to Children has a long history of service delivery and advocacy on behalf of children.  I acknowledge the work of the society over the years in providing support services to children and their families.<\/p><p>The ISPCC has indicated that its Childline service will have a shortfall of &euro;1.2 million by the end of this year.  The service currently operates on a 24-hour basis, but the ISPCC has stated that as a result of the shortfall in funding, the night-time service may have to be discontinued.<br\/><br\/>While the costs of the Childline service have always been met by ISPCC fundraising activities, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, funds the ISPCC in respect of core running costs and towards a number of projects on a regional basis.  The level of funding provided in 2014 is &euro;476,000.  Separately, my Department funds the ISPCC to provide the missing children's hotline, which takes calls in relation to any missing child, including from the general public, family members, or potentially, the missing child themselves.<br\/><br\/>Childline is a free, confidential service that can be accessed seven days a week, 365 days a year.  It was set up by the ISPCC in 1988.  The focus was changed from 1992 to an active listening service for all children and the service was extended to a 24-hour basis in 1998.  The Childline service is used by children who want to talk, rather than children with serious child welfare and protection issues and the overwhelming majority of calls, thankfully, do not relate to serious child welfare or protection concerns.<br\/><br\/>I have met with the ISPCC and I am aware that a fall in the level of public donations for Childline has created financial difficulties for the service.  The ISPCC informed me that it was embarking on a major fundraising campaign, and also that it would provide details of the nature and cost of the service.  I have asked officials in my Department to meet with the ISPCC, along with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to examine how best such a service can be provided to the greatest benefit of children.<br\/><br\/>The Government will continue to promote and support the welfare and protection of vulnerable children and families.  We are making significant improvements in this regard.  Key initiatives to date include the establishment of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, in June 2011; the establishment of the Child and Family Agency in January 2014; a proposal to which the Deputy alluded, to amend the Constitution to ensure that children's rights are strengthened was put to the people in a referendum in November 2012; and Better Outcomes: Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020<i>, <\/i>was published in April 2014.  It is Ireland's first overarching children and young people's policy framework which spans the age ranges from birth to 24 years.<br\/><br\/>In addition, there has been the introduction of a suite of child protection legislation, including the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act, 2012, the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the Children First Bill 2014.  The provisions of Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children in 2011 have been revised and updated.  The Children First Bill will put key elements of the Children First Guidance on a statutory footing.  Key provisions in this regard include introducing a mandatory requirement to report child welfare and protection concerns to Tusla, and to assist in investigation of such concerns if required.  Every organisation that provides services to children is required to develop a child safeguarding statement.  The Children First interdepartmental group will be put on a statutory footing.  The Children First Bill has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and Committee Stage will be scheduled early in 2015.<br\/><br\/>I assure Deputies that I am committed to ensuring children benefit to the greatest extent from every euro we spend.  In that context, I have asked my Department to meet again with the ISPCC and Tusla so that we can work towards a sustainable service focused on achieving the best possible outcomes for all our children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000025#Y00600","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418217600,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

At a time when we do not provide out-of-hours services for social workers, at a very minimum we should provide a service that children who need direct access and help can call.

Everyone is singing from the one hymn sheet, in the sense that we all believe that anything which could be done to make roads safer is a good thing.  There is no doubt in the recent past the behaviour of drivers on roads has changed for the better.  Unfortunately, in recent years, especially last year, the number of road fatalities has begun to creep up again.  That said, a very worrying development has also been taking place in recent years, whereby cases are being thrown out by the District Court in considerable numbers.<\/p><p>It is not exaggeration that since 2009, 1,393 cases involving GoSafe vans have been thrown out by District Courts.  The difficulty I have is that if the implementation of the speed detection system is to be seen to be fair and impartial and to be doing what it says on the tin, so to speak, then this should not be happening.  This year alone, 59 cases have been thrown out in Castlebar; 133 in Ennis; 71 in Gorey; 68 in Nenagh; 71 in Wexford, along with a whole clatter of others.  This culminated last week in a situation in a court in the Cavan-Monaghan area where the judge within his remit referred to the law being brought into disrepute.  This is a very serious situation.  I refer to the person who is informed by post that he or she has incurred penalty points and is fined - as happened to me in the recent past - and the person accepts the situation.  However, on the other hand, a person will say they did not receive the notice, the case will go to court and it is thrown out.  There is a massive unfairness built into this system which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p> Two problems arise, in my view.  Legitimately detected speeding offences are not being upheld by the system because the system is flawed massively, it seems.  In other cases, people will do the right thing; they will admit they broke the speed limit, they will take the penalty points and they will pay the fine.  Where do those people stand now?  What is the situation as regards the penalty points on their licences and the increase in the cost of insurance premiums as a result of having penalty points?<\/p><p> The penalty points system has been dogged by controversy in the recent past.  I refer in particular to the whistleblowers and the GoSafe vans.  The law needs to be seen to be impartial and blind to interference, be that from loopholes that one could drive a lorry through or interference from members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as was reported by whistleblowers.  The law must be seen to be fair.<\/p><p> Ultimately we must ensure the roads are safer and this system is an attempt to change people's behaviours.  However, people's behaviours will not change and they will probably get worse if they believe there is a way out of getting penalty points if all one needs to say is, &quot;Judge, I never received it&quot;.  I have no doubt that among the lists of District Court hearings there are legitimate reasons for non-receipt of penalty points.  However, I would be very dubious that the summonses, notices or letters issued to 1,393 people since 2009 just vanished into thin air or were at the bottom of a post bag and ended up in the Liffey.  I do not believe this to be the case and I do not think anyone believes it.  It is time this was fixed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000026#Z01100","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418218200,"counter":359,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  The Minister regrets that she is unable to be present as she is abroad on official business.  The Minister has asked that I emphasise that the initial decision to introduce outsourced safety cameras came after a number of years of detailed analysis and was identified as a key additional measure to reduce deaths and serious collisions on our roads.  I need not remind the Deputy that the Road Safety Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and many others working in the field of road safety, continue to emphasise the role played by speeding in serious collisions.  Excessive and inappropriate speed is the number one road safety concern.  The advice to the Minister is that in many instances, reducing speed by even a few kilometres per hour can made all the difference to the severity of a collision.<\/p><p>  It was against this background that GoSafe was awarded the contract to provide outsourced safety cameras in November 2009, following a tendering process.  Operations commenced in November 2010 and were supported by advertising and an awareness-raising campaign highlighting the life-saving objective of the cameras.<\/p><p>  The Minister wishes to clarify that GoSafe is paid according to the number of hours of surveys and monitoring.  The number of detections has no bearing on the payments made.  The service provided by GoSafe operates under the overall direction and oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including with respect to scheduling of speed monitoring, training and quality assurance.  Vans operate in defined speed enforcement zones, the location of which is in the public domain, including on the Garda website.  These zones were identified following an objective and evidence-based analysis of collision data and speed surveys.<\/p><p>  Compliance has increased across the zones since the network was introduced.  For example, between January 2011 and October 2013, compliance in 50 km\/h limit zones increased from 62% to 98%, while compliance in 80 km\/h zones increased to 96%.  The Garda authorities are reviewing the location of the zones on a continuous basis to ensure the cameras are located where they can have the most impact on safety.  All of the analysis carried out points to the conclusion that the safety cameras have saved lives and therefore bring very significant human and economic benefits.  Moreover, research carried out on behalf of the RSA earlier this year found that 81% of adults surveyed supported the use of safety cameras and 71% surveyed believe them to be effective in influencing motorists to drive more safely.  It is also important to bear in mind that the safety cameras free up Garda resources for other road safety enforcement, including more mobile operations, as well as carrying out alcohol checkpoints.<\/p><p>  The Minister is aware of the recent court cases in which GoSafe speeding detections have been dismissed.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for the Minister to comment on the outcome of specific cases before the courts.  She has, however, discussed the matter with the Garda authorities and understands that they are carefully studying the recent rulings and taking legal advice, including with respect to the possibility of seeking clarification from the higher courts.  This is being addressed by the Garda authorities as a matter of urgency and developments will be reported to the Minister.<\/p><p>  In so far as the question of reviewing the law is concerned, the legislation governing the operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of speed detection cameras and the use of outsource safety cameras, is contained in section 81 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, which comes under the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The advice from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, however, is that the recent court cases do not identify issues which would warrant amendment of the legislation.  I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and I will certainly communicate the points he has made to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000027#AA00200","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1418218200,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the discussions I have had with him on this matter.<\/p><p>  The reply from the Minister of State is fine in that it tells me everything I know about the speed detection system but that is not what I asked.  I refer to information from the Department.  In 2012, 111 cases were thrown out at Naas District Court.  This has nothing to do with what has happened in the past couple of weeks because it has been ongoing since 2009.  In 2012 alone, 936 cases were thrown out of court across the country.  It is not today or yesterday that this problem began.  The law as it is constructed is definitely not seen to be fair.  If a person can say in court that he or she did not receive the necessary documentation in the post, based on the figures I have given, the court will likely come down on the side of that person and decide that it was probably not received.  As a result, 1,393 cases since 2009 have been thrown out.  I do not know how this situation can be resolved.<\/p><p>  At a meeting of the transport committee this morning my proposal was accepted that both Departments as well the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and legal practitioners should come to the committee to discuss what is a fundamental issue of road safety and also an issue to do with the fairness of the law.  For example, I may have received three penalty points because I accepted the notice and the accompanying picture of my car as detected in County Limerick breaking the speed limit and I paid the fine, and the same notice was posted to another person who claimed in court he or she did not receive it and the case was thrown out.  There is a gross unfairness which must be resolved.  Penalty points are being attached to licences and insurance premiums are increased, and rightly so, but other people are getting off scot free.  This situation needs to be addressed.  I would like both Departments to co-operate on providing a more comprehensive answer.<\/p><p>  The advice from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that recent court cases do not identify issues that would warrant a change in the legislation.  The judge in Monaghan last week said the law was being brought into disrepute.  What more needs to be said from the bench of an independent court before something is done?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000027#AA00300","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1418218200,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution.

Deputy Peter Mathews has submitted this Topical Issue matter every day since 22 October and I want to acknowledge this.  It is unfortunate he will not have a chance to speak on it today.  Aer Lingus was a State company when these contracts were entered into and when current and deferred pensioners paid into the defined benefit pension scheme.  Today the Government has a 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus, so it has a moral duty of care in this respect.  What I have encountered from discussing this with pensioners who are on small meagre pensions is that it is the difference between survival and not.  It is a most serious issue.  It is taking bread from the table of families and older people, in particular in the city but in a wider area also.<\/p><p>  Pensioners have been abandoned by Aer Lingus, the DAA and the trade union involved, Impact.  It is outrageous that pensioners were excluded from a decision-making process which affected their pensions.  Others voted to benefit themselves while excluding those who would take the hit.  A total of 70% of Aer Lingus current employees voted to cut pensioners' annual income, starting in January 2015.  This is completely out of kilter with any sense of justice or fairness.  In other unions, such as teachers' unions, retired members have just as much influence as and an equal say to those in current employment.  It beggars belief that this has happened.<\/p><p>  A total of &euro;175 million of the pensioners' defined benefit pension saving fund was redirected without their permission or consent.  They were not even consulted.  Various figures are circulating, but at least 5,000 retired people are involved and at least 5,000 deferred pensioners and possibly more.  It was a unilateral decision which did not involve any consultation, and it was completely unfair.  Pensioners themselves had no involvement whatsoever in any of the resolution of the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IASS, deficit negotiations which led to this decision on cutting their income.  They are the only group of members of the IASS pension scheme to whom the employers, namely, Aer Lingus and the DAA, decided not to provide any compensation to mitigate against this cut in their yearly pension.<\/p><p>  This is all at a time when the Aer Lingus share price is rising.  What is most reprehensible is that the price of Aer Lingus shares rose fairly substantially when ICTU told the company the ballot had resulted in a 70% vote in favour.  This had a direct impact on the value of shares in Aer Lingus, which is extraordinary.<\/p><p>  A 10% cut may be perceived to be minor or negligible in some people's minds, but to low income pensioners it is substantial.  I could read some of the e-mails and letters I have received.  The matter has already been raised in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Clare Daly and others.

I know other colleagues have sought to have it selected.  In responding to the points I will begin by stating I am deeply aware of the impact of the proposed changes on many people.  I have met them and read a huge amount of correspondence from them.  I have heard at first hand the personal consequences of this crisis for them and their prospects for the future.  The plight they face and the scale of difficulties present in the fund weigh heavily on me.<\/p><p>  In framing my response to the Deputy, I want to begin by emphasising a number of points on where it stands at present.  Legal responsibility, and responsibility with regard to resolving this great difficulty, is primarily a matter for the trustees, the company, the scheme members and the Pensions Authority.  The Deputy did not touch on the scale of difficulty in the fund, but I am sure she is aware of it.  In 2011 the deficit for the fund, which is the largest fund of its kind in our country, was &euro;344 million.  In March 2013 it was &euro;769 million in deficit.  I understand that at present the deficit is approximately between &euro;700 million and &euro;750 million, with the potential to affect up to 15,000 members.<\/p><p>  I have thoroughly investigated where it stands legislatively.  Based on the minimum funding standard available from the IASS actuaries in December 2013, the estimated coverage for deferred as well as active members' benefits is approximately 24% to 31%.  This is what people would have claim to in the pension fund.  This takes direct account of the 2013 pensions legislation allowing reductions to be made in pension payments.  I completely understand the initial level of pensions which many people have at present is modest after many years of work.  This pension fund, which sources pension payments, now has a deficit which we estimate to be between &euro;700 million and &euro;750 million.<\/p><p>  With regard to the process the Deputy described, an expert panel was established.  As a result of this process the total contribution proposed by the employers aimed at resolving the difficulties now amounts to &euro;260 million.  With regard to the point made by the Deputy on the lack of a share of this additional money for deferred pensioners, it is an increase of &euro;20 million on what was proposed by the original employers, in addition to the &euro;40 million already there, bringing the proposed amount to be available to deferred pensioners to &euro;60 million.  On Friday, 14 November, the trustee sought approval from the Pensions Authority for a funding proposal and requested me to commence provisions to facilitate implementation if approved.  The trustees confirmed they believed this was in the best interests of the fund.  This was also the view of the expert panel.<\/p><p>Having considered this and reflecting on all the issues involved in such a significant deficit, I signed the order.  Had I not signed the order - this was done with the support of Government - it would have posed an unquantifiable risk to the entire scheme, which would have had profoundly serious implications for all members of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000028#BB00500","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418219400,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Are any of the trustees beneficiaries of the deferred scheme?

However, it seems very unwilling to deal with the problem.  The Government has not pursued that issue.  I am conscious that this is recently on the Minister's watch.  He has drawn attention to the fact that the deficit increased substantially from &euro;344 million to &euro;769 million between early 2011 and March 2013, which was under the watch of this Government.  The Taoiseach made some extraordinary comments on the matter in the D&aacute;il in recent weeks.  He said that the issue had dragged on for years and had been allowed to drift.  However, he did not seem to assume any responsibility for that or provide any solutions.  I am afraid that what the trustees recommended to the Minister in November does not offer a solution.<\/p><p>  We are aware of the water protest outside the gates of Leinster House today.  People are protesting for different reasons - many because they cannot pay and many others not for that reason but because they are frustrated over how the Irish Water quango was established.

Nearly four years of work has gone into trying to come up with a resolution to this difficulty.  Nearly every labour body or institution of the State has been involved in it.  Various difficulties led to the appointment of a group of people who were charged with trying to resolve the issue.  An expert panel was appointed to try to do it.

Some people have suggested that I, having received a communication from the people whose job it is to run the fund that has a deficit of this magnitude, should not do what they believed was in the best interest of the fund.  I took this very seriously.  I considered all the consequences of what could happen if this resolution could not be delivered.  Given all that had happened up to this point, I made the strong judgment that all the alternatives that were facing the fund were considerably worse than what is being faced at the moment.  For those reasons I made the decision to enact the legislation that had been introduced because I had to respond to what the trustees of the fund were recommending.  I looked at all the other options and consequences for everybody.

I welcome the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who is taking the Chair.  These amendments are driven by what is happening to the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, which is affecting airport workers both past and present.  The central problem is that the IAS scheme is in the region of &euro;720 million in deficit.  I am reliably informed that if the scheme were wound up now, without any resolution on the table, each beneficiary of the scheme would receive approximately 5% of their entitlement.  This incredible deficit is a result of the companies abusing the scheme over many years.  The scheme was used as a slush fund to get people out of the companies, in actions which could possibly have been outside the law.  It was a flagrant abuse of the scheme and the result has left workers, both past and present, in a desperate situation.  The trustees of the scheme in particular have really let down the beneficiaries by allowing it to be abused to the point of massive deficit.<\/p><p>  There is a proposal on the table for the beneficiaries which would mean winding up the existing scheme and setting up a new defined contribution scheme.  This would see the three groups within the scheme face a level of cuts which vary depending on their standing within the IAS scheme.  There are three categories of beneficiary: active workers, retired members, and deferred members, which are those who have left the company but have not yet reached retirement age.  Each group of beneficiary is facing a cut in their pension entitlement and it would be fair to say that each group would see the cause and solution to their situation in different ways.<\/p><p>  The active members are due to take a 10% cut, with retired members in line to take cuts ranging from 1% to 20%, and with deferred members in line to take cuts of up to 60%.  The disproportionate level of pain for the deferred members is the result of a complex set of circumstances.  However, this does not mask the fact that the deferred members have cause to be especially aggrieved by these cuts.  The active workers I have spoken to see this matter as an industrial relations dispute, and they have enacted an industrial relations response through their unions.  Retired members see the source of their change in fortunes in the 2013 social welfare legislation which created the law allowing schemes in deficit to include retired members to burden share in order to move schemes out of deficit or when winding up.  It was then up to trustees of the scheme to make a decision based on their legal requirement to treat all members equitably.  The trustees of this scheme have included cuts to retired members in the winding up proposal for the IAS scheme.<\/p><p>  Deferred members feel they are victims of the passing of the 2009 social welfare legislation by the previous Government, which moved the deferred members out of the protections provided to retired members and into the same grouping as the active members.  Deferred members are seeking a legislative amendment to place them back within the level of protections which are still afforded to retired members.  Some of those amendments are before the House today.<\/p><p>  Over the course of this year, I have been working with my colleagues in the Labour Party, from Dublin to Clare, to pursue any possible solution to the matter of the disproportionate hit taken by the deferred members.  The Minister will attest to our persistent efforts to find a solution and the various meetings that took place.  Through our representations, it has become clear that the one bottom line on this matter is that further money will be required to resolve it in a more equitable manner, but where does the money come from?  The companies would argue that they have already provided funds towards a solution in winding up the scheme and setting up the new defined contribution scheme.  This is despite shareholder resistance, in particular from one notable shareholder which did not want to give any money towards a new pension scheme.  The companies are reportedly adamant that there will be no more money put into it.  With no legal requirement that the companies provide any funds at all and the message from the companies that they have already gone as far as they are willing to go, there is uncertainty as to what would happen if the existing proposal on the table was revisited.<\/p><p>  If these amendments were to be accepted or passed today, would the trustees be required to share the burden again to make fair the injustice of what has happened to deferred members?  What would happen then?  Deferred members could achieve further equity, but without more cash the equity would have to come from existing money within the resolution proposal.  Aer Lingus workers have already voted in favour of the proposal, so the consequence would be a nullification of that vote and a return to the company to seek a further distribution of funds.  I presume that if this were on the table, the active workers would go back to the company and look for more money, similar to what they would lose in a redistribution.  How would the company respond to such a move?  It is unknown but, given the position the company has taken in the recent past, it is not unreasonable to assume that the company would disregard such a move and play hardball.  Would the active members then threaten industrial action?  Would this threat work?  Would the pressure force the company to provide more money?  Would the active members take industrial action?  Would this achieve their objectives?  If not, and if the amendment ensured that the existing funds be further redistributed among the three groupings, would the active members then replace the deferred members as the most aggrieved group?  The question then is whether the State should contribute funds towards the resolution of this dispute.<\/p><p>  I am firmly of the view that the State should be strongly active in pushing the companies to provide more funds for the deferred members from outside the current resolution proposals and I believe more time should have been given to try to achieve this.  We have reliably been informed that the sum it would take to resolve the matter is approximately &euro;50 million.  In the context of the cash reserves within the companies, this is not an extraordinary amount of money.  It is possible that, with negotiation, a lower sum might have been acceptable.  There is a moral obligation on the companies to act on this matter and provide some solution.  For too long they used the pension pot as a slush fund to achieve efficiencies and entice workers out of the companies.  They should not get away with it.  They have the money to resolve this.  The trustees should also be called to account for their lack of action.<\/p><p>  There is a lot of uncertainty and many questions for which we do not know the answers.  There are roads which could be taken which are risky and none of us knows the ramifications of taking such choices.  The deferred members are taking a disproportionate hit and I believe it is incumbent on the companies to find further funds to address this injustice.  It is incumbent upon the State to push the companies to find such a resolution.  I look forward to the Minister's response to these amendments and to the issues I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000030#DD01200","speaker":"1013"},{"type":"speech","time":1418220000,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I speak in support of amendment No. 20 which has been tabled by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.

I knew their story but hearing it again from their own mouths was shocking.  An appeals process is necessary for these people.  Deferred members of defined benefit schemes are particularly vulnerable, given their exclusion from the industrial relations process and the fact that the current legislation offers grossly inadequate protection.  These issues have been raised repeatedly with the responsible Minister, Deputy Burton, over recent years.<\/p><p>  I have also raised them with the current and previous Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.

The Minister must now introduce fairer protections for defined benefit scheme members.<\/p><p>  This amendment has been allowed through, but other amendments on this issue have been conveniently rejected by the Government and thus prevented from ever being considered.<\/p><p>In addition to amendment No. 20, Sinn F&eacute;in also submitted a further amendment to ensure deferred members are not impacted disproportionately in any scheme restructuring with an associated appeals mechanism and to enable participation of representatives of deferred members in such appeals.  Members of defined benefit pensions have been left vulnerable by this Government and people fear their entire pension could be wiped out, despite the fact they did everything they were meant to do.<\/p><p> The Minister may have rejected our amendments but I call on her to review them and take inspiration from them in resolving this problem through the Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in previously outlined the priority order that must be introduced for restructuring of defined benefit schemes that are in deficit.  I will restate them.  First, a PRSI contributions record sufficient to ensure eligibility for the full State pension should be purchased from the Social Insurance Fund for every scheme member who has not attained such a record.  Second, provision should be made for 100% of pensioners' benefits below &euro;12,000, excluding post-retirement increases.  Third, active and deferred members under 55 should have disbursed to them the lower of 50% or &euro;6,000 of benefits, or if they are over 55, they should have disbursed to them the lower of 75% or &euro;9,000, excluding post-retirement increases.  Fourth, there is a suggestion regarding 75% of pensioner benefits exceeding the initial &euro;12,000 up to a maximum of &euro;30,000, excluding post-retirement increases.  Finally, 75% of active and deferred member benefits exceeding the initial sum up to a maximum of &euro;30,000, excluding post-retirement increases, should be the fifth round, as it were, with the sixth round entailing the remaining benefits for pensioners, excluding post-retirement increases.  The seventh round would entail active and deferred member remaining benefits, with the eighth round relating to the remaining pensioners and active and deferred members.<\/p><p> This is about treating deferred members fairly and striving to honour the plans they signed up to and lived up to.  It is simply not good enough that bad management of these schemes will leave these members in the lurch, with no way of supporting themselves.  I ask the Minister to support the amendment and examine the other Sinn F&eacute;in amendments relating to deferred members again.<\/p><p> Aer Lingus is a profit-making company and before it was partly privatised, it was a State-run organisation.  Many of these deferred members were part of the pension scheme when the company was State-owned.  Deferred members are taking the biggest hit with this and it is clear from conversations that I and the Minister have had with deferred members and their representatives that this does not seem right.  Many people put money into a pension pot for ten, 20 or 30 years but they are now being pulverised.  That is not good enough and the State has a responsibility in this matter.  We are repeatedly told that the trustees should take the blame and the expert panel made the recommendations.  There is scope to put more money into the pension pot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000030#DD01300","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418220600,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending.  Everything is interrelated on the Government books.  There are off-balance sheet items in the water debate that is expressing itself on the streets outside and now there are 15,000 former employees of a semi-State airline and related businesses who would not have had a problem if they had been full State employees because they would have had a State pension, which is paid from the Central Fund.  However, there was a separate pension fund outside the pure State arrangements.  When interest rates fall, it benefits the Government and central funding of the country but it is to the disadvantage of pensioners, whether they are existing or deferred pensioners or current employees.  This is because one would require more funding to pay the same income level of pensions when interest rates fall.  That is the reason the pension deficit went from &euro;344 million in 2011 to &euro;769 million in March 2013, as indicated by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe.  Equities, if they are in the pension fund, will have grown rather than collapsed in that time but the near-cash equivalents - or bonds - have fallen.  More of this would hence be required to have a flow in order to pay pensions.<br\/><br\/>Within this interrelated picture, the Government boasts daily to people in newspapers that the cost of the national debt is falling, thanks to the efforts of the public that is being squeezed, hurt, crunched and steamrolled.  That is why more than 80,000 people are on Merrion Square and the other side of the campus.  We must be fair and the Minister cannot have her cake and eat it.  It is wrong that we are getting e-mails such as that described by Deputies Creighton and Ryan.  After 40 years of reasonable expectation and staff cost rationalisation within that time, it is wrong that these people are beaten up and told that the pensions are only worth half or even 25% of what they could reasonably have expected.  There is something going very wrong amid the smoke and mirrors of the accounting.<br\/><br\/>The Minister is an accountant and will understand these questions.  Is there a deferred member trustee or a fully retired member trustee?  Are there a few of them?  Is there a current employee among the trustees?  These actuarial experts push things around like trolleys on wheels and then send out fee notes plus VAT at 23% in any event.  We need skin in the game, as they say, and that will be when we can get good trustee management and people who understand the issue.  It is not rocket science and one day of coaching would teach anybody how to be a trustee.  If there is difficulty in understanding, I will do the work <i>pro bono<\/i>.  There is too much jargon and too many multi-syllable words.  There are too many lever-arch or ordinary files with too much fudge.  It is clearly wrong that 15,000 people are being messed around as they are.  The Government must come clean, be fully transparent and spell out exactly what are the intentions.  Even if there is a bit of a deficit that is objectively extraneous to the understanding and capabilities of people inside the black box, one might say there is a shortfall of 10% or 15%; that can be shared fairly, with a simple explanation of what is happening.<br\/><br\/>There are people going around with metaphorical bits of string, Sellotape, blindfolds, smoke and mirrors in labyrinthine corridors.  That does not do it for me.  One could put the plight of these 15,000 people on a wall and show the age profiles by decile, along with who contributed the different amounts.  We should remember that there were employee contributions and they did not all come from employers.  There was rationalisation and people were told that there had to be improvements in operating results, profit-and-loss accounts and balance sheets.  When elements are moved off balance sheet, what were employees are changed to deferred pensioners.  That goes off the balance sheet and profit-and-loss accounts into the trustee balance sheet and actuarial funding equations.<br\/><br\/>It is smoke and mirrors.  It is a practice we must put a stop to.  We can start doing so by taking the iron-clad brake of the whip system from the Government parties.  It already has a majority, so does it not trust itself to be able to debate the pros and cons of aspects of legislation needed for the circumstances in which the country finds itself?<\/p><p>Unemployment is down by 100,000 and jobs are up by 81,000 but what about the 500,000 who have emigrated?  Somebody said to me last Friday that the rate of unemployment is falling but I said my second son is not in that statistic.  We just saw him off earlier this morning for two years.  That is the second one.  The atmosphere here is not even good for people of that age.  They are asked to fill out an income tax form 11, which is 23 pages.  God almighty.  It is a simple thing.  Where is the simplicity?  Even with property tax and water charges, a new bureaucracy is born.

Deputy Brendan Ryan went into the same area, so I will address those two points.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the actions of the trustees of the Irish Airlines Superannuation Scheme, the Pensions Authority has the power under section 18 of the Pensions Act 1990 to investigate the state or conduct of a pension scheme.  The Pensions Authority has wide-reaching powers of investigations in regard to trustees.  Under section 18 of the Pensions Act, the authority may authorise in writing such and so many persons it considers necessary to be authorised persons to inspect or to investigate on its behalf the state and conduct of an occupational pension scheme.  For clarity, I wanted to say that in regard to Deputy Ryan's comments.<br\/><br\/>The powers conferred on the authority by section 18 of the Act are extensive.  They include the power to require persons to provide such information, explanation and documents as may be specified in a notice to enter premises for the purposes of inspecting, copying and-or removing books, documents and records and the power to obtain a warrant from the District Court in respect of entering upon a person's private dwelling.<br\/><br\/>Section 18(5) makes it an offence for a person <i>inter alia <\/i>to obstruct willfully an authorised person in the exercise of his or her powers and the penalties attaching to that and the power of the authority to conduct an investigation under section 18.

It gives first priority to awarding the full State pension.  The pension fund legislation deals with the distribution of the occupational defined benefit pension scheme funds.  There is actually no direct connection between the contributions made to benefits received from an occupational defined benefit scheme in the private sector and an actual payment of a State pension.  I said previously that the provisions contained in section 48 of the Pensions Act, which set out how the assets of a scheme are distributed and the wind up of a scheme, have no impact on any entitlement to the State pension or the PRSI contributory system.  The contributory principle, where there is a direct link between social insurance contributions made and resulting entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions that are payable as a right, is an underlying feature of principle of Ireland's pay related social insurance system.<\/p><p>  The State pension contributory is paid from the Social Insurance Fund to any individual from the age of 66 who meets the qualifying criteria and has sufficient contribution.

Broughan and Clare Daly.  They broadly entail placing a debt or obligation on employers to secure or guarantee a level of scheme funding, changing the manner in which the assets of the pension scheme are distributed in the event of the wind-up of a pension scheme and provision of an appeals mechanism for scheme members where trustees have decided upon reduced benefits for members.  Defined benefit pension schemes in Ireland are set up and maintained by employers on a voluntary basis.  There has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to their pension scheme.  Rather, when a defined benefit scheme is set up, the level of employer and employee contributions is agreed and established in contract in each scheme&rsquo;s trust deeds and rules.  The trust deeds and rules differ from scheme to scheme, as I am sure Deputy Mathews is well aware.  As with any contractual situation, they reflect the parameters on the level of obligation of the parties involved.  This is an issue which has been considered on several occasions over the past decade.<br\/><br\/>The funding standard expert group of the Pensions Authority recommended against the introduction of a debt on employers in 2004 and 2005.  They saw it as introducing a retrospective cost on employers and feared that it would undermine the voluntary basis on which defined benefit schemes were set up.  The Green Paper on pensions, which was published in 2007 by the previous Government, considered &quot;debt on employer&quot; and referred to the recommendations of the Pensions Authority in 2004 and 2005.  Following the public consultation process on the Green Paper, the national pensions framework was published by the previous Government in 2010 and did not include any provision for a debt on the employer.  While the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, review of the Irish pensions system, which was published last year, considered the issue of the debt on the employer, its findings are not prescriptive.  In tabling its views the OECD advised:<blockquote>In considering these alternatives, it should be kept in mind that each of the national schemes and reforms discussed was adopted in a specific national economic, social and political setting.  There is no blueprint for reform which Ireland could take off-the-shelf and implement directly.  Any solution has to fit the Irish situation.<\/blockquote>A debt on an employer would require employers to account for any deficit in the pension scheme in its annual accounts following changes to accounting requirements as set out in financial reporting standard, FRS, 17.  Notwithstanding the outcome of previous considerations of this issue, very serious consideration was given in developing the measures contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013 to imposing a statutory obligation on employers to secure scheme level funding.  I recall having very detailed discussions on this with quite a few people present in the House here today.<br\/><br\/>Internationally, the structures needed to administer such arrangements are complex and costly.  It has resulted in increased and detailed State involvement in sponsoring employers&rsquo; business decisions.  Given the very small proportion of defined benefit schemes in Ireland, linked to employers who have a credit rating or other reliably accurate and consistent measure of solvency, it is not the case that a workable &quot;anti-avoidance framework&quot; to &quot;selectively apply&quot; a debt on an employer is easily achievable.<br\/><br\/>I suggested previously that many schemes are making great efforts to ensure their ongoing viability.  Many have been very successful in doing that.  Employers and members have often made significant financial contributions over and above those required by their particular trust rules.  This process is generally managed through dialogue between trustees, employers and members where efforts are made to reach agreement regarding the steps that have to be taken to secure scheme viability, which may include a mixture of measures such as those outlined in several contributions today.<br\/><br\/>I do not propose to accept the amendments put forward but in response to the points raised by Deputy Ryan and just as we were finishing on the previous day by Deputy Clare Daly, I want to draw attention to the powers of the Pensions Authority in respect of the matters they raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000033#GG00500","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1418221800,"counter":422,"content":"<p>The strength of feeling expressed last week and here today about the myriad problems arising in respect of current employees and current and deferred benefit pensioners within the IASS highlights and underlines the hotch potch of policy underpinning pension policy in this country.

It has been estimated that some 80% of that &euro;3 billion in tax expenditure has been to the benefit of 20% of the highest earners in this country.  That is at the root of all the problems associated with pensions here.  We have a pensions policy that is highly inequitable, very expensive and benefits the better off.

The Government should have made a better and more strenuous effort to sort out this problem before the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport rushed out to sign the order and thereby consign these people to their fates.

That would protect the workers and the future deferred pensioners, etc.  We are also saying there should be an appeal mechanism for the trustees.  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned that the matter can be referred to the Pensions Authority.  Did she refer this matter to the authority?  How many of these cases have been referred to the authority?  I believe the authority will not consider these cases other than in the most extreme circumstances.  In light of all the stories in the public domain about the mismanagement of pension funds by trustees in this case, not to mention all the allegations about conflicts of interest, etc., I am at a loss to know why the T&aacute;naiste did not refer the conduct of those trustees to the authority.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to give the House an assurance that the Government will bring these matters to the attention of the Pensions Authority immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000033#GG00700","speaker":"1059","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418222400,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I found the T&aacute;naiste's response wholly inadequate.  We have to restate the background to this matter.  I refer to the imminent erosion of the living standards of existing pensioners and the threat that the same thing will happen to deferred pensioners and present members of the scheme in the future.  The Government has attempted to portray this as a problem of the trustees, the company and the members.  There has been a suggestion that it has nothing to do with the Government itself.  That is completely wrong.  The trustees adopted a \"freeze and de-risk \" strategy at the behest of the employers.  We should remember that one of these employers - the Dublin Aviation Authority - is 100% owned by the State.  At key times in the history of Aer Lingus, it was  fully owned by the State.  It is still 25% owned by the State.  We have an ability to curtail the antics of these companies.  That is what these amendments seek to do.<\/p><p>  Deputy Ryan suggested that the companies have abdicated their responsibilities.  He claimed they have acted outside the law.  If that is the case, the behaviour of the companies has profound implications.  In such circumstances, why has the Deputy not referred the matter to the Garda?  If he really believed it was the case that the companies are responsible, he would be supporting these amendments, which seek to ensure solvent companies that have a responsibility live up to that responsibility.  These issues should have been examined before the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport signed the order.<\/p><p>  I noted the T&aacute;naiste's comments about the powers of the Pensions Authority.  I fully intend to pass information I have about certain antics in this scheme to the Pensions Authority, which has been in contact with me.  Against that background, surely the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport would have waited before he signed the order and surely we have a responsibility now to implement these amendments, which would seek to curtail the antics of companies, one of which is meeting as we speak.  The vote is probably over now.  I refer to the Aer Lingus extraordinary general meeting, which was on at 2 o'clock.  I do not doubt that it has sealed its approval for this measure.  This is the 11th hour.

The Government promised to reform it but is has backed off on those reforms.  We saw that happening last year.  The Labour Party element of the Government, in particular, promised to introduce serious reform, but the Government has backed off on that.  The pension levy was increased as a direct result of the shortfall in the funding that was expected to be raised from pension changes.  Many people on very small private pensions have been paying a pension levy of 0.6%.  This makes a huge difference to their pension benefits.  The shortfall I mentioned, which resulted from the Government's failure to introduce the promised reforms last year, meant that the pension levy had to be hiked up by a further 0.15% for this year and next year.  That is further compounding the unfairness of the pensions regime.<\/p><p>  The other major pensions problem in this country is the regulatory framework that surrounds pensions.  As a result of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009, which made provision for the priorities in pension schemes to be reordered, existing pensioners - those who are in payment - stand to lose between 10% and 20% of their pensions.  Rather than addressing this issue by making savings at the top end, where vast pension pots are being subsidised by everybody in this country, we are overseeing a situation in which people on small private pensions are losing substantial portions of those pensions.  The Act that was introduced in 2009 by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government gives the green light to solvent companies to walk away from their pension commitments.  The current Government cannot explain its position by referring to what its predecessor did because the provision in question was copperfastened in December of last year by the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013.  The Government is telling companies that have very healthy balance sheets, are doing very well and have very strong outlooks for the future that it is happy for them to walk away from their pension commitments and the undertakings they gave to their workers and pensioners.<\/p><p> I regret the T&aacute;naiste is not in the Chamber, but I must pose my next question anyway.  On what basis does the Government believe it is acceptable for a solvent company to walk away from its pension commitments, other than being prepared to abandon workers and pensioners who understood they had certain rights?  The Government is saying it is okay to forget about them because it will not hold the companies to their commitments.  It is an incredible position for the Government to adopt, especially its Labour element.<\/p><p> Earlier, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, spoke about feeling the pensioners' pain.  That kind of bleeding heart stuff is of no benefit to those who are affected.  The Minister and the T&aacute;naiste assert that, somehow, everything is someone else's fault and has nothing to do with them.  An attempt is being made by Ministers to hide behind the trustees of the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IASS, and to claim the latter are at fault.  Whatever about this applying in a private company that is far removed from the Government, the Government should set a good example in this case and set down a protective framework for what is a basic element of a worker's rights, namely, the right to a decent pension, especially after having paid into that pension for 35, 40 or more years.  This is the situation obtaining with the IASS.<\/p><p> In spite of having owned Aer Lingus until its privatisation and still possessing a 25% shareholding in same and despite the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, being a semi-State commercial company, the Government has refused to play any role in this debacle, leaving it to the company and the trustees as if the situation had nothing to do with it.  The Government has the power to act.  It should have told the companies that it was not acceptable for companies that were solvent and doing well to renege on their commitments to their pensioners and employees.  The Government should have stated clearly that a company in State ownership should not behave in that way and undermine workers and pensioners' rights.  We need the Government to show leadership, not to hide behind the trustees or companies.<\/p><p> There was a protest outside Aer Lingus's EGM this afternoon, particularly by aggrieved deferred pensioners.  Can the House imagine if public sector workers, for example teachers, were told that, from today on, they would lose between 40% and 60% of their pensions?  Whatever about the protests on the streets today, they would be far larger if an arbitrary decision was taken to slash pensions without any notice or justification.  There would be uproar, but that is effectively what the Government is supporting the companies in doing.  Having paid into pension schemes and received written contracts and undertakings when they took early retirement packages, people had a legitimate expectation of having their pension benefits preserved, yet the Government is now saying it is okay for State companies to renege on those undertakings.  This is not acceptable by any standard.<\/p><p> It was wholly inadequate of the T&aacute;naiste to tell Deputy Clare Daly to bring the serious issues that she raised last week to the Pensions Authority.  Serious allegations had been made.  The T&aacute;naiste has had a week to look into, verify and take action on them.  It is disappointing that she has done nothing.  She has passed the buck and told Deputy Clare Daly to do something if she knows about it.  When the Deputy brought the matter to the T&aacute;naiste last week, the latter should have acted on it.  This is just more washing of hands.<\/p><p> The first amendment in this group requires a full review to be carried out of the implications for the public purse of current Government policy on private pension schemes.  If we are telling companies that it is okay for them to renege on their pension commitments, it will have implications for the State's non-contributory pension.  The State seems to be saying that it is okay for private companies to do this and that the State will pick up the tab if people end up claiming non-contributory pensions.  We need to review this, as it is not acceptable.<\/p><p> Under the principal amendment in the group, a company would not be allowed to close a pension scheme unless it had met 90% of the funding standard.  By right, a scheme should meet 100%, given people's contracts, but 90% is a reasonable standard.  No company that is solvent and trading successfully should be allowed to close a scheme without ensuring that its members get 90% of what they were promised.<\/p><p> Another amendment relates to an appeals mechanism.  Many decisions have been taken arbitrarily, with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, signing the order on foot of the expert panel's recommendations.  Although he stated that he understood how deeply worried people were, he failed to take any action to address the inequality that was being delivered to people.<\/p><p> What the Government is doing with the IASS means that, while its existing pensioners stand to lose out, its deferred pensioners in particular stand to lose a significant amount of what they understood were their retirement benefits.  The Minister of State and anyone with any sense know that it is wrong and unfair to treat people in this way.  That the Government, a central player, believes it to be all right to sing dumb when people's rights are clearly being trampled is beyond understanding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000034#HH01400","speaker":"1178","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418223000,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000035#JJ00200","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1418223000,"counter":440,"content":"<p>In spite of the sympathetic noises from the ministerial benches and backbenches, if people believe in the rights of the workers involved in the IASS, they should stand up for them and support this amendment, which would ensure those rights were upheld.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000035#JJ00300","speaker":"1178"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418223000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1418223000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 19 has already been discussed with amendment No. 18.

I love these Standing Orders; they are great.  This gets to the heart of the issues concerning the sharing of the pain and the impact on pensioners' living standards.  The problem is that we, particularly Government Deputies, have put forward the idea that there is a problem with the scheme as if it were somehow preordained or beyond our control.  The issues we have raised have not been dealt with and there has been no answer to a question as to why there is a problem with the funding of the scheme.  On the one hand, the problems relate to the antics of the company which allows people to leave.  Those concerned invested in the pension scheme when they left but new employees got to join a different pension scheme, a defined contribution scheme.  If no new staff are coming in and replenishing the funds in the IAS scheme, there is clearly an actuarial problem.  The decision in this regard was made when the company was in State ownership.  The issues and problems with the trustees have been mentioned.  This absolutely must be investigated.<\/p><p>  There has been talk about the vote at the EGM in terms of Aer Lingus.  However, I do not believe we have focused sufficiently on the DAA side at all.  Many of the Aer Lingus staff who voted on the system were not members of the pension scheme at all.  They were members of SIPTU but not of the IAS scheme, yet existing pensioners and deferred pensioners were denied a voice in the same process.  Despite this, the Government has sought to rely on the expert panel report to justify some of the cuts being made.  These amendments are seeking to change the order to protect and minimise the impact of the cuts on the various pensioner groups.  They are a necessity if pensioners' living standards are to be protected.<\/p><p>  There has not been enough discussion on the DAA side of the equation.  The DAA is getting half the amount that Aer Lingus members are getting in terms of an investment to solve the problem with the scheme.  However, the DAA also has significant legal problems with the way in which it put forward the idea on the Aer Rianta supplemental superannuation scheme, which it believed it would be able to wind up as part of the proposal.  Now, however, it has been told it actually has to freeze it.  The point I am trying to make is that there is no acceptance of the expert panel's proposal and the solutions put forward by any of the members' unions in the DAA at the moment.  Therefore, there is not an agreement, leaving aside the points on the existing pensioner groups who did not have a voice in the first place.<\/p><p>  Let me put this in context.  What we are talking about doing is protecting people from draconian cuts and changing the order.  Let me deal with an e-mail I was sent by a constituent.  The constituent was responding to information I got for him from the Minister for Finance on income tax paid and how that income tax affects various groups.  The point he was making is that the tax burden is markedly benign as income rises over &euro;150,000.  He referred to a group of people who earn over &euro;11 billion between them, suggesting no income group earning above &euro;100,000, up to multiple millions of euro, pays more than an additional 4.7% in the euro.  As income rises, therefore, we have a very regressive tax scheme.  The constituent made the point that he worked for Aer Lingus for 40 years and that when the Government was the sole or majority shareholder and employer, the Minister's contribution to the defined benefit underfunding crisis was actually to damage further the fund with a levy that reduces it and pensioners' entitlements accordingly.  Obviously, the vote at the EGM that took place today was to try to reduce that even further.  Pensioners were excluded from the process and the communication roadshow that took place on the schemes.  They were completely and utterly excluded from the expert panel.<\/p><p>No moneys have been put in to defray the costs from them.  They are the only group, in that &euro;175 million of their pension capital is being taken from them.  This represents a six-week cut in their income from the start of next year.  Of course, they have no right to bring these issues to the Labour Court or anywhere else.  Therefore, they need us here to protect them and to bring in measures that prevent their income and living standards being dropped below a certain level.  That is why we tabled these aspects of the amendments.  They are critically important if we are not merely to be giving sympathy to, and shedding crocodile tears for, those who are in that boat.  It is within our power to deal with this and cushion the blow, and we should do so.  Otherwise, it is completely reprehensible.  There is a misunderstanding that deferred pensioners are persons who went off, built a career in a different employment and were able to get pension entitlements through that; they are not.  This group, and some of the staff involved, gave decades of service to Aer Lingus and are being harder hit as a result, and they need measures put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000038#MM01100","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418225100,"counter":483,"content":"<p>We had a discussion on priority orders last year when we were discussing double insolvencies and the change to how defined benefit should be viewed.  We did not have a long enough debate on it in terms of the Mercer report which outlined at the time the various different strategies around how to create a priority order.  The Mercer report, which the Minister had, was made available a week or at most two weeks before we started the discussion into something as detailed as this.<\/p><p>  Even though there are different parameters here, the existing guideline of the priority order is what most look to.  It is indicative of the way one, in this case, the IASS, should go.  That does not make it right.  If we had all of the information that we now have via the IASS, just as if we had all of the information on Waterford Wedgwood, perhaps we would have come up with a different priority order or we might at least have argued from this side of the House for a substantially different priority order.  I did so.  I submitted amendments which technically would have been grouped with these amendments if they had been allowed, but the restrictions on Opposition Deputies, or maybe all Deputies other than Ministers, in tabling amendments which are a charge on the Exchequer or a charge on the people - the two separate ones because of a bizarre constitutional block which was highlighted at the Constitutional Convention by me and others - mean that the amendments I tabled on this section were ruled out of order.  This makes it a little more difficult to argue positively, although in all of this discussion I do not think there is anybody, either on this side of the House or on the Government side, who is not trying to be positive in relation to the pension outcome, whether in the case of the IASS or Waterford Wedgwood which we discussed previously, or the other DB schemes that are being changed to defined contribution schemes.

I listened carefully to everything Deputy Clare Daly stated and a number of points she made about what may or may not have happened to this fund and how it may or may not have been managed.  I repeat it is important to bear in mind that the provisions in section 50 of the Act do not differentiate between active and deferred scheme members as these members are participating in a scheme during the phase where members accumulate pension rights.  However, the extent to which pension and payment can be restructured is limited.  In the Act debated last year, the first &euro;12,000 of pension is protected.  As most of those in these schemes and in this one as well who have long service would also have a State contributory pension, as the Deputy was suggesting, we are trying to protect those fully on a combined basis of &euro;24,000.  Given the level of entitlement that the lower paid may have to pensions, that is a significant and strong feature of the legislation which I introduced.<\/p><p>  Between &euro;12,000 and &euro;60,000, it can be reduced by up to 10%.  Up to &euro;60,000 a year, and &euro;60,000 is a significant pension, the reduction above the &euro;12,000 is 10%.  For those in excess of that, those over &euro;60,000 a year, which would be quite a significant pension, the reduction increases to 20%.  In addition, in many pension funds, because of the nature of the employments, persons would have been in insurable employment and there may be a full entitlement to a contributory pension.  Essentially, these changes provide for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all of the scheme members.  The issue of how these changes might be applied is a matter for the scheme trustees who, I stress, are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries just as they are required to administer the scheme in the best interests of the beneficiaries and they are required to administer it properly in the context of trust law.<\/p><p>  I addressed some of the comments of Deputies Ryan and Clare Daly in my earlier response.  I do not propose to accept these amendments for the reasons I have set out.<\/p><p>  The Deputies should bear in mind that what we are trying to do here - there is no disagreement between either side of the House - is to protect as far as possible persons of different categories in defined benefit schemes which, unfortunately, are in difficulty because of what has happened to schemes.  The schemes are made up of two parts: the employer and the employees.

On Committee Stage I indicated that not only was I happy to acknowledge but I fully understood the common sense of the proposition.  I believe that a lifetime penalty for someone joining a private insurance arrangement after the age of 35 is punitive.  The amendment seeks after a period of ten years to remove the penalty aspect and to take the calculation as of membership having been taken out by the age of 35.  In my view a ten-year penalty is reasonable and fair.  A ten-year penalty is more than adequate and appropriate, as the case may be.  For someone who is 36, 37 or 38 years of age to have to bear a penalty up to their final days by comparison with somebody who joined at 33 or 34 years of age, does not ring true with me.  I believe that timeframing it to a period certainly no greater than ten years, as Deputy Kelleher's amendment suggests, is both fair and reasonable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000041#PP00700","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1418226000,"counter":508,"content":"<p>Section 3 of the Bill amends section 7A of the Act and refers to the premia which may be charged under health insurance contracts in certain circumstances.  This section clarifies that the obligation on insurers to impose lifetime community rating loadings on premiums is mandatory and cannot be waived by an insurer.<\/p><p>  While Section 7A of the Act sets out the circumstances under which increased premiums may be charged, this section also clearly provides that any requirement to pay increased premiums is subject to regulations under subsection (6).  In this context, the Health Insurance Act 1994 (Determination of Relevant Increase under Section 7A And Provision of Information under Section 7B) Regulations 2014, were signed into law on 7 July 2014.  These regulations provide for premium loadings to be applied to inpatient indemnity health insurance contracts purchased on and from 1 May 2015 and require registered undertakings to set different premium prices depending on the age at which an individual takes out health insurance.<\/p><p>  As premium loadings are provided by way of regulation rather than by primary legislation, it is appropriate that any policy change requiring an amendment should be made to the regulation which governs the operation of the scheme.<\/p><p>  The amendment proposed by the Deputy will therefore be considered as part of the review of the scheme provided for in the regulations to be carried out by the Health Insurance Authority after April 2017, when the scheme has been in operation for a period of time.  While I agree in principle with what the Deputy proposes, it is not necessary now and will not be necessary for at least ten years and it may never be necessary because I hope that within the next ten years we will have universal health cover.  It is not necessary at all that it be put into primary legislation because it can be done by regulation.

I can accept the rationale of some of what the Minister has said but there is a view that what we and the Minister are trying to do is to stimulate the insurance market, incentivise younger people to take out insurance for the purpose of cross-subsidising those who are in greater need of the support of health services.<\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Even those ideologically opposed to private health insurance believe that because it exists there must be intergenerational solidarity.  While we are trying to incentivise it, this will really discourage people if the loading will be with them for life.  The legislation should include a clause that the penalty would wither after a certain period of time.  The Minister stated the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, will assess this and make recommendations.  The previous Minister for Health rejected many of the recommendations made by the HIA.  While it is a statutory body charged with overseeing the private health insurance market, its recommendations can be rejected, as has happened previously.  This is not much comfort with regard to ensuring a mandatory obligation for the penalty to wither after a certain period of time.<\/p><p> I do not know whether the regulations governing people who come to the country have been brought to the Minister's attention.  They have a window of nine months during which they must register with an insurance company, and if they leave they must inform it.  There is a perception that those aged 35 and over will skip in and out of the country to avoid health insurance weighting.  This may have been brought to the attention of the Department, but if it has not it should be examined.  It is very onerous and will cause huge administrative work.  The idea people would leave the country for a certain period of time to avoid this weighting does not stack up.  People will leave the country for many reasons, such as economic necessity or because they want to go on holidays or live abroad, but the idea one would leave for the purpose of avoiding the levy is completely unnecessary and will cause many administrative difficulties for the insurance companies which, as the Minister well knows, will create further red tape.

I am no advocate for private health insurance, as I have made very clear time after time, and nor am I a supporter of universal health insurance.  I am an advocate for universal health care.  I have no doubt in my mind that a 36 year old, on the basis of what the Minister said, would decide he or she was being asked to buy a pig in a poke.  The penalty will apply.  It is not much good saying we will examine it in two years time, in 2017, and at some point in time along the years subsequently.  It will be a disincentive, and of this there is no doubt in my mind, for those who are well past their 35th year and even for those close to that age bracket.  Clarity is required and certainty is the only assurance.  The methodology suggested by Deputy Kelleher is, to my mind, the only one that stands the test.  There it is; I recognise the Bill is a requirement and I will support it.  I am not an advocate but I understand this is the reality in which we are, and so I support the thrust of what the Minister seeks to achieve.

If too many guillotines, exceptions and subclauses are introduced, we get away from this very clear message.<\/p><p>  If this is something we need to tweak or amend over time this can be done, which is why the two year review is built into the legislation, but even at that point it will be done by regulation.

These are being done in the interests of textual clarity and correction of cross-references and do not affect any substantive amendments.  They are as follows.<br\/><br\/>Section 567 contains a table which sets outs section numbers and subject matter to which that section applies.  There is a discrepancy between the subject matter and the section number at page 489, line 21.  Section 672 currently has the subject matter &quot;Order for payment or delivery of property against person examined under <i>section 660<\/i>&quot;.  The verbal correction will update the section reference to read, &quot;Order for payment or delivery of property against person examined under <i>section 671<\/i>&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Section 902(2)(e) refers to section 945(1)(b).  This verbal correction will change it to read 945(1)(a).  Section 945(1)(a) provides for the prescribing of designated bodies for the purposes of section 902 and 907.  Section 945(1)(b) provides for a body referred to in section 902(2) ceasing to be a designated body.  Therefore the correct reference here ought to be section 945(1)(a).<br\/><br\/>In section 999(4)(b) the reference to &quot;<i>subsections (2)(a)<\/i>and <i>(3)<\/i>&quot; needs to be changed to &quot;<i>subsections (2)(b)<\/i>and <i>(3)<\/i>&quot; to ensure the cross-reference correctly refers to a DAC limited by guarantee.<br\/><br\/>Section 1085 is amending section 121 for the purposes of applying the provisions of section 121 to plcs, public limited companies.  Subsection (7) of section 1085 amends the text of section 121(6).  Section 121(6) was amended by the insertion of the word &quot;entity&quot; by an amendment on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  However, the reference at section 1085 still refers to the original language of section 121(6).  Therefore the correction will insert the word &quot;entity&quot; immediately preceding &quot;financial statements&quot;.<br\/><br\/>In the Seanad, subsection (4) was deleted in section 1110(7), which will cause it to contain a blank cross-reference unless it is verbally corrected.  Therefore it must be changed to read &quot;subsections (4) and (5)&quot; instead of &quot;(4) to (6)&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Section 1359(4) contains a reference to subsection (1).

Millions of Israelis have been forced to seek shelter on a daily basis from the indiscriminate firing of rockets into Israel.  Some 55 Israelis, of whom the vast majority have been IDF personnel, and one Thai national have died.<\/blockquote>As it turns out, only three Israelis were killed in Israel by the &quot;toy rockets&quot; that Hamas was firing in the other direction.  Some 2,100 people were killed in Gaza, 500 of whom were children.  We had little to say about it.<br\/><br\/>On a different occasion during the summer, the Minister stated:<blockquote>The blockade of Gaza must be ended.  So too must the indiscriminate firing of rockets into Israel by Hamas and other militants, including Islamic Jihad and also the building of tunnels for the purpose of attacking Israelis.  Hamas must renounce violence as a means of achieving its political objectives.<\/blockquote>This is the fourth largest army in the world attacking the poorest nation on the planet.<br\/><br\/>The Minister, in his defence a couple of weeks ago when we argued for recognition of the Palestinian state, stated that it needed to be remembered that recognition of any state would not bring peace to the region.  He was right, but he did not add that the reason Israel could carry out genocide to the extent that it does in Gaza was because the US let it do so and supported it without qualm.<br\/><br\/>People might forget but, in 1948, the Jews expelled, massacred, destroyed and raped in Palestine.  As a result of that campaign, 500 Palestinian villages and 11 urban neighbourhoods were destroyed.  Some 700,000 Palestinians were expelled and several thousand were massacred.  It is called &quot;genocide&quot;.  Things have not changed much since.  The US has unreservedly supported genocide in Gaza.  Since we allow the US military to use Shannon as a military base to do whatever it feels like in the Middle East, to carry arms to the Middle East and to carry reinforcements to the Israelis, we are complicit.<br\/><br\/>The latest revelations concerning the CIA torture dossier - although the US Senate has only revealed 500 pages of a 6,000-page document, fair play to it for doing so - will hopefully bring our Government to the point of examining our role in what has transpired in the Middle East during the past 15 years.  We need an inquiry into who authorised Shannon to be used as a US military base.  It is nothing short of a disgrace.  We have been so silent, it is frightening.  That the new Minister was silent this summer and spent more time giving out about Hamas than he did about what the Israelis were doing to Palestinians in Gaza beggars belief.<br\/><br\/>I just met a man on the street who told me that he had heard people claiming there were only 30,000 people at today's protest.  He added that he would like to see them try to get all of those protesters into Croke Park, which can hold 80,000, because they would not be able to.  Some 250,000 attend the St. Patrick's Day parade.  He told me that he had attended most of those parades but that today's protest was bigger.<br\/><br\/>The Government is on its last legs.

It is a little sickening when we think about how glad we are in some ways to be able to welcome the recognition in our Parliament of a Palestinian state.  We have to jolt ourselves back, as it is just a tiny step in the overall battle.  Of course we welcome it but the fact that the Government is not opposing the motion in some ways shows how toothless the motion is.  It is important but it is not enough.

A two-state solution has long been the goal of the Palestinian people.  It was recognised as the most effective way forward since Palestine was a British territory but it is yet to be achieved.<\/p><p> Progress towards that end continues to be stymied, in part by acts of aggression.  When we met the Palestinian ambassador recently, he told us that the greatest single barrier to progress is the continued encroachment of the illegal settlements.  There has been conflict between Palestinians and Israelis for many decades, with untold thousands having lost their homes, their futures and their lives.  The most recent conflict saw an estimated 2,200 people dead.  More than 2,100 of them were Palestinians, of whom some 500 were children.  The entire region has been repeatedly plunged into conflict and repeatedly destabilised.<\/p><p> I hope this motion will go some way towards maintaining international pressure for the 1967 border to be recognised, for the settlements programme to be discontinued, and for efforts towards lasting peace and reconciliation to begin in earnest between the peoples of Israel and Palestine.

We the Irish nation and we the Irish Parliament are calling today for a long-term peace by way of recognition of the state of Palestine.

It is a regime that enforces the occupation of the West Bank through the types of checkpoints at which Mr. Abu Ein met his death today.  It is a regime that routinely slaughters the people it holds in the open-air prison camp that is Gaza, an area in which residents live in conditions of extreme poverty and extreme difficulty.

In 1947, the General Assembly of the United Nations called for a two-state solution in the region then known as the Palestinian Mandate, one Jewish and one Arab, with an international regime for the city of Jerusalem.  In 1948 we saw the creation of Israel and the outbreak of violence, followed by the establishment of the Green Line the following year.  In 1967, following the Six-Day War, the occupation by Israel of the lands that are now known as the West Bank and Gaza took place.  That occupation has lasted for almost 50 years, far in excess of any military justification for its observance in the first place.<\/p><p>  The Oslo Accords of 1993 opened up the prospect of a two-state solution.  As part of that process, there was an explicit recognition by the Palestinian side of the right to existence of Israel.  In the past 20 years, however, the principles of international law upon which the Israeli occupation is supposed to be governed were routinely and systematically disregarded.  In the occupied Palestinian territories today, half a million Israeli settlers are living in more than 250 settlements, all of them in contravention of the fourth Geneva Convention and all of them declared illegal by the International Court of Justice.  The advisory opinion of that respected and independent court declared illegal the Israeli wall, which annexes 16% of the West Bank, not only because of the land grab itself but also because of its impact on the civilian population.  That barrier separates people from their farmlands, sunders communities and has a major commercial and agricultural impact.  The report of the UN Human Rights Council's fact-finding mission on the implications of the Israeli settlements for the social, economic and cultural rights of Palestinians outlines in horrific detail the plight of a people living in a two-tier society where their rights are inferior to those of the other group with whom they share the region.<\/p><p>  When we discuss Israel and Palestine, our focus always should be on the international human rights and humanitarian law that ought to apply to the situation.  The existence of one state should never be subservient to or at the whim of another state.  That is an important principle which should be acknowledged.  Palestinians have a right to reside in their homeland, as was indicated by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1947.  Ireland voted in favour at the General Assembly some years ago of giving Palestine state status.  The motion before the House is not just symbolic; it is a powerful statement that this State acknowledges not only Israel's right to exist but also the right to existence of a Palestinian people within a Palestinian state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000052#YY00400","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speech","time":1418231400,"counter":1115,"content":"<p>The motion before us is not ideal.  At its heart it recognises that negotiations will be needed to achieve the two-state solution it promotes.  Having said that, there is much in the text of the motion that is fair and reflective of a middle ground.  I am aware that Deputy Adams met with the leader of the Israeli Labor Party, Isaac Herzog, during his visit to Israel and Palestine last week.  Mr. Herzog had as a central plank of his campaign last year to be elected leader that he would put the achievement of peace at the top of his party's agenda.  I was very disappointed, however, by his stance on the Israeli violence in Gaza and the appalling deaths of civilians there.  Nevertheless, I welcome Mr. Adams's willingness to meet with people from both sides, including Mr. Herzog.  I understand the Deputy has also met with diplomats from the Israeli Embassy on this island.<\/p><p>Deputy Adams has much experience to share with those on both sides.  I was Chair of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement when it was addressed by Senator George Mitchell, who spoke briefly about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  He stressed that each conflict is unique and requires its own local solution.  However, Senator Mitchell also referred to how the Northern Ireland peace process is held up as a shining example throughout the world, including in the Middle East, and stated that on one visit to Stormont he met 12 Palestinian activists who were there to learn from MLAs and political leaders about the peace process experience in the North.<\/p><p> The conflict under discussion is complex in nature.  It has a long history and there has been much suffering on both sides.  The EU has played a role in this regard, both in terms of the Holocaust and its approach to the refugees from the latter.  Ireland has a very poor record on this matter.  That is why I believe that the EU should act collectively and try to help both sides to move towards furthering the peace process.  I very much agree with the approach of the Government, which was outlined last night, to engage in a reflective response following the passing of this motion.  I agree that there must be an EU consensus.  The European Union needs to draw both peoples closer to it.  The EU must work with them to build capacity - the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, outlined some of the projects with which Ireland is involved in the area of Palestinian education - and act as an honest broker in the peace process.<\/p><p> I am very much opposed to campaigns to boycott Israel.  Perhaps it is time for Sinn F&eacute;in to adopt the kind of nuanced approach outlined in the motion, reject calls for boycotts of Israel and work with both sides.  Within these Houses and operating under the auspices of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, there are parliamentary friendship groups.  These groups have relationships with many parliaments across the globe, including those in Israel and Palestine.  I am a member of one such group in this Parliament and I have received huge flak for that as if the group in question is some kind of cabal of friends of Israel and involves a worldwide conspiracy.  That is not true.  The Inter-Parliamentary Union recommends that we have such groups in our Parliament and that we become involved in friendships with parliaments in countries in which there is conflict.  We should build on the work being done in this regard.  I would welcome any Sinn F&eacute;in involvement with the work in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000052#YY00500","speaker":"1010","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418232000,"counter":1117,"content":"<p>I am very happy to support the motion because I am fully in favour of the sentiments behind it.  For many years, Ireland has supported the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state not just because this would provide freedom and security to Palestinians, but also because we believe it is the best hope of such freedom and security for Israel and the entire Middle East.  It is sometimes perplexing that Israel does not seem to recognise this fact.  We appreciate that Israel is just a small enclave - the Israeli people very much believe this to be the case - in an Arab-dominated region.  We also understand that the Israeli people feel beleaguered, particularly in view of their long history as victims of persecution.  However, it is that history which should demonstrate to Israelis how a subjugated population whose members are denied their sovereignty, personal freedom, lands, homes and dignity will become increasingly radicalised and will for ever be a viper in the nest.  This surely must be a greater threat to Israel than any two-state solution or any other solution or negotiated settlement at which it might be possible to arrive.<br\/><br\/>The long-held position of Israel, which was again communicated to us by that country's ambassador to Ireland who encouraged us to vote against the motion, is that any recognition of a Palestinian right to self-determination should be postponed until Palestinian leaders recognise the equal right to self-determination of the Jewish people.  I would offer three responses in this regard, namely, unlike Palestinians, the Jewish people already enjoy the right to self-determination; the continuing and accelerating erosion of Palestinian land appears to be an attempt to ensure that self-determination for the Palestinian people will never be achieved; and the Palestinian leadership has, on many occasions, reiterated its commitment to and desire for a two-state solution based on the 1967 border and 22% of the area of historic Palestine.  A two-state solution would be a <i>de facto<\/i>recognition that both states would be entitled to self-determination.  Refusing to come to the table to negotiate because the equal right to self-determination of the Israelis has not been recognised is a dubious justification.<br\/><br\/>All of that has been known for many years.  The situation in the region has, if anything, disimproved.  There has been increasing radicalisation of Palestinian youths, ever greater harassment and unrest and encroachment on and occupation of the land that might have been used to form a second state.  I agree with the very definite shift in Ireland's policy on this matter.  This shift was articulated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade some weeks ago when he came before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and indicated that the basis of Ireland's new policy is - in conjunction with the EU, if possible - to consider how the prospect of Palestinian recognition can help leverage meaningful discussions with Israel.  If the prospect of recognition does not achieve progress in terms of bringing Israel to the negotiating table, if human rights abuses and the settlement programme continue and if UN resolutions continue to be ignored, then we should move towards actual recognition.  The use of economic sanctions and every other peaceful means at our disposal must be considered in this regard.<br\/><br\/>None of what I am saying is aimed at exonerating violence perpetrated by the Palestinian population.  The truth is, however, that Palestinian people have been oppressed for so long and are now so without hope that the region is increasingly in danger of becoming fertile ground for total destabilisation.  If this proves to be the case, there should be no doubt that the destabilisation will not be confined to the Middle East.  I support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000053#ZZ00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1418232000,"counter":1118,"content":"<p>I support the motion.  The political situation to which it relates is perhaps the most distressing and tragic in the entire world.  There are other conflicts in which more people are being killed but, in fundamental terms, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is more distressing than any of these.  On one hand we have the Israeli-Jewish people who probably have a longer history of being discriminated against and appallingly treated than any other group.  This has been their lot down through the ages.  I once heard a member of the Jewish community list the intolerable difficulties the Jewish people have been obliged to endure since the time of Abraham.  I have no doubt as to the truth of what I heard, particularly when I contemplate the horrors visited upon Jews during the Second World War.  That was just the last in a long series of outrages perpetrated against them.  The Jews were a people without a homeland.  They then found a homeland in Israel but when they did so, they deprived the Palestinian people of theirs.  This was a catastrophe for the Palestinians in the same way as what happened in the Second World War was a catastrophe for the Jewish people.<\/p><p>  The problem which arises relates to how to resolve this terrible dispute.  I absolutely abhor the violence being perpetrated by those on both sides in the conflict and I wish for a peaceful solution to be found.  Not a day goes by without some further problem arising in the region.  Today, for example, a Palestinian Cabinet Minister, Mr. Ziad Abu Ain, was killed when attending a protest relating to land confiscations, a matter which lies at the very heart of the problem.  I take this opportunity to offer my condolences to the family of Ziad Abu Ain.  The problem to which I refer is being exacerbated by the Israelis' creeping annexation of Palestinian territory and their increasingly discriminatory approach to Palestinians.  We are all aware of the problems behaviour of this nature caused in our own country.<\/p><p>  I am extremely frustrated by the situation which is the subject of this motion.  For the long-term good of both the Palestinians and the Israelis, the EU must impose economic sanctions on the State of Israel.  Such sanctions should not be lifted until such time as the authorities in Israel engage in meaningful dialogue with the Palestinians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000053#ZZ00300","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speech","time":1418232000,"counter":1119,"content":"<p>This State should not only do what it can at international level to help secure an inclusive and viable peace process, but it should also encourage the resumption of direct talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians because, ultimately, this is the only mechanism that can truly resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and bring about a two-state solution.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>This requires that we bring to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict all that we have learned from the Irish peace process whilst recognising its greater complexity and different dynamic, the difficulties of the region and the competing interests, rivalry and antagonism not only of neighbouring states but also within the Muslim world generally.  The fabric of the conflict is multi-layered and, too frequently, discussion of it both within and outside this House is selective and simplistic and either ignores or deliberately avoids addressing issues of complexity which present a barrier to conflict resolution.<br\/><br\/>It is regrettable that the Government refrained from tabling amendments to the motion to better reflect the more sophisticated and nuanced approach being taken to it in the context of conflict resolution as represented by the speeches delivered by our three Ministers of State yesterday evening, particularly that of the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy.  I presume this was done to avoid controversy.  However, the avoidance of controversy, of itself, is not a credible policy approach to an issue of such sensitivity and importance.  In international relations, words matter.  The wording of the motion will be examined carefully by the Israeli and Palestinian sides.  How we express ourselves is important also in preserving the integrity of the neutral engagement of our Defence Forces in UN missions in the Middle East.<br\/><br\/>If we in this State are to play a real role in assisting to secure a viable and inclusive peace process, we must understand the difficulties on both sides and not simply embrace the rhetoric of one.  It is widely known and understood that the only viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may involve some shared sovereignty of East Jerusalem and continued access by all monotheistic religions to their relevant holy sites.  The motion, as proposed, presents East Jerusalem as the sole preserve of Palestinians, something with which no Israeli Government could agree.  The motion also calls on the Irish Government simply to recognise the state of Palestine on the basis of the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, describing this as &ldquo;a further positive contribution to securing a negotiated two-state solution&rdquo;.  Anyone who understands the conflict and its complexities will realise a commitment to East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state alone excludes Ireland, from the Israeli perspective, as a possible contributor to securing a viable peace process.  The motion is also unhelpful in portraying what it describes as &ldquo;Israeli settlement construction&rdquo; activities as the main obstacle to the establishment of a Palestinian state.  This ignores the many more fundamental obstacles, including the continuing divisions between Hamas and Fatah epitomised by the collapse of the unity government.<br\/><br\/>What are the obstacles that are ignored in this motion?  They include the fact that Hamas as a terrorist movement is still committed to the extermination of the Israeli state, as is Hezbollah, and that it acts as a proxy for Iran; that rockets fired from Gaza, which have resulted in three successive wars since Hamas took control of Gaza, have substantially undermined support within Israeli political parties and the public for any resolution that could render Israel vulnerable to missiles being fired from the West Bank; that President Abbas and Fatah are essentially insisting that a Palestinian state be <i>Judenfrei<\/i>; that, despite the time that has elapsed since the Oslo Accords and all the assistance that has been furnished to Palestinians, they have still failed to develop the essential democratic and state institutions required for a viable Palestinian state that respects the rule of law and protects fundamental human rights; that it is necessary to rebuild trust between politicians on all sides and for Palestinians to address and resolve their internal divisions and end self-created obstacles to a successful peace process; and the reality that any Palestinian leader who achieves a resolution with Israel that involves any compromised resolution will be a target for assassination, tragically, by some of his own people. <br\/><br\/>If this State is to make a real contribution to the resolution of the conflict, we must regard both sides in the conflict as our friends, emphasise that friendship, and not hesitate to discuss with each the realities of the other&rsquo;s concerns while avoiding propagandist rhetoric connected with the conflict.  As we learnt in Northern Ireland, a resolution can be brought about only if each side recognises the need for compromise.  Compromise can occur only where political leaders prepare their population for pragmatic and practical compromises that bring to an end conflict and distrust.  It can also only occur where neither side incites, encourages or engages in acts that generate hatred of the other.  There is a continuing pretence at international level that if the Israeli Government, together with President Abbas and the Palestinian Authority, could agree a resolution, the conflict would be over.  Tragically, this is a fantasy and will remain a fantasy until the Palestinians resolve their internal divisions and until there is a single democratically elected government governing the West Bank and Gaza.  It will also remain a fantasy until such time as Israelis are assured that, subsequent to a final agreement, Hamas could not end up in power not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank and the entire Israeli state and all of its citizens - Jews, Muslims, Christians and others - would not be vulnerable to Hamas missiles.<br\/><br\/>It is extraordinary that, as movers of the motion in this House, not a single member of Sinn F&eacute;in addressed the divisions between Fatah and Hamas, the obstacles that Hamas presents to a viable peace process and the extraordinary unacknowledged reality that, since 2006, President Abbas, whom I have met many times, as well as other Palestinian leaders, whom I have met on occasion, has been unable to enter Gaza for fear of his life.  The focus should be on reigniting the peace process and the reopening of talks which involve direct engagement between Israel and Palestinians.  It is regrettable that motions now coming before various parliaments in Europe have little to contribute to the achievement of that objective.  I believe they are a distraction from the real internal issues and dilemmas that must be addressed by both Palestinian and Israeli political leaders if any real progress is to be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000053#ZZ00400","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418232600,"counter":1121,"content":"<p>I welcome the Palestinian and Moroccan ambassadors to the House.  I congratulate Sinn F&eacute;in on tabling this motion calling for an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestine and recognising the state of Palestine.  It is particularly interesting that a similar motion has already been passed in the Seanad unanimously.  It would be quite unprecedented if in this House the motion were passed unanimously.  That would create a precedent indicating the entire Oireachtas is in favour of a particular policy approach.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that international recognition of the state of Palestine can copperfasten the two-state solution because it automatically implies international recognition of the State of Israel.  That is quite important to certain countries throughout the world.  The Israeli&ndash;Palestinian conflict is destructive, as we all know, and liable to erupt at any time.  It destabilises the entire region but its resolution has the potential to bring stability, once and for all, to the Middle East.<br\/><br\/>The invasion of Gaza, the occupation of the West Bank, the encroachment on East Jerusalem and the establishment of illegal Israeli settlements are serious attacks on the integrity and viability of a Palestinian state.  Therefore, it is imperative that the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories be ended immediately.<br\/><br\/>The freedom of the Palestinian people is being crushed by the occupation.  Palestinians are denied basic rights and freedoms, such as the freedom of movement.  Checkpoints restrict access to work in schools and the separation wall has annexed vast tracts of the West Bank, disconnecting families and preventing Palestinians from conducting their daily lives.  This is particularly evident in East Jerusalem where the permit system adds further obstacles to mobility.<br\/><br\/>Another kind of freedom denied is freedom to live without harassment as Israeli settlers engage in violence against Palestinian people and their properties with impunity, and as Israeli police fail to investigate and charge the perpetrators.  Another freedom denied is that of Palestinians to develop their homes on their lands, as a two-tier planning system allows Israeli settlements to develop and expand while Palestinian homes and essential infrastructure are being demolished daily.  Other freedoms denied are the freedom to live peacefully as Bedouins in the Jordan Valley are evacuated from their homes at short notice for days on end; the freedom to walk and drive on the same streets as Israelis, which, incredibly, is not possible; the freedom of governors, mayors and the business community to develop the economic sustainability of their towns and villages since taxes are withheld and economic projects are denied permission, as in Jenin, Hebron and Bethlehem; and freedom of access to natural resources such as water as Israeli settlement consumption <i>per capita<\/i>far exceeds that of Palestinians.<br\/><br\/>These actions seem to be a part of a strategic plan by the Israelis to force Palestinians off their lands and remove their residency rights, particularly in the Jerusalem area.  This policy, along with the Separation Wall, has resulted in the agreed boundary based on the 1967 borders being pushed back even further, effectively annexing large tracts of Palestinian lands, as referred to in the Oslo Accords in 1993.<br\/><br\/>When the countries of the world give their stamp of approval to the new state of Palestine, the moral authority of such broad agreement must not be disregarded.  Already 135 countries have formally recognised the state of Palestine, and this motion is an important step towards Ireland's formal recognition of the state of Palestine also.  The peace process should now begin in earnest.  The EU has a major role to play.  It can and should guarantee the security and integrity of the new state of Palestine.<\/p><p>Already, the United States guarantees the security of the state of Israel.

For example, in September last, the committee met both ambassadors for four hours in public session and today we revisited the issue.  It has been an important part of the committee's programme over the past three and a half years.<\/p><p>  Ireland first asserted in 1980 that the solution to the conflict in the Middle East lay in the establishment of a Palestinian state.  In accordance with that, Ireland voted in favour of Palestinian admission to UNESCO, and as a non-member observer state at the UN.  Of course, the next logical step is for the recognition, by agreement of both sides, of a Palestinian state.  Also, in 2011, Ireland upgraded the title of Palestinian General Delegation to Ireland to &quot;Palestinian Mission&quot;, and the title head of mission from delegate general to &quot;ambassador, head of mission&quot;.  These may be small steps but they are important.  They are a significant symbol of the recognition of Palestine.<\/p><p>  As Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have long recognised the importance of the need to continue dialogue at a political level.  That has been said by most speakers here tonight.  It is only through the process of dialogue that we will achieve a lasting solution, based on fairness and equality and on a two-state solution.  Only today, the committee met the Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel, EAPPI, an NGO that works in the region monitoring and protecting human rights.  All such organisations should be supported in order to move forward a peaceful solution.<\/p><p>  In recent years, matters were clearly not helped by the effects of the Fatah-Hamas split.  I would urge Hamas to recognise the state of Israel.  That is imperative, if we are to move forward with talks.  The agreement reached in June this year between the two sides, Hamas and Fatah, paved the way for long overdue presidential and legislative elections, following which a government will be forged in the usual way.  I welcome this development as an important step forward in reaching an overall negotiated settlement.<\/p><p>  I agree with the broad international consensus that the only way forward for both the Palestinians and Israel is the negotiation of a viable two-state solution, with the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza on the basis of the 1967 boundaries.  The rejection of this proposal by sizeable parts of successive Israeli Administrations has led to the continuous expansion of Israeli settlements.  This, in turn, has led to heightened tension and increased violence, which has resulted in a lasting settlement appearing to be further away than ever.  It seems that the current Israeli Government, albeit that elections have been called for next March, cannot allow itself to make the concessions that are necessary for a lasting two-state solution.  In order to make one step forward, any decrease in violence would be welcomed.<\/p><p>  How many minutes have I, four or five?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000055#BBB00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1418233200,"counter":1124,"content":"<p>Four minutes.

Of course, in this House we recognise more than most the importance of recognition.  The first gathering of the D&aacute;il took place on 21 January 1919, just around the corner from here in the Mansion House, and the Teachta D&aacute;la who gathered there declared to the world the freedom of the Irish people and put their programme for Government to the Irish people and to the world.  They asked for recognition of our State.  Tragically, recognition was hard to find and we were bound into a war over the next number of years and the tragic consequences of all of that.  We in Ireland are aware of the importance of recognition by other countries of one's right to statehood and to freedom and dignity.  I am delighted that this motion will be passed, it appears, unanimously, here tonight in this House.<\/p><p>  I recently had the chance to visit the Occupied Territories and Palestine.  I was in Ramallah and I travelled from there, through the infamous Kalandia checkpoint, through what is called the Devil's Elbow - that long winding road that Palestinians must take to journey to Hebron, Bethlehem and other locations.  Rather than the direct route, the Palestinians must take this long circuitous route.  Along the way, I saw at first hand both Israel's wall of division - its Apartheid wall built around Jerusalem - and the settlements.<\/p><p>  On the journey that day, I passed through areas A, B, and C.  I visited Hebron and I saw how the Al-Ibrahimi mosque, the scene of the Hebron massacre 20 years ago, is now annexed for the use of Jewish worshippers in a section of it.  I saw how their sacred mosque, the fourth most sacred place for those of the Muslim faith in the world, is surrounded by military installations.  I saw at first hand the occupation of that city to protect just 400 Israeli settlers, and, of course, the settlers who are all around the city.  I saw the infrastructure that Israel has constructed - the settler-only roads where, as we speak, they are destroying the two-state solution.  Those roads that connect the settlements illegally under international law to the city of Jerusalem are settler-only roads - it is Apartheid.<\/p><p>  I travelled on to Bethlehem, a city with considerable potential in terms of tourism and wealth creation for the Palestinians who live there.  The Israelis advise tourists not to stay there stating they will bus tourists in to visit the Church of the Nativity where Christ was born and will bus them out again.  The Palestinians who live there do not enjoy the benefits of the place where Christ was born for their community, and they want to.  They embrace and celebrate it, but they are not able to enjoy the benefits.<\/p><p>  Then I spent a full day in Jerusalem.  I was horrified at what I saw at first hand.  There is a situation where the Israelis have annexed east Jerusalem for a long number years.  During that period they have built illegal settlements throughout the city and as one drives past those settlements, everything is spick and span.  There is a tram connecting these illegal settlements to the rest of Jerusalem and Apartheid is again in place because one sees, on going into the Palestinian communities within Jerusalem, that those communities are not maintained.  One can see litter.  One can see the roads are not maintained.  Even traffic lights do not work.  That is the Israeli policy and practice because we, in the international community, have sat on our hands and expected the Oslo Accord to be implemented on its own.<\/p><p>  In Jerusalem, I met Palestinian families who are being evicted from their home and whose homes are to be demolished.  In one case, I met a 96 year old woman who had just been beaten by settlers.  Within that city, settlers terrorise the Palestinians, who are driven to despair.  I then met a family where a lad was 14 or 15 years old.  He had been arrested 16 times.  He was nine years old when he was first arrested by Israeli forces.  They are trying to drive the Palestinians within this area out of their homes.  It is very difficult for a Palestinian to build a home in Jerusalem today.<\/p><p>  All around me, be it in Ramallah, throughout the West Bank and even when we visited Jerusalem that day, at a whim the Israelis closed down the Kalandia checkpoint which meant that a Palestinian could not gain entry into Jerusalem.  Merely for some derisory security reason on that given day, they closed down the whole place.  We were fortunate because we held foreign passports.  We could go a circuitous route and come into Jerusalem another way with our foreign passports, but it was not for the Palestinian people to go to and enjoy their city.<\/p><p>Palestinians in east Jerusalem are not even citizens; they are residents.  They are given residency by the Israelis who are occupying east Jerusalem in defiance of international law.  It is shocking to see it at first hand.<\/p><p> I was profoundly saddened on my way home.  The two-state solution is dying as we speak.  The Palestinian people no longer control 22% of historic Palestine, which they were so generously willing to accept; they control approximately 5%.  If one takes the areas that are described as A, B and C and take away the Jordan Valley and east Jerusalem, all that is left is 5%, which does not amount to a state.  The international community has allowed that to happen.<\/p><p> I have not even mentioned Gaza, which has again been destroyed by an onslaught.  The Israelis have blockaded Gaza.  There is no airport in the state of Palestine.  One cannot fly there.  That is why it is so vital that more and more countries across the world take the initiative, take an independent stance and, accordingly, recognise the state of Palestine.<\/p><p> I listened to the Government&rsquo;s argument.  The motion commends the Government on some of the initiatives it has taken.  I appreciate that it is important to build international alliances and to work in partnership to resolve issues, but the fact is that the international community has absolutely failed the Palestinian people.  I cannot describe the level of despair I witnessed.  I was in the West Bank.  I did not get into Gaza.  I did not see where the real and utter devastation is evident.  I refer to the looks on the faces of people in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and everywhere else that we met them.  Those beautiful people with their beautiful culture and sheer potential to build a nation and take their place among the nations of the Earth have been so failed by the international community.<\/p><p> We have worked to reach consensus with other European states but there is no consensus.  Even when a report condemned the illegal settlements in the West Bank the trade partnerships still continued and we still purchase goods from the illegal settlements.  We still give them the green light and allow the Israelis to have nuclear weapons and to deny that they have them.  We still allow them not to sign up to the non-proliferation treaty yet we demand from Iran the highest possible standards where they might even be able to use nuclear energy for their own economy.  At the same time Israel has all the weapons that we never demand to see or on which we expect accountability.<\/p><p> I passionately believe that the best interests of the Israeli people, who have a right to security, their own state and to peace, is in a two-state solution.  If the Israelis give the Palestinian people their dignity and negotiate a proper state, not 5% but the 22% the Palestinian people are willing to accept, that is the surest way to achieve peace.  I will be at the front line tabling motions in the House to defend the Israeli people if they come under attack having done the right thing.  The purpose of the motion is to say that we as a sovereign, independent State wish to take our own position on the matter.  We have the opportunity to do that tonight.  I cannot describe how happy I am that we will do it, but the next step is for the Government to recognise the Palestinian state.  I hope to see that happen soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000055#BBB00700","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418233800,"counter":1130,"content":"<p>Today is a great day for Ireland but it is also a great day for Palestine because the motion will not be opposed.  While some people have been spinning to say the motion is not binding, I do not see how a Government could not support the motion and its effects into the future.  It is a challenge for us as Opposition Members but it is also a challenge for the Government in particular to live up to what is contained in the motion.<\/p><p>  On 21 January 1919 An Ch&eacute;ad D&aacute;il met down the road in the Mansion House.  Three main things happened on the day.  There was a declaration of freedom, of independence.  The document was read out in Irish first, French second and English third.  That was followed by a democratic programme which, again, was announced in the three languages.  The final document, which is often forgotten about, is the message to the free nations of the world.  The Irish State, as founded on that morning, called on all free nations in the world to recognise it.  Three emissaries were appointed by the D&aacute;il to attend the peace conference in Versailles to argue the case for Irish independence and for the new Irish nation state to be recognised.  Those emissaries were Eamon De Valera, Arthur Griffith and George Plunkett.<\/p><p>  What we are doing today is living up to a commitment that we sought of other nations on behalf of the Palestinian people who have asked for help for many years.  They have asked us as a small nation - they have asked every other nation also - to recognise their state and to give them the same status we enjoy.  Not having such status means they do not have a full seat at the UN.  I hope that through our actions today they will be a lot closer to their goal.  Not only that, but that they can give full effect to their independence.  I hope that when their independence is under attack by Israel, as it has been for many decades, or when the Israelis bombard Gaza, as happened earlier this year, that we as a nation will stand up and declare a boycott of Israel, its goods, services and representatives.  I hope we will demand that sanctions will be taken against Israel.<\/p><p>  I also hope that the EU, a club of which we are a member, will not play games with Israel and that the old consensus is over, whereby one was told not to raise the issue in case the Germans, Czechs or others might get upset.  The view that we had to take a consensus approach is gone once and for all.  We should have been the nation within Europe that set the example for the rest of the European nations.  It is a pity we were not.  The Swedes and others have got there ahead of us.  However, now we can set an example by reaching out to those states who have already recognised the Palestinian state in order to set the agenda in Europe and to recognise what has happened to the Palestinian people in the past while Europe and Ireland in the main sat back and did nothing.<\/p><p>  It is a great day for organisations such as the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, IPSC, SADAKA - the Ireland Palestine Alliance, Gaza Action Ireland, Tr&oacute;caire, the Irish Friends of Palestine and the likes of the Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel, EAPPI, and friends of mine who were in Gaza, Jenny and Derek Graham, who have been fighting for Palestine to be put centre stage and for us as a small nation to recognise what they have gone through for years.<\/p><p>  I would love to have much more time to regale the House with what I saw when I visited Gaza, Palestine and the West Bank but I will conclude by saying that I am one of the last people who got a stamp from Gaza free port.  One cannot go into Gaza from the sea or from the air.  That is a denial of the rights of the Palestinian nation.  I hold that passport dear to me because it has a stamp in and out.  I was one of the last people who broke the siege and managed to get in.  The siege is illegal and must be lifted straight away.  Part of the process is to recognise their nationhood and the state of Palestine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000056#CCC00200","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1418234400,"counter":1131,"content":"<p>It is a welcome decision by the Government not to oppose or amend this motion.  By creating unity on this issue in the Oireachtas, we will be sending a strong message of solidarity to the Palestinian people and an international message that Ireland will stand up for the right of self-determination.  It is vital that the Government takes heed of this motion and the motion recently passed in the Seanad.  The Government must now follow through on the substantive steps needed and ensure that it lives up to the commitments outlined and agreed to.<\/p><p>  I wish to use this opportunity to highlight some of the current issues relating to Palestinian children being held in detention by Israel.  According to a report by the Euro-Mid Observer for Human Rights which was released this summer, from the beginning of 2010 to mid-2014, Israeli forces arrested nearly 3,000 Palestinian children, the majority aged between 12 and 15 years.  That number continues to increase due in particular to continued Israeli crackdowns in the occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank.<\/p><p>  The report states that 75% of the detained children are subjected to physical torture and 25% faced military trials.  The arbitrary arrests are in violation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which Israel ratified in 1991.  It is one clear example of how Israel continues to violate international and human rights law with its occupation of Palestine.<\/p><p>  The arrests of children are largely carried out in the middle of the night without clear justification or an actual security need.  Arrests are often carried out on youths protesting against Israeli armed forces who are protecting Jewish settlement areas that have been illegally appropriated from Palestinian families.  The vast majority of arrests are for throwing stones which is considered an offence under section 212 of military order 1651.  Children as young as 12 are taken into custody without warning.  It is a practice that is completely contrary to the protection of children's rights and, indeed, human rights.  It results in thousands of children under the age of 16 being taken into custody.  This is unjustifiable.  Although the maximum sentence for children of 12 to 13 years is six months, the penalty rises dramatically from the age of 14, when a child can face a maximum penalty of between ten and 20 years, depending on circumstances.<\/p><p>  Another 22-page report conducted by UNICEF in March last year found that the ill-treatment of Palestinian minors held in Israeli military detention centres is widespread, systematic and institutionalised.  It stated that most children confessed at the end of the interrogation, signing forms in Hebrew which they hardly understand.  It also found that children had been held in solitary confinement for between two days and one month, before being taken to court or even following sentencing.  During court hearings children were in leg chains and shackles and in most cases the principal evidence against the child is the child's own confession, in most cases extracted under duress during the interrogation.<\/p><p>  A study conducted by Defence for Children International in the occupied Palestinian territories, showed that Palestinian children in Israeli prisons are being subjected to torture, sleep deprivation and being blindfolded.  In contrast to their Israeli counterparts, Palestinian children do not have a right to be accompanied by their parents during questioning.  According to Defence for Children International, in 96% of cases, children were interrogated alone and seldom informed of their rights, especially their rights against self-incrimination.<\/p><p>  The Euro-Mid Observer for Human Rights also stated that at least 1,406 Palestinian children have been killed since 2000, including 263 children under the age of eight and 450 children under the age of 15.  This was before the military onslaught on Gaza, which killed over 2,100 people.  According to UN figures this included 519 children, 323 boys and 190 girls, 70% under the age of 12.  This is the true face of Israel's occupation.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in hope this motion improves the chances of a two-state solution and that Palestinian children can grow up in a safe and free Palestinian state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000057#DDD00100","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1418234400,"counter":1132,"content":"<p>I wish to acknowledge the presence of the Palestinian ambassador.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte romhat.  I welcome the Government decision to support this motion.  Yesterday the Opposition had occasion to catalogue the Government's faults and failings but the non-partisan position that has been adopted on this issue provides an instance of contrast.  In this case, the Government appears to have listened at last to the will of the Irish people and furthermore, it seems prepared to do the right thing.  That deserves acknowledgment as does the support of Independent Deputies and those of Fianna F&aacute;il.  If we can show unity on this issue, that represents real leadership.  Even though some may say the motion is not binding in itself, the level of consensus, nevertheless, represents an historic move that sends a strong message of solidarity to the beleaguered Palestinian people in their time of great need.<br\/><br\/>Ireland remains in the minority of UN member states that does not yet recognise the state of Palestine.  This motion would have Ireland join the global majority of 135 other countries which have already extended this recognition, including the eight EU member states which have done so.  For Ireland to sit on the sidelines waiting for an EU common position to emerge is to shame ourselves as a nation.  As a people we have our own experience of colonialism and foreign military occupation.  Ireland, therefore, has a particular responsibility for human rights leadership on this issue.  Let that start in earnest tonight.<br\/><br\/>I want to emphasise that the PLO and Palestinian National Assembly's 1988 declaration of the independence of the state of Palestinian, based on the pre-1967 borders, was a statement of compromise by the Palestinian leadership, representing a claim to only 22% of the historical territory of Palestine.  This most emphatically does not threaten the existence of the state of Israel; neither does it negate the Israeli people's right of self-determination.  Rather, it intentionally creates the conditions for a viable two-state solution and peaceful coexistence based on equality.  Like other Members, I have received correspondence from the Israeli Embassy urging me not to support this motion, to which I have proudly signed my name.  But the Israeli Embassy has got it utterly wrong on the question of self-determination when it states in its letter that, &quot;recognition of the Palestinian right to self-determination should be postponed.&quot;  To be clear, one people cannot veto the self-determination rights of another people - temporarily or otherwise.  It does not work that way.  The right to self-determination is one of those small handful of norms in international law considered <i>jus cogens<\/i>, which means it is a peremptory norm, protected by the UN charter but also as a matter of customary international law.  In other words, this fundamental human right cannot be conferred or deferred.  Interference with the lawful exercise of this right is prohibited and enforcement of the right itself is lawful.  In fact, it is the settled law of the UN charter, given expression in UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 on Friendly Relations Among States, that forcible deprivation of the right to self-determination of a people, including by way of foreign occupation or apartheid, activates the right of that people to obtain assistance from the international community in their resistance to same.  As significant as our motion is, it is simply an expression of a fulfilment of our international obligations.<\/p><p>It claims that &quot;Ireland as a neutral country, would be intervening in a foreign conflict&quot; by recognising Palestine.  On the contrary, such recognition constitutes a peaceful fulfilment of our international obligation either to assist or certainly not to obstruct the Palestinian exercise of the right to self-determination, in a manner fully consistent with international human rights law, international humanitarian law and the UN Charter provisions on the use of force.  Will the Minister bring these facts to the attention of the Israeli embassy and foreign ministry when he next has contact with them?<br\/><br\/>I also had correspondence from 900 prominent Israeli citizens who wholeheartedly endorse this motion and the recognition of Palestinian statehood.  These 900 citizens, including former Israeli ministers, diplomats and Nobel peace laureates, have stepped forward at great risk and deserve commendation.  So do those other progressive Jews in Israel and the world over, from the Women in Black to Jews Against the Occupation to the military conscientious objectors or <i>sarvanim<\/i>, including Yesh Gvul and others, whose humanity and commitment to equality and human rights has sustained them in their defiance of the illegal occupation of Palestine and the racist ideology that seeks to appropriate for itself the claim to represent all Jewish people.  This is not true, and no one should be fooled into believing this, but nor should we ever be drawn into anti-Semitic commentary.  Let me be clear, opposition to Zionist ideology and the racist Zionist state is one thing, but there is no room for anti-Semitism in the campaign for Palestine.  I acknowledge that the Jewish campaigners to whom I referred have a crucial contribution to make towards ending the occupation of the Palestinian territories and the ongoing illegal expansion of settlements contrary to international law.<br\/><br\/>I recognise and commend the Irish citizen at the head of the UN Human Rights Council's fact-finding mission on the 2014 Israeli bombardment of Gaza.  Professor William Schabas, a naturalised citizen of Jewish descent who lost family in the Holocaust, is also a world-renowned scholar and former director of the Irish Centre for Human Rights at NUI Galway.  He has come under sustained attack by Zionist campaigners for taking on this role ever since his appointment earlier this year.  Like the organised vilification of Professor Richard Falk and Judge Richard Goldstone before him, this has included subjection to a despicable smear campaign intended to impugn his academic integrity and his character as a jurist.  I state for the record that we are proud that an Irish citizen of his calibre has been selected to make this important contribution to holding to account those responsible for human rights violations and war crimes in this terrible phase of conflict.  We trust that his findings and recommendations will even-handedly expose and criticise perpetrators in the conflict, without fear or favour.  Professor Schabas deserves the support of the House.<br\/><br\/>Over the summer months in the course of the horrific bombardment of Gaza and the human suffering it tolled, many gruesome images of the suffering of the people of Gaza were seen by people in this country and beyond.  A particular picture summed up the tragedy of the situation for me.  This was of a young Palestinian girl, who I guess was no more than four or five, holding her doll and covering its eyes so it would not have to see the horror of what was around the child.  In passing this motion we assert not in abstract terms but in real human terms the rights of this Palestinian girl and every other Palestinian citizen to their freedom, state, dignity and human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000057#DDD00200","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418235000,"counter":1134,"content":"<p>I apologise to Deputy McDonald and the House because my phone malfunctioned during the course of the debate.  I also regret not being here at the start of the debate yesterday and earlier this evening.  I was away on international business and have only just returned.<\/p><p>  I will begin by responding to events this morning.  I deplore in the strongest possible terms the death earlier today of Palestinian leader Ziad Abu Ain following clashes in the West Bank.  I have already personally conveyed my condolences to Palestinian ambassador head of mission, who is present here this evening, my deep concern and that of the Irish people.  I will make it clear to the Israeli Government through the Irish ambassador to Israel, Eamonn McKee, who will contact the government at the highest level tomorrow.  We know from our own experience that we must not base decisions on the latest incident.  This is a point we constantly urge on Israelis and Palestinians.  This tragedy does not bear directly on our consideration of the specific issue of recognition, but it underlines powerfully the importance and priority we attach to ending the occupation of Palestinian land.<\/p><p>  I only have time to comment briefly on the motion and the debate thus far.  I will have to leave some of the wider issues raised on occupation for another occasion, but we will have this opportunity.  I took a very careful note of the motion presented by the Deputies opposite, and recommended to the Government that we should neither oppose nor seek to amend it.  The motion recognises our common goal of achieving a Palestinian state, which is something on which we can all agree and was outlined in the address of the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, yesterday.  We have always supported a viable two-state solution and we will continue to support this in any manner and by every means.<\/p><p>  Our priority goal is to work to begin or resume a process of real negotiations between the parties.  Despite previous failures, and consequent deep frustration, our own experience tells us this is the only way the conflict can be resolved and a fully functioning Palestinian state on all of its territory established.  We pursue this goal primarily though our engagement in the EU and the UN and also through our bilateral contacts.  As Deputies know, I attended recently the Norway and Egypt-hosted Gaza reconstruction conference, and I am exploring dates to visit to Israel and Palestine early in the New Year, when I intend to speak to all sides.<\/p><p>  Since taking office I have been active and vocal at EU level in particular, emphasising the need to combat actively destructive Israeli policies on the ground, especially with regard to settlements, which close off the prospects for peace.  Ireland also directly supports NGOs working on these critical justice and human rights issues, and something to which I attach special importance is helping those Israelis and Palestinians who are themselves working to make a difference.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, set out how Ireland is also engaged in substantial humanitarian relief work and in capacity building in the Palestinian institutions.  We are trying to meet the serious needs of the present and to build the future Palestinian state.  The possible recognition of Palestine may be one element of this multi-stranded approach.  It has been suggested that recognition now might help jump-start a stalemated process.  This was the judgment made by Sweden and is the spirit of this motion.<\/p><p>  As we have stated, achieving and recognising a Palestinian state has always been the objective of the Irish Government.  Everything we do on the Middle East is directed towards this aim.  While successive Governments have always seen recognition coming as part of an agreed peace, I have made it clear that I have absolutely no difficulty in principle with the idea of early recognition if I believe it can contribute to achieving a settlement of the conflict.  The current stalemate is not acceptable to me, and I am open to any action that can move things forward positively.  As Deputies know, at the last Foreign Affairs Council, prompted by Sweden's action and with my own support, the EU began a process of reflection among Ministers as to the implications and possibilities of recognition, and I believe this is an important, responsible and reasonable approach to take.  I will ensure the House is kept fully informed.<\/p><p>I thank everybody who contributed to this important debate.  I will advance matters further at Government level following an in-depth political and policy analysis with a view to ensuring that our actions will make a positive contribution to the objectives clearly expressed in the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000058#EEE00200","speaker":"1055","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418235600,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, who is sharing time with Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Adams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000059#FFF00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1418235600,"counter":1137,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom cinneadh Lucht Oibre and Fine Gael gan r&uacute;n Shinn F&eacute;in a sh&eacute;anadh a moladh.

Both Houses of the Oireachtas are united in this demand and the Government will not oppose it.  There is now a real opportunity to build on Ireland's strong record of solidarity with the people of Palestine and after tonight we can much more ambitious for our role in their future.<\/p><p>  Last night, the Minister of State stated that it has been the position in Europe, supported by the current and previous governments, that the recognition of the state of Palestine should be dependent on a comprehensive peace agreement, as a Palestinian state cannot exist without the ending of the Israeli occupation.  This is a crucial point, and it sets out a fundamental flaw in the EU's position on the right of the people of Palestine to have their state recognised.<\/p><p>  Israel will not end its occupation in the absence of sufficient international pressure to do so.  As the Minister of State acknowledged last night, Israel's construction of illegal settlements is relentless.  The people of Gaza are on their knees.  Israel's aggression in Jerusalem and beyond has escalated.  More recently, extreme Israeli nationalism has come to the fore in expressing itself in the most depressing manner as citizens openly dehumanise their Palestinian neighbours.<\/p><p>  The Government needs to have more confidence in Ireland's ability to lead in Europe.  It is deeply troubling that Ministers believe that by speaking up in Europe on matters of such importance we will marginalise or weaken our position in the EU.  Last night, the Minister of State told us that we can only push the envelope if we are inside it.  That analysis is nonsense, as nobody is pushing the envelope in an EU-wide context.<\/p><p>  The international community has failed the Palestinian people for decades and the Government's failure to respond appropriately to Israel's latest barbaric assault on Gaza, a densely populated small tract of land blockaded from the rest of the world, has only helped to destabilise the region further.  Waiting for someone else to lead is no longer an option.  Ireland has a moral obligation to speak out.  By leading on issues of human rights and against what is an apartheid regime we can tread where others must follow.  Recognition of Palestine is the critical first step in ensuring that the state of Palestine is not only formally established but that it will be functioning in the future.  People need to see and feel the change to believe in it.<\/p><p>  How on earth can we the international community expect people living in an apartheid state for generations believe us when we say we will recognise their right to a state of their own, but only when Israel says so?  This is not a coherent strategy on the part of the European Union.  It is another failure of EU politics, a failure that we should no longer accept.  It is now time to lead by example.  We cannot stand idly by on these issues.  We cannot outsource our moral responsibility to a paralysed EU.  We cannot surrender what is left of our democratic independence.  To do so would be to squander the goodwill and influence that has been built up by dozens of Irish generations.  Independence is only real when it is exercised.<\/p><p>  The Government must be confident in Ireland's commitment to human rights, to democracy and to peace.  We cannot be afraid to stand up against oppression, against the violent military blockade of Gaza and against the apartheid regime that exists across Israel.  Recognition of the Palestinian state is a strong signal of solidarity, of a peaceful future and a commitment to human rights.

T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an Rialtas tar eis glacadh leis an r&uacute;n.<\/p><p>I welcome the Government's support for the motion.  I also welcome last night's contribution by the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Dara Murphy, when he said: &quot;It has been the objective of this Government since it took office to work to bring about the achievement... of a fully sovereign state of Palestine.&quot;  However, such a supportive attitude towards Palestine was not apparent this summer when Ireland froze in the international spotlight.  I and countless other Irish people were ashamed to hear that the Government decided to abstain on a UN Human Rights Council vote condemning war crimes during Israel's assault on Gaza during the summer months.<\/p><p>  I recognise that there are two sides to this conflict so what are they?  On one side is an immensely stronger occupier and coloniser that has meted out what amounts to collective punishment on the people of Palestine.  On the other side are the oppressed and colonised, struggling for their freedom, human rights and dignity.  Sadly, this motion aside, the Government has clearly divested itself of any remnant of independent thought by entering into what appears to be a slavish pact that does nothing to challenge Israel.  The Irish people have a long history of supporting the Palestinian struggle to survive and have formed deep bonds with their people.  We must again be to the fore.  Thousands of Irish people protested over the onslaught against the population of Gaza all over this island during the months of July and August this year and they demanded action.  The motion calls on the Government to join the international movement to universally recognise the state of Palestine and to improve the chance of a real and lasting peace.<\/p><p>  Recent months have seen a change at an EU level.  We have seen Sweden recognise Palestine, the first EU member state to do so as a member.  The Government has tried previously to convince us that it is more prudent to push issues surrounding Palestine through the EU route.  However, as we have seen time and again, this dilutes the message and panders to the Israeli Government, which has often acted as if it is above the laws that apply to every other state.  We should work with our EU partners on international issues, but we should never fear or negate our responsibility to act as an independent State with our own independent foreign policy that has human rights at its core.<\/p><p>  We also have the great wrong of the continued building of illegal settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem with more than 500,000 illegal Israeli settlers in the occupied Palestinian territories.  This must stop.  The walls must also be broken down, metaphorically and physically.  That a wall, much higher than even the Berlin Wall, remains in the West Bank should serve as a stark reminder that, even though Palestine might not be covered on the main news bulletins at the moment, segregation and discrimination continue unfettered.<\/p><p>  I am sure that Ireland recognising the Palestinian state will help to move peace talks forward.  I note that the Seanad motion on 22 October was unanimously accepted.  It called &quot;on the Government to formally recognise the State of Palestine and do everything it can at the international level to help secure a viable two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict&quot;.  This House must follow suit and add Ireland to the list of countries that are progressive and supportive of those who are currently being discriminated against and denied their fundamental human rights, yet keep their eyes firmly on peace.<\/p><p>  In my role as health spokesperson, I must look to the urgent work that is needed to help rehabilitate the health system in Gaza following the summer onslaught.  The conflict saw the damage or destruction of over half of the hospitals and health centres that existed.  Of course, these were poorly equipped to begin with due to the unjust blockade imposed on Gaza.  Far from ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel, this blockade condemns countless innocents to abject poverty and highly curtailed rights, and is likely to fuel a backlash.  The blockade must be lifted.  It is a great shame that we must again call for such basic rights to be respected.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The conflict also saw 11,000 people injured, which put great pressure on their ailing services which often are unable to provide essential medicines such as painkillers or even latex gloves.  Even basics such as water and fuel were in short supply.<\/p><p> That the president of my party, Deputy Gerry Adams, was unable to enter Gaza last week shows how Israel thinks it alone is allowed to dictate the present and future of the Palestinian people.  This motion is in many ways a first step, a step to ensuring that the Palestinian people get to decide their own future.<\/p><p> I thank all those who have contacted me regarding this motion, and many have done so.  I wholeheartedly support it and ask the Government to ensure it is acted upon with urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000059#FFF00400","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418236200,"counter":1140,"content":"<p>T&aacute; go leor dul chun cinn bainte amach do mhuintir na Pailist&iacute;ne anseo sa D&aacute;il le dh&aacute; l&aacute; anuas.

As we come to the end of this debate, I particularly welcome the decision of the Government not to oppose the motion.  When we finish this debate, both Houses of the Oireachtas - I recognise an Seanad&oacute;ir Averil De Paor a rinne p&aacute;irt maith sa Seanad leis an obair seo - will support the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, recognise a Palestinian state, and endorse the right of the Palestinian people to independence and sovereignty.  This is a substantive and positive development which means that we are standing with progressive opinion, including in Israel, which wants a lasting peace arrangement and supports the recognition of a Palestinian state.<\/p><p>  In the debate, Ministers and Deputies spoke frequently of standing up for the rights of the oppressed, but always in the context of EU policy.  My colleagues and I have consistently argued, however, that this State needs to have its own foreign policy positions based on human rights and international law.  This should always be the case.  In the course of this debate, others have said that this motion is a symbolic act.  Fair enough, but let the Government move beyond symbolism, as the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has promised.  The passing of this motion, in conjunction with similar motions in parliaments across the European Union, is an important act of solidarity with the people of Palestine.  It is also an important act of solidarity with the people of Israel.<\/p><p>  The dangers and tensions were underlined today with the sad news of the death, during a protest on the occupied West Bank, of Ziad Abu Ein, a cabinet minister in the Palestinian government.  Ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhr&oacute;n a thabhairt do chlann Abu Ein.  I dedicate this D&aacute;il motion to the deceased minister and his family.  I also extend our sympathies and solidarity to Ambassador Abdelrazek and ask him to pass these on to President Abbas and the Palestinian Authority.  Abu Ein died during a non-violent demonstration to mark international human rights day.  He and others were planting olive trees, symbols of peace, on land owned by a Palestinian but which, because of a nearby illegal Israeli settlement, is mostly off limits to Palestinians.<\/p><p>  I and others explained during the debate the extent of the control the Israeli Government exerts through its policies and military, as well as suppressing the daily lives of Palestinians.  The separation wall, the sterile roads that Palestinians are banned from, the systematic ill-treatment of Palestinians and the denial of peaceful protest are all symptomatic of an Israeli apartheid system that brings shame to that state.  It also brings shame to the international community which has failed to defend international law and has failed the people of Palestine and Israel.<\/p><p>  This is exactly the right time for this motion.  It is also the right time for the Irish Government to stand with Palestinian and Israeli citizens who are taking risks every day for peace.  Now is the time for the Government to take up a leadership role in encouraging greater action by the international community to uphold international law.  It is the right time to build on this debate and motion.  I call on the Government to act with all speed to upgrade the Palestinian mission to an embassy, as well as pushing for greater action by our colleagues in the international community.  I commend the Oireachtas for agreeing to this historic recognition of the rights of the people of Palestine.  Long live the people of Palestine.
