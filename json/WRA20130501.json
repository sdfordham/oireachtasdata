A landlord may not serve a notice of termination on such a tenant except in very clearly defined circumstances such as a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations in relation to the tenancy, where the landlord intends to sell the property within 3 months after the termination of the tenancy or where the landlord requires the dwelling for his or her own occupation or for that of a family member. <\/p><p>The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is an initiative announced by the Government in July 2004 to cater for the accommodation needs of\u00a0 persons in\u00a0 receipt of rent supplement, normally for more than 18 months and who were assessed as having a long-term housing need.\u00a0 One of the main features of the scheme is that local authorities in sourcing accommodation for these households make use of the private sector and enter into contractual arrangements to secure medium to long-term availability of rented accommodation.\u00a0 A Residential Tenancy Agreement is entered into by all three parties and, as with the other such arrangements, the tenancy is governed b y the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. \u00a0 Notwithstanding this, as RAS is deemed to be a social housing support, the local authority retains the responsibility to source further accommodation for a RAS household, should the dwelling that the household is living in become unavailable through no fault of their own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100063#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":33,"content":"<p>Question No. 21 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Waiting Lists","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100063#WRB01450"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[20492\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100063#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has explored, in the interest of addressing the large housing waiting list, the possibility of purchasing some properties for social housing areas where demand and the drop in property prices suit same.","asker":"1080","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[20416\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100063#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the extent to which in the course of a review of the full extent of the local authority housing need arising from failure of his predecessors to make adequate provision in this regard, any plans have been put in place, to reintroduce a capital housing programme with particular reference to addressing the housing crisis affecting those who traditionally relied on local authority housing as a first step in meeting their housing needs;

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.<\/p><p>  The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to &euro;287m in 2013, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In July 2012, I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. I am monitoring expenditure under my Department&rsquo;s housing programme for 2013 together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014.<\/p><p>  In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities must operate, the final outcome for 2012 is expected to be in the region of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units. Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year.\u00a0However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.<\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes.<\/p><p>  Regarding the issues surrounding the refusal by some landlords to accept rent supplement, it should be noted that while the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants in the private residential rented sector it does not refer to rent supplement. The Equal Status Acts 2000 &ndash; 2004, which come under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, provide protection against direct and indirect discrimination outside of employment on a range of grounds. However, being in receipt of rent supplement is not among these grounds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100063#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100064#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[20474\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100064#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the date of the last meeting of Comhairle na Tuaithe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1096","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[20475\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100064#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the latest date on which he attended a meeting of Comhairle na Tuaithe or the national co-ordinating committee of RAPID; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 57 together.   <\/p><p>Comhairle na Tuaithe (The Countryside Council) continuously supports and oversees the implementation of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy and its associated schemes, programmes and activities, including the Walks Scheme.

The Committee includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector. Real progress is being made in tackling and resolving the issues faced by residents of unfinished estates and the Committee is meeting on a regular basis to oversee this effort. The NCC has produced a Guidance Manual on Resolving and Managing Unfinished Estates, a Key Stakeholders Code of Practice, and a Guide for Residents Living in Unfinished Housing Developments, all of which are available at .<\/p><p><br \/>  Site Resolution Plans (SRP's) have been identified by the NCC as a key tool in resolving issues associated with unfinished housing developments. Such plans enable stakeholders, including developers, local authorities, financial institutions, NAMA and residents to collaborate in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites. The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership. Such solutions also take account of the best interests of residents.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Public Safety Initiative for Unfinished Housing Developments my Department has made allocations totalling some &euro;3.877 million to 21 local authorities from the funding made available to address immediate public safety issues. In 2011, &euro;2.49 million was approved, in 2012 &euro;1.38 million was approved, and my Department will continue to examine and approve claims in 2013 as they are submitted by Local Authorities. The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites. To date, a total of &euro;2.515 million has been drawn down by local authorities. It is not considered necessary to allocate any additional funding to this scheme at this time as the funds currently available are adequate to service this initiative. This funding is targeted at those developments where a developer has abandoned the development and serious public safety concerns exist. In circumstances where a developer is still active it is the responsibility of the local authority planning department to pursue the developer for completion of the development in line with the terms of the original planning permission. Similarly, where a developer is inactive but still in place the enforcement of the planning conditions is a matter for the relevant planning authority.   <\/p><p><br \/>  As outlined in the National Housing Development Survey 2012, the results of which I published in November 2012, real progress has been made in tackling the issues faced by the residents of unfinished housing developments, with a 37% decrease in the number of unfinished developments since 2010 and nearly 300 developments effectively resolved in the last 12 months. I am satisfied that the work carried out through the NCC continues to tackle the problems associated with unfinished housing developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100064#WRC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Voluntary Housing Sector Issues","counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100064#WRC02250"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[20417\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100064#WRC02300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the total number of houses provided under the capital allowance schemes and handed over to various voluntary housing bodies throughout the country since the inception of the scheme on a county basis; the full extent of the total cost of all such schemes to the Exchequer; the extent to which all such bodies continue to comply with regulations governing their operation; if the State investment is guaranteed and returnable to the State directly or via the local authorities in the event of non-compliance with regulations, articles of association or company law; the extent to which any breaches of the relevant regulations have been discovered and addressed by location; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[20930\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100064#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the total number of voluntary housing organisations, the companies for which were in abeyance or struck off in the past ten years, the capital for which was provided for in its entirety through the capital allowance scheme; if in such cases the housing stock concerned reverted to the local authority as provided for under the scheme; if any specific action under the provisions of company law followed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 156 together.<\/p><p>At the end of 2012 a total of 25,371 units of accommodation had been provided by approved voluntary and co-operative housing bodies under my Department&rsquo;s capital funding schemes since the inception of the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) in 1984 and the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) in 1992. Exchequer funding of &euro;1.3 billion was provided under the CAS for the provision of some 15,262 units of accommodation for persons with specific categories of housing need such as older people, the homeless and persons with a physical, intellectual or mental health disability.<\/p><p>Under the CLSS, mortgage finance was provided to approved housing bodies by way of loans from the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to meet the cost of providing social rented accommodation for low-income families. At end 2012, approved housing bodies had provided some 10,109 units of accommodation and loans to the value of around &euro;1.4 billion had been drawn down from the HFA. The CLSS was terminated in 2009 and expenditure in respect of projects over the period 2010 to end 2012 relates to projects at construction or approved to commence construction prior to the decision to terminate the scheme.<\/p><p>A breakdown of expenditure and the number of house completions on a county basis is not readily available for the period 1984 to 1992. Information in respect of individual CAS projects completed over that period is held on file in hard copy format only and disaggregated on the basis of the relevant approved housing body. Compilation on a county basis would involve an inordinate amount of time and resources.<\/p><p>Details of overall expenditure and numbers of units provided across all local authorities under the CAS scheme from its inception in 1984 to 1992, together with details of the funding and numbers of units provided under the CAS and CLSS on a county basis from 1993 to end 2012, are set out in the table below.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to the voluntary housing capital funding schemes relates primarily to the provision of funds to support the annual construction and housing acquisitions programmes by the sector. It is a matter for the relevant housing authority to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the schemes and to have appropriate oversight and liaison arrangements in place for the effective administration of the schemes and for ensuring that the investment in voluntary housing is safeguarded.<\/p><p>Funding for both schemes was provided by the relevant housing authority to the Approved Housing Body (AHB) in the form of a 30 year annuity mortgage loan. The terms of the scheme provide that repayments of principal and interest charges due from the AHB may be fully waived, provided the AHB continues to comply with the terms and conditions of the schemes. Should the AHB fail to comply with the terms and conditions of the schemes at any time during the term of the mortgage, the AHB will be liable for the principal and interest charges and which will be recoverable by the housing authority.<\/p><p>704 housing associations were approved by my Department under Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992 for the provision and management of housing. In 2012 my Department identified 86 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) that neither produced housing stock nor applied for any funding from my Department. These companies were no longer registered with the Companies Registration Office and their approved status with my Department was rescinded.<\/p><p>My Department is now proceeding to examine the status of more than 100 additional bodies that also appear to be inactive, and I expect to de-list further bodies in 2013 in order to present a more accurate picture of the size of the sector operating in Ireland.<\/p><p>My Department is developing an enabling regulatory framework for the voluntary housing sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners. The development of this framework will take some time to complete. In the meantime, my Department has been engaging with the sector on the development of a voluntary code of good governance. The code will outline minimum regulatory standards that will apply to all approved housing bodies with additional standards and requirements applying to larger bodies. It is intended formally to launch the code in the coming weeks once all the issues raised during the consultation period have been considered.<\/p><p>My Department has not been notified of any case where an approved housing body was required to repay the mortgage loan to the housing authority. Any actions in relation to company law would be a matter for the Companies Registration Office.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>                      -<br \/><\/th><th><div>No. of Units<br \/>CAS

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants in the private rented residential sector.<b><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  My Department conducted a review of the Act in 2009 with a specific emphasis on whether the Act best supports the PRTB's key functions and on whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector. The outcomes of the review were announced in April 2010 and the drafting of the General Scheme of a Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the review was approved by Government in July 2011. The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012 was published on 19 July 2012 and passed <b>Second Stage<\/b><font color=\"#222222\">in the <\/font><b>D&aacute;il on 24 January 2013.<\/b><b>It <\/b>builds on what has been achieved by the Residential Tenancies Act and the PRTB, and provides for the further development of the rental sector into the future.   <\/p><p>Among the main issues addressed by the amending legislation are -   <\/p><p><br \/>  - the extension of the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act to Approved Housing Body tenancies;<\/p><p><br \/>  - the Board of the PRTB to be reduced from 15 to 12 members;<\/p><p><br \/>  - the separation of the governance and quasi-judicial functions of the Board;<\/p><p><br \/>  - the merger of the PRTB and the Rent Tribunal; and<\/p><p><br \/>  - the simplification and streamlining of the mediation process.   <\/p><p><br \/>  While the Bill addresses a wide range of issues, there are some other aspects still under development which I hope to bring forward for consideration during the Bill's passage through the Oireachtas. In particular, I am keen to progress a number of key on-going concerns within the private rented sector such as the over holding of rented property by tenants and the illegal retention of tenants' deposits by landlords. <\/p><p><br \/>  On foot of the commitment in the <i>Programme for Government 2011<\/i> to introduce a tenancy deposit protection scheme I asked the PRTB to commission research on such a scheme and to report back to me with recommendations.

A key conclusion in that regard is that such an office should not be simply inserted as a further layer of governance and administration in addition to the current local government structures. The establishment of an office with more far-reaching powers, functions and budgetary capacity would be likely to require significant changes in existing local government arrangements. The implications in this regard and the changes required at local government level would need to be considered carefully. <\/p><p>  The approach to be taken in relation to local governance for Dublin must take account of the foregoing factors. The Action Programme indicated that a special forum or colloquium of the elected members of Dun Laoghaire &ndash; Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin County Councils and Dublin City Council would be convened by the Lord Mayor of Dublin to consider the options for local governance in Dublin ,   including the potential for a directly elected Mayor for a Dublin Metropolitan Area. It is intended that proposals arising from the colloquium will be put for decision through a plebiscite in 2014, which I envisage will be held alongside the local elections. This will provide for suitable democratic debate and consultation on all dimensions of the issue. <\/p><p>  I have recently written to the Lord Mayor of Dublin setting out matters which I consider would need to be addressed by the elected members of the four local authorities when developing proposals to be put before the electorate in the plebiscite.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100065#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dormant Accounts Fund Deposits","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100065#WRD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[20467\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100065#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the amount of money in the Dormant Accounts Fund, less the reserve; the amount of commitments entered into that have not been paid out broken down by year of sanction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":89,"content":"<p>The Dormant Accounts Acts provide for an annual transfer by credit institutions and insurance undertakings of monies in accounts determined to be dormant into the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF).

It is intended to facilitate access to the uplands for hill walking and similar activities.  A pilot scheme has been developed at Mount Gable in Connemara and there is general agreement among the relevant stakeholders that the initial proposed Carrantuohill scheme be extended to the entire MacGillicuddy Reeks in Co Kerry.

A National Indemnity Scheme , to be managed in conjunction with the State Claims Agency, is currently under negotiation.  The proposed scheme would indemnify private landowners nationally against claims from recreational users for injury or damage to property.

I expect this process to be completed shortly. The City Council will then be in a position to provide projected multi-annual funding requirements for the future regeneration of both areas.

The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.  When I published the statement, I announced a set of indicators which will be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed.

The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney general (1980), which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.<\/p><p>  However, a cohabiting couple where both partners are working get, in total, the same tax credits as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership (i.e. &euro;3,300).

Married couples or couples in a civil partnership where both work get the same treatment.<\/p><p>  The difference between the two groups is the ability of married couples or civil partners to transfer certain tax credits such as the personal\/married credits and part of the tax bands, i.e. the tax band of &euro;65,600 available to married couples or couples in a civil partnership with two incomes in 2013 is transferable between spouses up to a maximum of &euro;41,800.

CBA is a technical evaluation tool for appraising the merits of public expenditure projects.  It is  one of a number of appraisal methods &ndash; as outlined and explained further  in the Public Spending Code &ndash; and its most common application is for evaluating proposed new investments in physical infrastructure projects and proposed new schemes of current expenditure.  There are very clear rules and guidelines in this area set out in the Public Spending Code, which obliges all Irish public bodies to treat public funds with care and uphold value-for-money best practices.   As the Deputy is aware, the programme of reducing the size of the public service is connected with reducing the cost of Government and reforming public services.  It is clearly not a new spending proposal.  <\/p><p>  I expect that the Deputy&rsquo;s interest is in assessment of the pros and cons of the Government&rsquo;s policy on public service reform, including reduced staffing levels.  A critical factor informing our policy approach has had to be the imperative of reducing our large deficit and bringing the public finances back onto a sustainable footing.  Many of our choices have been difficult, but with public service pay and pensions accounting for over one-third of current Government expenditure, it is clear that this area has to continue to contribute to that effort, and headcount reduction has been a key element of our approach to containing and reducing these costs.<\/p><p>  Nonetheless, while working to address the stark realities of the public finances and the unsustainable cost of the public service, the Government&rsquo;s measured approach to the matter seeks to mitigate the potential disadvantages of reduced staffing levels.  To this end, the numbers reduction policy takes account of priority areas, by allowing for replacement of key staff especially in the education sector and in key areas of health; gives sectorial and local management discretion in exactly how staff resources are allocated within an area; provides a framework for redeployment of staff across the public service;  and includes introducing new streamlined services such as shared services, which allow functions to be maintained and indeed enhanced with reduced staff levels and at a lower cost.<\/p><p>  Reform of the public service is necessary both because we need to reduce costs given our serious fiscal position, and because the quality of public services for the citizen needs to be continually improved and value-for-money for the taxpayer protected.   The Government&rsquo;s reform plan is comprehensive and ambitious.  It captures a wide range of reform projects, including: ICT infrastructure projects to support enhanced automation, better online services and shared payroll and HR services; change management projects  to support more effective work practices, redeployment, rostering and manpower planning; organisation restructuring, involving mergers of previously separate state bodies and of divisions and work areas within organisations.<\/p><p>  These reform projects will allow the public service to function more efficiently and more cost effectively over the medium term. Crucially, they are facilitating the delivery of services while making headcount reduction.  Of course, where once-off investment costs arise in these reform areas &ndash; such as new ICT platforms for example - there must be full compliance with the Public Spending Code, including where appropriate under the Code the need to carry out a CBA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100076#WRP01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions Issues","counter":323,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100076#WRP01150"},{"type":"question","counter":324,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[20599\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100076#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when his officials will meet with the Alliance of Retired Public Servants in relation to the decision to legislate for certain changes in respect of public service pensions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":325,"content":"<p>My officials have written to the Alliance of Retired Public Servants with a view to a meeting in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware ,following  public servants non-acceptance of the measures proposed by the Labour Relations Commission, the Government has requested the CEO of the LRC to make contact with the parties to establish whether or not there is a basis for a negotiated agreement to meet budgetary targets.

The Act states that the registers must be made available for public inspection.<\/p><p><br \/>  In regard to the DSA and PIA, a debtor, through their personal insolvency practitioner applies for a Protective Certificate.  If granted by the Court, this Certificate protects the debtor for a period of 70 days from the commencement or enforcement of any action against them by creditors. Thus it is necessary that the debtor concerned is identified by inclusion in the Register of Protective Certificates so as to alert creditors and to prevent unnecessary actions against the debtor on their part.  The other benefit of inclusion in the Register of Protective Certificates is that it serves as a notification to a creditor that the debtor will be applying for a DSA or PIA.<\/p><p><br \/>  Should a debtor, through their personal insolvency practitioner, successfully obtain a DSA or PIA, then that fact must be recorded in the appropriate Register.  This provision, <i>inter alia, <\/i>alerts potential creditors should the debtor seek to obtain additional credit while subject to a DSA or PIA.  There is no question of a debtor being named or shamed by being included in a Register.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is intended that only the minimum necessary information should be recorded in the various Registers to fulfil their function.  The naming of individuals involved in and obtaining the benefits of an insolvency process is standard practice in many jurisdictions around the world, including in the United Kingdom. <\/p><p><br \/>  However, I am aware of the need to add further relevant provisions in regard to the operation of the registers and my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, is preparing the necessary amendments for approval by Government and presentation to the Oireachtas in the very near future.  It is intended that the relevant amendments will be incorporated in the Courts Bill 2013 which is presently being processed through the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100083#WRW01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Abduction","counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100083#WRW01450"},{"type":"question","counter":473,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[20651\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100083#WRW01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will investigate the case of an Irish person (details supplied) illegally taken while on holiday in breach of UN Convention on Human Rights.","asker":"1015","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":474,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual cases.

The Bill includes a number of provisions which relate to the professional education and training of legal practitioners. For example, under section 9 of the Bill the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority is charged, among other things, with keeping under review the admission requirements and policies of the Law Society relating to the solicitors' profession and the availability and quality of education and training (including ongoing training) for solicitors, including how and by whom such education and training is provided.  In addition, section 30 of the Bill provides for the Authority to report to the Minister for Justice and Equality on a range of matters following a public consultation and reporting process.  These matters include, specifically, the education and training (including ongoing training) arrangements in the State for legal practitioners and the manner in which such education and training is provided.  I would expect that the issue of apprenticeships, including access to them, will be among those aspects of the training and qualification of legal practitioners that will be kept under active review by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority - while also being addressed as part of the public consultations on the education and training of legal practitioners upon which a report is to provided by the Authority within one year of its establishment day.<\/p><p>  In relation to the current situation, I am aware of the fact that there are aspects of the economic crisis that are having an impact on the availability of apprenticeships.  For example, there has been a reduction in the number of practising solicitors, of whom over 1,000 are reported to remain unemployed, and this has been accompanied by some decline in the number of solicitors in practise who are in a position to support paid apprenticeships.  However, notwithstanding these challenges and those that might arise from the question of possible disadvantage being raised by the Deputy, it is my understanding that the Law Society has a long-standing scheme in place under which it provides support and guidance to prospective solicitor apprentices.  This includes a facility under which apprentices can be matched-up with solicitors' firms who are able to register their apprenticeship vacancies with the Society for that specific purpose.  An area of the Society&rsquo;s website for members is also set aside for solicitors apprentices.  I would, therefore, urge any person seeking a solicitors apprenticeship at this very challenging time to augment their own efforts by continuing to draw upon the available supports of the Law Society in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100084#WRX00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":480,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100084#WRX00350"},{"type":"question","counter":481,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[20614\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100084#WRX00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to Monasterevin Garda Station, County Kildare; and the total number of Garda&iacute; assigned for the whole county.","asker":"1102","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":482,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[20616\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100084#WRX00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there are designated hours of opening for Monasterevin Garda Station, County Kildare; and what are these hours.","asker":"1102","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":483,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 182 together.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that as of 31 March 2013, there were 320 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Kildare Garda Division, of which 4 are assigned to Monasterevin Garda Station.

This would be very significant bearing in mind that there were 33 bankruptcy adjudications in 2011 and 35 in 2012. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100085#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Staff","counter":513,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100085#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":514,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[17741\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100085#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the way that tip staff in the court services are paid expenses sometimes in excess of their salary; if he will confirm that tip staff come under the Croke Park Agreement; the justification that is made for this expense to be paid to them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":515,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[17740\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100085#WRY00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the way court tip staff or criers are doubling their pay due to expenses that are afforded to them; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that last year tip staff claimed &euro;990,000 in expenses and in 2011 more than &euro;2.7 million was claimed which showed an average of &euro;13,200 for 75 court tip staff; his plans to address this expense; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":516,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 192 together.<\/p><p>  The management and administration of the courts including responsibility for the provision of information is a matter for the Courts Service.  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that a total of 74 tipstaff are employed by the Courts Service in the grades of Usher and Crier who act as personal assistants to Judges of the High Court and Circuit Court respectively in the carrying out of their official functions.  They are civil servants covered by the Croke Park Agreement and are entitled to claim for travel and subsistence incurred while on official duties and overtime in respect of extra attendance.  Among their duties are maintaining proper order in the courtroom, managing the judge&rsquo;s chambers, the provision of personal security to the judge and driving the judge when needed.  All expenses are paid in accordance with Civil Service regulations and subject to verification and audit.<\/p><p>  I am informed that the total amount paid in expenses to ushers and criers was &euro;561,043 in 2012 and &euro;635,536 in 2011, totalling &euro;1.2m. Subsistence expenses are incurred in respect of expenses related to necessary absence from the normal place of work on official duty.  The necessity for subsistence expenses arise when these staff members must travel with their Judges to Court sittings at various locations around the country.  The amount of expenses paid varies widely and is very much related to the jurisdiction within which individual Judges work, the size of the geographical area covered by the judge, number of locations of court sittings and length of hearings.  Ushers and Criers are also entitled to Extra Attendance payments in respect of overtime necessarily worked. A flat rate is applied no matter when the extra attendance is provided.  I am informed that all payments made are subject to verification and audit. It should be noted that these permanent support staff are only available to judges appointed prior to 1 January, 2012.  Under legislation sponsored by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, support to judges appointed after that date is provided by legally qualified Judicial Assistants who are engaged on temporary contracts of no longer than two years duration and are equipped to carry out a range of legal research functions in addition to personal assistant functions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100085#WRY01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":517,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100085#WRY01050"},{"type":"question","counter":518,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[17568\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100085#WRY01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to introduce an amendment to Section 37 of the Employment Equality Act that is needed to enshrine in legislation the rights of lesbian, gay and bisexual teachers; and his plans to include provision that will also protect the rights of transgender teachers.","asker":"984","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":519,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Parliamentary Questions No. 54456 of 4 December 2012, No. 2999 of 22 January 2013, No. 4077 of 5 February 2013 and No. 10664 of 27 February 2013.  As I explained in response to these previous questions, the Government has undertaken in its Programme for Government to ensure that people of non-faith or minority religious backgrounds and publically identified lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people should not be deterred from training or taking up employment as teachers in the State.  I have previously expressed concern about the potential impact of section 37 of the Employment Equality Acts on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. This section is designed to allow schools and other institutions to maintain their religious ethos. It was examined by the Supreme Court in 1996 when the Employment Equality Bill of 1996 was referred to it under Article 26 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court found that it is a reasonable balancing in legislation of the different rights involved, including chiefly the right to earn a living and the rights to freedom of religion and association. I am concerned however that, in practice, the balance is not a fair one and that in practice this provision can operate in a way that is unfair to LGBT persons. I consider that an extensive consultative process and formal assessment of the options should be undertaken.  On 16 April, I announced the names of 14 new members designate of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. In advance of legislation to establish the new Commission, the members designate will take up their positions on the two existing bodies that are being merged, the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission. I will be meeting the Commissioners shortly. As I have previously explained, I intend to ask them to examine this issue as a priority. I hope they will complete this consultation process quickly and report on their views and recommendations to the two Ministers centrally concerned, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn and myself as the Minister for Justice and Equality and to the House.  I am committed, once this necessary consultation process is completed, to bringing forward Government proposals for any necessary anti-discrimination amendment to this provision. In this context, the Government has welcomed the Private Members' Employment Equality (Amendment) (No.2) Bill which has passed Second Stage in the Seanad. During the Second Stage reading of the Bill, my colleague Minister of State Kathleen Lynch signalled to the House the Government's intention to take forward this Bill, with any amendments that might be needed, with Government support for enactment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100085#WRY01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Services Regulation","counter":520,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100085#WRY01250"},{"type":"question","counter":521,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[18628\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100085#WRY01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the level of cost saving to enterprises arising from the changes to legal services.","asker":"1080","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":522,"content":"<p>The Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 gives legislative expression to the commitment in the Programme for Government to <i>&quot;establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&quot;. <\/i>Furthermore, as a sectoral objective under the EU\/IMF\/ECB Troika Memorandum of Understanding, it supports the objectives of structural reform, national competitiveness and early economic recovery, building on the relevant recommendations of the Legal Costs Working Group and the Competition Authority<\/p><p>. The Bill, which has completed Second Stage,is due to commence Committee Stage in July and is a key component of the Government's strategy to reduce legal costs in this country by way of increasing our competitiveness.  The Legal Services Regulation Bill makes extensive provision, particularly in Part 9, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients. The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account if disputed costs are submitted for adjudication. These cost transparency measures will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors and will enable those availing of legal services to identify costs and their basis more clearly, including by way of comparison with other possible legal service providers.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Bill it will no longer be permissible to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business. It will no longer be permissible to charge Junior Counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees. Legal practitioners will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in Section 90 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated. A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question.  The Bill also provides that a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will deal with disputes about legal costs - at present these are dealt with by the Office of the Taxing-Master. The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated with greater transparency.  The Office will be empowered to prepare Legal Costs Guidelines. It will establish and maintain a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will include the outcomes and reasons for its determinations about disputed legal costs.<\/p><p> Two new Taxing-Masters have been appointed by public competition under the enhanced qualification criteria of Part 14 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 to prepare the way for these modernisation measures. Taking account of developments in other open common law jurisdictions the Bill seeks to address the danger of Irish law firms and legal practitioners operating at a cost disadvantage while consumers of their services continue to lack the benefits of value that come with being able to shop around a range of alternative legal service providers. Several types of new alternative business structure have been, or continue to be, rolled-out in England and Wales, Scotland, Australia, Germany, Netherlands and parts of Canada in direct competition with Irish legal service providers - for example, solicitors, accountants and insurers practising as one business or &quot;multi-disciplinary practice&quot; providing their complementary services in a pooled and more cost-effective setting.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Bill, therefore, contains numerous measures aimed at opening up the provision of legal services to more responsive and more competitive legal service models building on the enormous advances that have been made in supporting business technologies. In other provisions the Bill lifts existing restrictions on direct professional access to a barrister and on barristers who share premises or costs from advertising themselves as such a group. The Bill also allows that a barrister in employment may provide legal services for his or her employer.  Through its extensive legal costs transparency provisions and its provision for modern and more competitive business alternatives, the Legal Services Regulation Bill is providing an opportunity to ameliorate the cost to business and other consumers of legal services while, by the same token, creating new business opportunities for the legal services sector.  The Bill is, therefore, introducing structural reforms that will make legal costs far more amenable to public scrutiny and competition than they ever have been in the past. These reforms will also put us in a far better position to monitor the future impact of legal costs on business and the economy on an ongoing basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100085#WRY01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":524,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100085#WRY01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100085#WRY01450"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[20573\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100085#WRY01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a 2012 agri-environment options scheme 1 payment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":525,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from the 1st   September 2010 and full payments totalling &euro;1,666.65 and &euro;4,999.98 issued in respect of 2010 and 2011 respectively. <\/p><p>  Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue.

The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals enabling resources to be targeted appropriately.

Following a request by the HSE, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has completed the first phase in a series of Health Technology Assessments of common surgical procedures.

It will deliver a number of important benefits, including<\/p><p>- significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs,<\/p><p>- a lowering of the drugs bill to the State,<\/p><p>- timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and<\/p><p>- reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.<\/p><p>  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years. Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.  The Department of Health and the HSE have also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for taxpayers and patients. The Bill passed Committee Stage in the House on the 19th of March. Report Stage was initiated on the 24th of April and is scheduled to resume on the 9th of May. I hope that the Bill will complete its passage through both Houses shortly thereafter.<\/p><p>  It is not possible, at this juncture, to provide accurate figures regarding potential savings resulting from the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing, as these depend on various factors including prevailing prices, number of competitors, availability of substitute products, and market dynamics. <\/p><p>In addition, the recently established HSE Medicines Management Programme has identified &lsquo;preferred drugs&rsquo; for prescribers when prescribing Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) or statin medication for patients. This is the first time that the State has introduced a preferred drug initiative. PPIs are prescribed for patients with peptic ulcer disease and\/or reflux and statin medication is for high cholesterol. The preferred PPI is Lansoprazole and the preferred statin is Simvastatin. The HSE is asking doctors to prescribe these preferred drugs in order to save money, both for patients who pay for their medication and to deliver savings of an estimated &euro;15million for the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  The Department is also committed to establishing high-level annual targets by the end of September for the share of generic penetration over the medium-term. These targets will be informed by the findings of a report currently being completed by the ESRI which is examining the usage of generics in Ireland and comparable EU jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100092#WRGG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":667,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100092#WRGG01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects Status","counter":666,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100092#WRGG01150"},{"type":"question","counter":667,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[20581\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050100092#WRGG01200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he has provided funding for the construction of a by-pass around Maigh Cuilinn in County Galway; the proposed timescale for the construction of this by-pass; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":668,"content":"<p>The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.\u00a0 The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.
