There is a healthy competitive market for air services in and out of the country and we benefit from a wide range of air connections, both short and long haul. New routes are being announced on a regular basis by both Irish and international airlines. Maintaining and developing this connectivity is certainly a key objective of national aviation policy.<\/p><p>  A consultation process to develop a new national aviation policy is currently underway.\u00a0An issues paper was published on 1 March this year inviting submissions from stakeholders and interested parties.\u00a0The deadline for submissions has recently\u00a0been extended to 12 July in response to a number of requests. I\u00a0anticipate that\u00a0all the major airlines and airports\u00a0will\u00a0have substantial contributions to make to the consultation process. They each have a role to play in maximising options and opportunities for the development of the aviation sector.\u00a0 I look forward to receiving their submissions along with the views of all interested parties.<\/p><p>  Following receipt of\u00a0submissions, a draft National Aviation Policy Statement will be issued in the second half of 2013. This will provide further opportunity for stakeholder input before the adoption of the new policy document in early 2014. The new policy will outline the actions to be taken by Government to help sustain and develop the aviation sector, in order to create jobs and support business and tourism.<\/p><p>  In relation to the State's remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus, the Government continues to seek opportunities to dispose of the shareholding, but will only do so when market conditions are favourable and on terms and at a price that are acceptable. In the meantime the Government will continue to manage its shareholding actively to protect the State's interests and with the aim of maximising the value of the shareholding, securing dividends and\u00a0encouraging new routes and additional capacity where commercially viable.<\/p><p>  In relation to Cork airport questions regarding the development\u00a0of routes and operating costs are day to day operational matters for the DAA and local management.\u00a0I recently met with management at Cork Airport and welcomed their plans for the development of the Airport and for enhanced consultation by them with regional stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700054#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700054#WRA03350"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[30948\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700054#WRA03400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the way the &euro;43.798 million allocated to the Irish Sports Council in 2013 is to be spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>The Irish Sports Council, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the promotion, development and co-ordination of sport, including the allocation of funding across its various programmes. <\/p><p>  I have referred\u00a0the Deputy's question to the Irish Sports Council\u00a0for direct reply.

The judges are elected by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) from a list of three candidates nominated by a state party. In the time available, it is not possible to provide the lists of candidates put forward by Ireland for election to the European Court of Human Rights on each occasion since the Court was established in 1959. However, I set out below the lists of three candidates nominated for election to the Court since it was established on a full-time basis on 1 November 1998, pursuant to Protocol 11 to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  Ireland has submitted lists of candidates in respect of three elections to the full-time Court - in 1997, 2004 and 2007. Details of the lists of candidates put forward are as follows:<\/p><p>1997 (in advance of the setting up of the full time Court) <\/p><p>Mr. John Hedigan S.C. (elected in January 1998)<\/p><p>Mr. Gerard Hogan S.C.<\/p><p>Mr. Denis Vaughan Buckley S.C.<\/p><p>2004 (in advance of the expiry of Judge Hedigan's first term of office)<\/p><p>Judge John Hedigan  (re-elected in April 2004)<\/p><p>Professor Fionnuala N&iacute; Aol&aacute;in<\/p><p>Mr. Roger Sweetman S.C. <\/p><p>(on the resignation of Judge Hedigan)<\/p><p>Mr. David Keane B.L.<\/p><p>Ms Ann Power S.C. (elected in January 2008)<\/p><p>Mr. Roger Sweetman S.C.<\/p><p>  The ECHR sets out certain criteria required of judges of the European Court of Human Rights, including the requirement to be of high moral character and to possess the qualifications required for appointment to high judicial office or to be jurisconsults of recognised competence. In addition to this, PACE has adopted a number of texts on the standards to be adhered to by states in preparing the list of three candidates. I would refer the Deputy to an information document (reference AS\/Jur\/Inf (2013)02 10 January 2013) prepared by the Council of Europe Secretariat for<b><\/b>the Parliamentary Assembly Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the PACE on the procedure for electing judges to the European Court of Human Rights which lists the relevant texts and includes information on its own procedures. This document is available on the Council of Europe website at: <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i>.<\/p><p>  In preparing lists of candidates, states are expected, amongst other things: to issue public and open calls for candidatures; to transmit the names of candidates in alphabetical order rather than in order of preference; to ensure that candidates possess an active knowledge of one and a passive knowledge of the other official language of the Council of Europe (French and English); and, as a general rule, to ensure that the list of candidates includes both women and men. <\/p><p>Although it has no formal role under the ECHR, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has adopted measures seeking to ensure that only high quality candidates are put forward by Governments for election to the Court. In 2010 the Committee set up an Advisory Panel of experts on candidates for election as judges to the Court. The Panel's role is to advise states parties on whether the candidates that they propose to nominate to PACE for election meet the criteria set out in the ECHR. On 28 March 2012 the Committee of Ministers also adopted Guidelines on the selection of candidates for the post of judge at the European Court of Human Rights, together with an Explanatory Memorandum identifying good practices. The Guidelines support the standards laid down by the PACE and deal with the criteria for the establishment of lists of candidates; the procedure for eliciting candidates; the procedure for drawing up the recommended list of candidates and the finalisation of lists of candidates. These are available on the Council of Europe website at: <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i> and<b><\/b>.<\/p><p>  In submitting its list of three candidates, Ireland has ensured that it has complied with the evolving standards set down by the Council of Europe. In 2007, the nominations procedure included a public newspaper advertisement, an advertisement on my Department's website and a notice informing the judiciary, the legal professions and universities of the vacancy.  A review of all applications was conducted by an expert panel created by the Attorney General to assist him in recommending the three most suitable candidates to the Government. The decision on the submission of the three candidates was taken by Government on foot of a Memorandum submitted by my predecessor. PACE has commended the quality of the candidates put forward for election in respect of Ireland by the Government and the Committee of Ministers has cited Ireland in its Memorandum on Good Practices.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700059#WRF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passports for Investment Scheme","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700059#WRF00350"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[31275\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700059#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if a decision has been made on an application for a investment visa in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":183,"content":"<p>Visa and immigration decisions are solely a matter for the authorities of the country to which the application relates and are therefore outside of my remit.

Before dealing in detail with the outcome of the meeting, I should mention that the Council adopted new Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief, and Guidelines to promote and protect the enjoyment of all human rights by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI).  Advances on these important issues are to be welcomed at any time but I am particularly pleased that both sets of Guidelines, which were priority concerns for Ireland, were adopted at the final Council meeting of the Irish Presidency.<\/p><p>  The first item on the agenda at Monday's meeting was the Eastern Partnership.   Ministers took stock of preparations for an Eastern Partnership Ministerial meeting scheduled for Brussels in July and for the Eastern Partnership Summit that will take place in Vilnius in November.  A progress report was presented on the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) Agreements with Armenia, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine was presented.    Ministers considered developments in the six Eastern Partnership countries and were broadly supportive of the work being done in preparation for the Summit in November.   I expressed the hope that Heads of State and Government would be in a position to take positive decisions at that meeting.<\/p><p>  Next, the Council discussed EU Climate Diplomacy and   the global cross-cutting challenges which are presented by the impacts of climate change. There was general agreement on the need for Foreign Ministers to consider the strategic and security dimensions of climate change and to avail of opportunities in their contacts with third countries to build support for actions to address these challenges.  In my intervention, I recalled the successful conference on climate change, nutrition and hunger which I co-hosted in Dublin in April.  I also emphasised the importance of pursuing a holistic approach to the climate change agenda.  Preparations for the 2015 UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris are advancing well and the Council expects to return to this issue next year.  Comprehensive Conclusions were adopted which are firmly in line with the Conclusions on Post-2015 which were agreed at the Development Foreign Affairs Council in May. <\/p><p>  Ministers reviewed recent developments in relation to the Middle East Peace Process  , including current efforts by the US to achieve a resumption of direct negotiations. Following this discussion, HR Ashton reaffirmed the EU's commitment to the two-state solution and full EU support for the US efforts. <\/p><p>Over lunch, which was attended also by the NATO Secretary General, Ministers discussed the current situation on the ground in Afghanistan   and the prospects in the region, particularly in the context of forthcoming Presidential elections. They examined  political, developmental and security aspects of this issue and Council Conclusions were agreed. The EU is resolutely committed to supporting state-building and long-term development in Afghanistan. <\/p><p>  After lunch, discussions moved to the Southern Neighbourhood   agenda item. HR Ashton debriefed the Council on her recent visit to several countries in the region. Ministers had an exchange of views on the ongoing crisis in Syria and also had a broad discussion of the effectiveness of the EU's response to the 'Arab Spring' developments. They reiterated the need for a political settlement of the Syrian crisis and discussed how the EU can best maintain pressure on all sides so as to bring about an end to the violence and to secure their engagement in a political process of transition. There was agreement that the Geneva II process is critical.  Following the Council meeting, HR Ashton repeated the EU's firm support for a political solution and noted the EU's commitment to humanitarian assistance in Syria, where the contribution by the EU and its member States is in excess of &euro;1 billion.  Ireland's total contribution to date stands at &euro;9.8 million.<\/p><p>  Finally, Ministers discussed the Western Balkans, in advance of decisions to be taken at this week's European Council. I intervened to confirm Ireland's support both for an agreement to open accession talks with Serbia and for an agreement to open negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo  .

Ministers discussed the next steps for Serbia and Kosovo in the enlargement and stabilisation and association process.  The GAC recommended that, following completion of national parliamentary procedures and subject to the endorsement of the June European Council, accession negotiations be opened with Serbia.  The Council also agreed in principle on draft Council decisions authorising the opening of negotiations for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo.

Having regard to the activities carried out by a PIP, Revenue has formed the opinion that the service provided by a PIP is not one that qualifies for exemption in accordance with the VAT Directive, Irish VAT Law, and relevant decisions of the European Court of Justice.

It is imposed in such a way that increasing rates of deduction are applied to increasing bands or slices of an affected public servant's pay each year.  The PRD originally became operative on 1 March 2009 as provided for in section 2 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  Soon afterwards, the PRD rates and bands were changed by section 13 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009, which, in particular, put in place a zero per cent rate of PRD, effectively an exemption, on the first &euro;15,000 of pay in each year.  A further change in PRD will take place on 1 January 2014, when the PRD rate on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band will fall from 5% to 2.5%, as provided for in section 11 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.<\/p><p>  Members of pension schemes affected by the 2011 pension fund levy, on the other hand, are not charged with paying the 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets.

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and nearly 10,000 Learning Support and Resource Teachers.  These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position.  Whereas the allocations of SNA support for individual schools may change each year in line with a schools enrolment of children with care needs, there has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year.  This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support.<\/p><p>  The total number of SNA posts allocated to schools for the 2012\/13 school year was 10,487 posts.  For the 2011\/12 school year it was 10,320 posts.  It is therefore estimated that there will be sufficient SNA posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such support in the coming school year.  In relation to the allocation of resource teaching support for schools from September 2013, demand for support has risen again this year, due to a combination of demographic growth and increased assessments.<\/p><p>  Despite the fact that the overall number of posts available to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) for allocation to schools had been maintained at existing levels, the allocations announced by the NCSE last week were reduced to take into account of the growth in demand, within the maintained number of posts, in order to ensure that equivalent allocations could be made for all qualifying children.  The Deputy will be aware that I announced recently that I have now authorised the NCSE to retain the level of resource teaching allocations which can be provided for students with special educational needs to the 2012\/13 levels.  This will mean that there will not now be any reduction to resource teaching time for children over the level which applied last year.<\/p><p>  I also committed to ensuring that the resources which will be required to ensure that the allocations can be made to schools at existing levels will be provided, including resources required to meet any late demand expected to arise between now and the start of the school year.  The NCSE will publish revised details of the Resource Teaching allocations for all schools, based on existing allocation levels, and will also advise schools of their revised allocations in the coming days.<\/p><p>  In the longer term, it is proposed to develop new allocations system to improve how resources for children with special Educational needs are allocated to schools.  I am concerned that the scale of increased demand for resource teachers this year, if it were to continue, would make the current system unsustainable.  I am asking the NCSE to consider the reasons for the unprecedented 12 per cent rise in applications for resource teacher support this year, which compares with an annual 1.3 per cent increase in the number of students attending school in the current year.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools.<\/p><p>I have, as suggested by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal, for consideration, for a new allocation model for teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools.<\/p><p>  In the interim, I wish to ensure that children will not be disadvantaged while we move towards a new model which will ensure greater fairness and quality of education for children with special educational needs.

Advice was sought from international experts on research provided by the IAA and other research on educational interventions for children with autistic spectrum disorders and the advice concluded that research does not support the exclusive usage of ABA or indeed the exclusive use of any other approach, as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that my Department's preferred policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child's needs. <\/p><p> My Department remains willing to review and consider any further research as and when it becomes available and my officials are conscious of the need to adapt existing policies and to develop new policies as new research or learning becomes available. <\/p><p>  The Department officials who attended the recent briefing referred to by the Deputy have also obtained copies of each of the presentations made by the 3 speakers. I understand the presentations were most informative of the merits and advantages of the ABA model. I am also aware that the presentation was attended by representatives of the National Council for Special Education. <\/p><p>  The National Council for Special Education has a formal role under Section 20.1(j) of EPSEN to advise the Minister 'in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities'. I have now requested the NCSE to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. A feature of the preparation of this impartial advice will involve the NCSE consulting widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties. As the NCSE were present at the presentations, I would expect that the information presented upon will be of interest in the context of the preparation of the policy advice.  <\/p><p>  The NCSE have commissioned research which will not be finalised until mid to late 2014 and I expect that this research will inform much of the work in preparing the policy advice. Accordingly it is not expected that the report will be finalised until early 2015. <\/p><p>  My officials are not aware of a recent invitation from the Psychology Society of Ireland's Division of Behaviour Analysis to meet with them to provide a more accurate understanding of ABA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700063#WRK03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":316,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700064#WRL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":317,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[31350\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700064#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if officials from his Department have met representatives of a board of management of a school (details supplied) in County Wicklow regarding their concerns about the proposed location for their new school building; when this meeting took place; the outcome of the meeting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":318,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, for some time, my Department has been working with the local authority to identify and acquire land for the delivery of school accommodation for a Gaelscoil and Gaelchol&aacute;iste in the area referred to by him.

PRD remains a critical financial emergency measure, supporting the fiscal position to the extent of some &euro;1 billion annually. <\/p><p>  I would however note that, as lately legislated in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, and as provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, the rate of PRD on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band of pay received in a year will fall from 5% to 2.5% on 1 January 2014. This rate cut will be worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with those taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of take-home pay boost.<\/p><p>  This progressive aspect of the January 2014 PRD adjustment with respect to take-home pay is mirrored by the progressive design of the PRD itself. As an income-graduated measure applying to pensionable public servants, PRD is structured in such a way that increasing rates of deduction are applied to increasing bands or slices of an affected person's pay each year. In this matrix of band and rates a zero per cent rate applies to the first &euro;15,000 of earnings, which is especially important for lower-paid public service workers, in that it markedly dampens the proportion of pay deducted. In terms of its detailed composition, PRD is currently applied by reference to the following set of income bands and associated reduction rates:<\/p><p>  First &euro; 15,000 of earnings: exempt<\/p><p>  Earnings between &euro; 15,000 and &euro; 20,000: 5%<\/p><p>  Earnings between &euro; 20,000 and &euro; 60,000: 10%<\/p><p>  Earnings above &euro; 60,000: 10.5%<\/p><p>  Based on this set of deduction rates, the PRD imposition on a public servant paid &euro;20,000 in a year is &euro;250, or 1.25% of pay, not 10% of pay as stated in the Deputy's second question. Likewise, the PRD taken from a public servant paid &euro;60,000 in a year is &euro;4,250, or 7.08% of pay, not 10.5% as stated by the Deputy.  <\/p><p>  In terms of the actual outturns in the example cases raised by the Deputy, the large difference in PRD impact between 1.25% of pay at &euro;20,000 and 7.08 % of pay at &euro;60,000 shows how, across this pay gap, PRD acts in a manifestly progressive way. While this large difference would lessen in a post-tax relief analysis, the lower paid person would undoubtedly retain a clear edge.<\/p><p>  For the record, PRD, though tax-relieved, does not qualify for relief from PRSI or USC. All such reliefs are a matter for the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700065#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":354,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700065#WRM00850"},{"type":"question","counter":355,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[31442\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700065#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 142 of the 16 May 2013 and 67 of 23 May 2013, if he will clarify that the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Bill 2013 that will provide for a statutory qualified privilege for private papers of Members and official documents of the Houses will include that of political staff working in their parliamentary and constituency offices in terms of their documents, emails and other communications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":356,"content":"<p>The Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries Privileges and Procedures) Bill 2013 provides for a statutory qualified privilege for the private papers of Members and official documents of the Houses.

The revaluation process is the mechanism whereby economic changes that take place in the property market are reflected in the valuation lists for rates purposes and in individual ratepayers&rsquo; rates liabilities. The national revaluation programme is a priority for Government and is a feature of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012. The programme is particularly important given the significant changes that have occurred in rental values following the economic downturn of recent years. The purpose of a revaluation is to distribute commercial rates liabilities more equitably among ratepayers based on up-to-date values. Following revaluation, there will be a much closer relationship between rental value and commercial rates liability. Even though property values have fallen generally, given that the purpose is to redistribute the overall rates liability, some ratepayers will obtain a reduction while others will experience an increase from the process of redistribution but, overall, revaluation results in a fairer distribution of the rates burden.<\/p><p>  In line with Government priorities, I am very keen that the revaluation programme would be expedited so that the first revaluation in 25 years can be completed as soon as possible across the country. In keeping with Government policy, I have introduced the Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill, 2012, which is currently before the Oireachtas. The primary purpose of this legislation is to accelerate the revaluation process. The Bill also includes new features which provide for the streamlining of the valuation appeals procedures available to ratepayers and as part of the efforts to accelerate the national revaluation programme, it also provides the legislative basis for carrying out a revaluation based on self-assessment by ratepayers and also for the external delivery of elements of the valuation process. <\/p><p>  Under Irish law, there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation of that property determined by the Valuation Office and the annual rate on valuation (ARV) set annually by the elected members of the rating authority. Revaluation is the mechanism whereby movements in property valuations as a result of economic factors are reflected in valuation lists. Following the first revaluation in each area, the Valuation Act 2001 provides for subsequent, recurring revaluations to be carried out at intervals of a minimum of 5 years and no later than 10 years. This will ensure that movements in the property market are tracked and reflected in rateable valuations within a reasonable timeline, which has not been the case heretofore. Accordingly, individual valuations would be established and remain fixed for a 5-10 year period. On the other hand the ARV can, as determined by the elected members of the rating authority, vary from year to year and therefore so can the amount of rates payable annually.<\/p><p>  Valuations reflect the value of all individual properties in particular rating authority areas at the statutory valuation date (28th October 2011 for Waterford). Movements in valuations since the last date by which valuations were set (1988\/89) reflect the relative changes to rental values within and between sectors such as retail, industrial and hospitality between 1988 and 2011. Accordingly, some businesses will have an increase in their rates liability while others will experience a decrease following revaluation. <\/p><p>  The setting of valuation levels during a revaluation exercise such as that underway in Waterford City Council, Waterford County Council and Dungarvan Town Council is based on market evidence available to the Valuation Office, including information solicited from and provided by ratepayers. In establishing the levels for rateable properties, the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in carrying out his function. In relation to particular cases there is, of course, a well established statutory process whereby a ratepayer, if he or she considers that the proposed valuation or any of the details contained in the Proposed Valuation Certificate are incorrect, can make representations to the Valuation Manager.  There is also a subsequent statutory right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, an independent body set up for such purposes and subsequently, on a point of law, there is an appeal to the High and Supreme Courts. <\/p><p>  In keeping with the principle of separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates, the amount of rates that a rating authority can raise is generally a matter for decision by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and does not come within the competence of the Commissioner of Valuation whose sole responsibility lies in administering the system of rateable valuation as underpinned by the Valuation Act, 2001. However, in so far as valuation legislation is concerned, there is a specific provision in the 2001 Act which allows the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to make an order requiring a rating authority to exercise its powers to make rates in such a manner that it does not exceed the amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the first year following a revaluation except for any increase determined by the consumer price index.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700065#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700065#WRM01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Microfinance Loan Fund","counter":360,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700065#WRM01350"},{"type":"question","counter":361,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[31191\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700065#WRM01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of applications the micro finance loan fund received since it was started; the number of loans that have been awarded; the average size of the loans; the average time from an application being lodged to a loan awarded; the number of loan applications that have been denied and the reason for same ; if there is a breakdown available of the industries receiving loans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":362,"content":"<p>A full progress report on the operation of the scheme from 1 October 2012 to 31 March 2013 can be found on my Department's website () and the Microfinance Ireland (MFI) website (  ).

At the end of 2012 there were 6 IDA Ireland supported companies in Monaghan employing 350 people.  In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, IDA Ireland continues to engage with these client companies in order to transform the existing FDI base with a view to developing, retaining and growing employment opportunities.<\/p><p>  As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  In order to achieve balanced regional economic development, IDA prioritises the marketing of its Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass and highlights the opportunities provided by other locations on an opportunistic basis, which are within commuting distances of these Gateways. <\/p><p>  County Monaghan is part of IDA&rsquo;s North East Region along with Counties Cavan and Louth.  Through its network of overseas offices, IDA Ireland markets the North East Region for new inward investment through the Gateway of Dundalk. In addition the Agency works closely with all of its 34 client companies in the Region which currently employ 3,200 people, to encourage them to further develop their engagement in the region.  <\/p><p>  With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one county in the Region has a positive impact on other counties in the Region. <\/p><p>  I consider that it is neither practicable nor effective to establish jobs task forces or specific jobs plans around the country as a general mechanism to address high unemployment.  I believe that to embark on such a course would involve diverting the various State Agencies from their on-going efforts to create jobs.  A considerable administrative commitment is involved in servicing any additional committees and groups which may be set up and, given the constrained staff resources facing all public sector bodies at present, I am strongly of the opinion that establishing such additional groups, except in very exceptional circumstances, would not be in the best interests of using the State&rsquo;s resources effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700066#WRN00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700066#WRN00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Benefit Payments","counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700066#WRN00350"},{"type":"question","counter":379,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[31382\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700066#WRN00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if and when arrears of a child benefit claim will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":380,"content":"<p>Child Benefit is in payment to the person concerned.

The government will now review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances. A plan for the implementation of the Recommendation will be developed before the end of 2013.<\/p><p>  The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the gradual implementation of a guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed in the first quarter of 2013, at 53,800, decreased by over 10,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.<\/p><p>  The additional costs involved in delivering the Youth Guarantee in Ireland are likely to be substantial.  Issues will therefore arise as to how a guarantee is to be financed and over what period, given the fiscal constraints currently facing the country.  In this context the additional funding available from the EU, to be allocated across qualifying member states is actually &euro;3bn.  The balance of &euro;3bn is a reallocation of monies from within the European Social Fund. Although it is now proposed to frontload the provision of these funds the actual process by which they will be allocated to member states is is as yet unclear. <\/p><p>  As part of the process of developing our own national implementation plan  the costs of any measures involved arising in 2014 will be dealt with in the normal way through the 2014 Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700067#WRO00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Delays","counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700067#WRO00350"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[31413\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700067#WRO00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a social welfare appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath in relation to the disallowance of a claim for disability allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":413,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an Appeals Officer, having fully considered all of the available evidence, disallowed the appeal of the person concerned by way of a summary decision.

It is the world's largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide and, on average, provides food assistance to more than 90 million people in 70 countries every year. Ireland has consistently been one of the WFP's most generous donors and key partners, being the twenty-fourth highest contributor of 133 donors from 2009 to date. <\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the WFP are made up of an annual core contribution from my Department which amounted to just under &euro;10 million in 2012, and support from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through the Irish Aid programme, for the WFP's response to specific humanitarian emergencies.  In 2012, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provided humanitarian funding in support of the WFP's activities in Chad, Syria and the Sahel region in West Africa. In addition, funding was provided to support the operation of the UN's Humanitarian Air Service, which is managed by the WFP. To date in 2013, &euro;3.25 million in humanitarian funding for the WFP has already been approved by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. My Department&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;9.96m will be paid in Q3 of this year. <\/p><p>  Ireland was most recently a member of the Executive Board of the WFP for a one-year period in 2011. The Board provides an opportunity for UN Member States such as Ireland to oversee WFP's humanitarian and development food aid activities, with three meetings each year at WFP&rsquo;s headquarters in Rome. When not a Board member, my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade attend in an observer capacity and contribute to the Board's work with our EU partners. Most recently during our Presidency of the EU, we guided this EU position by coordinating the views of the other Member States and the European Commission for presentation at the Board meeting.<\/p><p>  As a sign of our commitment to the WFP, I was pleased in April of this year to co-sign with Minister Joe Costello T.D. a Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) between Ireland and the WFP.  This SPA is a bilateral agreement between us as the donor country and the WFP setting out:<\/p><p>- Shared objectives in the area of humanitarian emergencies;<\/p><p>- Multi-annual financial contributions. In this regard my Department has committed to contributing minimum &euro;7m in core funding each year from 2013 to 2015. In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has committed to continue to make available funding on a case by case basis in response to humanitarian crises;<\/p><p>- Management, reporting and evaluation of the contributions.<\/p><p>  In addition and unrelated to our contributions, the WFP has identified Ireland and Irish companies as potential suppliers for the products which it procures on an annual basis.

I am very pleased to say that on the basis of compromise texts put forward and negotiated by the Irish Presidency team, I succeeded in achieving an adjusted negotiating mandate from my Ministerial colleagues across all the Member States that allowed me to take forward these negotiations to the final phase.  The deputy will be aware that, on the basis of this mandate, we achieved political agreement in the CAP Reform negotiations with the European Parliament and the Commission in Brussels yesterday. <\/p><p>  The deal represents a package of measures that will set the framework for the development of the EU agri-food sector up to 2020.  In terms of the detail of the agreement, I believe this is a well balanced package and is a very good outcome for Irish farmers.  In relation to our key area of concern, the distribution of direct payments, Member States will have the option to apply the partial convergence model put forward by Ireland.  As part of this model, farmers will receive a minimum payment of 60% of the national or regional average payment per hectare by 2019.

During my visit I met with my counter part, Minister Dmitry Livanov, Minister of Education and Science of the Russian Federation. This meeting was productive and allowed for an exchange of views on the possibility of Ireland entering into a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption with Russia. The Russian authorities acknowledged the satisfactory outcomes for Russian children adopted in Ireland and expressed a willingness to conclude an agreement with Ireland which will be subject to the approval of the Russian parliament. I stated that many Irish families were hopeful of completing future adoptions of Russian children. <\/p><p>  During these meetings I reiterated to the Russian authorities that the Irish Constitution protects the integrity of family life and that once adopted in Ireland the child is treated in the same way as other Irish children. This means that the ability of the State to intervene in a family, when a child&rsquo;s welfare and protection is not compromised, is limited. I highlighted the implications of this Constitutional imperative in instances where families, who had given commitments to the Russian authorities in regard to the provision of post placement reports, fail to adhere to those commitments.  In these instances the State has no legislative power to enforce compliance with the commitments given by Irish families, legal or otherwise, to provide post placement reports.<\/p><p>  However, in saying this, I emphasised the high standards of child protection that exist in Ireland for all children and the legislative basis under which these standards are enforced. I  emphasised the commitment of the State to intervene in instances where the safety or welfare of any child, adopted or otherwise, is in anyway compromised. I outlined the total commitment of the Irish Government to the child protection and welfare. <\/p><p>  My Department has undertaken an examination of the draft bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption proposed by the Russian Federation. In order to progress the development of a bilateral agreement the Department has focused on this issue of post placement reporting in relation to Russian children adopted in Ireland, which the Russian authorities have indicated is a necessary component of any bilateral agreement. To this end a draft wording of the sections of the bilateral agreement that relate to post placement reporting is being developed. My officials are in active discussions with officials in the Office of the Attorney General and in the Department of Foreign Affairs on advancing a draft agreement for consideration by the Russian authorities.<\/p><p>  I have invited the Russian authorities to visit Ireland in September in order to finalise consideration of this aspect of the draft bilateral agreement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700073#WRU02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":649,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700073#WRU02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":648,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700073#WRU02150"},{"type":"question","counter":649,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[31177\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700073#WRU02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite a medical card application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":650,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

In addition, the HSE is developing its Rehabilitation Medicine Programme within the Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate. The Report is the overarching policy on neuro-rehabilitation services and includes proposals for a framework for the future of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland. The aim of neuro-rehabilitation is to enable the person to achieve the highest possible level of independence. Desired outcomes range from a return to full independence in social and work situations to a person requiring long-term support and care but with a higher level of independence than in the absence of neuro-rehabilitation. Current services available include acute hospital services; the National Rehabilitation Hospital; multi-disciplinary community services; long-term assisted living supports; and rehabilitative training services. These services are provided directly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and several non-statutory organisations.<\/p><p>  The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has been working in collaboration with the HSE's National Disability Unit as part of an expert Working Group planning for the implementation of the Report. The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has incorporated key elements of the Report into its own Model of Care and adopted the Strategy&rsquo;s recommendation of &ldquo;hub and spoke&rdquo; model for specialist rehabilitation services and is keen to progress with a comprehensive model for the continuation of such service into the community. This co-operation will continue in 2013.<\/p><p>  Improving access to outpatient services, including neurology, is a key priority for the Government.

The level of funding available for the health budget for 2014 has not yet been determined.  Deliberations by the Government on the expenditure allocations for next year are likely to continue up until Budget time.  The HSE is currently engaged in the estimates process.  The National Clinical Programme for Asthma is included in the HSE's 2013 Operational Plan.  Implementation of the Programme is ongoing and will continue in 2014.  To date, different work streams of the National Clinical Programme for Asthma have resulted in the following initiative, the preparation of a Model of Care.  This is currently being finalised and will be sent for stakeholder consultation after 30 June 2013.  The Model of Care cannot be completed until stakeholder responses have been received and considered.  The Model of Care includes a proposal to provide a standardised structured asthma review of each patient by the patient's GP at least annually.  This will optimise treatment, ensure institution of inhaled corticosteroid therapy early in asthma management where appropriate, encourage medication adherence and address underlying problems with asthma care and management.  This will include:<\/p><p>- Inhaler technique;<\/p><p>- Adherence to and understanding of medications;<\/p><p>- Self-management education including personal asthma plans and self-monitoring;<\/p><p>- Management of co-morbidities and triggers including allergic rhinitis; and<\/p><p>- Smoking cessation and\/or avoidance or exposure to second hand smoke.<\/p><p>- The establishment of Asthma Check (Chronic Disease Watch Asthma - structured review) - this has been submitted to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) for review.

Neuro-rehabilitation services are presently delivered across a range of settings, from acute  hospitals and specialised neurorehabilitation centres, to primary and community settings, including home.  Service user neuro-rehabilitation needs range from intensive, acute treatment at tertiary level through to long-term neuro-rehabilitation at community level.  Improving access to outpatient services, including neurology, is a key priority for the Government.  Collaborating with individual hospitals, the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) together with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), have developed the outpatient waiting list minimum dataset that allows for data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis and, for the first time, outpatient data is available on www.ntpf.ie.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time, consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE Service Plan for 2013.  The SDU\/NTPF will work closely with hospitals towards achievement of the maximum waiting time.  The Department of Health and the HSE have developed and published the &ldquo;National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011 - 2015&rdquo;.  In addition, the HSE is developing its Rehabilitation Medicine Programme within the Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate.  The Report is the overarching policy on neuro-rehabilitation services and includes proposals for a framework for the future of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland, including key elements such as guiding principles; implementation structure; methodology for implementation; and information and communication.<\/p><p>  The Report recognises that given the current economic climate, the focus in the short to medium term has to be on re-configuration of services, structures and resources and the enhancement of the skills and competencies required to meet the changing context.  The recruitment of additional consultants in rehabilitation medicine can only be considered in this context i.e. reconfiguring current services and available resources.  The key priority areas, as identified in the HSE&rsquo;s National Operational Plan for 2013 are to Map and develop Integrated Service Area level rehabilitation networks; Implement the model of care for rehabilitation services within the networks with a focus on community rehabilitation.  Current provision for people requiring neuro-rehabilitation services, including those with multiple sclerosis, range from acute hospital services; the National Rehabilitation Hospital; multi-disciplinary community services; long-term assisted living supports; and rehabilitation training services.  These services are provided directly by the HSE and several non-statutory organisations, including MS Ireland.  The HSE provided over &euro;2.6m to MS Ireland in 2012 towards the provision of services and supports.  Neuro-rehabilitation services can be accessed through HSE local health offices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700074#WRV02400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Provision","counter":688,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700074#WRV02450"},{"type":"question","counter":689,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[31286\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700074#WRV02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1778 of 18 September 2012, if he will immediately consider reinstating the existing ambulance control centre at Kerry General Hospital even on a temporary basis as a back up service, in view of the fact that the local knowledge by staff in this control centre and the local knowledge at the community hospital bases is invaluable in the introduction of the new ambulance control centre in Dublin; if he will now accept the fact that there is no longer an input from local staff, that this is having very serious repercussions for the health and safety of the general public in County Kerry and throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":690,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[31306\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700074#WRV02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will restore local ambulance control to Tralee following the recent error in directing an ambulance to the home of a young child who died","asker":"1047","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":691,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 and 259 together.<\/p><p>  A tragic event occurred in Kerry last week which was widely reported. Firstly, I wish to extend my deepest sympathies to the family of the child involved. The loss of a loved one is hard for family and friends at any time, but the sudden and unexpected death of a young child is particularly difficult. In relation to this incident, the facts are that, at 1.16 a.m. on 18 June 2013, an emergency call was received for a baby who was reported as not breathing. The National Ambulance Service (NAS) was initially unable to obtain sufficient details of where help was needed, which led to a delay in reaching the incident. The first emergency resource arrived at the scene 30 minutes after the initial 999 call. The patient was subsequently pronounced dead. The incident has been the subject of a systems analysis, as is routine in cases where a death occurs, to ascertain whether call-taking protocols were followed. Following an examination of the facts, the HSE is satisfied that systems and processes operated correctly and there are no plans to carry out any further review. However, interrogation has been strengthened to try and mitigate the impact of a call where the incident location cannot be identified. In addition, HSE Communications has been requested to run a publicity campaign to improve public awareness of the need to communicate precisely the locations of incidents. In the interest of respecting the dignity and grief of the family, I wish to make no further comment on the specific incident.<\/p><p>  A significant reform programme has been underway to totally reconfigure the way the HSE manages and delivers pre-hospital care services, to ensure a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system, supported by improved technology. The National Control Centre Reconfiguration Project, which is endorsed by HIQA and which represents international best practice, will reduce the number of ambulance control centres to a single national control system, with significant investment in new voice, data and mapping technologies. The project is also a key element of Future Health:  A Strategic Framework for Health Reform in Ireland 2012-2015. Both HIQA and the NAS have had concerns over control and dispatch structures at some control centres leading up to the development of the national control system. Accordingly, the NAS moved the Cork and Tralee centres to its Townsend Street centre on an interim basis in May, to mitigate such concerns pending completion of the national centre. Detailed preparations took place to ensure the safety of services during the move of the Cork and Kerry operations. The NAS provided additional staff, training, technology and equipment to assist this process. 112\/999 calls from those areas are now answered in Dublin using improved technology. The NAS is satisfied that Townsend St, while not appropriate to the needs of the overall reconfiguration project, is nevertheless suitable and infrastructurally sound for the interim accommodation of these centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700074#WRV02700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":693,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700075#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":694,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[31304\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700075#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when it is expected the draft legislation in respect of the survivors of symphysiotomy will proceed to the next stage of the legislative process; when it is envisaged that this legislation will be enacted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":695,"content":"<p>The Private Members Bill in question has been referred to the Select Committee on Justice Defence and Equality for consideration at a date that has yet to be scheduled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700075#WRW00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":696,"content":"<p>Question No. 259 answered with Question No. 257.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":697,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700075#WRW00450"},{"type":"question","counter":698,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[31317\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700075#WRW00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a medical card will be reinstated in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry.","asker":"1051","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":699,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

However, in an emergency admission if a private designated bed is not available and a private in-patient is accommodated in a public bed, the maintenance charge is currently not levied, although the private in-patient continues to pay the fees of his\/her hospital consultant.<\/p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying private-designated beds.  This situation represents a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, who cover most private patients.  I believe that this situation cannot continue and that the new charge makes sense. Up to now insurers have enjoyed a significant subsidy, where these private patients have only paid a standard &euro;75 charge per day to the hospital even though they have seen and paid their consultant privately.<\/p><p>  The gap between the cost of providing this service to private in-patients and the amount that public hospitals are currently allowed to raise from those private patients is estimated to be about &euro;200m per year. The subsidy is equivalent to the cost of treating over 30,000 public patients every year or operating a medium size public hospital. While everyone is entitled to use a public hospital, some people chose to be treated privately, in which case they have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital. The Government believes that users of private services should pay for the costs of providing these services even when they are provided by a public hospital.<\/p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, the Government announced that it would raise &euro;60m in 2013 under this heading, and &euro;115m in a full year. This represents a modest phasing in of the charge &ndash; as called for by the insurers themselves - and is a relatively modest extra cost on an industry that pays out some &euro;2 billion in claims costs every year.<\/p><p>  The Health (Amendment) Bill 2013 is presently before the D&aacute;il and provides for charges to be levied on all in-patients who are treated privately by their consultant, irrespective of where the patient is accommodated in the hospital and regardless of whether they are admitted directly or through emergency departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700075#WRW00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":703,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700075#WRW00850"},{"type":"question","counter":704,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[31322\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700075#WRW00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if hospitals may access insurance details for patients without the patient's permission; and if so, under what legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":705,"content":"<p>Issues relating to access to personal data, including insurance details, are a matter for the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p><p>  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is established under the 1988 Data Protection Act.

This Programme aims to remedy the variations in service provision around the country.  To assist in addressing some of these variations, I announced the allocation of &euro;1m in funding for autism and early intervention services in 2012.  <\/p><p>  Beechpark is a regional, community-based HSE service which provides specialised clinical supports for children with a specific diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder up to 18 years of age, who attend designated special schools, outreach preschools and outreach classes in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  I approved &euro;300,000 of this funding, which equates to five therapists posts, for Beechpark services in Dublin, north of the Liffey, based on the options contained in a report prepared by the HSE.

In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE requires a generic medicine to be priced below the originator price.  This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.<\/p><p>  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700076#WRX01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"question","counter":749,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[31428\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700076#WRX01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update in the work undertaken by the National Task Force on prescribing and dispensing; the savings expected to be delivered by this approach; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":750,"content":"<p>The HSE has been working with GPs over many years to encourage better quality prescribing of drugs in Ireland.

This is the first time that the State has introduced a preferred drug initiative.  PPIs are prescribed for patients with peptic ulcer disease and\/or reflux and statin medication is for high cholesterol. The preferred PPI is Lansoprazole and the preferred statin is Simvastatin.  The HSE is asking doctors to prescribe these preferred drugs in order to save money, both for patients who pay for their medication and to deliver savings of an estimated &euro;15million for the taxpayer. <\/p><p>  A further initiative underway to assist with GP prescribing is the launch of the HSE's Prescribing Guidance System (PGS).

This Act provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  It also sets out statutory procedures governing the supply, reimbursement and pricing of medicines and other items to patients under the GMS and community drug schemes. <\/p><p>  The commencement of this Act provides the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) and the HSE with a robust statutory framework for the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing on a phased basis, with priority given to those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State.<\/p><p>  Previously, when a specific brand of medicine was prescribed for a patient, a pharmacist could only supply that particular brand, even when less expensive generic versions of the same medicine were available.  The Act now permits pharmacists to substitute medicines prescribed, provided that they have been designated as safely interchangeable by the IMB.<\/p><p>  The IMB will review an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.  It is expected that the first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, will be published in mid-August.  The IMB will publish subsequent lists for other groups of medicines on an ongoing basis.  From the end of the year onwards, hundreds of thousands of prescriptions will be subject to generic substitution, which will offer choice and reduced prices to patients.<\/p><p>  The legislation provides that the HSE may set a reference price for each group of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Products. Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines.  It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine's prices.  The first reference price is expected to be implemented by November. <\/p><p>  Under the latest agreement negotiated with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland which came into effect on 1st November 2012, the price of generic medicines published on the List of Interchangeable Medicines by the IMB will be immediately reduced<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>from not more than 50% to not more than 40% of the pre-patent expiry prices of the equivalent branded original medicines, i.e. a reduction of 20% on the current price of generic products.  This price reduction will take effect in advance of the setting of a reference price.<\/p><p>  Eligible patients using State drug schemes like the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme will not face any additional costs for products priced at or below the reference price.  If a patient would like to receive a particular brand that costs more than the reference price then the patient will have to pay the additional cost of that product.  In cases where substitution is prohibited for clinical reasons, patients will not face any additional costs if the prescribed product costs more than the reference price.   <\/p><p>  The Act also provides that the HSE may use a competitive process to determine the relevant price of medicines reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.  While there are no plans at present to introduce competitive tendering, in the case of high volume, off-patent medicines, it is expected that the HSE will set reference prices where appropriate.  Reference prices will be set in accordance with the criteria set out in the legislation, in particular, securing value for money for the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  This legislation will promote price competition, a greater use of generics and deliver lower medicine prices for the taxpayer and for patients.  It is not possible, at this juncture, to provide accurate figures regarding potential savings resulting from the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing, as these depend on various factors including prevailing prices, number of competitors, availability of substitute products, and market dynamics. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700076#WRX02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":755,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700076#WRX02250"},{"type":"question","counter":756,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[31430\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700076#WRX02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total number of home help hours and home care packages delivered in each of the years 2011, 2012 and to date in 2013 and the cost of same; the expected total for same for the full year of 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":757,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700076#WRX02400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Data","counter":759,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700077#WRY00350"},{"type":"question","counter":760,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[31431\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700077#WRY00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total number of general practitioners in this State at 31 May 2011, 2012 and 2013; the total State remuneration of same; if he will provide a breakdown of same by capitation and other; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":761,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[31438\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013062700077#WRY00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"in terms of state contribution, the lowest, highest and median pay of general practitioners here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":762,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 and 289 together.<\/p><p>The number of medical practitioners registered as trained specialists in the specialty of General Practice on the Specialist Division of the Medical Council's Register of Medical Practitioners is as follows:<\/p><p>  - As of 31st May 2011 = 2,279;<\/p><p>  - As of 31st May 2012 = 2,583; and<\/p><p>  - As of 31st May 2013 = 2,766.<\/p><p>  The HSE, principally through the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS), makes payments to contracted General Practitioners (GPs) for services they provide under a range of agreements including the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme, the GP Visit Card Scheme, the National Immunisation Schemes, the Health (Amendment) Act 1996, Heartwatch, the Methadone Treatment Scheme and the National Cancer Screening Service.<\/p><p>The PCRS publishes a Statistical Analysis of Claims and Payments for each year in respect of payments which it makes to contracted health professionals, including GPs.

Irish hospitals use the AR-DRG grouping system which groups each hospital&rsquo;s inpatient and daycase workload into 698 DRGs.  Until this point, the main use of the DRG system has been to adjust the budget allocations of acute public hospitals by up to 3% in line with the complexity of their casemix and their relative performance under the Casemix System.  DRGs have also been used as a tool to assist with planning as well as monitoring and assessing performance within the acute hospital sector.<\/p><p>  The draft Money Follows the Patient Policy Paper, which I published for consultation on 15 February last, proposes the introduction of a new model of funding for public hospital care.   This involves changing from the current inefficient system of block grant budgets to a new approach where hospitals are paid for the actual level of activity they undertake.  Introduction of MFTP effectively means that hospitals will be funded on the basis of the quantity and quality of the services they deliver to patients and not the size of last year&rsquo;s budget.  The new approach will be facilitated through the introduction of a prospective case-based payment system using the existing DRG grouping system.  <\/p><p>  Encouraging hospitals to use the resources at their disposal more efficiently is one of the central objectives of the MFTP system.  A recent pilot project, which implemented a MFTP model in the orthopaedic speciality, showed the positive impact that MFTP can have through productivity gains.

There is a healthy competitive market for air services in and out of the country and we benefit from a wide range of air connections, both short and long haul. New routes are being announced on a regular basis by both Irish and international airlines. Maintaining and developing this connectivity is certainly a key objective of national aviation policy.
