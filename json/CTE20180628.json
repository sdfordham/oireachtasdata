This is the HEA report on Waterford Institute of Technology.  I received correspondence personally from the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, and I was in contact with some of the officials of that trade union.  A number of current staff members met the author of the report, and while I do not know whether what they said would be considered protected disclosures, they feel vulnerable in the sense that drafts of the report have been given to individuals within the institute of technology.  It might be easy for individuals and management to discover who exactly said what to the author of the report.  Given that there is a delay in the publication of the report, they feel a bit let down as well as apprehensive and nervous at having been left hanging.  It would be appropriate for the committee to write to the HEA outlining that.  I asked the TUI to write directly to this committee and, if it has not done so, that is a matter for it.  It has written directly to me, however, and I can send on a copy of the letter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#B00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>We would be happy to forward that document setting out those concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>They are genuine concerns.

In the past week or so, there was a television programme which outlined some of the procurement issues there.  Some of those will fall under a criminal investigation.  Some of the issues, however, will not.  Certainly, I am picking up deep concern about the waste of public funds in a sector that is under pressure.  People are being asked to pay voluntary fees while others are having meetings at the K Club.  That is how people are, understandably, absorbing what is happening.  We need to determine those aspects of it that have been referred to the Garda and will be investigated so that we can come back to this issue because it is not just about Kildare and Wicklow ETB but the oversight by the Department in the context of the historical connection.

Ms Forbes clarifies that RT&Eacute; 2+1 as a channel does not exist.  We have a separate item of correspondence from Mark Griffin which I will put on the screen.  It is No. 1421B.  He is the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  His correspondence on the exact same issue is dated 22 June as departmental officials were here that day.  He states:<\/p><blockquote>I refer to the letter from the committee dated 18 June in relation to a letter from Ms Patricia Cronin, Assistant Secretary of the Department, which was discussed at the committee's meeting on 14 June.  At the committee's meeting on 3 May, Ms Cronin stated that RT&Eacute; had made an application to initiate an RT&Eacute; 2+1 service which is with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for consideration.  This was not correct.  The factual position is that RT&Eacute; had forwarded a draft proposal for discussion with the Department but has not submitted a formal proposal to date.  Therefore, the BAI has not yet been requested by the Minister to conduct a sectoral impact of any such proposal as provided for in the Broadcasting Act 2009.  I apologise to the committee for the fact that Ms Cronin's evidence to the committee was not accurate and appreciate the opportunity to correct the record.<\/blockquote> <p>We will happily do that.  I give that as an example in the context of the next item on the same topic.  The evidence presented was not accurate.  People should just come in, tell us that and let us correct the record.  People should not dance around or try to justify it.  This is a straight correction of the record and that is the way we want to proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#B01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>People make mistakes.

RT&Eacute; spoke at the same meeting on the same issue, even though the Department made that particular statement.  I had asked about this RT&Eacute; 2+1 channel.  It started off as a harmless issue, but the fact that I am not getting a straight answer says something about the people responding.  Mr. Hurley was watching proceedings and took it up.  I do not know who he is.  He said regarding what was being said at the committee on RT&Eacute; 2+1 that the channel did not exist and we were not being given the exact position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#B01300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Thanks, Mr. Hurley.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#B01400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Hurley, whoever you are.

I want to put on record that RT&Eacute; are dancing around this.  If it would just come up like the Department and set the record straight, we could move on.  However, for some reason, it is not inclined to do that.  RT&Eacute; stated it had asked for the RT&Eacute; 2+1 to be on the Sky platform.  I will now read the letter from Ms Forbes to Mr. Hurley, which the committee did not get but which Mr. Hurley sent to us.<\/p><blockquote>Thank you for your email of 5 June 2018.  <br \/><br \/>By way of clarification, Mr. Jennings response at the Public Accounts Committee ... [on] 3 May 2018, relate to RT&Eacute;'s submission to the BAI's five-year public funding review, which on the date in question was still under ... consideration ...  This submission confirmed RT&Eacute;'s intention to formally request permission for the creation of an RT&Eacute;2+1 channel.<\/blockquote><p>By definition, she is saying that it does not exist, as she says that they had not yet made a formal application.  She is now saying, which is not fair to the committee, that when we asked a straight question about RT&Eacute;, the response given related to an RT&Eacute; 2 submission to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI's, five-year public funding review.  There was no such reference at the meeting.  She cannot now state that the reference to RT&Eacute; related to some document that it had sent to the BAI as part of a five-year review.  She is actually giving Mr. Hurley the run-around.  There was no reference to that and I cannot accept the validity of the assertion that what was said here related to the submission to the BAI five-year public funding review by RT&Eacute;.  I am not buying that.  I think we have agreed to write back to RT&Eacute; and ask if it could please look at what the Department did, correct the record and let us move on, and not drag things into it that we know were not part of the discussion at the meeting.  I hope that will be conveyed to RT&Eacute;.  They are only putting trips on us and on themselves and they are doing themselves no good by dancing around in circles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#B01500","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I have a separate issue with RT&Eacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#C00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>It is appropriate to raise that now.

Worryingly for RT&Eacute;, although it is good news for the staff, it states there may be issues in respect of back pay and a cost to RT&Eacute; in implementing the report's recommendations, which it should do.  This is something that we might return to because indirectly that would be a cost to the taxpayer.  The committee should certainly write and get a copy of the report as it came directly from a hearing of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is good that there has been a response.  There is an independent report and it confirms there are issues.  There are also wider issues for other media outlets.

This committee has people coming to us with protected disclosures.  The committee probably needs to take a bit of time to consider how we deal with these.  We have had them from justice, education, and third level institutions.  They are coming from a variety of sources.  Rather than deal with each one on an <i>ad hoc <\/i>basis, telling one person to go here and another to go there, we, as a committee need to get a briefing on how we will handle all these in a consistent manner.  The final paragraph of his circular to us, Robert Watts states:<\/p><blockquote>the Protected Disclosure Act is subject to statutory review, which is almost complete and will be published shortly.  This will review the operation of the Act since its commencement in July 2014 and has included a public consultation process in which 25 submissions were received ... A report will be made by the Minister to each House of the Oireachtas by early July on the findings of the review and conclusions drawn from those findings.<\/blockquote> <p>According to the Secretary General, there will be a report on how the Act is operating in the next week or so.  We know there are serious deficiencies and inconsistencies all over the place in public bodies.

We dealt with No. 1407B on CCTV.

The Secretary General states that the Department is working to identify a streamlined process.  I will not read the note any further.  The Department is in breach of its statutory duties.  A housing authority must either have inspected and been satisfied that the property meets the rental accommodation standards within 12 months prior to the HAP application or have arranged to inspect the property within eight months of HAP commencing.  The Department and the local authorities under it are in breach of their statutory duties in this regard.  I am not interested in what plans, processes and arrangements are to be put in place.  According to the letter, the Department is targeting a 25% inspection rate, but I see nothing in the letter explaining why it can ignore the other 75%.  We discussed this matter as part of our periodic report, which we will revisit next week.  The function of these bodies is to implement the law, not to cherry-pick and inspect on a sample basis.  I am rejecting what is in front of us as unsatisfactory.  These bodies should comply with the law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#F01300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>It ties in with correspondence No. 1370B which outlined what the Department asserted had been done.

People make a complaint about mould on the wall in an expensive property that is being rented under the HAP scheme.  Invariably, they then get a notice to quit.  We are all encountering such cases.  Large sums of public money are involved.

A property is not accepted for HAP, however, if there is a prohibition notice or the property is subject to legal proceedings.  The threshold for standards is low, even in the legislation.

The Office of the Chief State Solicitor did not accept the report, stating that it was bound to follow the Law Society's guidance on planning compliance.  However, it has not communicated the difficulties that this presents with the Law Society and that contributed to the loss of &euro;4 million in respect of the building on Wolfe Tone Street.  There is a thread of emails relating to the 2011 report dating back over a period.  The Office of the Chief State Solicitor says that, although it followed the Law Society's standard guidance, this is now an issue.  We asked the office to take the matter up with the society, but there has been no communication between the two.  The office has ignored the previous recommendation.

He obviously has issues and has raised them in a protected disclosure, the timelines of which, as Deputy MacSharry has pointed out, have been contradicted with regard to how they have been dealt with.  His situation has to be mediated so that he can continue to work or whatever else the mediation process will involve.  The issues in his protected disclosure have to be dealt with comprehensively.  There are issues relating to the process by which the Prison Service deals with protected disclosures.  I do not think anyone, based on the information and conversations I have had with him and others, would feel comfortable in the Prison Service in making a protected disclosure in any way, shape or form.  I know they would not.  That is not right.  It is completely wrong.  There is a situation in Irish prisons where prison guards who do their job of finding drugs, mobile phones etc. feel that they get penalised because it looks bad for a prison for things to be found, the governor does not like that the statistics for these findings are getting higher, and then comes down on the prison officer.

The issues in the protected disclosure are severe and serious, need to be dealt with, and correlate with other people who have had issues in the Prison Service.  The third issue is the process by which the Irish Prison Service, supervised by the Department of Justice and Equality, has dealt with this, and the contradictions as outlined by Deputy MacSharry and me.  That last bit is quite serious.  The people watching this need to know that, as a committee, we will deal with these issues.  Before we finish this term, if we do not see progress on these items, I will ask this committee for support to have the Irish Prison Service and the Department of Justice and Equality sitting here in the first meeting we have after the recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#G02500","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Not to labour the point, but the whole point of protected disclosures is not necessarily just to look at individual disclosures but also systemic failures.

The last paragraph of his letter says the first question in our correspondence related to non-delivery of a contract service.  It is about JobPath.  It says the second question at the joint committee related to the operation of the payment model.  They are two slightly different aspects of the same issue and he makes clear that he was answering different aspects.  There is no contradiction and he is making that clear.  We note that and will forward it to the person who sent it to us.<\/p><p>Nos. 1401C and 1402C are dated 11 May 2018 and request that the committee investigate matters relating to the censorship of a play authored by the correspondent and make inquiries about a programme broadcast on UTV.

The individual states that major remedial work was carried out.  High Court proceedings were heard by Mr. Justice Humphreys.  According to the correspondent, the judge excoriated various public bodies, Wicklow County Council and the Department as the job done is so bad that public moneys were wasted and a further remedial project must recommence.  Much money has been expended on this matter.  The topic was discussed by the committee recently and we will ask for a very detailed and comprehensive response on the matter and follow up on it when that is received.<br\/><br\/>No. 1416C, dated 22 June 2018, relates to the dossier submitted to the committee by John Miskelly.

This is just a continuation of that argument that it was okay.  It has just gone another layer down the ladder.  We have established this is totally wrong.

In addition, I note we asked the individuals when did they have protected disclosures.

As members will know, I have an interest in the IBRC liquidation going back over the past year.  On my recommendation, as a committee, we included in our last periodic report a recommendation to establish a committee of inspection within the liquidation.  We discussed that it would include, for example, representatives from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  I had also made the unorthodox suggestion that we would consider making an approach to the person who has a legal case against the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance, for effectively the same reasons, to have increased oversight of the liquidation.  There was agreement in principle by the committee to do that and I was to come back with a recommendation of what shape that might take or how we would proceed.  In a personal capacity, and not on behalf of the committee, I contacted the plaintiff in that case and asked, in a personal capacity, how he envisaged such a thing would happen.  He sent me some documentation that I received in the past couple of days and which I will circulate to committee members.  His documentation seems to indicate to me that the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Department of Finance clearly listened to our deliberations and have taken the unprecedented step to contact the plaintiff with a suggestion of exploring the possibility of withdrawing the case and that they would defer to the Committee of Public Accounts.  While the suggestion is very unorthodox, it is something that could save the State a lot of money.  It might also enable us to ask questions and provide the level of oversight that are required.<\/p> <p>  In the past number of weeks we have had the fifth progress report on the liquidation.  On reading that report I am concerned that while probably legal in terms of accountancy law and practice, perhaps morally it was not as transparent as I would prefer, particularly from a legal fees perspective.  I have been shown documentation, and I see that the matter was covered in the media last weekend, where Arthur Cox, which is one legal firm, received &euro;23,000 in a given year.  I have also been shown documentation that in one case alone, the company had billed out nearly &pound;980,000, which is not obvious from reading the presentation.  <\/p> <p>  The underlying issue is the kind of questioning and second guessing that ought to be required and is normal practice in a liquidation has not been done in this instance.  Perhaps the Department and KPMG are doing the best possible job anybody could do.  Given the hundreds of millions of euro that are now involved and the likelihood that the costs will grow substantially - this liquidation being the biggest in the history of the State and, perhaps, one of the biggest in European history - it requires a greater level of scrutiny.  <\/p> <p>  I will circulate the documentation I have been given, which then will leave it up to members.  I will pass it on.  I sought the information in a personal capacity and I think it is useful.  On the back of the documentation, when it arrives, we should write to the Department of Finance or the Office of the Chief State Solicitor or perhaps both and ask how we can assist.  There is a basis for this case to be discontinued, which would save money for everybody.  More importantly, we, as a committee, may be able to participate and provide the necessary level of scrutiny in terms of looking after taxpayers' money.  At the moment, this matter reeks of autopilot.  I found, having read the progress report, that while potentially it is perfectly legal in accountancy terms, it lacks the kind of transparency to which I believe the public is entitled. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#M01800","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#M01900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Obviously, Deputy MacSharry is aware of the contents of the documentation he received but we are not.<\/p><p>Ideally, we would have oversight and the committee of inspection should have been set up right from the word go.

It is not that this committee would become the committee of inspection.  We would oversee its establishment and perhaps, given the unique circumstances, a member of the committee might be appointed to it.  I imagine that it would certainly have representation from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General because the expertise would be there.  If there is no case, we can then invite representatives from  KPMG, as the joint special liquidators, to come before us, together with the departmental officials who were here before and who told us that they had a great story to tell but that they could not answer questions because there was a case before the courts.

He told me that he would come back to me in writing on the current status.  We made a recommendation in January.  Is the Department embracing this?  Is it setting up a committee of inspection?  Clearly, it has done something because it seems to have made contact with the plaintiff in the case to ask whether there is a basis on which he would withdraw.  I understand he indicated quite clearly that he would defer to this committee.

As an accountant, the Chairman knows that committees of investigation are pretty prescriptive about who sits on them in normal liquidation situations.

The appropriation accounts for the Vote of the Department of Health, the HSE's financial statements for 2017, which were recently issued, and matters relating to consultants' pay, are on the agenda for next Thursday's meeting.  The following week, on 12 July, we have the National Treasury Management Agency before us.<\/p> <p>  I want to make two comments on the work programme.  I want to put the HSE on notice that we want it to deal with the following matters next week and I want to get this information to it.  One is consultants' pay, which we already have on our schedule.  This arose at our meeting earlier in the year.  We are all aware of the situation whereby the HSE has private investigators following certain consultants.  I asked a parliamentary question on what robust measures were in place to ensure that consultants comply with their contractual obligations.  The reply I received from the Minister by written answer on 14 February stated it is the responsibility of management to make sure the contracts are being enforced, and that he had asked the HSE to ensure robust measures are in place in 2018.  For next week, we want to know what measures have been put in place by the management of each hospital whose job it is, according to the Minister, to ensure that consultants comply with the contract.  We want to know the hospitals where the private detectives were brought in.  I do not know why they needed to be brought in if the hospital managers were doing their job.  We want details of this.  We also want the HSE to explain whether measures are in place anywhere to ensure that consultants comply with the contract.  The parliamentary question to which I received a reply on 14 February can be referred to the HSE in order that it will be aware of the topic.<\/p> <p>  I will come to the CervicalCheck issue in a moment.  However, the other issue I want the HSE to deal relates to a particular point.  We received a letter from a dental surgeon about the dental treatment service.  The scheme is very limited and covers people with medical cards and those classified by the HSE as high risk.  That high-risk group includes individuals with intellectual disabilities or sensory deficits.  Recently, the dental surgeon to whom I refer sought approval to carry out work on behalf of people considered high risk.  They are all patients the dental surgeon has dealt with for years.  One was a blind patient, another was a deaf and dumb patient and the third was a patient in HSE residential care.  It would be normal for this work to be approved.  The HSE wrote back to the dental surgeon seeking written medical evidence of the patients' sensory and intellectual deficits before it would approve the dental treatment, although they had nothing to do with dental treatment.  It wanted medical evidence of the disabilities.  The dentist claims the disabilities had no relevance.  I know the HSE needs procedures in place but the dentists cannot do their work.  The HSE has asked for medical evidence for every high-risk patient  It is awful for the dentist to have to say to his blind patient, his deaf and dumb patient, and his patient with an intellectual disability in residential care that a medical report on their position is required before he can do the dental work.  This seems to be creeping into HSE.  I want the HSE to give us a full briefing note to explain why it is going down this road.<\/p><p>It states in all its correspondence that it needs this information for other purposes in order to ensure that no claims that are not valid are  being processed under the system.  I think it has lost a bit of humanity in its approach.<\/p><p> That brings us to our second issue.  I want the HSE to give us a detailed report next week on where the process of recruitment relating to the new director general of the organisation stands.  I do not know whether the HSE or the Department of Health is here next as well.  Brendan Drumm was the first director general or chief executive officer of the HSE from 2005 to 2010.  Then we had Cathal McGee from 2010 to 2012 and Tony O'Brien from 2012 to 2018.  John Cunningham is currently in the role in an acting capacity.  A lot of people will feel that over the period since 2005, women's health has not been adequately dealt with by the HSE.  We have had the recent cervical cancer issue, breast cancer issues and maternity services issues.  I might be challenged on this but I urge those who are responsible for recruitment to give strong consideration to the argument that a woman should be the new director general of the HSE.  We have had excellent men but I believe a woman could bring something to the role in terms of putting patients first.  I ask that it be given a high mark on the scoring of any application.  People may say we are straying off track.  It is my own view and I am not asking the committee to endorse it.  I will make that point to the witnesses next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#N01200","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I appreciate the sentiment but it is a very strange comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#O00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>It is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#O00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Ultimately, women's issues are very important to the Labour Party, as are the social agenda and the progression of women's rights and their role in our society.

The commission is an independent statutory body tasked with providing a modern and efficient appeals process for the hearing and adjudication of tax disputes.  The 2016 appropriation account of the Tax Appeals Commission shows that the total spend by the commission in 2016 was &euro;890,000.  The amount provided for the commission for the year was &euro;1.5 million.  As a result, almost &euro;600,000 was liable for surrender at the year end, reflecting delays in recruiting staff and underspending on the commission&rsquo;s ICT system.  The commission has been reliant on the Revenue Commissioners for many support services.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 9 is a short report examining progress by the commission in putting in place the necessary corporate governance arrangements and the management of overtime payments in 2016.  While the commission was established formally in March 2016, we found that by September 2017 it was not yet fully compliant with its corporate governance obligations.  The commission published a governance framework that outlined the proposed governance structures, including audit, assurance and compliance arrangements.<\/p><p>It had not, however, established an audit committee, did not have in place a formal risk management system, and had no formal risk management policy or risk register.  An effective risk management process should assist the Tax Appeals Commission in achieving its objectives by allowing it to identify and manage threats to delivery in a timely and effective manner.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee on progress in developing its governance systems.  We are examining them again in the context of the 2017 appropriation account.<\/p><p> The commission's 2016 Vote appropriation account records overtime payments of &euro;65,400 to one employee, which was very substantial given the scale of the Vote.  Because of the additional expense involved, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines require that overtime working does not occur unless it is both authorised and unavoidable.  When the 2016 payments were examined by the audit, it was found that the records kept by the commission were not sufficient to substantiate the payments.  The claims for payment of overtime went back a number of years and there was no record that the claimed overtime work had been authorised by a more senior official.  The commission&rsquo;s then head of administration was not involved in review or authorisation of the payments and only became aware of them when Revenue's payments section queried the amount of overtime being processed on behalf of the commission.  Overall, the circumstances surrounding the overtime payments made in 2016 indicate a very weak control environment at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#P01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#Q00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530172800,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I am the Accounting Officer of the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC.  I am before the committee in response to matters highlighted by the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to internal controls in the TAC in 2016.  As members are probably aware, the decision to establish the TAC was made following a lengthy process of consultation, consideration and review by a number of different bodies.  It was established pursuant to the Finance (Tax Appeals) Act 2015 and commenced its activities on 21 March 2016.  The TAC is an independent body with its own Accounting Officer and Vote, although under the aegis of the Department of Finance.<\/p> <p>  The legislation made clear that the commission was to be a new body whose independence was enshrined in statute and which would have the power to adopt flexible and active case management procedures with a view to progressing and finalising appeals as efficiently as possible.  The former right of appeal to the Circuit Court was abolished and the TAC now makes findings of fact which are binding on the parties.  The only right of appeal from the TAC is to the High Court by way of a case stated on a point of law.  Perhaps because of this change, the Legislature also introduced a requirement for the Appeal Commissioners to give written determinations in every case, an obligation to publish those determinations and the right to apply those determinations to appeals which raise similar issues of law.<\/p> <p>  Ms Lorna Gallagher and I were appointed as Appeal Commissioners at the end of 2015, prior to the establishment of the Tax Appeals Commission, following a recruitment process conducted by the Public Appointments Service.  We were then reappointed pursuant to the 2015 Act when the TAC came into being.  We have been appointed for a seven-year term, which expires in 2023, and we may then be reappointed for one further term.  In June 2017, Mr. Conor Kennedy was appointed as a temporary commissioner, primarily to deal with the legacy appeals received from the Revenue Commissioners in the second half of 2016.  His appointment is for a two-year period, which may be extended by the Minister for Finance.<\/p> <p>  Following its establishment, the Tax Appeals Commission took over the operations of its predecessor, the Office of the Appeal Commissioners, working with the same staff and from the same premises.  When I was first appointed the office had a staff of four, including a principal officer seconded from the Department of Finance to assist with the planned establishment of the TAC.  The TAC now has a staff of 14.5, including a part-time official responsible for human resources and training and our current head of office who is not a permanent staff member of the TAC but rather a principal officer on secondment from the Department of Finance.  One member of staff has been absent on sick leave since August of 2017.<\/p> <p>  The staff of the TAC work in three distinct units, namely, scheduling, case management and administration.  Of the 14.5 staff, 11.5 of those were appointed in 2017 or 2018.  The most senior member of our permanent staff is an assistant principal.  While it is clear from the foregoing that there has been a growth in our staff numbers, particularly in the past 12 months, it has taken us a long time to recruit suitable people and we are still significantly short of the necessary staffing levels.<\/p> <p>  The workload of the TAC is considerable.  We assumed the existing caseload of the Office of the Appeal Commissioners and in the second half of 2016 a total of 2,731 legacy appeals were transferred to the TAC by the Revenue Commissioners.  The 2015 Act furthermore provides that all appeals are now made by taxpayers directly to the TAC, whereas under the previous regime appeals were notified to the Revenue Commissioners in the first instance.  This has resulted in a significant increase in the number of appeals which the TAC is required to process.  In 2016, the total number of appeals received was 901 but in 2017 that figure had jumped to 1,751.  The TAC is currently receiving an average of 150 appeals per month.  The TAC had approximately 5,500 appeals on hand during 2017 and we believe the total amount of tax currently under appeal is in the order of &euro;1.6 billion.  By contrast, our budget, at &euro;1.6 million, is approximately one thousandth of the amount of tax under appeal.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the appeals received, the TAC receives a significant volume of correspondence on appeals, all of which has to be logged, filed and responded to.  The TAC may receive as many as 100 items of correspondence per day.  In addition, the TAC is now the first point of contact for many taxpayers when they are dissatisfied with a tax issue or if they have a query in relation to same.  Queries that may formerly have been made to the Revenue Commissioners are now being made to the TAC.  The committee will appreciate that all of this absorbs a great deal of staff time and resources.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the appeals and correspondence workload, the TAC also has to meet all the governance requirements of a Civil Service body.  With regard to governance, the TAC is akin to a small Government Department, with all necessary obligations having to be discharged alongside our primary task of hearing and determining appeals.  While a Department might have several sub-offices such as a press office, corporate office, accommodation unit, a Minister's office and so on, the position in the TAC is that many staff cover several dedicated areas of responsibility as the TAC does not have sufficient staff numbers to assign specific members of staff exclusively to specific roles.<\/p> <p>  Our recently published annual report for 2017 shows that we have made very significant progress, both in addressing our appeals workload and in meeting our governance obligations.  Headline achievements during 2017 include closing 693 appeals; listing 106 appeals for hearing; conducting 89 case management conferences relating to 479 appeals; publishing 35 determinations; conducting a public consultation exercise on our procedures; producing new guidance notes for appellants; populating our case management database with quality checked data relating to thousands of individual appeals; establishing case management and scheduling units within the TAC; publishing a comprehensively revised code of governance; producing a three-year statement of strategy; and appointing internal auditors and established an audit group.  We have closed a further 821 appeals to date in 2018.  As of yesterday, that figure stood at 860 appeals.<\/p> <p>  We are proud of all that we have achieved with the resources available to us and Commissioner Gallagher and I take this opportunity to acknowledge the enormous commitment the staff has shown to date, the unrelenting pressure through which they have worked, the multitude of different tasks they have managed and the daily co-operation, assistance and support they continue to provide.  Notwithstanding the progress made, however, we are very much aware that a great deal more needs to be done for our stakeholders, particularly appellants and the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of staff and resources, the Tax Appeals Commission faces a significant risk from corporate memory loss if staff choose not to continue under the current pressures they face.  Also, as the TAC does not the resources or adequate levels of delegated sanction, staff operate in the awareness that the TAC cannot, as it stands, offer them a career path.  Leaving aside for a moment the issue of sanction and budgets, staffing risks are higher and more critical in a small office such as the TAC, as it does not have either the capacity to absorb the memory loss or the time and resources necessary to continuously recruit and train in new staff.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the main business of the office - being the adjudication and determination of tax appeals - there are strategic and structural issues that need to be addressed in order for the TAC to operate optimally.  In this regard, we have dealings with and rely upon the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of Public Works.<\/p> <p>  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2016 correctly highlighted significant governance and related issues in the TAC.  We fully accept the criticisms made in the report and we accept the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We have implemented those recommendations to the best of our ability with the resources available to us.  I believe the TAC's annual report for 2017 clearly shows that a great deal of progress has been made.  We fully accept that more progress needs to be made but we cannot do more without additional resources.  We have formally reported to the Minister for Finance pursuant to section 21 of the 2015 Act on the issue of additional resources, and we have met the Minister and officials from his Department to discuss this issue.  We have commissioned a resource review to obtain an independent analysis of resources and the Minister has recently appointed a retired Secretary General to carry out a resource review for his Department.  We hope that both these processes will be completed in the very near future and will enable the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to make an informed decision on our requests for additional resources for the TAC.<\/p><p> An efficient and impartial tax appeals body is an integral part of a state's system of taxation of its citizens.  To meet our statutory mandate, there are legislative amendments that could assist the TAC in operating in a more efficient and effective manner.  In this regard, the TAC recently suggested certain legislative amendments for consideration by the Department of Finance.<\/p><p> Our statutory mandate requires us to put in place the independent, effective and efficient tax appeals system envisaged by the 2015 Act.  However, this cannot be achieved without adequate resources and the level of independence needed to apply those where we identify the need.  Our 2017 annual report shows how much more was achieved in circumstances where, although we remained under-resourced, our resources had improved from the very low base obtaining at the commencement of the TAC in March 2016.  Appellants should not have to suffer undue delays in the hearing of their tax appeals, but we are currently unable to prevent delays in the system in circumstances where we remain so significantly under-resourced.<\/p><p> In order to improve the tax appeals system and deliver an independent commission that will process tax appeals in as efficient and effective a manner as envisaged, it is our duty to assess the needs of the commission, identify the assistance we require and communicate that information to the relevant Departments in the form of a request for additional resources.  It is to be hoped that the relevant authorities accept that we are driven to provide the optimal service for our stakeholders and that we are best placed to assess our needs.<\/p><p> I am attending today to answer whatever questions the committee may have, and we will be happy to follow up with any information that we are not in a position to provide now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputy Burke, it is clear that the TAC is not even remotely staffed and resourced to the scale required by the task at hand.  I have never seen anything as bad as this at the committee.  Some &euro;1.6 billion of taxpayers' money is hanging out there when it should be in the State's coffers.  Most of it probably will be once the cases are settled.<\/p> <p>  According to its report, the TAC received 1,751 appeals in 2017 and settled 693 of those.  Its waiting list increased by more than 1,000.  That anyone would need a retired Secretary General to say that the agency needed more staff is a joke.  It is obvious.  I hope the Minister is listening.  By not resourcing the commission enough to do its job of efficiently collecting moneys due to the taxpayer, he is letting the taxpayer down.  Given the size of its office, the commission has my sympathy in trying to cope with the tsunami of appeals.  It is outrageous.  We will get into further detail, but those were my initial comments.

I can highlight two or three for the committee, if it believes time is a pressure.  I will start with the one that has been obvious to all of us from the get go, which is the matter of cases stated.  The Deputy asked whether we had been judicially reviewed, to which the answer is \"No\".  However, there is an appeal mechanism in the tax legislation whereby an appellant or the Revenue Commissioners, if they are so minded, may appeal us directly to the High Court to have what is effectively a point-of-law rehearing.  That provision requires an Appeal Commissioner himself or herself to draft the case stated document, which is a detailed and exacting document for the benefit of the High Court judge who will hear the case.  A series of questions must be set out, the determination must be clearly put forward, the points of appeal clarified and all of the exhibiting, supporting documentation included.<\/p> <p>  I believe we have asked, and will do so again, for this provision to be amended in a manner that will alow usl to request the appealing parties to draft a case stated document for review by us so that we can then alter or amend as necessary.  Drafting case stated documents takes many hours, consuming a great deal of our time.  We will ask for that change.  When our body of determinations grows, the number of appeals will inevitably grow as well.  The interesting thing about the case stated legislation is that it provides a tight timeframe of three months within which an Appeal Commissioner must draft, finalise and sign the case stated.  As such, if I receive a case stated application, I must prioritise that ahead of determinations that have been sitting on my shelves and awaiting my attention.  If the parties could draft the case stated document for my review and my final sign-off, it would be of great assistance.  This is one of the recommendations we have made.<\/p> <p>  Another recommendation that may be of interest to the committee relates to our section 949 new jurisdiction provision.  This jurisdiction is helpful for taxpayers because it allows them to opt to have their appeals heard without oral hearings.  They can furnish to us in writing their submissions, statements and points of view, the points of law and anything else they feel is relevant.  The Commissioner will then sit down at his or her desk and draft the determination on foot of that paperwork, as per between Revenue and the taxpayer.  This facility has been taken up significantly by taxpayers.  However, the legislative provision as drafted does not allow us to make the final call on whether a case is determined in this way.  In circumstances where we feel that a small case, for example, of under &euro;10,000, or a non-complex case is appropriate for a section 949 new determination but the taxpayer disagrees with us, unfortunately we have to schedule a hearing and the matter will go through that process.  We have asked for consideration of whether we might make that decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorna Gallagher"},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>The Commissioners might send us details on the rest of the recommendations.

We are very much aware that resources are needed.  We just want to make sure that the correct resources go in.  To put this in context, one can see from the increase in staffing that the commission has gone from having two commissioners and four staff in 2016 to having three commissioners and 15 support staff.  That demonstrates the engagement the Department has had in improving the staff.<\/p> <p>  As of our liaison meeting on 18 January, we were still aware that additional shortlisting was going on for new case managers at assistant principal level, and that process was under way.  Three weeks later, we got a request for resources that would include an assistant secretary, two further principals, an additional assistant principal and a higher executive officer.  The fact that this came three weeks after a liaison meeting where none of that had been raised gave us serious cause for concern and that is why we have said we are not disputing that more resources are needed, we just want to make sure that the correct resources go in.  The Minister is very conscious that a fully functioning appeals system is an essential part of the tax system.  It is as much in our interest that this system works as it is in the interests of tax and taxpayers that it works.  We want this to work and we want it to be appropriately resourced.  The Minister is fully engaged with this.  That is why we have appointed a single reviewer to go in to do the review as quickly as possible.  It is someone with experience, who can essentially put the business case to the Minister with his Public Expenditure and Reform hat on, and say these are the resources that are needed to make this an effective and fully functioning body and then we will have the basis on which to resource it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#Y02900","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Donaghy"},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":583,"content":"<p>Has the Department factored into that process the fact that if Revenue were to put in a review system. as happens in social welfare. it might prevent cases arising?

In 2012, the figure was 247 but this increased to 356 in 2013, 498 in 2014 and reached 667 in 2015.  That is based on information received in response to parliamentary questions.  In 2016, the figure was 960 and in 2017 it was 1,405.  The more people know about the office, the more people will make appeals.  There needs to be some way of triaging cases.  Perhaps Revenue needs to step up to the plate and deal with some by having a review.  Revenue might say that is the job of the commission; I do not know.  The figure was 1,405 last year and will be at least 1,800 this year.  Only four years ago, the figure was 500 and it will have increased to well over 2,000 next year.

The 2017 account shows that net receipts of taxes and duties amounted to a total of &euro;50.8 billion, an increase of &euro;2.8 billion, or 5.8%, by comparison with the figure for 2016.  Receipts related to VAT, income tax and corporation tax together accounted for over 80% of net tax receipts.<\/p><p>Receipts collected by Revenue and remitted directly to non-Exchequer agencies and funds also increased substantially.  Net receipts totalled &euro;10.8 billion in 2016, increasing to &euro;12.2 billion in 2017, an increase of around 13.5%.  Pay related social insurance, PRSI, contributions account for the majority of this category of receipts.  A significant part of the increase in that category of receipts in 2017 was in respect of the VAT mini one-stop-shop, MOSS, scheme, which implements place of supply based VAT rules for businesses engaged in electronic supply of services cross-border.  Transfers to other EU member states increased from just under &euro;400 million in 2016 to almost &euro;1.2 billion in 2017.<\/p><p> Revenue's administration and operational expenses are charged to Vote 9, Revenue Commissioners, rather than the Revenue account.  The 2016 appropriation accounts show that the total spent by Revenue in the year was &euro;397 million.  Taking account of appropriations-in-aid of &euro;75 million, net expenditure under the Vote amounted to &euro;322 million.  The surrender for the year was &euro;8.8 million.<\/p><p> There were three chapters in last year's report on the accounts of the public services dealing with Revenue-related issues.  The committee has already examined and reported on the chapter dealing with corporation tax.<\/p><p> Revenue is obliged under legislation to collect tax in a timely and efficient way, including the pursuit of any tax debt outstanding.  As at 31 March 2017, the total value of gross tax debt outstanding was just under &euro;2.3 billion.  The value of outstanding debt has increased since 2015, reversing the downward trend of the previous five years.  Revenue has attributed the increase in recent years to an increase in the value of tax debt outstanding under appeal and, therefore, not currently available for collection.  Tax debt under appeal in March 2017 accounted for 48% of the total.  Our analysis also found that &euro;661 million or 29% of the total tax debt was classified as collectable, but it was not subject to either payment agreements or enforcement proceedings.  About one third was recently identified as debt.  Much of the remainder was at various stages of investigation or review but some debt was not under investigation.<\/p><p> Revenue wrote out a total of &euro;211 million of debt in 2016 and active pursuit of that payment ceased.  It included &euro;1.6 million in around 512,000 cases where small balances, an average of just over &euro;3 per case, were written out automatically.  The remainder was higher value debt which was written out on a case by case basis, with more senior authorisation for higher debts written out.  The most frequent reasons for such debt write-outs are liquidations and businesses ceasing to trade.<\/p><p> Chapter 22 deals with delays in transferring certain tax receipts to the Exchequer, which resulted in the accumulation of deposits in a Revenue holding account at the Central Bank at year end.  The problem arose because the receipts for the two tax heads had not been matched with the appropriate taxpayer records in a timely way.  Encashment tax is a standard rate income tax deduction made by banks and stock broking firms when they make or receive certain payments.  Encashment tax receipts of just under &euro;31 million which had accumulated in the period 2012 to 2016 remained unallocated to taxpayer records at the end of 2016.  <\/p><p> Since the start of 2015, companies which qualify for a film tax credit are required to apply film withholding tax when they make certain payments to non-resident artists from outside the European Union and remit the amounts collected to Revenue.  Accumulated film withholding tax receipts of &euro;1 million remained unallocated to taxpayer records at the end of 2016.  Revenue subsequently developed systems to ensure more timely allocation of such receipts to taxpayer records.  The accumulated receipts of both taxes were allocated to customers records during 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#JJ00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I call on Mr. Cody to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#KK00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530172800,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for giving me this opportunity to make a short opening statement.  The focus of the meeting is on chapters 21 and 22 of the 2016 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, entitled Tax Debt and Write Outs and Allocation of Encashment and Film Withholding Taxes, respectively.  The meeting is also to consider the 2016 appropriation accounts, as well as the Revenue accounts for 2016 and 2017.<\/p> <p>  I will first address the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the two chapters of his 2016 report, setting out some of the background for context, as well as providing an update on progress in implementing the recommendations made.<\/p> <p>  Revenue plays a vital role in the economy by collecting taxes and duties due to the State.  In 2017 we collected a net &euro;50.76 billion in taxes and duties.  This is the seventh consecutive annual increase and was &euro;2.8 billion more than in 2016.  Provisional net tax collection to 31 May 2018 was &euro;20.48 billion, which was &euro;1.2 billion ahead of the figure for the same period last year.  Revenue's core strategy is to maintain and improve timely voluntary compliance, tackle non-compliance and prevent the occurrence of tax debt.  The maintenance of high rates of timely compliance, categorised by case size, in other words, by the amount of tax at risk in the event of late or non-payment, is a key measure of our performance and closely monitored.  Table 1, attached to my opening statement, sets out the rates of timely compliance each year in the period from 2013 to date.<\/p> <p>  It is clear the overwhelming majority of taxpayers want to be and are voluntarily compliant.  We acknowledge and value the important role of compliant taxpayers, businesses and their agents.  One of our core targets in the next three years is to reduce debt levels by increasing the rate of timely compliance for all other cases from 89% to the mid-90s range.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's 2016 report explains that tax debt falls into two main categories, namely, debt that is available to collect and debt that is not available to collect.  The latter mianly comprises debt that is the subject of appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission and insolvency related debt.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report reflects &euro;2.29 billion in total tax debt outstanding as at 31 March 2017.  Of this, &euro;1.19 billion was not available for collection, while &euro;1.1 billion was available for collection, equating to 1.68% of gross collection.  By comparison, at the end of March 2018, total tax debt was down 4% to &euro;2.2 billion.  This includes &euro;1.24 billion not available for collection and &euro;958 million available for collection, representing 1.35% of gross collection.  The committee will be interested to hear that the amount available for collection in 31 May 2018 was down to &euro;845 million.<\/p> <p>  To safeguard tax receipts due to the Exchequer and in support of the compliant majority, Revenue intervenes early when tax payments and filing obligations are not met.  Recognising that the more entrenched the debt becomes, the more difficult it is to resolve, our approach offers businesses and taxpayers an opportunity to deal with tax payment problems before they become unmanageable through early engagement.  When viable businesses or taxpayers with temporary payment problems engage with us honestly, we work with them to reach an agreed solution.  On 31 March 2017 there were 12,437 such businesses and taxpayers in phased payment arrangements in respect of &euro;116 million in tax debt.  At the end of March 2018, there were 10,833 phased payment arrangements in place, covering &euro;99 million in tax debt.<\/p> <p>  The small minority of taxpayers who either refuse to engage with us or refuse to pay their tax are met with enforcement action.  On 31 March 2017, &euro;328 million of debt available for collection was subject to enforcement proceedings.  During 2017 we referred more than 40,000 warrants to the sheriffs, while over 3,700 cases were referred for court recovery action, yielding a combined &euro;181 million in debt collected.<\/p> <p>  In order to secure a tax debt, Revenue may place a notice of attachment on a third party.  Attachment is an escalated option and normally used only where sheriff or solicitor enforcement has failed to secure payment of a debt or it is likely to be the only effective collection option.  In 2017 we issued 6,440 notices of attachment, yielding &euro;32 million for the Exchequer.  During 2017 we successfully petitioned the courts to liquidate 34 defaulting companies, while 22 individuals were adjudicated bankrupt by the courts on foot of a Revenue petition and 273 personal insolvency arrangements were agreed .<\/p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General reported that, at the end of March 2017, &euro;661 million in debt available for collection was not the subject of either a payment agreement or enforcement action.  While &euro;390 million of this was more recent debt, &euro;271 million was more than one year old, had no payment agreement in place and no enforcement action initiated.  The Comptroller and Auditor General recommends that Revenue conducts an annual review of such debt.<\/p><p> I assure the committee that entrenched debt is always the subject of regular close oversight and, as at 31 May 2018, the recovery process has been finalised in respect of &euro;148 million, or 55%, of that older debt.  Of the remaining &euro;123 million, 93.5%, or &euro;115 million, is under active collection involving direct engagement between Revenue and the taxpayer, while the balance of &euro;8 million is likely to conclude in write-off as uncollectible debt due to the circumstances of the taxpayers involved.  As at 31 March 2018, the comparable figures to the &euro;661 million and the &euro;271 million are &euro;569 million, down 14% and &euro;221 million, down 18%.<\/p><p> Turning to debt write-out, it is inevitable that business failure or individual circumstances will sometimes make collection impossible.  In such circumstances, Revenue may write out the debt and suspend all collection activity.  Most debt write-out is on a case-by-case basis.  Debt may be the subject of partial write out, where the taxpayer is able to make some payments towards the tax due but unable to pay the debt in full.  Our write-out procedures and controls facilitate closer focus by Revenue on the debt with a reasonable prospect of collection.  During 2017, Revenue wrote out &euro;147 million in tax debt.  This related mainly to insolvencies and ceased trades, and represented a reduction of 30% on the write out figure of &euro;211 million in 2016.<\/p><p> The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General refers to receipts of almost &euro;31 million in encashment tax in the period 2012 to 2016 and &euro;1 million in film withholding tax in the period 2015 to 2016 that remained unallocated to taxpayer records at the end of 2016.  Unallocated receipts are transferred daily to the Exchequer.  The only exception to this occurs in December each year when the transfer is suspended to facilitate the end of year balancing of the Revenue account by its accountant general.  Unallocated receipts are reported in the annual revenue account on the balance sheet as an asset and under the corresponding liability.<\/p><p> In June 2016, Revenue introduced RevPay, an online payment facility for all major tax liabilities, including encashment tax and film withholding tax.  RevPay facilitates online payment by debit or credit card, or by using a single debit authority, and the taxpayer record is updated when the payment is made.  This new facility reduces reliance on electronic funds transfer, EFT, as a payment method and over time will help to reduce the level of unallocated tax balances for all taxes.  In 2017, Revenue completed a project which updated the customer record for all payments of encashment tax and film withholding tax, and there are currently no unallocated receipts of encashment tax or film withholding tax.<\/p><p> The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General recommends that systems should be quickly updated when new taxes are introduced, and this is in keeping with the objectives of Revenue.  However, the prioritisation of IT development resources requires proportionate allocation.  For example, PAYE modernisation and the introduction of real time PAYE reporting on 1 January 2019 is a priority project for Revenue this year.  As such, smaller developments may not always be completed as quickly as would otherwise be the case.  However, like film withholding tax and encashment tax, all required changes will be assessed and prioritised in the IT development schedule and integrated with other taxes at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p> In keeping with the responsibility Revenue has to protect Exchequer funds, our resources are allocated based on risk.  Our debt management framework prioritises early intervention and action to drive positive taxpayer behaviour.  This gives the taxpaying public confidence that the system is fair, which, in turn, drives the very high rates of voluntary compliance.  In 2017, Revenue introduced a new case segmentation and compliance tracking system, providing greater oversight, enhanced whole case management and flexibility in matching debt management resources to business needs.  The new system is being implemented on a phased basis and all key elements are planned to be operational in early 2019.  The system has contributed to strong compliance outcomes and will also provide enhanced online customer services, thereby supporting positive compliance behaviour.<\/p><p> I will be happy to answer any questions raised by the committee.  In that context, I draw attention to my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality, as provided for in section 851(a) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and which prevents me from commenting on the tax affairs of any individual or entity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018062800002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530172800,"counter":645,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cody and his team for the presentation and for being here today.  This morning, the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC, appeared before us, and to say that we were shocked by some of the things it said to us is putting it mildly.  It said there is no external phone system, that nobody can ring out or ring in, and that the computers of directors have blown up.  It reminded me of Manuel from \"Fawlty Towers\".  However, as the Chairman pointed out this morning, this is serious business, not just for those who are collecting tax but for the wider public and society.

The witness knows this better than anyone; it is reflected in his remarks.<\/p> <p>  This morning, Mr. O'Mahony from the TAC said that he felt he was being stymied.

We have also appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, to discuss the same issue.  It is useful to put the issue into context.  The TAC inherited a tax appeals system that was not fit for purpose.  From 2009 or 2010, my predecessor made it one of her lifetime ambitions, as chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, to reform the tax appeal system.  The previous Minister for Finance launched a consultation on tax appeals in, I believe, 2013.  It was one of the few times that Revenue, as an office, actually made a submission to the Department of Finance.  The TAC is independent of Revenue.  The office which preceded it was also independent.  We do not control the tax appeal system and we did not control it before the TAC was established.  The legislation to deal with tax appeals was very limited before the Finance (Tax Appeals) Act 2015 was commenced.  The TAC was then set up in 2016, and has been a major reform of the tax administration system.  The TAC did not create the problem because there was a legacy system which did not have the proper system around it to provide for the listing of cases.<\/p> <p>  I pay great attention to proceedings of the Committee on Public Accounts, particularly when tax is being discussed.  I watched the discussion this morning with the TAC.  Some of the statements made, which Mr. O'Mahony did not make but which he reported, are based on a submission that was made to a recent consultation provided for by the TAC.  I would be very wary of relying on submissions being made by what I see as vested interests.  The legal framework for how the appeals system works is set out in legislation.  We raise an assessment, or make a determination, or disallow a repayment.  Those are formal processes that are then, by law, subject to appeal to the TAC.  It is not a back office for the Revenue nor could it be.<\/p><p>In certain cases, there are issues around whether there are grounds for appeal.  Sometimes, people make appeals without having the grounds to do so, and the TAC must rule on that matter as well.  I do not in any way agree that we use the TAC as a back office.  However, there are a number of issues with the process, and I am willing to set out for the committee the detail around the transition to the TAC.

We had to write to each taxpayer and ask him or her a series of questions.  Some appeals were in a legacy position and the taxpayers did not realise that they were still open.  They had to fill out a questionnaire, the first question on which was whether the appeal was still in existence.<\/p> <p>  The legislation also provided for an opportunity for agreement between Revenue and the taxpayer about the issue.  Subsequently, some practitioners said that they had believed they were going to get an opportunity to reach settlements, but I imagine what they thought was that, if the liability was X amount, we would settle for half of it.  We cannot do that, however.  We are obliged to interpret and apply the law.  What the legislation provided was an opportunity for engagement to see whether there could be agreement around the interpretation of the law or the quantum of the liability.  A good number of cases settled at that stage and did not proceed.  However, the taxpayer might have replied that he or she was interested in the appeal continuing.<\/p> <p>  The cases were transferred in three tranches, with the details set out, a spreadsheet all the cases and the notes on each.  In the period between the first and final tranches, there was a Supreme Court judgment on a case, which led to the settlement of approximately 100 follower cases.  It was a tax planning case that we lost.  Those cases had gone over in the first tranche, but they were then withdrawn because the assessments fell.<\/p> <p>  A process would have been followed at the end of November or December.

The Chairman mentioned a few points he recalled from that process.  All of these figures were on the agenda.  One of the reasons the Minister authorised up to five temporary appeal commissioners was the significant legacy issues.  One temporary commissioner was appointed to join the two permanent commissioners.  If the committee would find it useful, I can set all this out in detail.  We cannot have an assessment that is then subject to appeal without us putting on an appeal stop to stop the collection.  While the appeal is waiting to be heard, the money is not due.  This morning, it was asked whether that interfered with someone's tax clearance certificate.  If an assessment is under appeal, the person is entitled to a tax clearance certificate.

Most of our audit settlements are reached without the raising of an assessment and the issuing of an appeal.  If there is an additional liability, it is settled by agreement and, hopefully, paid.  Where there is a disagreement at the end of an intervention, most appeal cases relate to an interpretation of the law whereas others relate to the quantum of the liability.  For example, the best records not necessarily being kept was mentioned this morning.  In such an instance, we would have assessed the liability and raised an assessment, which would then have been appealed.  Those cases are less precise because, if there are not proper records, we make assumptions.  However, we must have grounds to make an assessment.

I was looking at it and the biggest proportion of it related to liquidations of companies in the property development and construction area arising from the collapse of the building industry.  Sometimes these liquidations take that length of time.  Some of them were unfortunately cases that had gone through a whole legal process of appeal, in which Revenue won at every level of appeal.  When these cases were settled the companies went into liquidation, leaving substantial debts.  That is one of the reasons we would be very keen to make the appeals process much speedier.  Some cases enter the appeals process partly as a strategy to ensure that those involved do not end up paying the money at all.  In the last figures the amount written off had decreased to &euro;147 million.  That reflects the recovering economy, but even in a recovering economy businesses will run into difficulty through no fault of the business itself.  Business failure is not all down to people engaging in sharp practice.  It is an inevitable part of the business cycle.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are really keen to improve the timeliness of compliance in order to prevent moneys owed becoming debt.  On that increase in timeliness, our large cases have a 90% compliance rate in the month following the date of payment.  Compliance in medium-sized cases, which is to say cases involving a tax liability of &euro;200,000 to &euro;500,000, is now up to 98%.  Compliance in cases involving total liabilities of less than &euro;200,000 has increased from 81% in 2009 to 89%.  I would be really interested in having a target to improve that to approximately 95% over the next three years.

In that submission we said that the return on investment from a fully-trained Revenue auditor is in the region of 10:1.  In the last number of budgets and Estimates processes, the Minister has supported that case.  While Deputy Michael Noonan was Minister he supported the case to Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who was Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Minister is now supporting that case to himself.

That is all I can say at this stage.  Revenue has an idea of the amount of tax that was due, as far as it was concerned, and that arrived in the appeals office.  Is that right?  Then, when the cases come back out, Revenue must know because the cases will come in and out.  Revenue either pays or collects the tax.  Mr. Cody is the person in receipt of the information.  The Tax Appeals Commission has no knowledge of this.  It does not handle the tax, as in what goes in and what percentage comes back out.  In other words, if 700 cases were decided last year, as the Tax Appeals Commission said, Revenue knows about the 700 and knows what it was hoping to get from those 700 when they went in.  How much did Revenue actually get out of those 700?  We just want to see this.  It is a mechanism of knowing how this operation is working.  If everything that went in came back out as it was, what is the point?  If there is a change, it tells us something has happened but no one seems to have any information on this.  It is akin to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  In social welfare, if somebody disputes his or her allowance or an entitlement to something and goes to the appeals office, the appeals office is there to adjudicate on A and B and reject C and D and it sends the case to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to go back and work out the figure.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office does not do the calculation.  It sounds as if the Tax Appeals Commission is akin to that.

Once the assessment is issued, the review process does not apply but before an assessment is entered there is a process, and we set out how many interventions we deal with.  The number of appeals went up in the 2017 process.  Some of this is accounted for by the fact that previously, when people used to write to us at assessment, they used to tell us they did not understand the process.  This is lost a bit because of the formal appointment of the Tax Appeals Commission.  We are open to exploring this.  We made a submission to the Tax Appeals Commission asking whether there are ways we can tidy up some of these smaller cases.  It is important to recognise that it is really a new office.

The maximum is 22.5% of the value of the house at the time the person goes into the nursing home.

The HSE has the facility to defer the process if, perhaps, a member of the family is still living in the house.  In the period from November 2010, when the first case was referred to us, until March 2018, a total of 5,327 were referred to us at a loan repayment value of &euro;101.6 million.  Of those, 3,921 have been finalised, resulting in repayments of &euro;69.8 million.  In 632 cases, involving &euro;16.3 million, that have been referred to us the amount is not yet due because there is a year from the date of death until the amount becomes due.  These are people who died or left the nursing home within the year.  There are 461 cases in which the HSE has advised us it has deferred collection of &euro;7.7 million.  In these cases the people involved did not apply for referral.  The cases were referred to us for collection but the people involved then went back to the HSE and they had a reason for deferral.  We mark them and do not follow them up.  In 313 cases, we are looking at a liability of &euro;7.9 million, and that is the debt available in these cases.

The most interesting thing to happen in 2018 was the discovery of the illicit, illegal cigarette factory in County Louth in March, which we seized.  We discovered 23.5 million cigarettes which were being manufactured in what one could describe as a hay shed.  The Deputy may have seen some pictures of that.  We found some 71 tonnes of tobacco from which 71 million cigarettes could be produced.  That was a big operation, which is now before the courts.

We are part of Crosscare.  Crosscare is a social support agency of the Dublin Catholic archdiocese which has supported Irish emigrants for over 75 years.  We were officially established as Emigrant Advice in 1987, and about ten years ago changed our name to Crosscare Migrant Project and we have continued to support both those leaving and coming home.  We are here to discuss the findings of our report \"One Hundred Thousand Welcomes?\".  We present this report as a contribution to the implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s diaspora policy, in particular the aim to reduce barriers for returning emigrants.<\/p> <p>  In the past few years the discourse around returning home has begun to identify the experience as one of &lsquo;re-emigration&rsquo; &ndash; a very demanding move, as significant as leaving the country, despite the fact that emigrants are \"coming home\".  We found that returning emigrants can face many barriers, and we have a great deal of experience in this area.  One of the main barriers we will speak on today is the issue of accessing social protection and safety nets for those who need them on their return.  The major issue for them is the habitual residence condition, HRC. <\/p> <p>  Our work is funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, specifically the emigrant support programme.  We aim to provide a quality information and advocacy service in particular to those who are vulnerable or marginalised.  Through our engagement with the people who use our service, we aim to effect change in the policies that affect migrants and returning emigrants.  We have worked extensively for changes to the HRC guidelines for more than ten years.  We made a presentation to the committee in 2008.  Changes were implemented at that stage that made quite a difference for people returning and we saw a major improvements.  However in the past couple of years, issues are beginning to affect people who are returning now.  This is important in the context of the wave of people returning.  More than 105,000 Irish emigrants have returned home in the past four years.  The issue will start affecting more people and we have seen this as a growing trend.  The report presents an overview and is evidence based.  We hope it will be useful to the Department and to the committee in its role of addressing some of the inconsistencies we have seen in the decision making.<\/p> <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague, Ms McLaughlin, who has done all the hard work and can talk members through the technical and complex bits. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018062800002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard King"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530178200,"counter":865,"content":"<p>The recurrence of issues that we have experienced is the basis for the report.  We have encountered during the past two years an increase in the number of returned Irish emigrants who have been disallowed social welfare claims based on the habitual residence condition.  The habitual residence condition is an assessment that was introduced in the European Union in 2004 that must be satisfied for an individual to be eligible for most non-contributory social welfare payments in Ireland.  It requires an applicant to show that he or she has a strong connection to Ireland and that it is their home again.  It is not based on nationality and is therefore applicable to both Irish and non-Irish citizens.  The operational guidelines are adopted by deciding officers in the Department to assess applications with regard to all relevant conditions.  There are five factors that are considered by deciding officers when assessing if a person is habitually resident: first, the main centre of interest; second, the length and continuity of residence; third, the length and purpose of any absence from Ireland; fourth, the nature and pattern of employment; and fifth, the future intention to live in Ireland as it appears from all the circumstances.<br\/><br\/>These have been amended and updated during the past few years, in particular, a specific provision was introduced in 2010 which particularly affects returned Irish emigrants.  It states: &ldquo;A person who had previously been habitually resident in the State and who moved to live and work in another country and then resumes his\/her long-term residence in the State may be regarded as being habitually resident immediately on his\/her return to the State.&rdquo; <b><\/b>How does this affect returning emigrants?  Irish emigrants who were previously resident in Ireland should be found habitually resident immediately upon return to Ireland, once they can demonstrate that they are resuming their residence.  The interpretation and appropriate application of this guideline is what we are concerned with here.  We have seen evidence of varying degrees of inconsistencies in the application of the HRC assessment.  In the majority of these cases, the individuals are experiencing very vulnerable situations such as homelessness or risk of homelessness, with no income or support networks.  Additionally some have children or further health and social care support needs. <br\/><br\/>On a daily basis, we provide information on access to social welfare and the HRC assessment criteria to all clients who have recently returned to Ireland or are planning to return.  We have seen an increase in the number of queries relating to HRC within recent years.  We dealt with more than 280 queries in 2017 and worked directly on 18 cases of HRC-based disallowed claims.  We submitted 12 cases to the social welfare appeals office and every case was successfully overturned.  Two thirds of these cases came from dual citizens who were either born here to non-Irish parents or who naturalised as adults, some of whom were forced to return in crisis from conflict zone areas such as Libya and Sudan on the advice of Irish consular authorities.<\/p><p> Our report illustrates some of the issues in case studies we have dealt with.  All these cases concerned individuals experiencing very vulnerable circumstances who had to wait on average five to nine months for their cases to return and to access their entitlements.  The long delay and stress involved had a significant adverse impact on them and their welfare.  To supplement our case studies and our direct work in the service, we conducted new research through an online survey to capture the experience of other individuals who have been disallowed a claim based on HRC on their return.  A total of 11 people, that is, half of those surveyed, told us they had been refused based on the HRC, mainly for jobseeker's allowance.  These were mainly people looking for work on their return.  Only two of them had made an appeal against the decision and were still awaiting an outcome.  All these individuals may have been left with very limited options and were possibly put in quite a vulnerable situation.  They told us they felt the process was \"intimidating\", \"demeaning\" and \"humiliating\" and they were made to feel guilty.  These expressions echoed comments from respondents in a broader survey which we carried out last year with 400 returned emigrants in our report Home for Good?  More than 100 people gave us negative comments on their experiences of access to social welfare payments on return.  Furthermore, we included in the report contributions from other emigrant support organisations across the world on the experiences of emigrants who are planning to return with urgent support needs.  They talk about misconceptions among Irish emigrants of their rights and entitlements.  They perceive these misconceptions as caused by inaccessible information on access to entitlements, particularly in respect of clarity surrounding the HRC assessment.  They perceive the lack of information and misconceptions on the HRC to be actively deterring emigrants from returning to Ireland on the presumption that they may not be able to access a safety net of income while they re-establish their employment in Ireland.<\/p><p> Our recommendations circle around two areas and functions of the Department.  I will quickly go through the recommendations in respect of the administrative function.  We ask the Department to ensure appropriate and consistent application of the guidelines for the HRC for returning emigrants as resuming previous residence through updated and ongoing training and supervision for deciding officers; to provide a user-friendly bespoke guide to the HRC for returning emigrants on the website and to regularly update it; and to introduce a mechanism, such as a declaration form or an option for inclusion in the current HRC application form, not dependent on proof of secured housing, that returning emigrants can confirm that they have returned to reside in the State on a permanent basis.  Figures released by the Department on claims disallowed on the HRC currently do not include a breakdown of those that were referred to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  In our experience, all the cases with which we have assisted have been overturned on appeal and thus are recorded as awarded claims.  We recommend that published figures reflect all cases that have been referred to the appeals office.  This will allow us to identify some problems at the initial application stage.<\/p><p> In respect of the customer service function, we ask the Department to provide clarity on required documents and evidence for social welfare claims in all forms of communication with returned emigrants, including the HRC leaflets, website and communications by email and phone and in person; to ensure referral of returned emigrants to the community welfare service for basic supplementary welfare allowance, as many people are unaware of this, a decision made in advance of the primary claim, as per the guidelines, and the exercise of appropriate discretion in the issuance of exceptional needs payments where needed in vulnerable circumstances; and to ensure referral of returned emigrants to the appeals process and to other support services for further support needs, such as our service, Safe Home Ireland and local services such as citizens information centres.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its interest in this matter.  We ask that members consider the issues raised and support the recommendations put forward to the Department to ensure that returned emigrants are not disproportionately affected by the HRC or at a disadvantage solely due to the fact that they have lived abroad.  This commitment would be in line with the aims of Ireland's diaspora policy, as Mr. King mentioned, supported by the Minister of State for diaspora affairs, to facilitate the return of Irish emigrants in a recovering economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018062800002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Danielle McLaughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530178200,"counter":867,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McLaughlin.

As Mr. King explained, I do the information and advocacy work with the clients face to face.  I find in my work that deciding officers in more rural areas sometimes do not see as many people returning home and their understanding of the rules can sometimes be a little patchy.  This is not to say that deciding officers in Dublin do not have the same issues.  I have been in touch with many deciding officers who really want to help someone with whom I am in touch.  I have spoken to them on the phone and they have said they really would like to award a certain entitlement but they cite habitual residence and the two-year rule.  Some people still think there is a two-year rule.  There is not.  Sometimes there is a fixation on one particular factor out of the five, such as time away, perhaps.  To come back to the Chairman's question, this does seem to happen a little more in rural areas.  In places such as the homeless persons unit in Dublin, we do not really tend to have as many issues now as we once did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018062800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Judy McAvoy"},{"type":"speech","time":1530178200,"counter":869,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  Theirs is an excellent piece of work and long overdue.  It is an issue in respect of which I get people coming to my constituency offices expressing concern and frustration at how their cases are being handled and in many ways stymied.  This is all reflected in the experiences highlighted in Crosscare's submission.  Cases similar to all these have come through my constituency offices.<\/p> <p>  Another issue that has presented itself, albeit not in huge numbers, is the breakdown of relationships whereby one party has had to return home.  This has presented itself as a huge challenge.  People try to access various information, whether bank statements or information on property they may have been renting or may own.  Some deciding officers really do not know what to do and essentially put a red line through it and force that person then to go through a lengthy appeal process.  At the same time, there is no referral to community welfare officers or anything like that.  It is a real problem.  However, the witnesses highlight in their submission that all of the 12 cases they have represented that have gone to appeal have been overturned.  This in itself sets off alarm bells that many deciding officers' interpretation in adjudicating on these cases is really not at the level it should be.  In many cases they probably do not have the knowledge or the know-how.  I see this even with disability allowance payments and other areas.  The easy option is just to put a red line through it and let the applicant then go through a lengthy appeal process.  The fact that these 12 cases which the witnesses represented were all successful just highlights this.<\/p> <p>  The recommendations the witnesses have put forward are all common sense and very basic, and I agree with every one of them.  This committee has heard evidence on exceptional needs payments and community welfare officers and the huge levels of discretion they have in offices right across the State.  This is posing problems.  There does not seem to be one set of criteria from which they all work.  There are huge anomalies and issues here in that one community welfare officer will grant something and another will not, and the two could be identical cases.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the report.  As I said, they are all basic recommendations, and it is something we as a committee need to look at.  There is a big push to try to get people back home, but there are problems actually doing so, which this report highlights.<\/p><p>There are problems which make it difficult to come home, and this highlights it.

There is a shortage of labour in the hospitality industry.  There is a shortage of chefs.  There are also shortages of nurses, teachers and construction industry workers.  One would think that the Government would be saying \"C&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte\" and welcoming those people back with open arms rather than putting obstacles in their way by means of these kind of mechanisms.  One such obstacle I have come across is that many young people who left when the economy collapsed in 2009 and 2010 and who have returned are trying to work and educate themselves.  When they go to college, however, they are not entitled to have their fees paid, even though this will be the first time many of them have attended third level.  Can the witness comment on that and indicate if there is something we can do to address it?  This is a big issue that young people are facing.  The Government, instead of making obstacles for these people, should be bending over backwards to encourage them to come back and work because there is a labour shortage on the horizon.  They should also be paid to undertake further training and education.  These people contributed hugely to society before the recession via taxation and social protection measures, but are now being told that they are not entitled to an education.

In this same committee we have heard presentations about pensions - another key focus - which constantly reminded us of the demographic gap.

For many people, however, committing to returning home can be quite difficult if they know that they are going to be unable to access social supports.

We have great links with many of the emigrant groups abroad.  There are people returning with families or who are about to have families.  Someone might arrive back who is pregnant and accessing maternity benefit can be extremely difficult, or impossible.  On the question of employability and having one person working, in some cases the spouse or partner might not be Irish.  People are forming families in other countries.  A separate issue that we are considering is the right of people to live and work here which is a secondary barrier.  People might come back, say, a pregnant woman and her partner, who will not be able to work for six, eight or even 12 months, for example, and will also be stuck with the issue of accessing payments.<\/p> <p>  A more overarching point within that is that many of the people who left in 2010, many of whom went to Australia, is that many of them are now interested in moving to other countries.  Their time in Australia is up for various reasons, whether tighter visa regimes or the end of their work, and they are now looking at going to Canada.  Wh<\/p> <p>  There is a broader related point.  It is interesting that many people who left in 2010, many of whom went to Australia, are interested in emigrating to other countries.  Their time in Australia is up for various reasons, such as tighter visa regimes or their work has ended, and they are looking at going to Canada.  That raises the question of why they are not looking to come home.  There is a perfect storm of many barriers, any of which one might be able to get past, and probably will, but they amount to the perception of returning to Ireland being very difficult.  Many will return to work, and they want to work, but they want to know there is a safety net.  We have heard so many people say that one cannot get a payment for two years after returning.  They wonder if it does not work out, what will happen to them, and that is a big disincentive.  Even if we tell them that we think they will do it, it is amazing how this idea spreads.  There are Facebook groups of more than 10,000 members where this disinformation spreads through large numbers of people.  One thing we are trying to do here is what we see as our responsibility to raise this and bring it to the committee and the Department so that we can get past that.  One key thing is making that information freely available through the Department.

Is there concern, if not about racial profiling, then about persons who do not come from Irish parents?  Second is the concern about persons who return to care, which this committee shares.  That often happens very suddenly and they face difficulties, such as the habitual residency condition.  It has both short-term impacts on matters such as accessing carer's benefits but also potentially long-term concerns regarding the recognition of pension contributions later on.  That is an issue that has arisen over care credits.  I want to check that I am correct that if one has not been working for a period prior to becoming a carer, then one's time as a carer might not be recognised for pension contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018062800002#G00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1530178200,"counter":894,"content":"<p>I will take the first question on naturalised Irish citizens.  The habitual residency condition is a greater problem for them because they are not being treated as, for instance, a young Irish person who went away, worked and came back.  They might be people who came here as refugees, might have gone to school and college here and then went away to work, like any other Irish young person before, before perhaps returning with their family.  They are being held to a higher standard and it is not seen as them coming home.  Their previous residence is often not recognised.  It is another quite serious problem with the habitual residency condition and the idea of resuming residence.  Sometimes only the resumption of residence, that its, the return, is taken into account rather than the previous residence.  The whole other half of the picture is missing and not taken into account.  Naturalised Irish citizens are having a tougher time.

If we are serious about rural recovery, surely it would make sense to assist our emigrants in every way possible.  I am aware of families who have returned to Offaly who met serious barriers.  One student managed to get herself a loan to pay her fees for the first year of college.  She could no longer afford it and had to take time out to work.  It is so unfair.

A lot of our advice is on pre-departure and preparation for return and our key advice, especially regarding access to entitlements, is to do their research, to be prepared and to look into what documents people will need on return instead of scrambling to find something that is in Australia or America when they are back in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  As to work the Department can do, the information that is available is very limited.  It is buried somewhere in the website and it is hard to access information specifically about the habitual residence condition, HRC.

One issue raised by the witness was that the figures released by the Department on claims disallowed on the grounds of the HRC do not include a breakdown of those that have been referred to the appeals office.  That is a critical piece of information because this would then give an overview.  The only figure we have is CROSSCARE's sample, if we want to look at it in that way, where it appealed 12 cases and won them all.  From the committee's point of view, I believe we should try to contact the Department to see if we can get further information in this regard.  That would substantiate or support the claim that is being made that deciding officers are inappropriately or not properly equipped to make the decision and that it is only when it gets to the appeals office that these decisions are looked at.  I believe as a committee we should have a look at this first.<\/p> <p>  As for my second question, I may have missed it in the report but generally speaking - this applies to anybody making a social welfare claim, the claim is made and one is asked for supporting documentation.  The slower one is in responding with the documentation, the longer the application process takes.  Where somebody is trying to prove habitual residency, I presume the standard length of the application process is longer than most because he or she is probably grappling with something that is not as well-defined and is trying to prove a point.

In a way, it is broad, in that deciding officers may have more flexibility in accepting one document over another, if there is an absence of one.  We still need an element of that flexibility.  We have highlighted in the report a couple of examples of good practice.  One of them is where there is specific reference to deportees who are returning who will have a document confirming that they are under deportation orders.  The officers will automatically issue this payment.  We do not seem to have any issues with those cases, in particular, in accessing further supports like homeless services.  That transition seems to be quite quick for that group of people and we know that it is a good practice.<\/p> <p>  Another good practice comes from another organisation somewhat like ourselves in County Mayo, called Safe Home Ireland, which provides some support for people, particularly around housing, and can assist them with securing housing and can provide a document to confirm that.  Not everyone would be in that position, as it is targeting an older group of people in particular.  <\/p> <p>  There are such different practices that can be learned from to smoothen transition for people.  The HRC is provided on every application form.
