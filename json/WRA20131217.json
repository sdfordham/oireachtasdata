My Department commissioned this study in response to a recommendation from the Implementation Plan for the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (or the Ryan Report as it is more commonly known).<\/p><p>  The focus of the report is on five inquiries in particular; starting with the Kilkenny Incest Inquiry which was published in 1993.  In commissioning the report, my Department sought to have an overview of the implementation of major recommendations and, in particular, what were the overall considerations that led to service improvements following such inquiries. As the purpose of inquiries is to find out what happened and how we can try to ensure that such events are not repeated, it is important that we reflect on which inquiries or types of inquiries led to the improvements in services we all seek. <\/p><p>  The recommendations of the various inquiries over more than twenty years were addressed to a range of bodies and departments, some of which no longer exist or have been merged into other bodies.  I am very pleased to see that many inquiry recommendations over this period have acted as a mechanism for positive change. The study provides important insight into how the recommendations of such inquiries can be framed to bring about the desired change and service improvement. The report identifies a need to avoid &ldquo;recommendation fatigue&rdquo; and for reports to provide impetus and support for positive change.  I welcome the proposal that, in future, inquiries should minimise the number of prescriptive recommendations and focus instead on key learning points. I agree with the recommendation that reviewers should remain totally independent in their findings, but a collaborative approach to key recommendations is more likely to improve services and outcomes for children. I believe such an approach is likely to increase the impact and relevance of recommendations and facilitate wider policy and organisational developments to be considered for the purposes of successful implementation.<\/p><p>  We have also, I believe, learned more about successful implementation of change.  In general, it is the responsibility of each Government Department and the bodies reporting to them to take the appropriate action on foot of any recommendation relevant to its work. For example, where recommendations are proper to my Department, they form part of the process of policy development and inform the strategic and business planning processes. Recommendations must be incorporated into key corporate planning processes if they are to be owned by the organisations involved and continue to be prioritised. <\/p><p>  There is also a role for oversight in relation to implementation where a range of bodies are involved. The process in respect of the Ryan Report Implementation Plan is a good example of such oversight.  My officials are currently preparing a monitoring framework in respect of all significant child care reports. This involves reviewing current monitoring and reporting mechanisms, with a view to capturing all relevant recommendations thematically, and to ensuring there is appropriate and streamlined progress reporting. The purpose of doing so is to provide for the effective and sustained implementation of recommendations across Departments and agencies while reducing unnecessary reporting burdens. It is neither efficient nor effective to have separate reporting processes for related recommendations from a range of different reports and I believe a more integrated monitoring framework will strengthen accountability.  It is intended that this monitoring framework will be put in place following the completion of the formal monitoring process for the Ryan Commission Implementation Plan. It will provide a basis for incorporating recommendations from any future inquiry into the planning and reporting process across relevant Departments and agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700052#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 77 and 78 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Costs","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700053#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[53854\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700053#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on the recent Indecon report on support for child care for working families as a mechanism to tackle the regulation of childminders; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

My Department has a funding allocation in 2014 of some &euro;260m per annum which is used to implement a number of childcare programmes.<\/p><p>  &euro;175m of this funding is committed to providing the free Pre-School Year which benefits approximately 68,000 children each year.  The financial benefit to the parent of a child participating in the free pre-school year is about &euro;2,500.  I have succeeded, despite the challenging budgetary situation, in maintaining the Pre-School Year as a universal and free programme, ensuring that a significant number of children, who would not otherwise be able to do so, can avail of quality pre-school services.  <\/p><p>  Some &euro;76.4m in funding is used to implement the Community Childcare Subvention and Childcare Education and Training Support programmes.  These provide subsidised childcare for lower income and disadvantaged families and parents participating in programmes provided by Solas and Education and Training Boards.  About 33,000 children benefit each year. <\/p><p>  A further &euro;9.5m in funding will be used in 2014 to implement an after school programme, targeted at low-income parents availing of employment opportunities, and a new part-time programme targeted at Community Employment participants.  Some 2,600 children are expected to benefit from these programmes.<\/p><p>  I am happy to advise the Deputy that my Department will be reviewing the Community Childcare Subvention and Childcare Education and Training Support programmes in the coming year with a view to identifying areas where they could be enhanced and improved to ensure that the best use of this funding  investment is being made.  The recommendations of the Indecon Report will be considered as part of this process.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, pre-school services are subject to the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006.  Childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families are currently not subject to the Regulations and therefore are not obliged to notify their services to the HSE.  Childminders not subject to the Regulations are encouraged and incentivised to voluntarily notify their services and to avail of quality training programmes.  There has been a limited response to these incentives and considerable work will need to be done to ensure whatever form of regulation is introduced works for children, parents and for childminders.   My Department will be working to develop a suitable approach in consultation with stakeholders in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700053#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Poverty","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700053#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[53806\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700053#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her Department routinely assesses the impact of the current economic recession on overall child welfare; if her attention has been drawn to the findings of the recent Growing Up in Ireland report including the finding that young children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to be obese, have poorer diets and display behavioural problems than children from more advantaged families; the consideration that is given to such findings; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":19,"content":"<p>My Department places a particular value on evidence - informed policy.  The first ever National Longitudinal Study of Children in Ireland, Growing up in Ireland, is wholly funded and managed by my Department, with support from the Department of Social Protection and the Central Statistics Office.  Findings from Growing Up in Ireland provide us with important evidence on children's lives across  a range of outcomes, including health and diet, behaviour and development, as well as their home environment and the financial circumstance of their families.  This evidence has relevance for a range of issues, across Government departments, and is likely to become increasingly used by Departments to inform future policy.<\/p><p>  In addition to the research undertaken by my Department, the Department of Social Protection undertakes a range of research and monitoring activities, including monitoring the impact of budgetary measures, which focus on households with children and on child poverty.  Collectively, this research and data provides an important resource for the policy system and departments, to support and inform decision-making.<\/p><p>  While I welcome the fact that Growing Up in Ireland shows that the  vast majority of Irish children are in good health and display low levels of behavioural difficulties, it also gives evidence of a social gradient in child outcomes relating to levels of social advantage, a gap that begins to emerge in early childhood.  This evidence must be used to inform policy and guide what we do.  Overweight and obesity  have emerged as public health priorities and are being addressed through the Special Action Group established by the Department of Health and the Department of Social Protections' initiative 'Healthy Food for All', which promotes healthy eating and combats  food poverty. <\/p><p>  In my own Department, the introduction of the new Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme 2013-2016, which is building on the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP), is a further demonstration of the Government's commitment to evidence based interventions for disadvantaged children and young people.  We know that the home environment impacts on a whole range of child outcomes and that parenting plays an important role in mitigating the impact of poverty and disadvantage.  <\/p><p>  My Department is committed to continuing the Growing Up in Ireland Study, to provide high quality data on a whole range of child outcomes, and arrangements are underway to commission a second phase of the study to ensure that this rich data source is continued and built upon. The  research from Growing Up in Ireland and other sources has been carefully utilised to inform the development of the National Children and Youth People's Policy Framework.

In 2013, &euro;53.498m has been made available for services for young people. <\/p><p>  Young people benefit hugely from participation in youth work services.  There is a growing body of research evidence which highlights how engagement in quality programmes helps young people to acquire important life skills such as confidence, problem solving, resilience and the ability to develop and maintain positive relationships and how it can enhance young people&rsquo;s competences for communication, leadership and innovation and their employability.   <\/p><p>  I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet with many youth organisations and groups to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.<\/p><p> In keeping with my Department&rsquo;s responsibilities for children and young people, my Department is developing a new strategy for children and young people.  This new five-year Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework is being developed in a holistic way which will comprehend the continuum of the life-course from infancy through to early and middle childhood, adolescence and early adulthood.

I have been contacted by four sets of prospective adopters who were affected by this change and who sought my assistance in this regard. Since this situation arose in July 2013 I have undertaken diplomatic and political efforts to resolve the situation. <\/p><p>  However it is obvious to me that in order that these adoptions, which were stopped by this change in Russian law, could continue an amendment to the Adoption Act, 2010, would be necessary to extend the validity of the declarations of eligibility and suitability. As the Adoption Act, 2010, is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention, and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Act had to be carefully examined before the Government is in a position to consider any proposed amendment of the legislation.  My Department has worked with the Office of the Attorney General to produce amending legislation that resolves the situation within the parameters of Irish law and our obligations under the Hague Convention.

The second step will be the ending of the practice of detaining 17 year old  boys in the adult prison system.  This will be achieved by the completion of the National Children Detention Facility project in Oberstown.

The existing arrangements for those seeking access to information reflect a transition from complex and historical situations and I am anxious that the HSE implement much more improved and consistent arrangements. It is also necessary to acknowledge that the legal and Constitutional framework within which such access operates is complex, reflecting a it does the balancing rights to privacy of the mother or a child who may not wish for contact to be re- established or personal information exchanged.    The HSE provides an Information and Tracing Service throughout the country to birth mothers, adopted persons and their families. The Adoption Act 2010, requirement that agencies providing Information and Tracing services would gain accreditation resulted in a number of religious orders deciding not to apply for accreditation and transferring files from their Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies to the HSE. Approximately 25,000 files have been transferred to the HSE Regional Adoption Service in Cork, from the Sacred Heart Adoption Society.   Work by the HSE on the organising and storage of these files has taken place.  The HSE has sought the advice of the National Archives in relation to the proper storage of these files that are of great significance. The HSE has also received records from other agencies.  A comprehensive list of records held, and their locations,  is available on the HSE website.<\/p><p>  The HSE Information and Tracing Service recognises the importance attached to this area of service provision and is working to provide a more streamlined  service and to ensure that enquiries in regard to information and tracing are handled as quickly as possible. The HSE has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption, or an illegal registration of a birth, should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland  or the HSE Community Services who will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records.  <\/p><p>  The National Adoption Contact Register was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences. The Authority, the Health Service Executive and accredited adoption services routinely inform enquirers about the existence of the register and encourage anyone interested in tracing or gaining information to sign up.  I am conscious of recent media coverage of the issue of information and tracing and I would hope that this will encourage more birth mothers in particular to access the  Contact Preference Register and where possible to consent to the release of information.   <\/p><p>  Work is continuing  in relation to the preparation of the Heads of Bill of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  I am anxious to bring the Heads of bill before Government at the earliest possible date. The Constitutional and legal context within which the development of these legislative proposals must be undertaken is complex. Certain legal and policy questions are currently being finalised and I expect to shortly submit a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government. The proposals will have to address the Constitutional and legal position with regard to any retrospective application of legislation, particularly as it relates to the right to privacy and the necessity to obtain consent for the release of personal information. I have agreed with the Oireachtas Health and Children Committee that once agreed by Government, the Heads of Bill  will be the subject of Committee hearings so that the complex and sensitive issues involved can be the subject of public consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700053#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Adoption Services Provision","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700053#WRB02250"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[53842\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700053#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on the very low success rate of the National contact preference register in matching only about 5% of the people who sought their assistance; the action she will take regarding same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":43,"content":"<p>The National Adoption Contact Register was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.

These were: the Kilkenny Incest Inquiry; Kelly Fitzgerald report; West of Ireland Farmer Case; the Monageer Inquiry and Roscommon Child Abuse Case. The objective was to determine the degree to which inquiry recommendations were implemented and to assess their impact in the context of policy initiatives and reforms. <\/p><p>  While I am pleased to see that many inquiry recommendations have acted as a mechanism for positive change, I am concerned that the findings of this study have also revealed a type of &lsquo;recommendation fatigue&rsquo;. It is important to note that this research report does provide clear advice, based on international best practice, on how to approach future reports. A key message is that future inquiries should take a fresh approach in order to minimise the number of prescriptive recommendations. The report recommends that the focus of inquiries should be on key learning points which may be disseminated within and across organisations.  Specifically, it proposes that recommendations should be drafted in a forward looking phase of an inquiry process, as distinct from the fact finding backward looking initial phase of an inquiry, and that they should be developed based on a collaborative approach with those who will be responsible for their implementation. The report also recommends that inquiries should ensure that the recommendations are informed by all relevant sources of information, knowledge and expertise. They should be framed in a way that illustrates the rationale for change, promotes learning, cites evidence, identifies the organisation or sector responsible for their implementation, and outlines them in such a way that progress in their application will be easy to evaluate.   <\/p><p>  In general, it is a matter for individual Departments to take the appropriate action on any recommendation relevant to its work.

In some circumstances it will be necessary to facilitate a foster care placement within the context of the child's extended family or family network.  There are also cases in which the foster family is moving abroad and it is in the best interests of the child to remain with the foster family.  There are also a number of circumstances in which children in the care of the HSE may be placed outside the jurisdiction with specialised therapeutic inputs from child psychiatry and psychology.  All such placements abroad are made with the permission of the Courts.  Placements in Special Care, whether in Ireland or abroad only occur in extreme circumstances and under the jurisdiction of the High Court.<\/p><p>  The need to provide Special Care placements outside the jurisdiction into the future cannot be avoided in a very small number of cases in order to ensure the best interests of some children with specialised additional needs.  The referral of children abroad for specialised therapeutic interventions is an established feature within our health and social care system and decisions in each case are made in the best interests of the individual.  The units in which the children are placed are inspected and regulated by their national authorities and the HSE is attentive to the standards of care delivered in these specialised units.

ACTS also supports other professionals in their ongoing work with young people and their families.  This includes on-site therapeutic services to the national high support unit and special care units and the children detention centres.  Assessment, consultation and focused intervention services for children at risk in the community of placement in high support, special care or detention is also a function of the ACTs team.<\/p><p>  ACTS is a multidisciplinary service which includes psychology, social work, speech and language therapy, counselling and social care.  It is supported by contractual sessions from child and forensic psychiatry.  ACTS is led by a management team consisting of the national manager and three heads of discipline whose central responsibility is the implementation of systems of clinical governance to support the best outcomes for children with particular needs.  This is done through effective planning, implementation and evaluation of treatment programmes and protocol driven interventions.  It also involves the provision of high quality clinical supervision and monitoring of professional development needs of staff.  It is based in Dublin with regional clinics in Cork and Limerick.<\/p><p>  The HSE is currently implementing a capital development programme for Special Care services in order to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to meet the needs of children requiring this specialised type of care.  The first phase of the programme is underway with improvements to facilities in Dublin completed and the extensive refurbishment of the unit in Limerick complete.

This is why my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever Early Years Strategy, and working on a comprehensive Pre-School Quality Agenda which aims to improve quality standards in pre-school services in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Since the broadcast of the Prime Time programme, significant progress has been made in the eight areas which I identified as requiring urgent reform, and legislation to underpin these reforms has now been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The legislation allows for:<\/p><p>  -  regulations for early years services to prescribe minimum levels of qualifications for persons working in early years services.  As a result, I will be introducing a minimum qualification of FETAC Level 5 for all staff working with children in pre-school services;<\/p><p>  -  the introduction of a new registration system for all early years services which will require persons wishing to open a new pre-school service to register with the Pre-School Inspectorate in advance of being permitted to operate.  The service design and suitability for purpose will be examined at this stage and a follow-on inspection after the service has opened will examine its care and welfare practices; and<\/p><p>  -  increased penalties for persons convicted of regulatory breaches, including a Class A fine (i.e. up to &euro;5,000).  In addition, Pre-School Inspectors will have the option to remove a service provider from the pre-school register or attach conditions to a provider&rsquo;s registration.  Protocols will be developed in conjunction with the new Child and Family Agency as to how the various levels of regulatory non-compliance will be reported.<\/p><p>  The introduction in 2014 of new regulations for early years services, to give effect to the legislative provisions, will also include the introduction of new National Quality Standards which will replace the existing explanatory guidelines with a new outcomes approach and supporting criteria; against which the quality of childcare services will be measured.<\/p><p>  The successful implementation of the S&iacute;olta and Aistear frameworks on a national level requires childcare practitioners to have a thorough understanding of quality early years provision.  In 2014, I will be establishing a new National Quality Support Service for pre-school services which will work directly with childcare services to improve the quality of pre-school care and education.<\/p><p>  In preparing for the establishment of the Child and Family Agency, the Children and Families Services Division of the HSE has worked to address the need for a more coherent national approach to the regulation of early years services and the development of the Pre-School Inspectorate as a nationally co-ordinated service.  Standard Operating Procedures have been introduced to address inconsistencies and provide clarity and transparency to early years services.<\/p><p>In July of this year, the Pre-School Inspectorate commenced the publication of retrospective pre-school inspection reports online, and this process is continuing.  All new inspection reports completed from 1st   July are also being published online.  Pobal is hosting the publication of the pre-school inspection reports, and they are available on the Pobal website.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700053#WRB03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700053#WRB03950"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[53810\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700053#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if childcare companies, particularly those in the community and voluntary sector, register a modest surplus at the end of the year on account of careful and effective spending on the State funding received will be permitted to retain and re-invest said moneys into facilities; and if she will provide assurances that the State grants for next year will not be reduced by reason of effective and efficient financial management.","asker":"1110","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>The Government has made a very significant commitment to maintaining the childcare support programmes implemented by my Department - the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS)  programme and the new After-school Childcare programme.

My colleague the Minister of Health, has established a Special Advisory Group on Obesity to advise on implementation of the report and this group has representation from my own Department. In November of this year, the Minister of health and myself launched the first phase of a three year media campaign on preventing childhood obesity developed by both our Departments working with Safe Food and the HSE. The media campaign is complemented by a website, social media interventions and printed resources for parents and professionals. The thrust of the campaign is based on providing parents with practical tips in addressing the problem.  Other work of the group includes technical support for providing calorie content information for small restaurant \/ coffee shop owners, to facilitate young people in making healthy choices.<\/p><p>  I recently launched the Area Based Childhood (ABC) programme 2013-2016, a &euro;29.7m programme which is being co-funded by my Department and the Atlantic Philanthropies, to improve outcomes for children in some of our most disadvantaged areas. Some of the initiatives are encompassing empowering healthy choices for children and families, in relation to diet and exercise, as part of a holistic approach to improving children&rsquo;s lives.  Research has shown that parents often underestimate the weight of their children, and a new pilot project has been initiated by the HSE to enhance the measurement of school children to provide parents with accurate information on their children&rsquo;s weight, which will compliment the work done at an earlier stage by Public Health Nurses in baby clinics and developmental checks.  <\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">It is widely accepted by researchers that there is a strong link between physical activity and overweight, and habits formed in youth tend to carry over into adulthood.

The financial benefit to the parent of a child participating in the free pre-school year is about &euro;2,500.

I have maintained contact, both directly and through our Embassy in Washington, with many key players in Congress including Republican Congressman Paul Ryan, Chair of the House Budgetary Committee and former Vice-Presidential nominee; Republican Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee; leading Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressmen Mark Amodei, Spencer Bachus and Doug Collins; Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi;  Chair of the Congressional Friends of Ireland, Pete King; with House Speaker John Boehner and his staff and with the office of House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy.  I have also maintained contact with key figures in the US Administration and with Irish-American community representatives.    I have reiterated throughout all these contacts the Government&rsquo;s interest in all aspects of immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing an overall agreement reached which provides relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and a facility for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.  <\/p><p>  In this context, we very much welcomed the US Senate&rsquo;s approval of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill by a 68-32 margin on 27 June last.    <\/p><p>  The comprehensive draft legislation, which was prepared over several months by a bi-partisan group of eight US Senators, provides for extensive reform of the US immigration system. It includes provisions that would legalise the status of undocumented Irish people and provide a path to permanent residency.  It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US via the proposed E-3 visa.   The focus has since shifted to the House of Representatives for its consideration of the issues and a key factor here remains convincing the Republican House Majority of the importance of making progress.     It remains to be seen whether a consolidated Bill can be agreed between the Senate and the House of Representatives.   It is generally accepted that securing overall agreement will be a complex and challenging process, particularly at a time when Congress has been preoccupied by budgetary and debt issues.    This was clear from my most recent contacts and I believe the challenge to secure agreement has become even greater in recent times.   I am determined to continue to deploy all necessary resources at political, diplomatic and Irish community level to make progress on this vital issue.   In support of this ongoing effort, a delegation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade visited Washington DC in October last for a programme arranged by our Embassy during which they met with key members of Congress and with Irish-American community representatives.    <\/p><p>  I wrote to US House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner on 12 December, reiterating our position and underlining our continuing strong interest in the prospect of reform of the US immigration system.

It also continues to coordinate our lobbying efforts with our Irish-American community representatives.

","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":171,"content":"<p>At the outset, I should say that the scenarios outlined in the question, albeit that they are purely hypothetical, may be based on a misapprehension of how the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) regime operates in practice.  To try to answer the questions posed, it is necessary to make assumptions about how the individuals concerned managed, in the period prior to retirement, any possible exposure to chargeable excess tax.  Given the size of the assumed benefits, it is reasonable to take the view that each individual would have sought a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) in 2010, when the SFT was reduced from &euro;5.4m to &euro;2.3m.  This would have allowed them to \"grandfather\" the pension rights they had built up at that point in time and thus protect them from chargeable excess tax on the PFT amounts.    <\/p><p>  By way of illustrating this point, take the details in the question relating to the public servant retiring on 1 January 2014 on a defined benefit (DB) pension of &euro;120,000 and a separately accrued lump sum of &euro;200,000 (as per the example - even though the lump sum would, in fact, be three times the pension i.e. &euro;360,000, under normal public service pension scheme arrangements).  Assuming that he or she was retiring after a full 40 year career, then that individual would have had an accrued annual pension and lump sum entitlement on 7 December 2010 (the previous opportunity for claiming a PFT) of some &euro;111,000 and &euro;185,000 respectively (assuming say 37 years service at that time).  The capital value of those pension rights would, therefore, have been around &euro;2.4m, and as this exceeded the then SFT of &euro;2.3m applying from 7 December 2010, the individual would have claimed a PFT from Revenue which would have fully protected the individual from chargeable excess tax on that amount at the point of retirement.  Thus, assuming the individual acted rationally and sought a PFT of &euro;2.4m, the chargeable excess would be &euro;200,000 and the chargeable excess tax would be &euro;82,000. <\/p><p>  In the same way, the private sector DB scheme member, again on the assumption that he or she was retiring after a full 40 year career, would have accrued a pre-commutation annual pension of some &euro;129,500 at 7 December 2010, with a capital value of &euro;2.590m at that date (i.e. &euro;129,500 x 20) which he or she could have protected with a PFT.  In this instance, on the face of it (but subject to the comments made later), the chargeable excess would be &euro;210,000 and the chargeable excess tax would be &euro;86,100.<\/p><p>  It is also necessary to assume that the private sector defined contribution (DC) scheme member would have sought a PFT. For illustrative purposes, assume that this individual&rsquo;s fund was built up steadily over a forty year career, meaning that on 7 December 2010, the fund was worth somewhere in the region of &euro;4.6m.  As the capital value of the fund was above the then SFT of &euro;2.3m and did not exceed the old SFT of &euro;5.4m, the individual could have sought a PFT for the full amount of the fund i.e. &euro;4.6m.  (In practice, of course, the value of the DC fund at that time could have been greater or lesser than this amount).  On these assumptions (again subject to the comments below) the chargeable excess would be of the order of &euro;400,000 and the chargeable excess tax would be some &euro;164,000.<\/p><p>  However, the scenarios illustrated in the question are unlikely to arise in practice, in the case of both the private sector DB and DC fund members, because the purpose of the SFT regime is to restrict the excessive build up of pension savings through tax relieved sources.  It achieves this by imposing penal tax charges on the value of retirement benefits above set limits (i.e. the SFT or PFT) when they are drawn down, thus discouraging the building up of large pension funds in the first place.  All the indications are that the pension funds of highly paid private sector individuals are being actively managed in this way, with a view to avoiding a chargeable excess and the penal tax charges that go with it.  Any individual in the private sector at risk of incurring a liability to chargeable excess tax is highly likely to act rationally and stop accruing pension benefits or stop making pension contributions and negotiate alternative immediate taxable compensation with their employer instead.  All of the evidence suggests that this is what has been happening and is likely to continue to happen. <\/p><p>  The position in the public service is different.  Public servants cannot avoid the penal tax charge as they have no means of ceasing to accrue benefits under their schemes in order to prevent a breach of the SFT or their PFT, if they have one. <\/p><p>  It was for that reason that I introduced in Finance Act 2012 a more flexible reimbursement option for public servants affected by chargeable excess tax and extended it in Finance (No.2) Bill 2013.  I should stress that these reimbursement options do not remove or reduce the tax liability arising on a chargeable excess but provide more flexible options for the recovery of the tax liability by the pension scheme administrator.  These options involve effectively spreading the recovery of the tax, paid up front by the public service pension administrator, over a longer period.  It is the case, however, that, in the event of the death of a public servant before full recovery of the tax, any outstanding amount effectively &quot;dies&quot; with the individual but, in such cases, of course, the Exchequer benefits by not having to pay out the member's pension in the future. <\/p><p>  As regards private sector DB schemes, in the event that a significant chargeable excess tax bill were to arise, the scheme administrator would also have to pay the tax over to Revenue up-front.  In that regard, the legislation is not prescriptive as to how recovery of chargeable excess tax so paid by a private sector pension fund administrator is to be accomplished, other than requiring the individual's rights under the pension arrangement to be reduced to fully reflect the tax so paid or for the individual to reimburse the administrator directly.  If recovery from the scheme member is by way of an actuarial reduction in the pension payable to the member, then it would appear that the recovery would cease on the death of the member.  While the issue of the recovery of chargeable excess tax by private sector DB pension fund administrators has never been raised as a serious issue with my Department (because chargeable excess tax should, generally, not arise in the first place), I would say that if it should transpire that the means of recovery of chargeable excess tax in private sector DB schemes emerges as a problem for members, then I will consider any practical solutions that might be suggested. <\/p><p>  In the case of private sector DC schemes, the issue of recovery of chargeable excess tax paid by the administrator does not arise, as it would simply have been paid directly from the individual's pension fund.  On that point, while the example in the Question has the private sector DC member purchasing an annuity with his or her pension fund at retirement, it is highly unlikely that this would, in fact, be the case.  This is because, in contrast to individuals in DB schemes, whether private or public service, the DC individual has the option to invest his pension fund, after taking the retirement lump sum, into an Approved Retirement Fund.  He or she thus benefits from being able to retain his or her remaining pension fund capital &quot;intact&quot; after death for the benefit of his or her spouse and children through the Approved Retirement Fund facility. <\/p><p>  The other important point that the question illustrates is the major criticism levelled at the existing SFT regime.  This is that the fixed rate conversion factor of 20:1 currently used for converting defined benefit pension rights to a capital sum equivalent is inequitable relative to defined contribution pension arrangements, given the higher market annuity rates that those with defined contribution arrangements could face if they were to purchase annuities.  I have made changes in the Finance Bill by way of moving, after 1 January 2014, to higher age-related valuation factors that vary according to the individual's age at the point the benefits are drawn down.  These changes will, for the future, substantially improve the equity between defined contribution and defined benefit arrangements and as between those who retire at younger ages and those who retire later in life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700055#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Administration","counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700055#WRD01650"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[53683\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700055#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he intends to amend the property tax legislation to remove the obligation to pay property tax in advance of the year it is due in situations where the sale of a house occurs after 1 November and before 31 December that liability will no longer apply to the party who have sold the house; if he intends making other changes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

For the year 2014, the liability date is 1 November.     <\/p><p>  LPT liability crystallises on the sale of a residential property and must be paid in full either in advance of the sale or must be deducted from the proceeds of the sale.  This includes any LPT that has been deferred by the liable person.  Where a liable person sells their residential property between 2 November and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, they will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014 and the tax must be paid in full at the time of the sale.  This is in accordance with section 126 of the Act.<\/p><p>  For a tax such as LPT to function properly, legislation must specify a liability date for the tax to have application for a particular year.  Whatever date is prescribed, the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed, and I expect the LPT liability is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract.  Furthermore, an individual selling a property will often be purchasing another property at around the same time.  While a vendor who owns a property on 1 November 2013 is liable for the 2014 LPT on that property, if s\/he does not purchase another property before 1 November 2013 s\/he will not be liable for the 2014 LPT on that &quot;replacement&quot; property - whoever is the owner as of 1 November 2013 will be liable.<\/p><p>  As there are a number of LPT issues to be considered when buying or selling a house, I am advised that detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and is available since last August on the Revenue website at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i> and on the Law Society's website.<\/p><p>  The liability date of 1 November in the preceding year and the obligation on the property owner on that date to pay any outstanding LPT on the sale of a property have been approved by the Oireachtas in passing the LPT legislation and I have no plans to change the law in either respect. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700055#WRD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Levy Issues","counter":175,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700055#WRD01850"},{"type":"question","counter":176,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[53796\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700055#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the continuation of the pension levy; if he envisages the levy continuing in 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I will however, introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% to, among other things, continue to help fund the <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i>.  The additional levy, within the existing legal framework, will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015.  The impact of the <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i> can be seen by the increase in employment levels, particularly in the accommodation and food services sector.  The <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i>  included the reduction of VAT on tourism services to 9% from 13.5% on a temporary basis until the end of 2013.  This measure has proved to be a major success, helping create over 15,000 new jobs as well as protecting existing jobs.  It was due to end this year.  However, it is important that we reinforce success when possible, so I have decided to continue this reduced rate.  This will support the increased number of jobs already in place and accelerate the creation of new jobs.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I announced the reduction of the Air Travel Tax to zero with effect from 1st April 2014.  The decision to remove the tax, together with the retention of the 9% VAT rate for tourism services, will help maintain the momentum created by the success of The Gathering this year.  Since the Budget announcement, airlines have announced the opening up of new routes resulting in a significant increase in passenger numbers with the associated increase in tourism activity and employment.<\/p><p>  The <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i>  also included a number of current and capital expenditure measures, including a number aimed at retraining the workforce.  I would ask the Deputy to note that my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton T.D., with responsibility for JobBridge, the National Internship scheme, recently announced that the number of internships, originally planned at 5,000 has now exceeded 20,000.

The scheme has been extended further with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Ruair&iacute; Quinn T.D. announcing in June this year, another 6,000 places under the third Springboard allocation.  Further rollouts of the springboard scheme will be considered in the context of the findings of an on-going evaluation. <\/p><p>  Finally, I want to reiterate that addressing the difficulties in the labour market remains the Government's biggest challenge and, accordingly, the Government is giving its highest priority to job protection and job creation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700055#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living City Initiative","counter":178,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700055#WRD02050"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[53875\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700055#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 77 of 3 December 2013, if he will provide the names of the economists in Indecon International Economic Consultants which authored ex ante evaluation of the Living City Initiative for Urban Regeneration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the &euro;200 arrears can be paid by property owners using any of the payment methods that are currently available for paying LPT.  I understand that to date about &euro;1.79m has been paid directly to Revenue in respect of almost 9,000 properties.  <\/p><p>  I am further advised that an extensive data matching exercise has been undertaken by Revenue since it received details from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) of those properties where the Household Charge has been paid or, in respect of which a waiver or exemption from the charge has been granted.  Revenue has confirmed that the vast majority of data from the LGMA&rsquo;s Household Charge Register has already been matched with its Local Property Tax Register and that the necessary work to finalise this process is ongoing.  <\/p><p>  Revenue has informed me that the Household Charge payment has been matched to over 1.2 million properties on the LPT Register.  It will not be possible to fully match all Household Charge payments to the LPT Register.  The main difficulty is where different people paid the Household Charge and the LPT for the same property.  The Household Charge registration process only captured details of the person who paid the Household Charge, and where someone other than the owner paid the Household Charge the owner&rsquo;s details are not on the Household Charge Register.  In addition where a property has multiple owners, if different owners paid the Household Charge and the LPT, the Registers may not match.  These mis-matches arise particularly in the case of properties with non-unique addresses.   <\/p><p>I strongly recommend property owners to check their LPT record online at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.revenue.ie<\/font><\/i>   with their Property ID and PIN.  If Revenue&rsquo;s LPT record shows that there is &euro;200 LPT\/ Household Charge arrears but they have paid their Household Charge, they should send Revenue a copy of the receipt for the Household Charge and Revenue will remove the charge from the LPT record.  If they have paid it and they do not have a receipt they should contact their Local Authority or the LGMA for a receipt and send a copy to Revenue. In this way anybody who has paid their Household Charge can ensure that Revenue&rsquo;s records are corrected.<\/p><p>  As outlined above, unpaid Household Charge at 1 July 2013 became a &euro;200 LPT liability. This was due for payment on that date and interest on unpaid LPT\/ Household Charge arrears continues to accrue.  Revenue advises me that the amount will be capped at &euro;200 if paid before they formally launch their LPT\/Household Charge compliance campaign.  However, if it is not paid in line with that campaign, interest will be charged; for example, if the outstanding Household Charge is paid on 30 April 2014, the amount payable will be &euro;213.<\/p><p>  Revenue will begin a compliance campaign on LPT\/Household Charge arrears in the first quarter of 2014 and they intend to make property owners aware of this on the Revenue website, in press releases, through interviews with Revenue spokespeople on local and national media, and if necessary, through formal media advertising.  Alongside this public awareness campaign, Revenue will also contact potential non-compliant property owners directly regarding their obligations.  <\/p><p>  At this stage, the 2012 Household Charge has been paid for over 1.2 million properties and LPT for 2013 has been paid for over 1.6 million properties.  The Revenue Commissioners have a duty, in the interests of fairness and equity to those who are compliant, to take effective follow-up action to recover the tax from the non-compliant.  Revenue will pursue unpaid 2013 LPT liability for the relatively small proportion of properties still outstanding and will also pursue the outstanding LPT\/ Household Charge arrears. <\/p><p>  Further information on Household Charge arrears is available in the LPT Frequently Asked Questions section of the Revenue website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700056#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Assessments","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700056#WRE00450"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[54025\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700056#WRE00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the additional yield to the Exchequer if the 0.25% rate for houses valued at over &euro;1 million was increased to 0.35% for the local property tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>The 0.25% rate of Local Property Tax (LPT) only applies to the portion over &euro;1m of any property valued in excess of &euro;1m.

The President's reply to the MEPs noted that the reasons that originally led to the decision to have &euro;500 banknotes in circulation were still valid.  Before the changeover to euro cash in January 2002, six of the euro area countries &ndash; Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands &ndash; had national banknotes worth between &euro;200 and &euro;500.  At the end of June 2013, the share of &euro;200 and &euro;500 banknotes in total circulation was 36%.<\/p><p>  Mr Draghi's reply to the MEPs also explained that the share of the total circulation value of the high denomination euro banknotes has been quite stable since 2009; it is not much different from the recorded shares of some of the highest denominations of the former currencies of the countries mentioned above.  <\/p><p>  The President of the ECB also noted that ECB studies indicated that only about 15%  of high-denomination banknotes are used for transaction purposes.  Consequently, it is not likely that a large share of the &euro;500 (and &euro;200) banknotes in circulation is being used for criminal transactions.  Neither does it seem likely that withdrawing the &euro;500 banknote from circulation would contribute to reducing such activities.  Whilst it is impossible to know precisely to what extent and for what reasons people are hoarding banknotes, there is evidence that the &euro;500 banknotes fulfil a role in the provision of cash to the public in times of high uncertainty.   <\/p><p>  Since the introduction of the euro in 2002 the Central Bank of Ireland has issued in excess of 1million &euro;500 banknotes.<\/p><p>  As euro banknotes circulate throughout the Eurozone, it is Net Issuance, rather than circulation, that is calculated on a national level.  Net Issuance is a calculation of notes delivered less notes destroyed, less stocks.  It does not take into account factors such as migration of notes within the eurozone.  The Net Issuance of &euro;500 banknotes in Ireland is 112,278 banknotes, with a value of <\/p><p>  &euro;56,139,000  as at 12 December 2013. <\/p><p>  The Deputy also refers to a suggestion by Merrill Lynch that the &euro;500 banknote be discontinued with the proceeds being used to recapitialise Eurozone banks. This suggestion has not been examined by the Department of Finance, the Central Bank or the National Treasury Management Agency; nor has it been raised with the institutions referred to by the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700056#WRE01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Renovation Incentive Scheme","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700056#WRE01250"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[54076\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700056#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will clearly provide details of the tax breaks for home owners who carry out renovations to their homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":219,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, I announced the Home Renovation Incentive in the recent Budget.

The primary purpose of the changes I am making to the SFT regime is to further restrict the capacity of higher earners to fund or accrue large pensions through tax-subsidised sources. The SFT regime addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by dealing with it at the point of pension drawdown in retirement rather than by applying restrictions to pension savings or accrual upfront. The regime achieves this by imposing a penal tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down. In this way it acts to discourage the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinds the tax advantage of such overfunding by clawing back, through the penal tax charge, the tax relief granted.<\/p><p>  The changes I am making can be summarised as follows;<\/p><p>  - firstly, the absolute value of the SFT is being reduced, with effect from 1 January 2014, from &euro;2.3m to &euro;2m,<\/p><p>  - secondly, the valuation factor to be used for establishing the capital value of defined benefit (DB) pension rights at the point of retirement, where this takes place after 1 January 2014, is being changed from the current standard valuation factor of 20 to a range of higher age&ndash;related valuation factors that will vary with the individual&rsquo;s age at the point at which the pension rights are drawn down,<\/p><p>  - thirdly, in calculating the capital value of a DB pension at the point of retirement, transitional arrangements provide for a &ldquo;split&rdquo; calculation where part of the pension had already been accrued at 1 January 2014 so that the part accrued up to that date will be valued at a factor of 20 and the part accrued after that date valued at the appropriate higher age-related valuation factor,<\/p><p>  - finally, the reimbursement options, introduced in Finance Act 2012, for public servants affected by chargeable excess tax are being amended and extended.<\/p><p>  As occurred on the occasion of the introduction of the SFT regime in 2005, and again when the value of the SFT limit was reduced to &euro;2.3m in 2010, the legislation contained in the Finance Bill provides for an individual who has pension rights on 1 January 2014 in excess of the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m, to claim a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) from Revenue in order to protect or &quot;grandfather&quot; the value of those rights on that date. This is subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m, and individuals with PFTs from 2005 or 2010 retain those PFTs.<\/p><p>  As before, the &quot;grandfathering&quot; provisions contained in the legislation reflect legal advice from the Attorney General. However, unlike previous occasions, the grandfathering arrangements this time around had to take cognisance not just of the reduction in the absolute level of the SFT from 1 January 2014, but also of the increase, from that date, in the factors for converting DB pension rights into capital value equivalents. It is for that reason, lest there be any suggestion that the changes had retrospective application, that DB rights accrued up to 1 January 2014 are to be capitalised at the existing valuation factor of 20, both for the purposes of determining if there is a PFT and for the purposes of placing a capital value on those rights at the time of retirement, where that takes place after 1 January 2014.<\/p><p>  The changes and grandfathering arrangements outlined above apply, as appropriate, to both DB and defined contribution (DC) pension arrangements in both the private and public sectors. As regards DB pension arrangements, it is irrelevant whether an individual is a higher paid public servant or a highly paid member of a private sector DB scheme, the same SFT rules apply to all such arrangements.<\/p><p>  Specifically, the new lower SFT limit will apply to both DC and DB arrangements. Those in DC pension arrangements can seek a PFT from Revenue if the capital value of their arrangements exceeds &euro;2m on 1 January 2014, subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m. If the value of their DC pension arrangements is below the SFT on 1 January 2014, their funds can continue to accumulate up to &euro;2m through further tax-relieved pension contributions and fund growth, subject to the various annual contribution and earnings limits that apply, without any risk of a chargeable excess arising. Members of DB pension arrangements can equally aspire to a maximum &quot;tax&ndash;relieved&quot; fund of &euro;2m. However, in the case of DB pension arrangements, members of such arrangements do not have individual &ldquo;earmarked&rdquo; funds (as is the case in DC arrangements) and this, coupled with the fact that pension benefits in such arrangements reflect a &quot;benefit promise&quot; based on salary and service, dictates that the capital value of pension rights arising under such arrangements has to be determined in some other way.<\/p><p>  The SFT regime provides (and has always provided) a simple formula for this purpose. The formula essentially requires the annual amount of pension payable to an individual under the arrangement to be multiplied by a valuation or capitalisation factor in order to establish the capital value, both for PFT purposes and for the purposes of establishing the value of DB pension rights at the point of retirement. Up to now, a single valuation factor of 20 has been used for these purposes. In light, however, of the major criticism levelled at the existing SFT regime, that the fixed rate conversion factor of 20:1 was inequitable relative to DC pension arrangements given the higher market annuity rates that those with DC pension arrangements could face if they were to purchase annuities, I have moved to introduce higher age-related factors. This will substantially improve the equity between DC and DB arrangements and as between those who retire at younger ages and those who retire later in life. These are significant changes.<\/p><p>  The value of DB pension rights accrued up to 1 January 2014 will, under the grandfathering requirements, be valued for the purposes of the SFT regime at the existing factor of 20. If the capital value so determined exceeds the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m, such individuals may seek a PFT from Revenue, subject to the overall limit of &euro;2.3m referred to earlier. In such cases, additional pension benefits accrued after 1 January will be valued using the relevant higher age-related factor and will, as for DC arrangements, be fully exposed to chargeable excess tax. Where the capital value of DB rights is less than &euro;2m on 1 January, such individuals may continue to accrue pension rights up to the SFT limit but those additional rights will be valued at the relevant higher age-related factor.<\/p><p>  Whether DB or DC arrangements are involved, on each occasion that an individual becomes entitled to receive a benefit under a pension arrangement for the first time (called a &quot;benefit crystallisation event&quot; or BCE) they use up part of their SFT or PFT, as the case may be. At each BCE, a capital value has to be attributed to the benefits that crystallise and the value is then tested against the SFT or the individual&rsquo;s PFT, as appropriate, by the pension scheme administrator. For DC pension arrangements, the capital value of pension rights when they are drawn down after 1 January 2014 is simply the value of the assets in the arrangement that represent the member&rsquo;s accumulated rights on that date, in other words the value of the DC fund at the point of drawdown. In the case of DB pension arrangements, the default position is that the capital value of such rights drawn down after 1 January 2014 is determined by multiplying the gross annual pension that would be payable to the individual by the appropriate age-related valuation factor. If the DB arrangement provides for a separate lump sum entitlement (otherwise than by way of commutation of part of the pension) e.g. most public service schemes, the value of the lump sum is added to the capital value of the DB pension to arrive at the overall capital value.<\/p><p>  However, reflecting the grandfathering requirements referred to earlier, where part of the DB pension has been accrued at 1 January 2014 and part after that date, the transitional arrangements provide for the part accrued at 1 January to be valued at the factor of 20 and the part accrued after that date at the appropriate higher age-related factor.<\/p><p>When the capital value of a BCE, either on its own or when aggregated with earlier BCEs, exceeds the SFT, or an individual's PFT, the excess is subject to an immediate tax charge at 41%<b>, <\/b>which<b><\/b>has to be paid upfront by the pension fund administrator and recovered from the individual. In addition, when the remainder of the excess is subsequently drawn down as a pension (or, for example, by way of a distribution from an Approved Retirement Fund or vested Personal Retirement Savings Account) it is subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate, thus giving rise to an effective income tax rate on a chargeable excess of some 65%, excluding any liability to USC and PRSI.<\/p><p>  The Finance Bill also amends and extends the reimbursement options, introduced in Finance Act 2012, for public servants affected by chargeable excess tax who are required to reimburse the public sector pension fund administrator for the upfront payment of the tax to Revenue. Unlike affected individuals in the private sector, public servants cannot minimise or prevent the breaching of the SFT or PFT by ceasing contributions or benefit accrual. The focus of the changes is to reduce the amount that can be recovered from the net retirement lump sum payable to the individual to a maximum of 20% of the net lump sum (from 50%) and to include the option of reimbursement of the pension fund administrator solely by way of a reduction in the gross pension payable over a period not exceeding 20 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700057#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Income Data","counter":254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700057#WRF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":255,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[54382\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700057#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number, shown separately for the public and private sectors, of workers who currently earn less than &euro;30,000 per annum.

A study was undertaken for the European Commission in April 2013 which projected that there may be up to 900,000 ICT job vacancies in Europe by 2015.  While that report did not provide a breakdown of the potential vacancies by country, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) has just published a report which estimates that there will be more than 44,500 potential job openings for ICT professionals in Ireland over the period from 2013 to 2018, including almost 20,400 potential job openings for both new graduates and skilled professionals between 2013 and 2015.<\/p><p>  The findings of the EGFSN study are informing the development of the new ICT Skills Plan which will replace the  Government's first ICT skills Action Plan launched in 2012 as a collaboration between Government, industry and the education system to increase the supply of high level ICT graduates.  The study also shows that the output of mainstream computer graduates has increased by 25% over the last 2 years and a doubling of graduate output now expected to be achieved by 2015 &ndash; 3 years ahead of the Action Plan target of 2018. In addition, as part of the Plan, almost 1,500 places have been provided for graduate jobseekers under two the rounds of the ICT graduate skills conversion programmes that have issued to date and 6,000 places have been provided on ICT programmes under the three rounds of the Springboard reskilling initiative that have issued since 2011.

These include:<\/p><p> - The introduction of a third major transfer point for students between primary level and third level<\/p><p>- The question of which school the Transition Year should be placed in<\/p><p>- The undermining of Department policy to maintain as common a curriculum as possible for as long as possible to avoid the risk of specialisation too early and school drop out<\/p><p>- The potential danger that the senior school will come to be seen as the 'specialist' Leaving Certificate centre into which transfers are sought at senior cycle<\/p><p>- The loss of the advantages to be gained when teachers regularly teach students from first year to sixth year<\/p><p>- The possibility of students from other schools seeking entry to the senior school with the attendant repercussions for other schools.<\/p><p>  Apart for these compelling educational reasons, patronage of the new school, was awarded to the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board (KWETB) specifically on the basis that it would deliver the prescribed curriculum at both Junior and Senior Cycle. Any change to this stated intention could lead to a challenge or to calls for the patronage determination process to be commenced afresh. This could have the effects of both delaying the establishment of the new school and, of course, re-opening the patronage of the new school to other applicant patrons.<\/p><p>  I have met with a parents' deputation and, in accordance with normal protocol following such meetings, I communicated the outcome of my subsequent consideration of this matter to the Deputies who had requested the meeting.

Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full\/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.<\/p><p>  The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools  across the country has been a key educational priority in recent years. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local <\/p><p>Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. <\/p><p>  Details of the special classes for children with autism, including details of special classes for children with autism in the Meath area, are available on the NCSE website http: \/\/www.ncse.ie. The contact information details for individual schools is available on the Department's website .  Details of the numbers of children with autism who transition from primary to secondary school in the county are not readily available.<\/p><p>  All primary and post primary schools have access to psychological support from the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS).  This may take the form of assessment, where needed, or advice on intervention and educational planning <\/p><p>for pupils with special educational needs, including autism.  The NEPS focusses on providing necessary support to schools in facilitating the effective transition of pupils from primary to post primary schooling. This may involve assessment and review by the teacher, by the psychologist or both, to inform educational planning in second level.  As part of this NEPS service, necessary psychological assessments are carried out in a timely manner.  In instances where the school's assigned NEPS psychologist is not available, the school may access psychological assessments through the Scheme for commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department's website. Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.   <\/p><p>  Queries on the waiting time for psychological assessments undertaken by the HSE in Co.

The level of  facilities, including playspace, that can be provided in schools will therefore  vary depending on the extent of classroom accommodation needed for the school.  A suite of technical guidance documents is available on my Department's website  (www.education.ie) to assist design teams in best practice in the design and  development of projects and to encourage them to take a complete design team  approach from project conception. These documents cover all aspects of the  development of a building project for both internal and external works.  <\/p><p>  The Physical Education curriculum has been designed on the basis that  facilities in schools may vary. Many primary schools have a general purpose  room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for  teaching different aspects of the P.E. programme. A similar situation with  sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level. In addition, many  schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields  and swimming pools. <\/p><p>  My Department's design guidelines for schools include guidance in the provision  of P.E. Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as  basketball courts. Other P.E. facilities, e.g. pitches are provided, where  appropriate, and in the context of available resources, as part of the  Department's school building programme. <\/p><p>  The provision of playing pitches is not part of the specification for primary  schools. However, in certain circumstances and where the site conditions allow,  the project scope may include the levelling and grassing of an area which  schools may decide to use for playing fields. At post primary level, an area  may be developed as a practice playing field where site conditions and  resources permit. <\/p><p>  In the context of my Department's co-operation with local authorities in  identifying suitable sites for schools, the location of sporting facilities is  one factor taken into account in locating schools. The Deputy may be aware of  my Department's role in developing shared community facilities in the Fingal  County Council area, which has made facilities available to the wider community  on a shared basis with the school.  <\/p><p>  Given the current financial constraints within which my Department is  operating, priority is being given to applications from schools for essential  mainstream classroom accommodation. In this regard, my Department is not in a  position to consider applications from schools for funding towards pitches or  sports facilities outside of the context of school projects on the building  programme.

These Frameworks will replace the existing Frameworks which were put in place in 2012 and which expire in April 2014.<\/p><p>  The panels will provide the basis for Architectural, Engineering and Quantity Surveying firms to tender for major school building projects throughout 2014 and 2015. Separate panels will be in place for category 2(b) projects (construction value between &euro;2.5m and &euro;5m) and category 3 projects (construction value greater than &euro;5m). <\/p><p>  In order to qualify for inclusion on a Framework Panel firms must satisfy certain minimum criteria which essentially demonstrate the firm's capacity to provide the required service as part of a design team on a major school building project. One of the minimum criteria is the need to have completed at least 3 major projects of a similar scale and complexity in the last 5 years. For category 3 projects, one of the three completed projects is required to be a school building project. This particular requirement does not apply to category 2(b) projects.<\/p><p>  The minimum threshold of &euro;2.5 million for the three completed projects applies only to the category 3 framework. This means that in order to qualify to tender for projects valued in excess of &euro;5 million a firm must show that it has successfully completed three building projects each with a value of at least &euro;2.5 million in the previous 5 years. <\/p><p>  The minimum value for each of the three completed projects to qualify for the category 2(b) framework is &euro;1 million. There is therefore ample opportunity for smaller firms to compete for category 2(b) projects and if, successful, to demonstrate their capacity to compete for category 3 projects in the future.<\/p><p>  These minimum criteria are based on the current Suitability Assessment Questionnaire for Principle Service Provider to be assessed under a Restricted Procedure  published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (QC1 v2.0 16\/07\/2013). <\/p><p>  However, in cognisance of the downturn in the construction industry, my Department has chosen to extend the period for which completed projects are eligible for inclusion from a three year period (which applied for the 2012 Frameworks) to a period of five years for the new Frameworks.  It is important to understand that this refers to completion dates for projects and that all firms completing such projects in the last 5 years would, by necessity, have been working on the design phases of such projects for anywhere up to three years before the completion date.  While the three projects must have been completed in the last 5 years this, in effect, gives firms an eight year window to provide three examples of large scale building projects which they have worked on in order to satisfy this condition.  It is also worth noting that the number of applications for the 2014 panels has exceeded the level of interest expressed back in 2012.  The evaluation process of the applicants is ongoing and the Framework will be operational by its target date of April 2014.<\/p><p>  Finally, it should be noted that the appointment of design teams on school building projects of a value less than &euro;2.5 million will generally not be tendered to the above Frameworks but will be conducted by open tender on the Governments e-tenders web-site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700059#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":360,"content":"<p>Question No. 206 answered with Question No. 203.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Numbers","counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700059#WRH01150"},{"type":"question","counter":362,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[53928\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700059#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of one, two, three, four and five teacher Gaelscoileanna in non Gaeltacht areas by county at the end of September 2011, 2012 and 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In relation to curricular reform the new junior cycle in post-primary schools outlines eight key skills required for successful learning by students across the curriculum and for learning beyond school. The key skills in the Framework for Junior Cycle all include as elements the use of digital technology. One of the Statements of Learning in the Framework provides for the use by students of technology and digital media tools to learn, communicate, work and think collaboratively and creatively. As new specifications for the Junior Cycle are being prepared, the use of ICT will become integrated across learning areas. In addition, new short courses in Digital Media literacy and in Programming and Coding will be available to schools from September 2014. A draft of it will be available shortly from the NCCA for consultation. <\/p><p>  The first step in developing a new strategy for the use of ICT in teaching and learning is the completion of an ICT census in schools. The census results are currently being analysed and the results will provide a sound research base which will in turn inform key policy decisions relating to integrating ICT in teaching and learning over the next three to five years. In the past the ICT census of schools focussed on the level of infrastructure in schools. The current census addresses a broad range of themes including:<\/p><p>- The impact of ICT in teaching and learning and assessment<\/p><p>-School-wide planning for integration of ICT in teaching and learning<\/p><p>-Continuing ICT related Professional Development (CPD) for teachers<\/p><p>-Curriculum-relevant digital content and software resources<\/p><p>-exploring views on the opportunities presented by integration of ICT in teaching, learning and assessment,<\/p><p>-Obstacles to ICT integration and how they could be overcome<\/p><p>  In addition there will be an extensive consultation process with stakeholders and the wider public. As part of this process, the ICT industry will be consulted in relation to technological developments. Feedback from this process and the results of the school census will provide a sound research base to inform policy decisions on the further integration of ICT in teaching and learning over the next five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700059#WRH02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":379,"content":"<p>Question No. 215 answered with Question No. 172.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education and Training Boards Staff","counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700059#WRH02550"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[53973\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700059#WRH02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 43 of 4 December 2013, if he will instruct the City of Dublin and County of Dublin Education and Training Boards to provide the information sought.

As part of this phase of the Department's decentralisation, a number of posts transferred from the Tullamore office to Athlone which freed up space in Tullamore to transfer parts of the Higher Education Division from Dublin to Tullamore.<\/p><p>  In April 2010 it was announced that decentralisation of the Department's HQ to Mullingar would not proceed on affordability grounds.  The same is the case for the Agencies listed above. This Department comprises 3 main locations: Dublin, Athlone and Tullamore.  In addition there is a small presence of staff in 40 regional locations outside of Dublin. As of end of September 2013, the Department has a staff of 1,296 people, 920 of whom work outside Dublin.   <\/p><p>  The information requested by the Deputy in relation to each staff member travelling to individual meetings in Dublin is not readily available and would involve an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile.  However I can inform the Deputy that domestic travel costs for the Department have reduced significantly in recent years.  Since 2007 the costs have been reduced by approximately 40% as set out as follows.<\/p><p>Year 2007: &euro;3.13m<\/p><p>Year 2008: &euro;3.06m<\/p><p>Year 2012: &euro;1.96m<\/p><p>Year to date 2013: &euro;1.71m<\/p><p>  My Department's policy specifies that all travel should be by the shortest practicable routes and by the cheapest practicable mode of transport. Officers are encouraged to use public transport whenever practicable, with private transport to be used only in limited circumstances. <\/p><p>  In terms of measures to reduce the necessity of travel, videoconferencing facilities have been in place in my Department's offices for a number of years, enabling staff in two or more locations communicate by simultaneous video and audio transmissions. In addition during 2013, my Department rolled out unified communications software across the three main offices in Dublin, Athlone and Tullamore and a number of regional\/local offices, with plans to extend to other such offices in 2014.  This software facilitates desktop video conferencing and desktop sharing, enabling colleagues in different locations work on the same document.  These technologies reduce the time and cost associated with business travel and enable a more efficient way of working.  It is however inevitable that senior officials in particular would be required to attend meetings away from their base such as Interdepartmental meetings, Ministerial meetings etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700059#WRH02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700059#WRH02950"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[54009\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700059#WRH03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when an application for additional school accommodation will be provided to a school (details supplied) in County Offaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":388,"content":"<p>The application from the school, referred to by the Deputy, is being considered by my Department, which has been in contact with the school concerned seeking additional information.

For works contracts the threshold is &euro;5 million.  The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.<\/p><p>  All policy, guidance and implementation measures relating to capital projects is published on the Construction Procurement Reform website  where the Capital Works Management Framework provides a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts and generic template documents. Tendering is dealt with through a range of guidance notes and template documents such as Suitability Assessment Questionnaires, Instructions to Tenderers and Forms of Tender which are published under the CWMF.  These documents may be downloaded and modified to suit each particular tender competition, and provides a consistent approach for contracting authorities to the management of public works projects.<\/p><p>  The Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF) was introduced on a phased basis from 2007 and became mandatory for all contracting authorities through the issue of Department of Finance Circular 06\/10 on 5 May 2010. The documents are updated and augmented where appropriate to respond to new developments in the industry and changes in the regulatory environment.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the assessment of a tenderer's financial and economic standing is a key part of any procurement process because the contracting authority must be reasonably satisfied that a contractor will have the necessary capacity to carry out a contract if the contractor is awarded the contract. Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned. This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract. My Department has developed specific national guidelines for contracting authorities in relation to minimum standards for suitability criteria for construction contractors interested in tendering for public works projects; published as part of the Capital Works Management Framework (Guidance Note 2.3.1.3 Suitability Criteria for Works Contractors Minimum Standards refers.  )  In this regard, it is important to point out that there are no centrally imposed requirements for a minimum turnover.

The SME Credit Guarantee Scheme has been live since 24<sup>th<\/sup> October 2012 and is intended to address market failure affecting commercially viable businesses.  It provides a 75% State guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to firms with growth and job creation potential. The Scheme is intended to facilitate up to &euro;150 million of additional lending to eligible SMEs per annum, over the three year cycle. <\/p><p>  Target groups are commercially viable SMEs, i.e. well performing companies that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, thereby demonstrating their ability to repay the loan, but that do not secure credit facilities due to the following two market failures:<\/p><p>1) Insufficient collateral for the additional facilities, or,<\/p><p>2) Growth\/expansionary SMEs which due to their sectors, markets or business model are perceived as a higher risk under current credit risk evaluation practices.<\/p><p>  To be eligible for the guarantee, businesses must have applied for credit, and must have been refused for either of these two reasons.  Ulster Bank, AIB and Bank of Ireland are participating in the Scheme.  <\/p><p>  The second initiative is the Microenterprise Loan Fund which was established by Government to improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks.   <\/p><p>Microfinance Ireland opened for business on 1<sup>st<\/sup> October 2012 and provides support in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.  The potential viability of the business proposal will be the dominant factor in all credit decisions.  To be eligible for a loan, persons must possess a business plan, must have a commercially viable proposal, must confirm that they have been refused credit from a bank, and must have the capacity to repay the loan.  It is intended that the Fund will generate over &euro;90m in loan expenditure over a 10 year period.<\/p><p>My Department publishes quarterly progress reports on the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme on my Department&rsquo;s website www.enterprise.gov.ie.

That Agency keeps in regular contact with its client companies, to ensure that any concerns or issues can be addressed promptly, to seek to enhance opportunities for the companies, to embed and expand their operations here and to explore linkages and other wider economic benefits that can be developed.  This process was, and remains, very active in the case of the three companies referred to in these questions. <\/p><p>  In addition, I myself avail of opportunities to meet senior representatives of the multinational companies operating here, both at local management level and also with more senior foreign-based executives, whenever possible.  In the case of one of the companies mentioned, I met with senior officials from the US parent company only last month.  Nothing more could have been done to avoid these recent redundancies. <\/p><p>  A feature of the Pharmaceutical sector at present is that it is going through a process of change, largely driven by recent mergers, which have resulted in excess capacity and a requirement to review operations and reduce costs.  In the case of one of the companies referred to, the new amalgamated company has 90 plants worldwide and needs to reduce that by 42, and the recent announcement included one of its several Irish operations. Other challenges facing the sector include patent expiry and changing trends, costs and dynamics.  These factors are totally outside our control.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the ultimate decision in all these cases is made by the parent company, on strictly commercial grounds, and on what is seen by the companies as being in the best interests of the group as a whole. <\/p><p>  In the case of the three sets of job losses referred to, the announcements were made a corporate level without advance notice to my Department.  <\/p><p>  Despite these setbacks, the future for the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices sectors in Ireland is very promising.  Additional jobs have been created in growth areas and most companies in the sector have been investing heavily in their Irish operations over recent years.  Prospects for finding a new buyer for the one plant recently scheduled for total closure are quite high and the IDA are working closely with the company and with potential buyers to advance that process.  It is heartening that in the case of three recent Pharmaceutical plant closures in Ireland, new buyers have been found through the efforts of the IDA and those plants are now back in production with healthy employment levels. <\/p><p>  We will continue to engage closely with these companies but it is an unfortunate fact that significant change is a feature of the industry.  While it is never possible to make absolute predictions about future redundancies, and there will inevitably be occasional rationalizations and changes, the outlook for these sectors overall, is promising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700063#WRM01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights Issues","counter":562,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700063#WRM01750"},{"type":"question","counter":563,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[54208\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700063#WRM01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the legislative programme and an associated timeline that underpins the recent announcement regarding compulsory collective bargaining; the stakeholders he has met on this issue in the past 18 months including members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or Seanad &Eacute;ireann; if there will be a consultation period on his proposals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":564,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to reform the current law on employees' right to engage in collective bargaining (the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001), so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. <\/p><p>  With this in mind, in late 2012 I wrote to stakeholders inviting their observations on the matter.

In the period between 2010 and 2012, this pro-active approach to IT support cost management has given rise to savings which in 2012 amounted to &euro;660,000 on the 2010 figure.  It is expected that the 2013 full year savings will be greater.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700063#WRM02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":577,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700063#WRM02750"},{"type":"question","counter":578,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[55037\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700063#WRM02800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide detail in tabular form by his Department and any agency under his remit, any exemptions granted to the long-standing general principle of pay policy that the payment of additional remuneration to public servants for undertaking additional duties is not permitted; the additional remuneration involved in each case; the date of sanction for such additional remuneration; the rationale behind such sanction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. SWA can consist of a basic primary weekly payment and\/or a weekly\/monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses a person may not be able to meet (e.g. rent supplement).  It can also consist of a once-off payment to help with the cost of any exceptional needs of a once-off nature.  The Government has provided approximately &euro;718 million for the various SWA schemes in 2013.<\/p><p>  Basic weekly SWA may be payable to anyone in the State who satisfies a habitual residence condition and a means test, has registered for employment, unless they have a physical or mental disability, and can prove unemployment, or anyone who is awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare or Health Service Executive payment.  The Government has provided &euro;161.4 million for the basic SWA scheme in 2013.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The Government has provided over &euro;403 million for rent supplement in 2013.  <\/p><p>  In order to qualify for a rent supplement a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons or an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement.  A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by the relevant local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support. <\/p><p>  In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the local housing authority in the area where claim to rent supplement is made (and the person intends to reside).  Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement. Policy in relation to the assessment of housing need is a matter for the Minister for the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  It is expected that the expenditure on the ENP scheme in 2013 will be in excess of &euro;35 million. <\/p><p>  There is no automatic entitlement to a payment. ENP&rsquo;s are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  ENPs are not subject to the habitual residence condition.<\/p><p>  Where a claimant&rsquo;s safety and wellbeing are at risk due to domestic violence Department officials administering the SWA scheme have discretionary powers to expedite the award of a payment to the person in question.  I am satisfied that the discretionary powers available to Department officials administering the SWA scheme are appropriate to assist those affected by domestic violence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700065#WRO01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":662,"content":"<p>Question No. 317 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Placement Programmes","counter":663,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700065#WRO01550"},{"type":"question","counter":664,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[54104\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700065#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the progress that has been made with the recruitment process of personnel under the Gateway scheme at Cork County Council; the number of persons that have been identified and interviewed to date; the date on which the selected persons will commence work under the scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The language planning process has as its core objective the strengthening of the language as a community and household language in the Gaeltacht. In order to progress the implementation of the language planning process on the ground, the following measures are nearing completion: Notices to designate the first 3 of the 26 Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas will be published very shortly, in line with section 7(3) of the Act.  The language planning guidelines, which will explain the language planning process under the Act, are being finalised.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is finalising a suitably robust and transparent system by which organisations will be selected to prepare and implement language plans in the Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas.  The <i>Comprehensive Linguistic Study of the Use of Irish in the Gaeltacht (2007) <\/i>  is being updated in order to establish the current baseline status of the language in the Gaeltacht. This work, which was commissioned by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, is being undertaken by NIRSA (the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis). <\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta operate a wide range of schemes in the Gaeltacht.

Implementation of this policy, as well as delivering substantial environmental benefits, is securing significant economic benefits for the State and our citizens. For example, the wind energy sector employs around 3,400 people in Ireland. In addition, the SEAI estimates that &euro;255 million in gas imports was avoided by wind energy in 2012 alone. Wind energy accounts for the largest proportion of our renewable energy resource. The development of wind energy projects must take account of the concerns of local communities in relation to the potential impacts of such projects in their areas. I have clearly stated my view that renewable energy developers must ensure that they undertake effective and timely communication from the initiation of projects right through to commissioning and operation. It is essential that local communities are engaged and consulted on an on-going basis.  Such an approach is of course also necessary in the development of community wind farms. There is real potential for wind farms to be developed and owned by local communities which would make an important contribution to improving public acceptance of the technology, and to ensuring benefits are delivered directly to the community in which a wind generation facility is located. <\/p><p>  SEAI has taken a number of initiatives aimed at fostering social acceptance of wind energy and the development of community wind farms.

The SEM is a gross mandatory pool which includes a marginal energy pricing system and an explicit Capacity Payment Mechanism (CPM).  At a high level, the SEM design consists of a centralised and mandatory all-island wholesale pool (or spot) market, through which generators and suppliers trade electricity.  Generators bid into this pool their own short-run costs for each half hour of the following day, which is mostly their fuel-related operating costs.

KCS is based on the international paradigm of Risk Management which addresses the critical elements of fire prevention and fire protection as well as response. The Risk Management approach, which is described in Chapter 2 of KCS, generally involves five stages including identifying hazards and evaluating the risks these hazards pose; mitigating these risks by trying to reduce the probability of the event occurring and\/or its consequences if it does occur; planning and preparing to deal with the risk; responding to an event; and reviewing events with a view to learning for the future.<\/p><p>  The use of an &lsquo;area risk categorisation&rsquo; system is central to the approach in KCS which is being applied across the country by all fire services. This will result in fire station areas being graded across five bands from very high to very low risk categories.  The fire service approach to risk management in an area, including response capacity in terms of numbers of fire appliances and fire crews, is reviewed on the basis of this risk categorisation. It is the predominant risk in an area that defines the risk categorisation. However, KCS provides that in some cases with extensive or widely varying station grounds, it may be appropriate to sub-divide the station area and have different risk categories.<\/p><p>  KCS sets out the approach and criteria for use by local fire service management in arriving at decisions on the risk category to be assigned to a station area, one of which is: <i>&quot;Extent of Individual Special Hazards (e.g. Institutional, Educational, Industrial, Lar<\/i><i>ge Scale Retail\/Commercial, SEVESO,<\/i><i>Places of Public Assembly<\/i><i>etc.)&rdquo;.<\/i><i><\/i>The overall approach to undertaking the Area Risk Categorisation Process relies on available data including census data and Risk-Based Approach Reports based on actual fire service activity, the use of local knowledge and operational intelligence, previously undertaken Major Emergency Risk Assessments and other available sources. KCS notes that specific hazard sites, such as SEVESO plants, are closely regulated and already the focus of significant risk mitigation work which includes external site response plans and exercises involving the principal response agencies. Buildings or sites which are of special interest because of their scale and importance to a community or region may not therefore of themselves be high risk, and the presence in an area of such facilities would not necessarily raise an area to high risk or very high risk category in the KCS area risk categorisation process.<\/p><p>  In accordance with the Framework for Major Emergency Management, which was adopted by Government in 2006, the relevant divisions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health Service Executive and the Local Authorities have carried out both individual and joint risk assessments for their functional areas and have prepared Major Emergency Plans, undertaken inter-agency training and carried out exercises on potential emergency scenarios. As part of this process, they have worked collaboratively with SEVESO site operators in accordance with a guidance document which was prepared specifically for this purpose. The central competent authority for the enforcement of the Seveso II Directive is the Health and Safety Authority, while responsibility for the transposition into Irish Law of the new SEVESO Directive (Directive 2012\/18\/EU) lies with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700069#WRS03400","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Decentralisation Programme Expenditure","counter":881,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700070#WRT00150"},{"type":"question","counter":882,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[53993\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700070#WRT00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will outline what offices relevant to his Department are located or have been decentralised outside of Dublin; if he will provide the total number of staff in his Department and the number of staff based outside County Dublin as of 2013; the annual cost incurred in 2012 and 2013, respectively, for decentralised staff travelling to meetings in Dublin; the number of times staff travelled to individual meetings in Dublin in each of the relevant years; the costs for which those staff will be reimbursed; and if his Department has procedures or mechanisms in place such as video conferencing to reduce the cost of travelling for each unit based outside Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

There are currently 4,364 persons seeking international protection residing in 34 Direct Provision accommodation centres across 16 counties under contract to RIA.  Of these residents, approximately a third are children under the age of 18.<\/p><p>  I should firstly commend to the Deputy RIA's 2012 Annual Report available on its website - www.ria.gov.ie - which  includes greater detail than before on family make up in centres as well as additional information on facilities for children in each of the centres involved.<\/p><p>  The Direct Provision system is unique and there is no direct comparison with other types of accommodation where children would reside, be they houses with gardens or apartment buildings. Some accommodation centres have more outdoor and indoor facilities than others.  However, any suggestions that children in these centres do not have opportunities for meaningful recreation activities are wide of the mark. Further details are available in the Report mentioned above. Of the current 34 asylum centres in RIA's portfolio, only 3 were specifically built for the sole purpose of accommodating asylum seekers, that is, they were 'purpose-built'.  All other centres must operate within the physical limitations of the premises' original use e.g. hotel, college dormitory, hostel, etc.  While all conform, at the very least, to minimum contractual and legislative standards, there are necessarily a range of facilities available in centres in the overall RIA portfolio, deriving from their original use.<\/p><p>  RIA and centre management work with local schools, community groups, sports clubs and NGO's to link children and families into community initiatives, sports and other activities to ensure access to the best available package of services. Children of asylum seekers can access recreational facilities available in the locality in which they are living.  Some Direct Provision Centres have on-site playgrounds.  Many centres will also facilitate NGO&rsquo;s who organise outings etc. Centres also have links with local community facilities which allow for free and discounted access to amenities outside of the accommodation centre.<\/p><p>  It is worth noting that asylum seeker children benefit from access to primary and secondary education on the same basis as Irish citizen children in the local community, and both schools and the Community Welfare Service are very supportive of those children in assisting with any associated costs in respect of equipment and transport. An exemption from fees for State Examinations is also available to asylum seekers who are holders of medical cards. Homework clubs and quiet spaces are provided in family centres to facilitate children doing their homework. <\/p><p>  On-site pre-school services are available in some of the larger direct provision centres. However, in all cases parents may opt to send their children to privately run pre-schools in the community. The Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme provides for free pre-school placements to all children, including children of asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700071#WRU02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Title","counter":949,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700071#WRU02600"},{"type":"question","counter":950,"qnumday":426,"qnumall":"[53702\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700071#WRU02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the average waiting time for registration of title at the Land Register in the Property Registration Authority of Ireland; the number of cases currently pending across the various sections; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":951,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Property Registration Authority (PRA) that the total number of cases on hand as at 30 November 2013 was 60,115.

These include the complexity of the case, investigation of title requirements, the completeness of the documentation presented and mapping requirements - this is reflected in the turnaround times for different application types which are set out below:<\/p><p>-  All electronic applications (eDischarges of mortgages and eNursing Home charges) are completed within 2 working days;<\/p><p>-  75% of mainstream applications not requiring changes to the map, which are in order for registration, are completed within 10 working days;<\/p><p>-  91% of Copy Folio and Title Plan applications, received electronically, are issued within 24 hours of receipt of application;<\/p><p>-  94% of Official Map Searches are completed within 5 working days.<\/p><p>  The cases on hand also include cases which require a change to the map, first registration and other more complex cases. The first registration applications and similarly complex cases are governed by a detailed and often complex area of land law and the circumstances of each case dictate the nature and the processing time of each individual application.<\/p><p>  Where a case is urgent and this is brought to the attention of the PRA, in accordance with its customer service policy, the matter is dealt with expeditiously.

These concerns arose from the fact that the scope of the published Bill was limited to apartment developments and did not cater for the many mixed developments containing apartments, duplex units, and detached, semi-detached or terraced houses. This extension of the scope of the Bill required, inter alia, amended definitions of 'multi-unit development' in section 1 and the current section 2(2) which applies the sections set out in Schedule 2 to multi-unit developments containing houses, whether detached, semi-detached or terraced, and which have an OMC structure. It appears that the requirement to establish an OMC was a requirement of the planning permission in many of these cases.  <\/p><p>  I understand that this practice of requiring the establishment of an OMC in housing developments has ceased following instructions from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.

Consequently, these two forms of new practice model continue to be provided for in statute since that time and are not merely a recent innovation.<\/p><p>  Subsequently, the 'Report of the Legal Costs Working Group' published in November 2005 and that of the Competition Authority of December 2006 entitled 'Competition in Professional Services: Solicitors and Barristers', put forward detailed findings and recommendations in relation to greater transparency in the legal costs regime and by way of supporting the more competitive and consumer-focussed provision of legal services in the State. Indeed, the Competition Authority Report of 2006 provides a series of substantial observations that clearly identify and respond to the market concentration of legal services already resulting at that time from the delivery of those services within the confines of narrow historical models that could not be adequately responsive to the needs of current markets, business technologies and consumer behaviour. I cannot accept, therefore, the import of the Deputy's Question as put, that the interests of consumers and our international competitiveness would be better served by the mere retention of anti-competitive or restrictive business models in a sheltered legal services sector that would remain immune to the kind of structural reform that, in every other services sector, has proven itself essential to sustainable economic recovery at this time.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, numerous jurisdictions have introduced new and more customer-focussed legal business models in the intervening period since the Competition Authority's Report of 2006. These &quot;alternative business structures&quot; (ABS) can involve the traditional legal services provided by barristers and\/or solicitors or combine them, in what  are known as &quot;multi-disciplinary practices&quot;, with those of accountants, insurance brokers, conveyancers or other professionals to provide seamless solutions for clients on a more cost-effective basis.  To ignore these changes would leave legal practitioners and the consumers of their services in this jurisdiction at a growing competitive disadvantage, not to mention continuing to disregard almost a quarter of a century of recommendations from public bodies such as the Fair Trade Commission.  Consequently, in looking to the future, the Legal Services Regulation Bill includes several measures aimed at opening up the provision of legal services in a way that takes account of the emergent legal business models. These will include new opportunities for legal practitioners to establish the types of multi-disciplinary practices mentioned; for solicitors and barristers to participate in legal partnerships; for legal practitioners working for private or State entities to be allowed to act as advocates in court proceedings for their employers; for practising barristers who share premises and costs as a group to be allowed to advertise themselves as such; for solicitors to employ barristers in a practice and for direct access to barristers in non-contentious matters that do not involve the holding of clients monies.<\/p><p>  It must be recognised that alternative business structures or multi-disciplinary practices and their attendant regulatory frameworks have been, or continue to be, rolled out  in other open economies like our own such as England and Wales, Scotland, Australia, Germany, Netherlands and parts of Canada, including British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario and that there is a wealth of information, regulatory precedent and academic analysis now available on them. The Legal Services Act 2007 provided for the introduction of ABS, including multi-disciplinary practices, in England and Wales - over 240 licences for ABS have been issued to date. The Legal Services (Scotland) Act 2010 also allows for ABS that include multi-disciplinary practices. In Canada, the legislation relates more narrowly to multi-disciplinary practices. Along with officials of my Department, I have been actively reviewing and considering in detail how the introduction of ABS is taking place in all of these jurisdictions along with the relevant literature and those submissions received.   I am also considering the various issues of probity and regulation so that they will continue to be addressed in the development of the Legal Services Regulation Bill.   <\/p><p>  The genesis and development of policy in this area, culminating in the policy imperatives of the Programme for Government and the EU\/IMF\/ECB Troika Memorandum to which I have already referred, are set-out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Legal Services Regulation Bill that is available on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality via the internet link, www.justice.ie. Amendments to the Legal Services Regulation Bill are being considered by Government with a view to their be made available prior to the resumption of Committee Stage of the Bill which is expected to take place in the New Year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700072#WRV01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":993,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700072#WRV01250"},{"type":"question","counter":994,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[54056\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700072#WRV01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the options open to an Irish citizen by virtue of an Irish grandfather who has adult children living abroad and who wish to move to live and work here; if he will advise of the position on this scenario; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":995,"content":"<p>A person is an Irish citizen from birth if at the time of his or her birth either parent was an Irish citizen.

By way of illustration, in 2012, INIS dealt with approximately 165,000 new applications across the broad immigration spectrum such as applications for visas, residence, protection and citizenship. Understandably, given that volume of activity a very large number of queries from Oireachtas Members on the status of individual applications are received by INIS. <\/p><p>  In recognition of the need to facilitate Oireachtas Members in submitting representations and queries and to provide timely and effective responses to all matters raised, a dedicated Oireachtas Members email service has been established by INIS. This service, for the exclusive use of Oireachtas Members, assists Members seeking information on individual cases while also enabling large volumes of queries to be dealt with speedily and efficiently. In 2012, almost 4,800 email queries were processed through the Oireachtas email service, with a similar volume being dealt with in 2013 to date. It is also the case that issues in respect of individual immigration cases are regularly raised through the Parliamentary Questions process and directly with my Private Office, all of which are responded to in an appropriate and timely manner.<\/p><p>  As I am sure the Deputy will agree the main priority for INIS must continue to be the processing of cases as expeditiously as possible. In that context and in view of the fact that an efficient email enquiry service is available to Oireachtas Members, I am of the opinion that the right balance is being struck between facilitating Members in making enquiries to INIS and the efficient processing of applications and that the provision of an enquiry line as suggested by the Deputy would have the effect of diverting scarce resources away from case processing.<\/p><p>  I do not see any current need or demand that would justify the extension of the system provided by INIS to other areas of my Department.

The applicants to whom the Deputy refers had submitted statements of financial support from the Libyan authorities for the purpose of pursuing English language studies and further third level studies in the State. However, they had  submitted letters of acceptance from English language schools only as they did not have confirmed plans at the time of application to pursue further third level studies in the State.

This service is provided by the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  In addition, the office also provides a public service for applicants seeking re-entry visas and this service is administered by INIS. Also, on a daily basis the office receives a number of callers seeking information or for other business. In total the number of persons attending the office is in the region of 130,000 per annum.<\/p><p>  The nature of the services provided is such that it is demand led and accordingly, there are peaks and valleys in the numbers of callers at different times of the year. For example, there is marked increased demand for registrations during the period from late September to the end of November, linked to the academic year, when a significant number of students apply for first time registration or re-registration.  Equally, there is increased demand for re-entry visa services in early summer prior to the holiday period and also before Christmas and Easter.<\/p><p>  The Burgh offices are open for registrations from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday &ndash; Thursday and 7 a.m. &ndash; 6 p.m. on Fridays.  While this requires significant staff resources, the long opening hours is aimed at catering for applicants who may be studying or working and find it more convenient to come to the office outside of office hours. Specific times are set aside for certain categories of persons such as students. The public office for re-entry visas is open from 8 a.m. to approximately 2 p.m. Monday to Friday. However, in the vast majority of cases it is not necessary to attend in person for a re-entry visa as INIS operates a postal service which is a more efficient option for applicants. Where there are genuine emergencies and persons need to travel at short notice, INIS facilitates such persons to be dealt with in person. <\/p><p>   My Department&rsquo;s customer service charter encompasses INIS and the organisation is continually seeking to improve the quality of services provided to customers. A major overall of the public reception facilities in Burgh Quay with expanded dedicated areas for dealing with the public has recently been completed.  In addition, the immigration service is planning to introduce an on-line booking system for appointments which is part of a wider plan to transfer the registration function from the Garda National Immigration Bureau to INIS.  The aim of the booking system is to give certainty to customers that they will be dealt with within a stated time window and at the same time enabling the immigration service to match its staff resources to meet demand at any particular time.  The new reception facilities have been designed to cater for such a system.<\/p><p>  Finally, I might add that this office is probably one of the busiest Public Offices with some of the longest opening times in the State.

It remains the responsibility of all non-EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality and the great majority of migrants comply with this condition.  It does not follow logically that the solution to illegal migration is for the Irish State to reward those who engage in it.<\/p><p>  If a person is undocumented his\/her case can be considered on its merits by officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department and part of this consideration involves looking at the extent to which the person's situation is through no fault of his\/her own.  Sometimes this consideration will result in a positive outcome for the applicant.   In other cases, the  decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, would be that the person has to go home.  That decision should be respected.<\/p><p>  Broad regularisation programmes are problematic.  They could give rise to unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  In our case there are also significant considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.<\/p><p>  Any significant departure from well established policies in this respect would have a major impact on the operation of the Common Travel Area both here and in the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>  Finally, I note that a figure of 30,000 is cited on the number of illegal immigrants in the State; by definition it is impossible to state with any accuracy the number of persons without lawful permission to remain in the State and in this respect, Ireland is no different to any other country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700072#WRV02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Registration Certificate Fees","counter":1016,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700072#WRV02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1017,"qnumday":450,"qnumall":"[54229\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700072#WRV03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the guidelines relating to the cost of replacing a Garda National Immigration Bureau card if the original is lost or stolen.","asker":"1080","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1018,"content":"<p>Section 19 of the Immigration Act, 2004 (as amended), provides that a non-national is required to pay a fee to the registration officer, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for the issue of a registration certificate.

In 2012, this funding amounted to &euro;1.36m to some 140 organisations to assist in their work in 2013 and I plan to make an allocation in respect of 2014 shortly.<\/p><p>  I should stress that it is the responsibility of horse owners to ensure the welfare of horses in their ownership and\/or their care and to dispose of them appropriately. In this context, horse owners are reminded of the advice of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council that, where an owner can no longer adequately provide for their horse or where the horse can no longer fulfil the purpose for which it was bred, he or she should be proactive in seeking to dispose of the animal humanely. My Department is, of course, continuing to deal with any animal welfare issues relating to horses through its existing mechanisms and I have previously indicated that emergency funding is available to assist horse owners who cannot afford to pay for their humane disposal. <\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to work with local authorities, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and with animal welfare bodies to ensure that horse welfare is protected.  I urge the public to continue to avail of the Animal Welfare Helpline in operation by my Department, to report instances where animal welfare may be compromised on 1850 211 990.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700074#WRX02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Equine Identification Scheme","counter":1101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700074#WRX02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1102,"qnumday":480,"qnumall":"[53862\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700074#WRX02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the statutory authority under which equine breeders being asked to pay for the costs associated with the identification and registration of equines for matters such as the marking and chipping of foals carried out by veterinary surgeons approved for the purpose and the issuing of identity documents by issuing bodies approved for the purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1103,"content":"<p>Owners and keepers of horses are required by EU Council Directives 90\/426\/EEC and 90\/427\/EEC and Commission Regulation (EC) No 504\/2008 of 6 June 2008 to ensure that their horses are identified in accordance with the provisions of that legislation, which has been transposed into national legislation via S.I.

Since that time, staff members assigned to the unit have undertaken investigations into a range of matters pertaining to animal health and welfare and public health, to ensure the integrity of the food chain, to protect animal health and welfare and to ensure the integrity of the disbursement of public funds.<\/p><p>  The remit of the investigation unit is to;<\/p><p>  -  Investigate all suspected criminal breaches of all legislation pertaining to the food chain, including animal health, animal welfare, public health.<\/p><p>  -  Provide advice to other DAFM  Divisions regarding possible breaches and approach to investigations<\/p><p>  -  Cross-report findings back to relevant line Division, as appropriate<\/p><p>  -  Prepare  prosecution files, where appropriate,<\/p><p>  -  Present the evidence in Court as necessary.<\/p><p>  Staff from the unit operate to a specific published code of practice.<\/p><p>  Joint operations are regularly conducted with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, (NBCI, CAB, GBFI), the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the Veterinary Council of Ireland, the PSNI, DARD NI, Customs &amp;amp; Excise, the Irish Medicines Board, OLAF and WGEO.<\/p><p>  Staff assigned to the unit have a range of primary qualifications in various areas related to their work, including law. They have undertaken a wide range of training to help them perform their duties, including up-skilling. Among the training events which were provided specifically for officers in the unit &ndash; additional to other training offered to other regulatory control officers, - include the following:<\/p><p>  -  A training exercise given by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the practical aspects of the law relating to searching premises, securing evidence, taking memo&rsquo;s of interviews, the making and taking of statements.<\/p><p>  -  A training course covering the detailed process associated with the collection of cattle identity ear-tags as evidence supported by a forensic analyst from the state&rsquo;s Forensic Science Laboratory.<\/p><p>  -  A Legal Training course organised by the DAFM Training Division, involving a practicing barrister, familiar with DAFM cases.  The course involved workshop was geared specifically to explain the &ldquo;how&rdquo; and &ldquo;why&rdquo; of the investigators and prosecutors role and function.<\/p><p>  In addition, there are regular scientific training sessions attended by veterinary staff in line with the requirements of the Veterinary Practice Act. Furthermore, staff from the unit regularly meet, formally and informally, with other international investigation agency staff to appraise investigative techniques and to keep abreast of current best-practice.<\/p><p>  As the range and scope of the unit expanded over the years into investigating different areas of DAFM activities, training was provided, in conjunction with the relevant line Divisions, to ensure that the investigating officers were familiar with new legislation and its impact on investigations.<\/p><p>  Currently there are 10 staff members assigned to the unit &ndash; three veterinary, six technical and one administrative officer. <\/p><p>  The financial resources assigned to the operation of the unit &ndash; including salaries and day-to-day operational expenses, including travel and subsistence costs - in the past three years, is set out below:<\/p><p><br \/><table><tr><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013 to date (end Nov)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;1,014,472.11<\/td><td>&euro;950,566.40<\/td><td>&euro;719,983.69<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>  Management of the unit hold monthly management meetings with the staff during which each case is discussed with the investigating officer.

The domestic market remains difficult with consumption coming under pressure.  Key activities envisaged in 2014 are TV and point of sale advertising, Facebook and website activities, digital advertising, PR activities and radio promotions.  Pork, ham and bacon with the Quality Mark will also feature in the RTE 1 &lsquo;Home Chef&rsquo; series with Neven Maguire starting in mid January.  In total there will be 19 weeks of promotional activity for pork and bacon on the home market throughout 2014.<\/p><p>  The main export markets will remain important in 2014, given the pressures on the home market.  In the UK, support will be directed towards projects which can assist processors in identifying and developing business opportunities.  In Russia, efforts will be directed towards enhancing relationships with local authorities, to maintain market access and build market and customer contact for Irish exporters through exhibitions such as Prodexpo.  In Asia, similar efforts in building trade links will continue for 2014, working closely with the Chinese Meat Association, and relevant Chinese government agencies.  In terms of trade development, Bord Bia will host an Irish stand at two trade fairs, Sial China in Shanghai and CIMIE in Beijing, while inward buyer visits from this region will continue to be supported.

The Department, and the Child and Family Agency upon establishment, will continue to advance such a collaborative approach in conjunction with the Department of Health and the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700076#WRZ03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Years Strategy Implementation","counter":1220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700076#WRZ03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1221,"qnumday":519,"qnumall":"[54040\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700076#WRZ03300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when the Early Years strategy will be compiled following the publication of the report of the expert group on the Early Years strategy.

In the main, these are the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) but they also include other bodies such as the HSE, some local authorities and, up to recently, some of the larger national youth organisations. <\/p><p>  The City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB), a statutory board established in 1942, under the City of Dublin ETB, is one such body which distributes allocations to youth projects. The CDYSB, on behalf of CDETB, has for several years, undertaken the administration of approximately 70 youth projects in the Dublin City area and has developed a strong track record in managing these payments.<\/p><p>  In January 2013, in an effort to streamline the tasks associated with the financial management of funding for projects to achieve greater efficiency in the administration of funding,  the administration tasks, formerly carried out by  six national organisations were transferred by my Department to CDYSB.  The six organisations are Youth Work Ireland, Crosscare, For&oacute;ige, Involve, YMCA and ECO-UNESCO.<\/p><p>  The financial management tasks involved in the transfer are those which had, up to that date, been carried out by the national youth organisations themselves and by the Department. The ETBs  (VECs at the time), had not had a funding administration role in relation to the organisations concerned. The role of the ETBs in supporting the provision of youth services in their respective administrative areas is unaffected by the streamlining initiative.<\/p><p>  The process involved my Department consulting with CDYSB to discuss their capacity to take on the additional work, the financial and other controls that would be put in place, how the responsibilities would be taken on a &ldquo;no additional cost&rdquo; basis within existing resources and how the transfer of the administrative tasks would be effected. In the deliberative process, my Department received advice that, as there was no payment involved for the provision of the service, the initiative was not subject to procurement rules. Consultations and meetings were also held with the six organisations involved.<\/p><p>  My Department continues to examine the scope for improving administrative arrangements for the financial management of the funding for youth services to achieve greater efficiency and standardisation. My Department is in ongoing discussion with ETB Ireland, the national representative association for the ETBs, on this shared objective, in the interest of  the front line youth projects and services throughout the country.<\/p><p>  In recent years, the numbers of bodies holding funding administration status from my Department has reduced from approximately 40 to some 30 at the start of 2013.

Such assistance can often include my officials contacting the HSE directly on behalf of the individual.  It is not possible to quantify the volume of such calls.<\/p><p>  The HSE publishes a range of reports on performance indicators on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Among these indicators is information relating to referral and assessment processes. The HSE also provides an annual Review of Adequacy Report under Section 8 of the Child Care Act 1991. The Annual Service planning process also provides an opportunity to set out service priorities in the context of available resources.  In addition, information is provided to me by the HSE on specific issues as required or to inform me of policy or legislative issues arising in the services.<\/p><p>  Child abuse referrals are broken down into four categories: sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse and neglect.  Although child prostitution is recorded as sexual abuse, it is not broken down according to the type of sexual abuse reported.  In 2011 there were 15,808 referrals where there was a concern of child abuse received and in 2012 there were 19,044 received.  Figures to date for 2013 indicate that the level of referrals will be similar to the number of reports made to Social Work Services in 2012.<\/p><p>  The HSE has advised that all referrals received receive an initial assessment to determine what further action is required in accordance with Children First Guidance (2011).

The study includes a section containing data on social, emotional and behavioural outcomes relating to children.  Data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Survey (HBSC) relating to self esteem, found that 57.3% of children reported feeling happy with the way they are, although this percentage reduced with older children.  There were also regional differences with 60.9% children living in the South-West reporting feeling happy with the way they are compared to 53.6% in the West.  <\/p><p>  The &quot;How We see It: Report of a Survey on Young People&rsquo;s Body Image&quot; report was conducted by young people from the D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g Council in 2011 and published in October 2013.  2,156 young people, aged between 10 and 21 years completed the survey, which was anonymous.  The findings from this survey clearly demonstrate that body image is a burning and complex issue for young people in contemporary Ireland, with 77% of participants ranking body image as important to them. Key findings included:<\/p><p>- Two out of 3 participants say that they were fairly or very satisfied with their body image with more than twice as many boys as girls being \tsatisfied (22% male; 8% female) and girls expressing considerably stronger dissatisfaction (26% female; 10% male). <\/p><p>- 97% of the young people who took part in the survey do some type of exercise, and activity and sports were cited as most important in supporting positive body image.  However, girls are twice as likely as boys not to take enough exercise to stay healthy, while boys are more than twice as likely as girls to feel that they take more exercise than is healthy.<\/p><p>- 60% of all participants said they feel pressurised to look good for other people. Girls (70%) were far more likely to say this than boys (46%).<\/p><p>- More than half of all the young people surveyed said their body image interferes with their participation in certain activities (such as swimming, dating, putting photographs on Facebook) and girls are up to twice as likely as boys to find it harder to take part in all of the listed activities.<\/p><p>  My Department also recently published &lsquo;Youth work: A systematic map of the research literature&rsquo; (2013).

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.<\/p><p>  In 2013, &euro;53.498m has been made available for services for young people. This includes capital funding of &euro;1.5m to support projects in the youth services, including new Youth Caf&eacute;s and &euro;0.250m for the provision of Play and Recreation facilities. This year, it proved possible, in the context of end year savings and efficiencies, to provide additional assistance to over 35 youth projects and organisations to assist them in ensuring their sustainability for the year ahead. Youth Officers of the Education and Training Boards, who have very close links with local youth projects, have been of great assistance to my Department in this process. <\/p><p>  With regard to funding for Co. Kildare, &euro;458,220 has been provided to six projects and services in 2013. In addition, I have recently allocated an amount of &euro;50,000 to Kildare Youth Hub, Kildare town towards the cost of developing a youth caf&eacute; facility which will offer a safe environment for young people to &lsquo;hang out&rsquo;. <\/p><p>  Work is underway in my Department on the determination of the 2014 allocations for the youth services. In line with Government policy, my Department, along with all Government departments, has been required to achieve significant savings on schemes and services in line with the reductions set out in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE). I am pleased to advise the Deputy that, as part of Budget 2014, I have secured an additional allocation of &euro;1m in current funding to reduce the impact of the CRE savings requirements on the youth services next year.  The additional allocation means that the savings requirement in 2014 will be &euro;2m rather than &euro;3m indicated for the youth services in the CRE and the total current funding allocation for youth services will be &euro;49.78m.<\/p><p>  Every effort is being made to finalise the 2014 funding allocations promptly so that youth projects and national youth organisations can be advised of their 2014 allocations as soon as possible. <\/p><p>  My Department has strong links with youth sector organisations and there is regular interaction with them on a range of issues including matters to do with ensuring quality services to meet young people&rsquo;s needs and the challenges youth organisations encounter in managing the budgets available to them over the year. The most prominent issues brought to my Department&rsquo;s attention over the past two years related to the impact of reduced budgets on youth organisations and youth projects throughout the country. The youth organisations also followed closely Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU Youth Council of Ministers, in which we prioritised the importance of quality youth services for young people&rsquo;s social inclusion and the contribution of youth work to the attainment of the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, particularly for youth employment. The  National Youth Council of Ireland partnered my Department in the organisation of the EU youth conference held in Dublin in March. Over 200 young people and policy makers from all the member states discussed issues of concern to youth, including youth unemployment, education and training and access to social services and supports for young people. Youth sector organisations where active participants in the Expert Round Table event which I hosted in June, in Co Kildare, and in which for the first time, youth organisations came together with employer and business representatives to discuss the contribution of youth work to young people's employability and entrepreneurship. My Department continues to work closely with the youth sector on these priority issues in the context of the Government&rsquo;s plan for the Youth Guarantee.<\/p><p>  My Department works collaboratively with the youth sector organisations on important policy initiatives in various fora. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee appointed by me in January 2013 includes representatives of the national youth organisations as well as statutory sector interests.

There are detection and treatment services available at present in community and acute hospital settings for these conditions.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides a sight testing service as part of the school health screening programme for children of primary school age.

Children between 12 and 16 years, whose parents are in receipt of a medical card, are eligible for HSE eye-care services when named on their parents' card.  Other children between 12 and 16 years are eligible to be seen by the HSE ophthalmic service when there is a medical reason for the eye condition, rather than a refractive error.  <\/p><p>  The National Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Programme commenced at the beginning of this year.<\/p><p>  In addition, there are a number of high level strategies which are relevant to the area of eye health, including Clinical Programmes; Public Health; Health Protection; Positive Ageing and Carers Strategies and Screening initiatives.

However, the Medical Council's Medical Workforce Intelligence Report, published on 25th July, 2013 provides useful information concerning doctors on the Medical Council's Register in 2012.  It noted that 16,392 doctors retained registration with the Medical Council Register, while a further 1,256 doctors entered the register for the first time. On the other hand, 1,419 doctors did not retain registration, representing an exit rate of 8%. These movements resulted in a 3% fall in the number of doctors registered at the end of 2012 compared with 2011.  The Council reported that \"a relatively high proportion of recent graduates from Irish medical schools are leaving the register\". The exit rate was highest amongst those aged 65 years and over, 19.2%; with 6.4% of those aged 25 - 29 and 6.3%  of those aged 30 - 34 exiting. However, it also found that doctors who qualified abroad (the 6 world regions averaged 13%) were more likely to exit the register than those who qualified in Ireland (5.8%). <\/p><p>  It should be borne in mind that there is a global demand for doctors and that they are a mobile workforce.

The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction.   The HSE may, however, continue to recruit front-line staff in circumstances where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement, and this can be accommodated within the budgetary and staff number limits in place. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the need to reduce numbers employed in the public service, the Government is, however, wholly committed to the provision of training, work-experience and employment opportunities where possible. Hence, for example. the decision to implement a Nurse Graduate Initiative. This Initiative enables the health services to offer 1,000 graduate nurses positions for two years, at a time when job opportunities in the public service are very limited. The Initiative therefore supports the retention of recently qualified graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system, and enables them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation.

It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013 with an additional &euro;28 million saved in 2014.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which came into operation on the 24th of June, introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients. It is estimated that this system will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.<\/p><p>Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State. The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.   They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. <\/p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August. The IMB is updating the List of Interchangeable Medicines on an ongoing basis and it expects to complete the assessment of  the top 20 priority medicines by  Quarter 2 2014.  The process will then continue until all relevant medicinal products on the reimbursable list have been assessed. <\/p><p>Once a List of Interchangeable Medicines is published by the IMB  a two stage price reduction process gets underway. First, under the terms of the 2012 APMI Agreement, the price of all relevant products fall by 20%, e.g. atorvastatin prices were reduced from 1st September.   Secondly, the legislation provides that the HSE may set a reference price for groups of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Products with a view to introducing further significant price cuts. Taking both price reductions into account, atorvastatin prices are down 70% since the introduction of generic substitution.<\/p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. <\/p><p>  The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013. The next reference price, for certain esomeprazole products, will be introduced on the 1st January 2014. Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.<\/p><p>  The legislation also includes a process for the review of existing prices outside of reference pricing. Each medicinal product, which was on the Reimbursement List when the legislation was commenced, must be reviewed by the HSE within three years to determine whether it should remain on the List and, if so, the price that should apply.  <\/p><p>  The Act also provides for the removal of items from the Reimbursement List and for conditional reimbursement of certain products. &euro;10 million savings have been targeted in Budget 2014 from the delisting of products and the HSE is now considering products for review in compliance with the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700079#WRCC03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Generic Drugs Substitution","counter":1368,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700079#WRCC03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1369,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[53915\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121700079#WRCC03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of drugs at present that must be compulsorily prescribed by international non-proprietary name; the number he expects to have under this system by the end of 2014; the total number of drugs currently covered by the Health Service Executive under various schemes that could be replaced by generics but are not compulsory; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, under the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland&rsquo;s (PSI) Code of Conduct, pharmacists are required to provide honest, relevant, accurate, current and appropriate information to patients regarding the nature, cost, value and benefit of medicines provided by them. Every pharmacist has an obligation to comply in full with the statutory Code of Conduct. <\/p><p>  The PSI advises patients that their pharmacist should be in a position to provide them with whatever information or clarification they require about prescribed medicines, including information about the pricing of those medicines. The Department of Health has asked the PSI to examine how greater price transparency can be achieved. It should also be noted that the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provides patients with an incentive to seek interchangeable products priced at or below the reference price.  <\/p><p>  It is the view of the HSE and the Department of Health that there should be total transparency provided when any pharmaceutical service is accessed by a member of the public. <\/p><p>  In relation to improved prescribing practises, a Medicines Management Programme (MMP) has been established by the HSE to provide sustained national leadership in this area. <\/p><p>  The aims of the MMP include (a) ensuring that patients have access to the essential medicines that they need; (b) facilitating more cost-effective prescribing with initiatives in relation to high-cost medicines; (c) ensuring value for money in relation to medicines; and (d) enhancing evidence based prescribing and optimising patient safety through a reduction in medication related adverse events. <\/p><p>  The MMP will focus on drugs and medicines which can be expected to have a significant impact in terms of patient safety and expenditure.

The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) is the body responsible for the capital project.  Last August, I announced appointments to this Board to replace the transitional Board which had been in place since January this year.  These appointments bring architectural, planning, procurement, engineering and construction expertise to the project.  In November, Mr. John Pollock was selected as Programme Director of the NPHDB.  Also in August, I announced appointments to the Children's Hospital Group Board which, as client for the project, will play a key role in ensuring the new hospital is optimally designed and completed as swiftly as possible.  In November, Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman took up post as CEO of the Children's Hospital Group, and will play a central role in driving forward the integration of the three hospitals, and the project as a whole.<\/p><p>  Prior to the commencement of construction, key elements of the project include design development, decant works for the site and planning permission. The new NPHDB has reviewed the design team procurement process, which had been initiated in July, and decided on a change of approach based on its collective expertise and taking into account changing market conditions. While this means that the design team will be selected in Spring 2014, rather than by the end of this year as originally planned, the Board is confident there will be no delay to the project overall.  Pre-application planning discussions have commenced, a master plan for the St. James's Hospital campus is being prepared and St. James's Hospital is working closely with the Development Board and the HSE in relation to the decant phase of the project.  Work on the review of urgent care centre configuration is at an advanced stage and I intend to bring proposals in this regard to Government shortly.<\/p><p>  The new children's hospital will provide  in-patients with their own single room and en-suite bathroom, with overnight in-room accommodation for parents.  The new theatres and procedure rooms will have advanced medical technology for patient diagnosis (e.g. x-ray machines) and complex surgeries, which will inevitably improve clinical outcomes for patients.  The hospital will have a child-centred design with colourful play areas and external gardens for children (and for their families). Different play areas and recreational facilities will be provided that are appropriate for different age groups.  Work on developing a detailed timeline is continuing, which will reflect the urgency and priority of the project and also its scale and complexity.  However, at this stage, the Board is confident that construction can begin in Spring 2015 with the transition of services to the new hospital to commence at the end of 2018.<\/p><p>  In October, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that up to &euro;200m would be made available for the new children&rsquo;s hospital from the sale of the National Lottery, adding to the existing &euro;450 million Exchequer funding. The level of funding now in place underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to this priority project.  Also, philanthropic \/ non-Exchequer funding will be sought to the maximum and most appropriate degree. Estimated costs will be reviewed and refined at each stage as the project progresses.  The total spent on the new children&rsquo;s hospital to date is &euro;41 million.  Of the total spent on the project in its previous location, much of the work that was done for the project on its previous site can be transferred to the new site.

These falls reflect Government policy that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet fiscal and budgetary targets.  The health sector must make its contribution to the necessary reduction.  Nonetheless, it is open to the HSE to continue to recruit nurses and midwives in circumstances where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement and this can be accommodated within the budgetary and staff number limits in place.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the need to reduce numbers employed in the public service, the Government is wholly committed to the provision of training, work-experience and employment opportunities where possible. Hence the decision to implement a Nurse Graduate Initiate and an Intern Scheme for Health Support Staff.  The Nurse Graduate Initiative enables the health services to offer 1,000 graduate nurses positions for two years, at a time when job opportunities in the public service are very limited.  Therefore it supports the retention of recently qualified graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system and enables them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation.  To date 77 staff nurse\/midwife graduates have commenced employment in HSE South, 256 nationally.<\/p><p>  There is a global demand for nurses and that they are a mobile workforce. A range of factors, including opportunities to gain further experience, the levels of pay available, working conditions generally and other economic factors and social conditions in different countries influence decisions to move abroad.

This is a national system which monitors the occurrence of deliberate self-harm presenting to hospital Emergency Departments.  The NSRF compiles and publishes data on the incidence of deliberate self harm an annual basis.  Data on the reasons behind the presentation of deliberate self-harm is not collected. <\/p><p>  A Child and Adolescent Self-Harm in Europe (CASE) study which was carried out in Ireland and in six other centres in Europe and Australia aimed to establish the prevalence and correlates of self-harm among adolescents aged 15-17 years.  The study found that the common factors significantly associated with self-harm among young boys and girls in Ireland were having a friend who engaged in self-harm and drug use.  Among girls, having lower self-esteem experiencing problems making friends or keeping friends and conflict with parents were also associated with deliberate self-harm.  Having a family member who had engaged in deliberate self-harm and experience of forced sexual activity were also significant for girls.<\/p><p>  Deliberate self-harm in boys was significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety and impulsivity, problems with schoolwork and having experienced bullying at school.  Among boys who had experienced bullying, other factors increasing the risk of self-harm included worries about sexual orientation, physical abuse, and problems with school work.  Risk of lifetime self-harm was four times higher for boys who experienced bullying in school.<\/p><p>  Drawing from the CASE study data from the seven countries, Madge at al (2011), found that there was a weak association between being bullied and deliberate self-harm.  The researchers concluded that there is no single pattern of self-harm among young people, but both psychological characteristics and stressful life events substantially increase risk.  The NOSP is currently funding a literature review to examine the prevalence and impact of cyber bulling on mental health and suicidal behaviour.  This literature review addresses Action 11 of the Department of Education and Skills <i>Action Plan on Bullying<\/i> (2013).  The literature seems to suggest that cyber bullying alone does not lead to deliberate self-harm or suicidal ideation, but cyber bullying may increase depression in young people, and thereby exacerbate vulnerabilities which increase the risk of deliberate self-harm and suicidal ideation.

Headway provides a range of services to people with acquired brain injury (16 - 65 years), including day services, a psychology and social work service, community integration programmes, supported employment, family support and rehabilitation training programmes.<\/p><p>  Neuro-rehabilitation services for children are provided by the HSE or by the non-statutory sector acting in partnership with the HSE.
