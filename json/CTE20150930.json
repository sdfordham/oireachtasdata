We just had a discussion, which delayed us a little, about the nature and structure of the whole system under consideration here.  I think there is general frustration among the members of the committee with the way the performance indicators, as they are currently outlined, work - or do not work.<\/p> <p>  Due to the limited time, rather than go into session 1 we will move straight to part 2, the opening statement from the Minister.  At the end of the meeting, the committee will make a report on the outcome of the deliberations and lay it before both Houses, as well as circulating it to the working group of chairmen.  We would like to see if we can find a way for the Departments, the committee secretariat and the liaison group to come up with a more workable formula.  We have been shown a model based on the New Zealand model, which may represent best practice.  Perhaps that could be further developed.<\/p> <p>  As it is, there is frustration with how the indicators are laid out.  For example, the projections mention Origin Green, but it is not clear how that manifests itself as a benefit to the Department.  Bord Bia takes care of it.  Will it result in a better outcome for the agri-sector?  In the same way, the enactment of the consumer and competition Bill is mentioned, although this Department is not directly responsible for it.  At the same time, it is clear that, if implemented and enforced, the Bill would give tools to the relevant authority which should benefit the agriculture sector.  When a target is given without explanation, it seems a little bit vague and people have to pick up on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015093000002#C00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1443607200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Can I respond to some of those claims?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015093000002#D00100","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1443607200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015093000002#D00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1443607200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>We have looked at the criticisms.

We have used the committee system to introduce better performance measurement and management tools in order to ensure there is more transparency around how Departments perform.  Their performance can be tested in committee.  This committee's secretariat has done a good job by putting a paper together which contains constructive criticism.  It deals with the Department's measurements and its internal processes, but claims that the generalised statements do not give committees enough details to get stuck into in terms of compiling questions.  I accept that claim to a certain extent.  It is important that we respond to some of the criticisms.  People now apply the New Zealand model to what happens in Ireland.  People want to know why we cannot do things like New Zealand.  There are a lot of good things in the New Zealand model, but that country faces different challenges from Ireland.  For example, half of the expenditure that comes through my Department is EU money, and there is a whole series of requirements to go along with that funding, such as inspections and audit systems.  Ireland is assessed regularly throughout the year, in a very detailed way, by the European Commission.  It ensures that our systems are robust, analyses how we spend the money and assesses whether we get value for money.  If we fail in any of those measurements we get significant disallowances.  New Zealand faces none of that because it does not have a Common Agricultural Policy.<\/p> <p>  A big part of our performance indicators are audited by the European Commission, which spends well over &euro;1 billion through my Department each year.  There are very tight control and monitoring systems that we are obliged, through the legal regulations of CAP, to deliver on, and we cannot just ignore all of that.  When we talk about a wish to deliver control and inspection programmes to underpin the protection of funds and their timely delivery, the committee secretariat says that is an example of our supplying information that is vague or is not definitive in terms of targets.  The targets that are set for us have been set down in regulations and they are absolutely definitive.  The Department is not perfect but there are a lot of good things happenings, in terms of performance indicators, that we need to apply, particularly with regard to EU moneys that are spent.<\/p> <p>  There is no other Department - apart perhaps from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, through its Action Plan for Jobs programme - that is more focused on long-term and medium-term target setting, delivering on these targets in terms of deliverables and recommendations, and measuring them on a monthly, never mind an annual basis, than the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p> <p>  Every year my Department publishes a report entitled Milestones for Success.  Earlier, the Chairman mentioned Origin Green and the sustainability journey.  My Department writes a full report every year which, to my knowledge, has never been debated by this committee.  That situation is a reflection on us.  Perhaps we should have brought it in here.  The Milestones for Success reports are published every year; they are in the media every year, and we launch them.  A huge amount of work goes into compiling them.  It is a fair criticism by the committee that we have not debated those reports here, because they are actual deliverables that we need to get across the line, and those in the industry are involved in that as well.  <\/p> <p>  We have a plan, Food Harvest 2020, that was put together by the last government, to its credit, which contains 215 recommendations that needed to be acted upon and completed.  There is now a report that measures our outputs in terms of those recommendations.  I do not see the same thing happening in New Zealand.  We now have a Food Wise 2025 programme which has 386 recommendations.  I chair a monthly meeting with all of the stakeholders, which included, in the past, an implementation group for Food Harvest and now includes the same for Food Wise.  We had a meeting this morning where we went through the recommendations and identified who was responsible for all of them.  Four key agencies are responsible: BIM, Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland.  As chairman of the stakeholders' group, I point the figure and say to people, \"Who takes responsibility for X, Y and Z?\".  I ask when will they be delivered on and say, \"Let us assess as we go along.\"  To be fair, this committee should be involved in some of those discussions a little bit more than heretofore.   I accept the criticism, if it is one, that we have not been more open about setting targets.  There are 23 items in an Action Plan for Jobs that we need to finalise.  I can assure the committee that the Taoiseach will point his finger at me if we do not get those things done.<\/p> <p>  I accept that we can improve.  I accept that we need lean management systems across all Departments which insist on continuous improvement and allow committees such as this one to benchmark performance, under whatever performance indicators we agree on, so that we can show we are improving year on year.  If we do not improve then the committee must ask us hard questions that we must answer.  <\/p> <p>  The suggestion that we have tried to avoid setting targets and deliverables is an unfair criticism.  It may be a fair criticism to claim that we have not introduced targets and deliverables to the discussions that we are having with the committee.  I am anxious to work with the committee on this matter.  If we can improve how the Department measures its output, I am confident that we will score pretty well.  The New Zealand model is relevant and there are elements of it that we should do more of here.  We have also done other things very well, and we should not pretend that has not happened.  That is the only comment I want to make on the matter.  I am open to making the Secretary General and anyone else in my Department available to the committee and its secretariat so that we can all work together to improve things for next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015093000002#D00700","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1443607200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The debate we had was not about the total amount of information that the Department gives to Europe or the amount of information that it gives in public documentation.

It is unreasonable for the Department to expect Deputies and Senators to get all of this information from all the various documents and create a parallel set of indicators.  From what the Minister has said, the Department has much more definitive indicators in all sorts of other accountancy systems, but it shares them with the Oireachtas in a direct manner.

I am very pleased to accept the committee's invitation to this hearing.  This is a valuable opportunity to review how we are progressing with the various challenges and opportunities presented across the various sectors in agriculture, food development, marine and forestry and to talk about market prospects across these areas and new investment opportunities for the coming year.<\/p><p>The agrifood sector continues to play a considerable role in our economic recovery.  The sector remains Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry and accounts for almost one in nine jobs, many in rural and coastal areas where few other employment opportunities exist.  Earlier this year Bord Bia confirmed a fifth consecutive year of growth in agrifood exports.  The value of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink exports grew by some 4% during 2014 and reached almost &euro;10.5 billion, which is another all-time high.  That is some &euro;3.2 billion higher than in 2009, representing an increase of more than 45% in that period.<\/p><p>In July the Taoiseach launched a very important plan for a new ten-year strategy for the agrifood sector, aptly named Food Wise 2025.  Food Wise 2025 predicts that over the next decade Ireland can: increase the value of agrifood exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increase value added to the sector by 70% to &euro;13 billion; and increase the value of primary production by 65% to &euro;10 billion.  This should deliver a further 23,000 jobs in the agrifood sector by 2025 and will present many challenges for us to face.  I think that prediction of 23,000 jobs is quite conservative.<\/p><p>In April this year the milk quota system ended and opened up opportunities and sustainable growth for the dairy sector for the years ahead.  Nationally, we can conservatively predict that the next five years of dairy expansion will deliver approximately 10,000 new jobs across rural Ireland.  Ireland&rsquo;s plan for a 50% increase in milk volume in five years is unmatched in the EU; other member states expect no more than 20% extra milk.  Almost simultaneously with the ending of the quotas, a number of factors, including a Russian ban, reduced demand for dairy product and increased stocks and production in China have resulted in significant downward pressure on dairy prices.  I think we are all familiar with that.  This is putting significant pressure on farmers.  It is a global issue but it is also very much an Irish issue and it is not possible to address to it in isolation here in Ireland.  I am engaging on a continuous basis with EU counterparts and the Commission to ensure that every possible measure is taken at EU level to mitigate the effects of the current situation.  <\/p><p>The key measure recently given effect by the Commission is the facilitation of advance payments of 70% under the direct payments scheme and 85% for rural development schemes before completion of controls.  In other words, &euro;750 million will given out next month on 16 October, which would not, or certainly that amount of money would not, have been given out but for that advance payment.  This will be of significant benefit in terms of easing the cashflow of farmers. <\/p><p>Furthermore, the European Commission announced earlier this month that it is providing a &euro;420 million direct aid package for European farmers.  Ireland&rsquo;s share of this fund will amount to just under &euro;14 million.  Among other measures announced, the increase of more than 100% in the rate of private storage aid for skimmed milk powder is very significant, as well as storage aid for cheese.  We had our first meeting of the dairy forum yesterday and I was very blunt and forthright with the farming organisations in terms of trying to get some feedback from them as to how they wanted us to spend that direct income support for farmers.  I agree with them that we should look at basing our distribution model on flat-rate payments, which, I think, will positively discriminate in favour of smaller farmers.  That would be a good thing to do.  It is not a huge amount of money but it will help cashflow for many dairy farm families.  We need to separately allocate some money for the pig sector as well and we will probably give some priority to young farmers by way of some percentage top-up in terms of those flat-rate payments as well.  I would be interested in people's views on that approach.  We have not finalised any decisions.<\/p><p>I can assure members that I will continue to work with the industry, other member states and farming organisations to consider how we can refine and improve mechanisms to help farmers to cope with downward price cycles when they arise.  We spent a good deal of time yesterday talking about price volatility.<\/p><p>Today&rsquo;s meeting will allow us to look back over the year to date, look at the remainder of the year and, as we are now close to budget 2016, it will allow me to get some feedback from the members and to take questions from them in that regard.  In the financial data we have supplied, we have tried to tie the financials and the outputs together in the briefing and I am happy to elaborate on any elements the members may wish to discuss.  This year the Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department amounted to &euro;1.26 billion, &euro;1.044 billion in current expenditure<b><\/b>and &euro;216 million capital expenditure<b>.<\/b>This represents an overall increase of &euro;41 million over last year&rsquo;s figures and is the first time my Department&rsquo;s budget has increased since 2009.  Expenditure so far this year is in line with profiles and it is expected that this will continue over the remaining quarter.<\/p><p>My overarching priority for 2015 has been to deliver the first part of the Government&rsquo;s commitments to the farming and fishing sectors in the commencement of actions under the new rural development and seafood development programmes.  These supports prioritise vulnerable sectors and support the incomes of family farms.  Overall, I secured &euro;439 million for investment in the rural development programme, up from &euro;405 million in 2014.  Schemes under the new rural development scheme, including the green low-carbon argi-environment scheme, GLAS, the beef data and genomics scheme, TAMS II and areas of natural constraint, ANC, are up and running, and I am pleased that, despite an additional two weeks allowed for application, &euro;114 million of ANC payments issued to farmers last week.<\/p><p>Next month will see payments under agri-environment schemes begin to issue.  This year &euro;155 million worth of payments will issue to 17,000 rural environment protection scheme farmers, closing out that important scheme, 19,000 farmers under the agri-environment options scheme and to up to 26,000 farmers under the new GLAS.  This scheme, when fully open, will support up to 50,000 farmers and require funding of &euro;250 million.  It will build on the success of these earlier programmes and encourage farmers to farm in an environmentally friendly manner.<\/p><p>The total allocation for the various on-farm schemes planned under TAMS II is &euro;395 million over the course of the rural development programme.  For 2015, I allocated &euro;34 million of grants under TAMS, which represents a 100% increase on the 2014 budget.  This provides for final payments on TAMS I, new schemes under TAMS II as well as a new farm safety scheme, which, unfortunately, we are reminded again today is extremely important.  I recently extended the period for receipt of applications under TAMS I and the farm safety scheme by two weeks and I am pleased that this additional period of time allowed many farmers to submit applications for finished projects.  Officials in my Department are working on those applications now with a view to processing payments for issue over the coming months.<\/p><p>In August I announced the opening of a new TAMS II scheme for pig and poultry investments and recently opened two more new TAMS II schemes.  One is the animal welfare, safety and nutrient storage scheme and the second one is the low emission slurry spreading scheme, or LESS as it is known now.  The benefits of the schemes range from the construction of new animal housing, the provision of nutrient storage facilities and the ever important safety elements to a more sustainably-friendly approach to the spreading of slurry, with knock-on benefits for Ireland&rsquo;s ammonia and climate targets. <\/p><p>As members will know, 2014 was a year when tragedy struck too many Irish farm families.  Conscious of the loss of life and injuries sustained on farms in recent years, particularly during 2014, I opened a farm safety scheme in October of last year.  Following on from the demand from the farm safety scheme, which saw applications from over 6,000 farmers, I was pleased to be able to relaunch the safety component of this new scheme - the animal welfare, safety and nutrient storage scheme.  This will give all farmers an opportunity to assess what can be done on their farms to improve safety and save lives, we hope, on family farms.  I am determined to do everything possible to reduce the tragic accidents that we have seen on farms, particularly in the past 18 months or so.  Unfortunately, I think, the figure so far this year is 14.<\/p><p>There is a family grieving as we speak.  <\/p><p> As the beef industry experienced a very difficult year in 2014 I was conscious of the need to give particular priority to providing the level of support that can contribute to restoring confidence in the sector.  I was pleased that we were in a position to fund support measures worth in excess of &euro;83 million.  The cornerstone of this support package is a significant increase in the funding allocated to the new beef data and genomics programme from &euro;23 million to &euro;52 million.  This 126% increase will place Ireland at the international forefront of genetic improvement in beef and will make an important contribution to improving the carbon efficiency of Irish production.  Payments under this scheme will issue to participating farmers later this this year.  There are just under 30,000 farmers in that scheme.  <\/p><p> I also prioritised innovation as part of the smart agenda through a substantial fund for research and development and training amounting to &euro;28 million under FIRM, Stimulus and forestry funds and Teagasc training courses.  The new call for research proposals will shortly issue.<\/p><p> The allocation of almost &euro;147 million for Ireland under the new European maritime and fisheries fund is significant for the sector.  In aggregate terms this represents a doubling of Ireland's allocation of EU funds relative to our allocations under the former European fisheries and EU financial instruments for sea fisheries control and data collection.  <\/p><p> The Department has prepared a new operational programme in consultation with the industry which has been submitted for approval by the European Commission.  The new and substantially improved allocation of funds, combined with more than &euro;90 million of national co-funding, will enable me to launch new schemes under the seafood development programme aimed at driving investment in fisheries and seafood development to 2020 and securing the future of the marine sector.  <\/p><p> Taking account of the fact that the Irish bloodstock industry is of enormous economic benefit to this country - we saw that in terms of sales yesterday - I increased State support for the horse and greyhound industry by &euro;14 million to &euro;68 million last year.  It has been estimated that the industry provides in excess of 14,000 jobs, approximately &euro;1.1 billion in economic output and is responsible for exports worth in excess of &euro;200 million.  The increase in State support for both industries is a recognition of a significant shortfall in funding going into the horse and greyhound sectors in recent years as a result of a downturn in the economy.<\/p><p> Budget 2015 saw a suite of taxation measures designed to support modernisation, restructuring and the promotion of growth and expansion.   The tax package which was worth about &euro;300 million to the farming community, was largely negotiated and put in place by the person on my left, who did a fantastic job on it with the Department of Finance.  Overall, 2015 has been a challenging year.  We have had to develop and launch the new basic payment scheme which will see some &euro;1.2 billion of funding issued to Irish farmers, 70% of this will be issued in mid-October, recognising the difficulties farmers are currently experiencing.  Many countries in the European Union cannot make those advance payments because they do not have the systems in place to do that on time.  It is a recognition of how robust our systems are that with a few weeks notice a decision can be made for 70% advance payment and we can make it happen.  I hope we will deliver that on time with the full amount of money involved. <\/p><p> We have also had to develop and open new schemes under the rural development programme.  Opportunities following the abolition of quotas were undermined by the downturn in world demand for dairy and the Russian trade embargo and have required a swift EU response to put in place supports.  I remain confident in the future for dairy in Ireland in the medium to long term.  We are already seeing signals that the market is starting to turn.<\/p><p> The Government remains committed to agriculture and the marine sectors.  I am determined through the Department's initiatives, schemes and programmes to continue to support and develop these important pillars of Irish society and of the Irish economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015093000002#G00100","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443607200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The Minister said the value of Ireland's food and drink exports grew by 4% during 2014 and was &euro;3.2 billion higher than 2009.  Perhaps he would develop on that theme.  Was that caused by volume or price increases?  The second issue is germane to this debate.  What policy decisions, particularly those in regard to expenditure, had most effect in increasing the value?  If we knew that, we could then put more money towards those particular policies.  The Minister mentioned a massive increase in dairying, 50% in volume.  Will this be achieved by getting more milk from the same number of hectares or by people swapping land usage to dairying from other farming activities?  Has any analysis been carried out by the Department on the possible impact of this on other sectors of the farming economy?  The upside is obvious but the downside needs to be looked at if there is to be a massive shift of land usage.  Given that 85% of rural development schemes are being paid out this year, will that affect the Estimates with 100% of the money on the RDP being paid between now and the end of the year?  I have one other question.  An interesting document was published yesterday, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021.

I anticipate that will be ironed out and the revenue issues will be sorted so that the Teagasc personnel are not put at a disadvantage.<\/p> <p>  I am unequivocal in my support for the beef data genomics programme.  It is absolutely critical to the beef industry.  Some time ago the Minister indicated that he would meet the farm organisations.  Perhaps he and his officials would meet the farm organisation to iron out some teething problems.  Clarification is required.  One hears daily about people wanting to leave the scheme, but that is foolhardy and I urge them to reconsider and stay within the scheme.  I see significant potential in that scheme.  It is important that the Minister goes into a room with the farm organisations and clarifies matters for them.<\/p> <p>  The comprehensive review of agri-taxation issues is worth &euro;300 million a year.  This is very welcome.  This is targeted to increase land mobility and restructuring.  Farmers like many who are self employed are being treated inequitably in the taxation system, because a self employed person is entitled to a self employed income tax credit equivalent to that available to the PAYE sector.  I ask the Minister to beseech his colleagues, the Minister for Finance to ensure that it is given to self employed and farmers in particular.  It is very important to bring equity and equality within the taxation treatment of individuals.  Farmers are no different and it would be very important to them, especially for farmers on low incomes.<\/p> <p>  There is the issue of income averaging in terms of those who derive an income from forestry.

We have increased our exports to France by 21%; to the Netherlands by 43%; to Germany by 34%; to Belgium by 23%; to Sweden by 15%; to Denmark by 43%; and to Poland by 72%.  One or two member states, Italy and Spain are down a bit in value.  The growth in food export to the UK is up by 24% in value.  One the things that is really adding to our numbers this year, despite the fact that dairy prices are down, and dairy is the most valuable export followed very tightly by beef, is the exchange rates.  When sterling is as strong as it is against the euro, it makes Irish product very good value in terms of competitiveness.  One will see many of our suppliers into UK retailers will be upping their numbers and having very strong years even though the price in sterling might not have changed hugely the exchange rate has changed and therefore Irish companies are much more competitive versus their counterparts either north of the Border or in the UK.<\/p> <p>  The market to Africa has grown by 46%, America is up 36%, Asia is up 122% driven by China.  To be honest dairy exports to China have gone from roughly &euro;60 million to nearly &euro;400 million in that period, mainly around infant formula.<\/p><p>Even though China is buying much less powder this year, it is probably buying more volume from Ireland this year than last year because we have helped to insulate ourselves from the trade in basic powders by having much more infant formula from companies like Wyeth, Abbott, and Danone, and new commercial propositions like the partnership between Beingmate and Kerry Group, producing product for the Chinese market in Charleville.  This is a direct dividend for a rural town like Charleville, producing a product for the Chinese market, a very high-end, valuable market, selling for about $45 a tin or such like.  It is a good example of how a rural community can benefit from a growing market.<br\/><br\/>Some people think about China and they just think about the big companies.  There is a reason we are seeing &euro;120 million being spent on dairy-drying facilities in Mallow, while near Waterford Port<font color=\"#FF0000\"><\/font>we are seeing nearly &euro;200 million, in Charleville &euro;50 million, and another &euro;40 million in Mitchelstown.  All of these rural economic drivers are built on the back of these markets.  The direct question Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked was whether this was driven by value or volume.  It is driven mainly by value.

There have been dramatic increases in volume in whiskey, for example.  Some 6 million cases of Irish whiskey are now sold.  Four or five years ago that figure would probably have been 3 million.  They plan to double volume again by 2020 and again by 2030.<\/p> <p>  It is a mixture across multiple sectors of more volume, more value, more premiumisation, and these factors are helped in some sectors by either currency exchange rates or increased commodity prices globally.  We have had the downside of commodity prices too, particularly in the grain sector and obviously this year in terms of dairy.  Our expenditure on R&amp;D and innovation is very important In terms of getting a dividend from increased exports.  The latest call we had, which was &euro;28 million around research projects, is driving a reputation in Ireland now for innovation in the food and drink sector, which is helpful.  That is one of the reasons Kerry Group will open its global food innovation centre tomorrow.  When that is fully up and running, it will have 900 people, mostly postgrads, designing the foods of the future, adding value to raw material in Ireland.  That is what is driving growth.  The supports we spend on Irish family farms to keep them in business through good times and bad are also critical.  If we do not have the raw material coming from family farms and if they are not making money out of producing that raw material, then we cannot have the basis for the export growth and value added that we talk about.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the rural development programme advance payments, there is no issue with direct payments.

That is the estimate we have.  In other words, we can improve the yield per cow significantly.  Many NGOs, in particular, that talk about concerns around emissions and climate change miss this point.  The Irish dairy herd can produce much more milk and reduce the emissions intensity of that milk production because the same cow of the same age will be producing more milk by better grazing management, better feed conversion efficiency and so on.  We are putting a great deal of research into that.<\/p> <p>  There will undoubtedly also be an increase in the herd size between now and 2020.  We think this will be about an extra 300,000 animals.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I think those are the figures.  Obviously some more land will be needed for that, but there is a great deal of land in Ireland that is under-utilised in terms of stocking rate and with improved efficiency and better grazing management, many dairy farmers will be able to expand their output without requiring a lot more land.  Certainly there will be more competition for land among dairy farmers.  That is true.  We are not predicting a significant reduction, for example, in beef output as regards suckler beef on the back of that.  What we will see now is a more focused look at how we use agricultural land more efficiently and more sustainably.  In all of our counties there are good examples of farms that could be more efficient and getting more young farmers into farming will help on that journey in terms of applying a more science-based approach to production.<\/p> <p>  There will be an increased herd size.  We have already seen that in terms of the calving numbers this year, which are strong, and we have seen about a 12% increase in output of milk.  We have probably had the best grass growth this year that we have ever had.  If one speaks to the co-ops, as we did yesterday, at the moment dairy farmers are getting very strong bonuses in terms of quality in milk components, which is helping with the difficulty as regards base price.<\/p> <p>  There will be advance payments on GLAS and organics.  What we had planned was &euro;20 million on GLAS and &euro;10 million on organics.  We are now trying to plan &euro;22 million on GLAS and &euro;11.5 million on organics, which would be an 85% advance payment rather than a 75% advance payment.

We have an agreed capital figure for 2016, which is &euro;217 million.  That is enough for us to do all the things that we are promising to do for next year.  We then attempted to put numbers in terms of capital expenditure, linked to forestry; to the rural development programme, mainly TAMS; and to the capital expenditure we will need, for example, in fishery harbours and so on.  We tried to put that profiling right up until 2021, but it was proving almost impossible to do that and get agreement on it because many of these schemes are demand-led.<\/p><p>Farmers approved for TAMS have two years to spend the money and they decide when they spend it.  It is not like building roads, where the State can plan for expenditure depending on how much money it has.  Essentially, we have agreed a baseline figure through to 2020.  Incidentally, 2021 will be a new Common Agricultural Policy year so who knows what money will be available then.<\/p><p> We have agreed a baseline figure of &euro;208 million, which is a significant increase on what was spent up to this year, and we have agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that we will add to that baseline figure annually taking account of what is likely to be spent year on year, which will be significantly more than &euro;208 million in most years between now and 2020, to accommodate the commitments under the rural development programme, the forestry programme, the seafood development programme and so forth.  For the first time in a Government-published document there is a full commitment from the Government to plan and estimate for the full delivery of the rural development programme by 2020.  I am very happy with the outcome there.  We have agreed the figure to be spent next year and a baseline figure after that, with very strong wording that states those figures will be topped up to accommodate the expenditure profile of the RDP as it rolls out.

We will spend &euro;20 million on GLAS this year.  There will be 26,000 farmers in GLAS.  We will open a second round of GLAS for applications starting, hopefully, in the week of 12 October.  We will accept another 10,000 or so.  They will start their membership of GLAS from 1 January next and they will be paid next year.  There will be approximately 36,000 farmers in GLAS.<\/p> <p>  We are moving towards the 50,000 figure.  Some people would like us to take in more than 10,000 this time but we must be responsible in scaling up GLAS.  We cannot spend &euro;250 million on GLAS next year.  I would love to be able to do it, but we cannot.  We never said we would be able to do that.  We said we would accept as many farmers as we could from the first day and 26,000 was far more than most people were seeking when it was being designed.  To have 36,000 in it by the end of the first year is not a bad performance.  We will take in the other 15,000 as soon as we can afford to commit the full &euro;0.25 billion a year that will be spent on GLAS.  It will be done as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  A number of members asked about beef genomics.  We are setting up a working group and the farming organisations will be included in it.  When the beef genomics scheme was launched there were concerns that it was too complicated and unworkable.  To be honest, the Department should have done more in terms of information meetings at that point.  We have tried to make up for that by holding those meetings in different parts of the country and we will do more of that.  Many people have been reassured about beef genomics.  I attended a number of public meetings and there was talk that there would be a mass exodus from the programme and that there would be no more than 5,000 farmers in it.  There are almost 30,000 farmers in the programme.  A small number of farmers decided to pull out for their own reasons, but the vast majority of people are staying in beef genomics and are now talking it up.<\/p> <p>  We have written to everybody in the scheme to give them a detailed outline of how it will work.  The Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, has given farmers information on qualification criteria, and 90% of the farmers in the scheme are already at a star rating in their herds that they are required to reach by 2018-19.  They are at that point now.  It is about bringing the other 10% up to that standard in the next few years by improving the information they have about breeding, linked to both performance data and the DNA of their herds.  In time, the beef genomics scheme will be one of the most innovative schemes ever introduced as part of a rural development programme.  Of course, there are challenges at the start to ensure that people understand what is required of them.  The farming organisations have been involved in that.  They are not shy about telling me when there are problems.  There will be a mid-term review of the scheme at the end of next year and if there are problems and changes are required, we will make the changes.  I have said that previously.  We are trying to help farmers with this, not catch them out.  I believe beef genomics will be a big success.  We have tied up a large amount of money in it, so it must be.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Penrose asked many questions.  I answered the question about GLAS and the &euro;250 million.  We will reach that as soon as possible, but it will not be next year.  Expenditure on TAMS will be &euro;34 million this year.  Next year it will be much more.  Expenditure on TAMS has proven remarkably difficult to estimate.  There will be less spent this year than we were expecting.<\/p><p>We will need to reallocate some of that money to make sure we get the expenditure, and we need to carry over some of the money into next year because the TAMS bills will keep on coming.  They do not respect calendar years.<\/p><p> On knowledge transfer schemes, some of the Teagasc advisers have a concern that there may be a tax liability with regard to the form of payment that is being proposed for them as individuals.  We need to address that issue with the Revenue Commissioners.  It is a question of making sure they are paid through the Teagasc infrastructure.  When I read this story it was the first time I had come across it, but I will do my best to address it.<\/p><p> The working group on beef data will very much involve the farming organisations, who asked for that and will get it.  On land mobility, one of the great successes that has been quietly happening in agriculture is the move away from conacre towards long-term leasing since we made the tax changes to encourage that over the past couple of years.  The increase in the numbers of farmers in long-term leasing is significantly up, maybe by 27%, and we need to keep pushing it because for young farmers to get a piece of land for 11 months is a disaster on lots of levels, especially when it comes to borrowing money on the back of it and investing in the soil in a field if they do not know they are going to have it the following year.  We need to get long-term leasing in place, and it is starting to work.<\/p><p> Self-employed tax credits are a matter for Deputy Michael Noonan.  I am always supportive of farmers and try to help their income levels.  We have a very able team of people negotiating with the Department of Finance, and they got a great result last year.  The conversation is continuing this year so we will hopefully get a good result in a few weeks' time.  <\/p><p> There is no commitment from the Department of Finance on income averaging in forestry.  I would like it to consider this, and it was very much part of discussions between our Department and the Department of Finance last year in the build-up to the budget, as it has continued to be.  If there is no income averaging for people in forestry, they will cut a certain amount of trees up until the threshold where taxation kicks in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015093000002#L02500","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443607200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>That is right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015093000002#M00200","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1443607200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>They will harvest maybe 70 acres of trees but leave the rest of the plantation, so that we have piecemeal harvesting of trees as opposed to being able to clean out 200 or 300 acres, if it makes sense to do that in one year, and averaging the income over four or five years to take into account the taxation treatment.  There is real frustration in the forestry sector on this issue.  To be fair to the Department of Finance, it has been unbelievably accommodating on issues we have raised with them, the proof of that being in the past number of years.  There are issues relating to this particular request, but we will keep working with the Department of Finance until the budget.

Deputy Heydon asked about the beef scheme.  The irony of the beef genomics scheme is that a lot of farmers who decided, for whatever reason, that they did not want to get into it now want to get into it.  If we are not spending the full amount that we anticipated we would spend - and we may be slightly under that this year - we will, of course, look to let more people in, but the rural development programme only has a set amount for the beef genomics scheme and we cannot spend more than that.  There are issues around young farmers who are starting out and who may want to come into the beef genomics scheme late, having not been in farming at the start of the scheme.  We need to prioritise them, but we will keep it under review with the working group and we will see how we can make sure we spend the full allocation.  If that means letting more people in late, we can look at that, though it is not that easy to do, as one signs up for a certain number of years.  If everybody in the scheme has signed up for five years and we take people in late there are knock-on problems because the scheme then goes beyond the lifetime of the current scheme into the next rural development programme into the 2020s.  Late applicants are a headache for the purposes of managing the scheme, but we will look at making exceptions and showing flexibility where we are allowed to do so by the Commission.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate Senator O'Brien on the growth of her own company.

That is an indication of what is happening in the small foods sector.  Some of them are not small any more but are very much medium-sized companies with big growth plans.  We have not seen too many Irish food companies go from medium to big in the past ten years, even in this growth period.  There are glass ceilings that are very difficult to break through in terms of funding and the ability to put infrastructure in place to become the next Glanbia, Kerry Group or Greencore.

I am hugely frustrated by commentary we sometimes get across mainstream media platforms about agriculture being the big problem, which neglects to mention that Ireland is probably doing more in terms of climate change in agriculture than any other country in the world right now.  Some 46,000 beef farms in Ireland are currently measuring carbon footprints in their herds with a carbon calculator.  No other country in the world is even talking about that but we are doing it.  All 17,000 of our dairy farmers have signed up, through their farming organisations, to a dairy sustainability scheme, for which they are not being paid.  Virtually all of our food companies are either in Origin Green or have signed up to Origin Green.  We are focusing on output and adding value but also on a sustainability journey that is measured and benchmarked as we go.  It would be great if the committee focused on some of that to raise awareness of it, perhaps by bringing in some NGOs to talk about it.<\/p><p>The idea that Ireland needs to reduce its carbon footprint by simply producing less does not make sense from either a climate change or an economic perspective.  On disease, we had a big step forward in relation to brucellosis recently when Northern Ireland achieved brucellosis-free status the week before the ploughing championships.  We have managed now to do away with pre-movement testing of animals, which is great news for farmers North and South of the Border on a practical level.  I acknowledge that there is a particular TB problem in Wicklow, which we think is linked to deer or badgers.  The herd has a TB incidence of 4.92%, which is down from a high of 15.72% in 2010, but there is still an issue in Wicklow, which we need to keep working on.  There has been huge progress in the number of reactors per thousand animals tested, which is now down to 5.19 from 8.85 in 2014.  That is in Wicklow east.  While there is a problem, there has also been a significant improvement in the numbers there.  I think I have answered everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015093000002#M01000","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443607200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I have a comment on land leasing which occurs to me and which I may have mentioned already to the Minister.  Some of those involved with the farm managers and Macra na Feirme approached me at the National Ploughing Championship and said that while the &euro;40,000 upper limit is very good and helpful, there is an issue whereby young farmers are getting a 25% top-up as more of the money is being extracted in the lease.  It was suggested that a maximum per acre should be applied as a control.  In other words, one would get up to &euro;40,000 tax-free for a long-term lease, but, taking a figure of &euro;200 per acre, the rest is taxable.  I imagine if that could be implemented, the Revenue Commissioners would love it.  I am not sure it can be.  However, it puts a brake on the price increase, especially as it applies to young farmers who landowners will know are in receipt of top-up payments.  It is the opposite of what we usually look for.  We are looking for a control measure here to aid young farmers.  It is something that should be discussed with Macra and farm managers in particular.

They asked me at the ploughing championships whether, over a certain amount per acre of spend, one would not provide a tax break in order to keep prices down a bit.  One is kind of moving into the territory of price fixing in that case, which sometimes has knock-on consequences in terms of the availability of land.  The most important thing here is that as much land is available for lease as possible.  We do not want any disincentive to landowners in respect of making land available for lease.  If we start to control prices and change the incentive, thereby reducing the amount of land available, we will be in a dangerous circle of having less land, thereby driving the price up even more, and trying to force it down through tax measures.  We will look at it, but that proposal is a double-edged sword.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015093000002#N00300","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1443607200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>What the Minister could do is say the tax relief is only on X amount per hectare.

As you said, Chairman, I will speak about the performance information first.  The committee is considering the performance information that is included in the Revised Estimates volume for education and how that information might be improved to better assist the committee in performing its financial oversight role.  This relates to the various output targets that are listed for each of the four high-level programme goals for my Department, together with various indicators of performance.<\/p> <p>  My officials have over the past few months been working closely with staff of the Oireachtas service and staff of the committee in this area, with a view to improving the type of output and target information that is presented in the Estimates.  Some progress has already been made.  That is to be welcomed and it will, hopefully, be reflected in the targets to be included in the Estimate for 2016.<\/p> <p>  My Department does agree that the guidance on setting performance targets, issued by the New Zealand Auditor General, can assist the efforts to improve the performance-based information included with the Estimates for the Department.  We are happy to continue to work with the committee in this regard.  We consider that this engagement would also include the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which publishes the Revised Estimates volume, and whose input would also be very important in this context.  It was that Department which facilitated the introduction a few years ago of the new performance budgeting approach to the production of departmental Estimates.  Performance budgeting essentially introduced the concept of including performance-related information directly into Departments' Estimates, whereas before this performance information existed separately to the Estimate.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is, I understand, also currently considering how the format of the 2016 Estimates might be improved.  My Department also believes that some of the other benchmark and guidance material that informed the introduction of performance budgeting, including material from the European Union and OECD, should also inform this new process.<\/p> <p>  I am confident that co-operation in this area between line Departments, the Oireachtas service and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will over time lead to improvements in the targets and outputs presented with the Estimates.  There will be issues and challenges to address here, but I believe that they can be resolved through the adoption of a reasonable and pragmatic approach on all parts.  Some of the issues have already been encountered in the engagements of the past few months and some are alluded to in the briefing material produced for committee members today.  They include such issues as: deciding whether certain output material in the Estimate should continue to be included, even though it might not meet all of the criteria set out in the New Zealand guidance.  This would relate, for example, to important structural changes made in Departments to allow them to better deliver their services, but which might be regarded under the New Zealand guidance as being more in the nature of internal processes.  I refer to such matters as the reform in the vocational education committees, VECs, coming together as education and training boards, ETBs, and the reform in the further education and training sector; dealing with situations where information on performance is not available on an annual basis.  This would be the case in relation to certain international surveys of education performance, such as the programme for international student assessment, PISA, survey; cases where results will only be achieved over a period of longer than one year, which is a feature of many educational programmes; cases where important education outcomes cannot be attributed to one particular activity or target.  This would be the case, for example, in relation to key indicators such as leaving certificate retention rates, or to participation rates in higher education; and how best to capitalise on the reality that Departments, in addition to the Estimates volume, use a wide range of mechanisms for reporting progress on targets and policies.<\/p> <p>  My Department, for example, has produced significant reporting outputs as part of the integrated reform delivery plan, IRDP, for the education and training sector which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and how the Estimates can accommodate the presentation of important context information in relation to education and education expenditure.  This would include key metrics such as numbers of mainstream and special needs teachers, numbers of SNAs, and numbers of schools.  As I said, however, I am confident that these and other issues arising can be satisfactorily resolved in the current process of engagement.<\/p><p>I again thank the Chairman for allowing me to make these introductory comments about this part of the meeting.

Regarding the departmental output tables, I have a question on school transport services.  I refer to the targets and outputs, items Nos. 4 and 5, the number of students provided with school transport services and the number of school transport routes.  The target and output for students provided with transport in 2013, 2014 and 2015 was 114,000.  The target for school transport routes in 2013 was 6,000 while the output was 6,500.  Given that the output was 500 more than the target, what was the situation?  In 2014, the target was 6,000 school transport routes, which was achieved, meaning there were 500 fewer routes.  The 2015 target is also 6,000.  My experience on the ground has been that the number of school transport routes has been restricted due to the changes to the minimum number of students required for a route.  The changes to the \"nearest school\" rule have also have an impact in that students can avail of transport only to their nearest school.  It has reached a pinch point this year, reducing the number of school routes.  Routes that would have previously included students who were not going to their closest school have lost students and are, therefore, being discontinued.  Could the Minister comment on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015093000002#D00300","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1443614400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>May I speak on the number of teaching posts in special schools provided?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015093000002#D00400","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1443614400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Is it related to the outcome?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015093000002#D00500","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1443614400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Yes.

I welcome what I believe the Minister said, that she would agree with working towards the New Zealand model and work with the committee to achieve it.  Does the Minister hope to get close to some of the elements of the model in the context of delivering the 2016 Estimates?  I hope so, and it would be a positive response to us.  The Minister gave examples of areas in which the model might not work for the Department.  One example was the fact that important educational outcomes cannot be attributed to one particular activity or target.  From our understanding, it would not necessarily have to be measured on one target.  In the example the Minister gave, if we are talking about leaving certificate retention rates, we would be examining where they are now, where we want them to be next year or the year after, and there would be a series of actions to achieve it.  Although the overall objective would be to achieve improvement in this area, a range of activities would be measured.  The goals would have to be specific and the outcomes measured.  This is what we want.

We want to move towards the New Zealand model as quickly as we can, and we have made progress.  As I outlined, there are constraints in that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for the design of the Estimates documentation.  There is a practical issue in that a number of measures are required to reach a particular outcome and, as members can see by the small size of the print, we are constrained by the physical space.  It is difficult to fit in all the measures designed to lead to an outcome, such as improved retention for the leaving certificate.  We need the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to be engaged in terms of the practicality of how we can present the material as clearly as possible.<\/p> <p>  In principle, we want to move as close to the New Zealand model as possible.  The programme for international student assessment, PISA, is an example of something that is measured in a different way from an international measuring system.  We must determine whether we can work out some yearly success based on a measure that is not done yearly.  If PISA results indicated we had improved literacy and numeracy levels, how could we determine how much of it happened in one particular year?  It is a practical problem.  We need to continue to work with the committee and we want to commit to this.<\/p> <p>  Senator Moloney and Deputy McConalogue's questions are related.

The Minister of State, Deputy English, and I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here.  I want to give a brief opening statement on the other element of the meeting.<\/p> <p>  For the mid-year review of 2015 expenditure, the briefing slides we have provided to the committee present the expenditure position to the middle of August 2015, together with the main components of this expenditure.  Net overall expenditure across all programme areas of &euro;5.172 billion to the end of August was running &euro;62 million behind profile, &euro;80 million behind profile on current expenditure and &euro;18 million ahead on capital expenditure.  However, as things stand, it is anticipated that towards the end of the year, expenditure will come under pressure from three main areas.  I mentioned one of them already - superannuation, where it looks like there will be in the region of 350 to 400 more teacher retirements in the year than originally provided for.  The other anticipated sources of pressure are student support payments, where demographic pressures are impacting strongly on expenditure; and expenditure on resource teachers and SNAs.  While the exact scale of these pressures is not yet known, they should be more crystallised in the coming weeks, at which stage the impact of additional students in schools and colleges will become known.  A clearer picture of the number of teacher retirements will also emerge at that stage.  However, my Department is at this time anticipating that a Supplementary Estimate will be required on the Vote.<\/p> <p>  Members will be aware of the figure of &euro;600 million to &euro;750 million indicated as being available to fund expenditure measures in the budget, including pay demands.  The determination of the overall budgetary strategy for 2016 will be finalised in Government discussions over the next fortnight.  I am, therefore, quite limited as to what I can say at this time.  However, I welcome any inputs that members may wish to make in this matter.  <\/p> <p>  The key areas of funding in the school sector include a new six-year investment programme that will fund the construction of 62,000 additional school places at primary and post-primary level to address demographic demand, as well as the completion of large-scale projects under the current programme announced in March 2012.  The ongoing delivery of these additional school places will ensure that there are sufficient school accommodation places in the education system for every child to have access to a physical school place.  Funding will also be available for the refurbishment of schools in older buildings that require improvement.  Funding for the provision of smaller-scale classroom accommodation for schools will be maintained.<\/p> <p>  The plan also includes funding for the replacement of prefabs with permanent accommodation.  Site acquisitions to facilitate the provision of new schools will continue to be funded, as will the funding of unitary charges under the public private partnership, PPP, school bundles.  The plan also provides for an important investment of &euro;210 million in IT and wireless networks in schools.<\/p> <p>  The planned total investment in the higher education sector in the period 2016 to 2021 amounts to &euro;350 million.  This figure includes direct Exchequer capital of &euro;110 million which will enable the funding of a minor works scheme.  This will enable institutes to plan for and undertake necessary improvement works, as well as commence programmes of equipment renewal, including upgrading of IT facilities.  In addition to this, there remains &euro;40 million of approved direct Exchequer capital yet to be drawn down for the Grangegorman project.  Accordingly, the sector will derive an up-front capital injection of &euro;150 million in the period up to 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015093000002#H00600","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1443614400,"counter":278,"content":"<p>We are now considering this information provided by the Department.

We have replaced a huge number of prefabs across the country, at a time when resources were very limited.  I say well done to the building unit and to anybody involved in that programme.<\/p><p>Will the same momentum continue?  Will there be that focus on reducing the use of prefabs in our school system?

A strategy without funding is a pretty pointless exercise.  I look forward to seeing that money being expended.<\/p><p>Over the last three or four years, great work has been done on the provision of 100 MB broadband to every post-primary school in the country.  Is it envisaged that part of the &euro;210 million will be spent on providing the same to our 3,300 primary schools?  While it is a huge undertaking, in the context of a national broadband programme which seeks to have 30 MB to every community by 2020, I hope there is a parallel ambition to connect all our primary schools to a minimum of 30 MB and an aspiration to 100 MB over time.  <i>siliconrepublic.com<\/i>has predicted that by 2020 we will have the fastest rural broadband in Europe, based on the private and public investment that is about to happen.

More importantly, however, they take a huge weight from the shoulders of management in those schools, in so far as the latter has no responsibility for the infrastructure of the building, other than to request through the management body that repairs be made.  While there probably is a case for developing this, is account being taken of the additional burden being placed on managers of schools who are not in public private partnerships?  As members are aware, management structures have been depleted considerably in recent years.  Another point concerns expenditure on information technology, IT, which has been a hobby horse of mine for quite a number of years.  Schools operate as individual islands, if one likes, apart from their fellow schools, even within education and training boards, ETBs, and the purchasing power for hardware and software, software in particular with regard to the licences being paid for it, is a matter of grave concern to me.  However, some time ago with the roll-out of broadband, one would have hoped it was possible to move from stand-alone systems over to a cloud-based system using something like Citrix or VMware, where the dependency on having up-to-date hardware is removed and one can use relatively old hardware to run the latest software.  This has bothered me for some time.  In the United States, many of the big companies fund education because, of course, the students are being trained in their products.  In some Nordic countries, there has been a move away from licensed software to open systems software.  How much per annum is being spent?  I had personal experience in my own college of how much was spent on information technology and it was a fairly significant sum.  I am aware the Department has been examining this issue for some time but has a real move been made towards centralising the purchasing of IT equipment, moving towards the cloud and, if one likes, taking the manufacturers of software and beating them into reality regarding the costs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015093000002#J01600","speaker":"1196"},{"type":"speech","time":1443614400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Deputy Ryan wishes to come in later.

The Department of Education and Skills provides no funding towards school meals, by which I mean breakfast clubs or lunch clubs.  The Department of Social Protection provides funding for the food to the tune of 60 cent per pupil for breakfast and &euro;1.40 for lunch.  However, the problem is schools are having difficulty in manning and staffing such programmes, which is where much of the expense lies.  It appears as though the Department of Education and Skills, while it allows the schools to provide the breakfast and lunch clubs, will put forward no funding towards their cost.  Does the Department have proposals to so do in the future because these clubs have proved to be vital, particularly the provision of breakfast for students who may not have had anything eat the previous 12 or 14 hours?<\/p> <p>  On the question of broadband, I find it difficult to envisage how it ever will be possible to roll out high-speed broadband to all rural schools in Ireland, given that the local school on which I am on the board of management cannot even get broadband to it.  It physically is impossible to get it, as the mountains and so on make it a nightmare in that area.  Consequently, I believe it will be difficult to achieve and I imagine it would be hard to quantify the amount of money it would cost to get broadband to all national schools.  Hopefully, however, there will be some work in the future in this regard.<\/p> <p>  There is one point I have always found it hard to understand.

I would like to see some use of the term \"further education\" because it is a fast-growing and dynamic sector.  For example, all age groups over 18 are flocking to the former VEC schools and colleges around Dublin and finding them of tremendous value in terms of rebuilding a career or for general self-improvement.  We need to separate it out as a sector because of its value and how widely it is patronised, particularly in cities, but I am sure it is the same in the countryside.  We should pay more attention to it.  The Department should examine more carefully how it can foster this relatively new branch of education and make sure it is resourced, particularly in working class areas where people might not have a history of going to college.  Throughout Dublin there is tremendous value being placed on it and men and women are attracted to it in very large numbers.  I would like it to get some mention and given some distinctiveness in its own right, and to have that represented in documents such as the one before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015093000002#K00200","speaker":"1031"},{"type":"speech","time":1443614400,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I want to make a few points.  Will the Minister explain what comes under the miscellaneous category on the appropriations-in-aid page?  There is &euro;6.1 million, &euro;6.2 million and &euro;6.4 million in the miscellaneous column.  Also, regarding secondments and overpayments, are there many overpayments?  What happens in that respect?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for the Minister of State, Deputy English.  Senator Moloney raised the question of a bus being supplied for ten students but not for nine.  With regard to transport to special education schools, my office raised a particular case with the Minister this year about a child who was looking for transport to a special education school.  A bus drove past that house with another child attending a special education school but this child was not entitled to that transport and had to pay the concessionary fee of &euro;100.  I still have not got an explanation of the logic behind the reason a bus could take one child and not the other.<\/p> <p>  I understand the criteria, and I may be going a little off-point, but when it comes down to the choice of a school for a child wishing to attend a special education school, an issue on which I have had many dealings, often the choice comes down to the school the special education needs organiser, SENO, recommends.  The person who knows the child with special educational needs best is the parent, and often parents would like their child to attend a school half a mile in the other direction or a little further.  If they attend the school the SENO recommends they get the transport but if they do not, they have to pay for it themselves.  Is there any way this problem could be examined and addressed?  I have brought up with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, the question of who determines that.  Sometimes they talk about the SENOs.  Despite what is said, SENOs do not always see the child and I do not understand how people can make decisions about where a child can attend school without even meeting the child.  That is very important in terms of the transport because it causes huge headaches.  This year, despite the improvements, I cannot give parents an answer to the reason one child with special needs was allowed to get free transport when the child who lives three doors up the road attending the same school had to pay &euro;100 concessionary fee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015093000002#K00300","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1443614400,"counter":304,"content":"<p>There are quite a few questions for the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015093000002#K00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1443614400,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Deputy Cannon asked about the capital programme.  We will continue the prefab programme.  In the existing programme the focus was mostly on the rented prefabs but we will now move on to the prefabs that have been bought.  We have to approach the schools and put it to them that we would replace the prefabs.  In cases where a new building will be built, automatically the prefabs will be replaced but in the other cases, we will be approaching the schools in the context of the capital programme.  The answer to the second question is \"Yes\" in regard to the schools already in the current programme but where there was a delay for one reason or another, they will stay on.<\/p> <p>  The digital school strategy is nearly ready to go.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, and I have been working hard on it and we are close to conclusion.  We want to get our capital allocation first, and the allocation the Minister, Deputy White, was getting with regard to the general roll-out was relevant also in regard to finalising the strategy.  The aim is to have wireless broadband available to all schools but if I can respond also to Senator Moloney's point, which is related, we want to bring it from outside the school into the school under our budget.  Bringing it up the mountain will have to be paid for under the budget of the Minister, Deputy White.  There is private sector involvement in the roll-out as well but the State will be doing the parts the private sector does not consider it appropriate to do.  It is a combination of getting it to the school gate and then us rolling it out in terms of moving from 30 up to 100 megabytes, as the Senator suggested.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Collins has left but I will briefly answer her question; Deputy McConalogue continued with the same topic.  Deputy Collins's first question was on the need for new schools.  Our estimate is that 19,000 places will be needed at primary level and 43,000 at post-primary level.  That is looking at the demographic growth.  The primary growth will peak in 2018, the post-primary will continue to grow up to 2024, and higher education will continue to grow further again.  That is the way the demographics are growing.  That is the reason we have included a bigger figure for post-primary than for primary.<\/p> <p>  With regard to having diversity of patronage and choices for parents, when he was Minister, Deputy Quinn started a process and a policy around providing more diversity.  When schools are being provided parents in the area are questioned about the type of patronage they would like, and the vast majority of the new schools have been of multi-denominational patronage, mostly Educate Together.  That is one way in which we are providing diversity.<\/p> <p>  The other way has been slower and more disappointing, that is, the divesting process.<\/p><p>That has not delivered as quickly as we would have liked for a variety of reasons.  I intend to meet all the patrons.  While I cannot remember the date, I will meet the Catholic bishops in the very near future and also the other patrons to discuss how we can inject a bit more pace into that process.<\/p><p> I would like to move more quickly on it.  Where there is a growing population we can provide choice more easily than where there is a stable population because of the issue of displacement.  If we were to simply open, for example, a multidenominational school in an area where there is a reducing population, it would probably result in reducing numbers in other schools.  That is something that has to be considered.  I would like to see progress and will be working to ensure that we get more progress in that regard.<\/p><p> Deputy Joan Collins asked about general allocation.  I think she asked what would happen if someone was not able to get a report.  There is also the general allocation for special needs.  All schools get a certain amount of resource teaching hours on the basis of the number of students in the school whether it is a boys' school, girls' school, DEIS school, etc.<\/p><p> I believe I answered Deputy McConalogue's question on patronage.  He asked me about minor works and the Supplementary Estimate.  I have indicated that we expect there will be a Supplementary Estimate in education.  The minor works will be part of our consideration a little later in the year.  Obviously, I have not announced the detail of the capital education programme as yet, but we would hope to look at that.  The Deputy also raised it here with me last year and we were able to deliver it last year.  However, I cannot give him a definite answer on that yet.<\/p><p> Senator O'Donnell had a number of questions.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, might also want to comment on research funding because it is in his area of responsibility.  Apparently the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform reclassified the funding from current to capital; so it is accounted for differently.  We can come back to the Senator with a more precise answer on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015093000002#K00500","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443614400,"counter":307,"content":"<p>It is confusing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015093000002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1443614400,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Yes, it is confusing, but that is what it was.<\/p> <p>  The total for Grangegorman was &euro;40 million in 2014.

Research has been reclassified from current to capital owing to a change in the EU accounting rules.  Under the US accounting rules for many years, research was regarded as a capital spend because it gives a return over a long period of time.  We did not in Europe.  We counted it as current spend.  That has been changed and now our budgets across all Departments reflect it as capital spend.  I can assure the committee the &euro;37 million is money well spent and more is requested.  Money spent on research, development and innovation is something the Government is driving across many Departments.<\/p> <p>  The total taxpayer spend on research and development will be close to &euro;800 million.  We want to get it back over &euro;1 billion.  Our commitment is for 2.5% of GDP.  There is a range of programmes funded through higher education along with other Departments.  It is very much about future-proofing the economy.  Money spent on research and development now is about developing talent for the future so that people can work in public research systems and also take up jobs in new companies and so on.  We know from our research that the companies that get involved with the education system and that spend money on research and development are the companies that are growing faster and exporting more.  They are the companies developing new policies and ideas, and taking on new people.  So it is all part of the future-proofing of the economy.  We would like to have much more than &euro;37 million in this regard if we could.<\/p><p>I hope over time we will have more.  It is well spent and well tracked.<\/p><p> We are developing a new science strategy in which all of the Departments are involved which we hope to announce in November.  This will include new ways to fund research and to have competitive funding among all the disciplines.  Various disciplines have probably often raised this is a concern with committee members, as they may have felt that in recent years it has been more difficult to obtain money.  It is because there was less money.  It is as simple as that.  We are making it very clear in the new strategy that all of the disciplines will have access to competitive funding and various other moneys.  There will also be new ways to track this money because it is a concern when we spend a lot of money as to how we can track and follow it and measure the outputs.  This is dealt with quite well through our agencies, including the Irish Research Council and Science Foundation Ireland.  We want to be able to improve this and make it clear to all involved that the money is well spent.  I guarantee it gives a return to the country, but we need to be able to track this and prove it.<\/p><p> The further education and training budget is under skills development in programme B.  The further education and training strategy sets out that it must become a pillar, as we want to give it recognition as best we can.  It has a major contribution to make to skills development in the country.  Every company says there is a shortage of talent and we are in the middle of a talent war.  Skills development and closing the skills gap will only be achieved through a blend of higher education and further education and training.  The Department is trying to recognise this, and the various strategies clarify this and give credence to it, and it is a case of how we can push the agenda.  Eventually the funding will be increased but it must become more responsive to enterprise needs.  This happens through further education and training because of apprenticeships, traineeships and the various schemes in colleges of further education which work with enterprise and community needs and respond to them.  We need to be able to match this with funding.<\/p><p> Several committee members have raised the issue of school buses and what happens when the number falls below ten.

There is an issue when it goes below the magic number, be it ten or seven, as it was in the past, with regard to what happens these people.  If they are eligible for a bus ticket they will receive a contribution towards the cost of transport.  This is the remote grant.  The families of children eligible to get a bus which is no longer running because it is inefficient to do so can apply for a grant towards the cost of transporting the children to school.  People can apply for it and will receive it, and rightly so because it is not their fault the number of passengers has gone below the magic number.

There is quite a high spend in this area to facilitate it.  With regard to why someone is not eligible to use a bus going past his or her door, a bus route is based on children who are eligible to go to their nearest school.  I will come back to who decides this.  In the case identified, the person was not eligible to go on the route, but a concession will be made for such a person if there is space on the vehicle.  The scheme must be implemented in the same way throughout the country.  Non-eligible children are regarded as concessionary and must make a contribution to the cost, which is &euro;100.

Deputy Ryan raised a good point.  Much of our focus in the science strategy has been on research and development, innovation, working with enterprise and third level education.  Whereas Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, is given the job of advocating for and encouraging science through primary and secondary levels, the Deputy called for an important target.  All students having access to science is a resource issue, but we should consider it in terms of the strategy to determine whether there is a way of closing the gap over a number of years.  The Deputy is the first person to mention it even though I have attended hundreds of meetings on the science strategy.  It is probably the most obvious point.  I will work on it and revert to the Deputy.  The science strategy involves a number of other Departments.  It is a good target, but solving the issue is a different story.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue is aware that I have met parents regarding the school bus issue.  Many saw resolutions this year, but we were unable to solve it for everyone.  The bus is not going over the mountain this year.  The route, which is based on eligible pupils, does not need to cross the gap about which everyone is concerned.  The system measures the shortest traversable route.  This is what is done across the country.  It can cause difficulty if one lives on a mountain Kerry, Cork or Donegal.  We even have the odd mountain in County Meath, or big hills as we call them.  However, the way the system measures must be equitable throughout the country.  There must be a common system.  There is no other way of doing it.  When I met the parents alongside the Deputy and others, I gave a commitment to review the situation continually to determine whether there was something obvious that we were doing wrong, whether we had missed a commonsensical approach and whether we could make tweaks that were within budget so as to improve the system.<\/p><p>That is an ongoing process.  Any major changes are a budgetary issue.  We are under a lot of pressure in all Departments when it comes to money.<\/p><p> I gave the parents a commitment but made it clear to them that there was no pending solution this year that would solve their problem.

This year the matter have been resolved for most of the students and we will work on the matter for the years ahead.<\/p><p> A fair point was made about ethos and language.  I understood that the issue related to the minority religion.  Roman Catholicism was always very dominant in this country and it was always felt that there was access to religious instruction in such schools.  Whereas minority religions, specifically the Church of Ireland, were not catered for.  That is what the rule is about.  There are some cases ongoing about the choice of going to a Catholic school as opposed to an ETB one.  That matter is generally dealt with in legislation.  I shall take a look at the matter and will come back to the Deputy with a proper briefing.  It is generally regarded that an ETB covers all religious requirements.

Ms McGrath is accompanied by Mr. Mick Long, accountant and Mr. Tony Smyth, director of engineering services.<\/p><p>On part 1, structure and purpose of the meeting, there have been ongoing efforts within the Oireachtas committees to improve the way that committees and members engage in the budget and Estimates process.  In order for committees to fulfil their responsibilities and hold Departments and public bodies to account for how they spend public money, the quality of information that committees receive needs to improve.  A number of committees, through their secretariats, have been in communication with several Departments and public bodies, including the OPW, over the past number of months to look at ways in which spending can be tied more closely to output targets and long-term outcomes.  Committees need to be able to assess how public bodies are performing.  The OPW is to be commended in how it has engaged with this conversation with the secretariat over recent months and also on its willingness to examine the type and quality of information it makes available to the committee.<\/p><p>There are two key parts of today's meeting.  Part 1 will allow members to discuss how the OPW measures performance, what it has done to improve these measures and what needs to be done in future.  Part 2 concerns the mid-year view of the position as regards outputs and expenditure in regard to the OPW Vote for the year ending 31 December 2015 and the emerging position for that Vote.  They will alert us to issues that will be relevant to the 2016 Estimates discussions in advance of the allocations being finalised as envisaged by the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014.  As in the case across a number of committees, I propose that at a further meeting the joint committee may agree a report on the outcome of our deliberations today and lay it before the Houses.<\/p><p>Members have been circulated with a briefing document for today's meeting.  The format of the meeting will be that Ms McGrath will make some opening remarks which will be followed with a question and answer session dealing first, with performance measures and then a second round of questions on the spending figures.<\/p><p>I remind members, visitors and those in the Visitors Gallery that mobile telephones must be switched off.  I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask Ms McGrath to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015093000002#C00400","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443618000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I am joined here today by Mr. Michael Long, the accountant for the Office of Public Works, and Mr. Tony Smyth, the director of engineering.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to be here today to assist in the committee's deliberations on this pilot exercise undertaking a mid-year review of the position on outputs and expenditure, brief the committee on the OPW's emerging position on the Estimate and comment on the performance data presented in the Revised Estimates for the Office of Public Works.<\/p> <p>  Before I present the challenges that we face in demonstrating performance on the main programmes, I will brief the committee on progress to date in 2015.  In terms of outputs, progress on the flood risk management programme has been hampered by a number of factors such as legal challenges within the procurement process and legislative requirements relating to environmental impact analyses of schemes.  These unavoidable difficulties result in a long lead-in time in bringing these complex infrastructure projects to commencement stage.  As a consequence, there are challenges in accurately identifying programme milestones in terms of output and expenditure where external factors can have a significant impact.  The committee will be aware that I have presented these difficulties here previously.<\/p> <p>  While the OPW has made every effort to advance the schemes planned for commencement and completion in 2015, specific difficulties have been encountered and have led to delays.  For example, the design of some schemes had to be revisited and required further consultation with stakeholders following the exhibition stage, a stage at which we conduct extensive public consultation.  In addition, despite robust planning and contract management, one project encountered procurement challenges, which resulted in the procurement process having to be terminated and restarted.  These issues have impacted on the Vote from both an output and expenditure perspective.<\/p> <p>  In expenditure terms, the OPW Vote spend is split between two programme areas.  Overall, &euro;397 million was allocated to the OPW in 2015, and expenditure at mid-year was 47% of the gross current allocation and 31% of the capital allocation.  Current expenditure is on profile to break even for 2015 and while capital expenditure on one programme is behind profile, significant expenditure relating to major capital contracts is projected for the final quarter.<\/p> <p>  We have indicated to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that an application to vire funding between subheads may be submitted this year and a carry-forward of capital savings to 2016 sought under the deferred surrender scheme, within the 10% saving permitted.  While the scale and composition of the 2016 OPW Vote is currently under consideration, the current expenditure ceiling for the Office is &euro;276.5 million, which is in line with the current allocation for 2015.<\/p> <p>  The 2016 ceiling will allow for the existing level of service to be maintained in property management, heritage services and drainage maintenance, with an increase in the provision on property maintenance for buildings occupied by Departments to be funded from within the Vote.  A reduced requirement on unitary payments for the convention centre in Dublin will allow funds to be redirected to the essential planned preventative maintenance programme now that we have assumed, since 2013, overall responsibility for this function.<\/p> <p>  While the capital allocation in 2016 will remain constant, the Government has demonstrated its commitment, announced yesterday, to flood risk management in Ireland with the announcement of a &euro;430 million six-year programme of capital investment on flood defence measures as part of the Government's overall Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021.  The programme will build on the very significant investment that has already been undertaken in flood relief works throughout the country over the past 20 years, with over &euro;410 million invested in that period.<\/p><p>In 2016, schemes will get under way in Bandon, Skibbereen, Clashaboy, Douglas, Blackpool, Claregalway, Lower Morrell, Ennis south and Foynes on a staged basis.  In 2016, reductions in capital unitary payments will allow for an increased investment in the ongoing office rationalisation programme.  This will ensure the State rental bill can be maintained at a sustainable level and accommodation for essential State services can be provided in a cost-effective manner.<br\/><br\/>In terms of output measures, I am of the opinion that the OPW targets used in previous years may now need to be revisited.  I am open to applying the principles drawn from the guidance issued by the New Zealand Comptroller and Auditor General to improve the performance information in the Estimates.  I would welcome the views of members on the type of performance data they wish to see presented.  I acknowledge that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as the publisher of the revised Estimate, will have a key role in agreeing any proposed changes.<br\/><br\/>As members are aware, the OPW is responsible for a wide variety of functions broadly based in two areas of responsibility: flood risk management and estate portfolio management, which includes heritage services.  I will address the challenges faced in demonstrating output within those programmes.  Members are aware that the OPW is the lead agency for the management of the flood risk management programme in Ireland.  The key purpose of this programme is to ensure the risks associated with flooding and the impacts identified in climate change are considered and appropriate mitigation plans are put in place.  The overall outcome is to reduce the risk of flooding to homes and businesses and to ensure appropriate flood risk information for planning in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The setting of performance targets and interim goals to measure this presents its own challenges.  The OPW currently publishes output indicators on <i>irelandstat.gov.ie<\/i>.  I suggest to members that these indicators might represent a more appropriate way to measure the performance of current flood relief schemes and the impending catchment flood risk assessment and management programme.  On <i>irelandstat.gov.ie<\/i>, we publish the number of additional properties benefiting from flood relief works in a given year and the cumulative number of properties benefiting from flood relief works.  We are incrementally demonstrating what is being achieved.  The value of benefit to properties, or damage or loss avoided in financial terms, is also represented, as is the cumulative value of benefit to properties, or damage or loss avoided in financial terms.<br\/><br\/>In order to implement the State&rsquo;s strategy for flood risk management in Ireland, we have developed a catchment flood risk assessment and management plan, known as CFRAM.  This programme represents a major advance in the way that the management of flood risk is approached, involving a move to strategic planning at the river catchment level.  It establishes a new framework for the proactive development and planning of flood relief schemes and other measures by applying international best practice.  CFRAM lies at the core of the assessment.  It is focused on 300 areas of potentially significant risk, known as areas for further assessment.  The ongoing programme will look at all possible options to address flood risk in each area for further assessment for inclusion in the flood risk management plans.  This programme, which has been allocated additional funding from 2018, will set out a medium to long-term strategy and will prioritise a programme of work with appropriate output measures to achieve the effective and sustainable management of flood risk.<br\/><br\/>I will set out the progress that has been made on the programme to date.  Draft maps were completed for 282 areas for further assessment by the end of 2014 and for all 300 areas by June 2015.  Over 40,000 maps have been reviewed by the OPW and the local authorities and have been subject to public consultation.  Under the EU floods directive, the flood risk management plans are due to be reported by March 2016.  This deadline will not be met until the end of 2016 due to delays in producing the flood maps.  It is worth noting that the capacity to deal with flood risk management has been enhanced in recent years through greater collaboration with local authorities, which act as the contracting authority for certain schemes and carry out some minor works projects funded by the OPW as long as the works meet strict cost-benefit criteria.<br\/><br\/>The other main programme for the office is estate portfolio management, which encompasses the management, maintenance and development of the State&rsquo;s property portfolio in our care, including the conservation, protection and presentation of national monuments and national historic properties in State care.  We have been tasked by the Government with rationalising the State's property portfolio to reflect the changing numbers across the Civil Service.  Since 2008, the OPW has undertaken a major rationalisation programme that has resulted in the surrender of over 1.2 million sq. ft. of office accommodation and yielded a cumulative reduction of &euro;111 million in rent on the OPW Vote.  In that period, we have surrendered 276 leases with an annual rental yield of &euro;34.7 million.  Rent reductions have been negotiated on 121 leases, yielding an annual rental reduction of &euro;8.59 million.  The savings achieved and the reduction in the State property footprint are output measures reflecting the significant work undertaken by this office over the last five years.  With rents now rising, particularly in Dublin, mounting challenges in the negotiation of rent reductions and the rationalisation of properties will need to be considered as part of the output measures to be set for 2016.<br\/><br\/>The objective of the property asset management delivery plan, which applies to all public property holders and not just the OPW, is to achieve a more strategic approach to the management of State property.  It requires all State property holders to view public property from a State perspective rather than from the perspective of individual ownership, notwithstanding that ownership will remain the same.  The plan sets out a series of actions aimed at improving the planning and management of the public service property portfolio though improved co-ordination, an increased capacity to benchmark building performance, standardised building measurement and the optimisation of the use of the Slate's property assets through asset-sharing and more streamlined processes.  As part of the plan, State property holders have been tasked with verifying their property data and submitting the data to the State property register by the end of 2016.  A network of property managers is to be established across public property holders and will be chaired by the OPW.  The application of the ISEN standard for facilities management for measuring and analysing office space to OPW office accommodation is to be introduced on a phased basis over the next two to three years.  A training model for public service staff is to be developed in the property asset management area by mid-2016.  A programme of information workshops has commenced, with further roll-out to be agreed with the steering group on property asset management, which I chair.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the capacity of the OPW to carry out the necessary reforms in this area, we have engaged in a business transformation process for our estate portfolio function.  We are taking a lead role in the property asset management delivery plan.  By looking at ourselves from an external perspective, we aim to improve our processes to deliver better outcomes for our clients and structure the organisation in a way that supports the most effective delivery of outputs.  The ambition is to increase overall efficiency, given the significant reduction in our staff resources, and to optimise the stewardship of the property assets entrusted to us.  Good progress is being made in this regard.  Priorities for improvement are emerging around supporting our clients, developing our programme and project management functions, enhancing our planning capability and using better information systems.  We will make progress with all of these areas for improvement in the course of the work of the business transformation, which will run until the end of 2016.  We will foster and support a culture of continuous improvement, with which further progress will be made in future years.<br\/><br\/>As part of our property portfolio, we are responsible for the ongoing management, conservation and protection of some 800 historic properties and national monuments sites.  The policy for this area is vested in the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  We provide guide services to visitors at 70 sites nationwide, many of which attract a significant number of visitors and are key to contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s cultural and heritage tourism.  During 2014, admission numbers to OPW-guided sites reached 4.5 million, which represented an increase of 33% on 2010.  From an output measurement perspective, we are faced with the challenge of balancing the needs of conservation, for which output is difficult to measure, with the strong desire to increase public access and visitor numbers.  This challenge of balancing the demands of tourism arises where the visitor experience derives from the quality of what we are presenting, but that same quality can be affected by those visitors.  The OPW has a number of internal measures in place to assess performance at visitor sites.  Traditional measures include simple analyses of increasing or sustained site popularity by reference to overall visitor numbers.  Similarly, customer feedback mechanisms such as customer comments and visitor books at sites are employed to capture the experience and the quality of the engagement.  In this digital age, the OPW is mindful that social media mechanisms such as Facebook and Twitter provide immediate and powerful feedback on the visitor experience.<\/p><p>I am sure members saw recently that of the top ten visitor attractions in Ireland recommended by TripAdvisor, four are managed by the Office of Public Works.  That demonstrates the value that these and all heritage sites bring to the tourism sector.<\/p><p> With regard to additional functions performed by the office, which are not reflected directly in the Vote, client services performed on an agency basis consume staff resources and were therefore included in the performance measures in past Estimates.  For example, the roll-out of the Intreo offices across the country that provide one-stop-shops to perform functions previously offered by separate social welfare, community welfare and F&Aacute;S offices have been successfully delivered to the Department of Social Protection within a very ambitious timeframe.  Similarly, the construction and fit-out of seven primary schools were delivered to the Department of Education and Skills during 2014 and 2015 with a further eight schools in train.  I would suggest that the work and commitment in the delivery of this accommodation, albeit funded from the Votes of other Departments, needs to be reflected with the OPW output measures, and I would welcome the input of members as to how this might be reflected in Estimates.<\/p><p> In general terms, I welcome the review of the performance measures and its consideration by the committee.  My officials and I have committed to work with the committee and the secretariat to review the current output measures in order to produce outward facing indicators that are of relevance to the public and, importantly, can demonstrate clearly the considerable work being carried out by the office and value being achieved for invested funds.<\/p><p> It is worth bearing in mind, however, that the illustration of progress towards what is trying to be achieved is also important.  While I accept that output performance measures should not relate to internal processes, events or milestones, these can usefully demonstrate the progress being achieved in reaching targets.  The outputs from the OPW are in part processes for other Departments, giving rise to outputs or outcomes for their service users and for the public.<\/p><p> In regard to the published output measures, we are not going to be able to address every area immediately but we would expect to consider all the measures in each area over the next number of Estimates.  These are just a summary of the key issues facing the office and I welcome any suggestions, comments or engagement with the members on these priorities and how we can improve the presentation of targets in order to assist the committee in its deliberations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015093000002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McGrath","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443618000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I wish to seek clarification from Ms McGrath on one point and also I wish to make one comment.

I will give Ms McGrath an example.  As a Deputy I remember issuing a press release about a road project in my area.  I knew the figure and budget involved and somebody came up to me afterwards and read the press release and said, \"That is wonderful, but what are you doing?  Are you improving the junction?  Are you putting in an extra lane or are you putting in extra lights?\"  That stopped me in my tracks and I realised then that it was not what we were spending or how long it would take to do the project that mattered.  It was the output or what will be there when it is all over.  That made it clear to me the difference between the two.

I will go into the definition of that in more detail if necessary.  We are also looking at occupancy.  For every ten staff in an organisation we provide eight desks.  We are looking at putting these measures in place and we are asking Departments to account for that through their annual reports.  The OPW provides the desks.  Departments provide the staff.

That applies to the cleaning contracts, window-cleaning, utility bills, and so on, some of which we do not record because we do not deal with it; the occupiers do.  We are seeking - the Office of Government Procurement is also working in this space - to use the standard language, the IEN standard, when we are replacing any of these contracts in the future.  That would mean that when they place a contract for cleaning it will be reported on, and the payments will be made based on the standard, so that ultimately, in a number of years' time, we will be able to give the total cost of occupancy for any given building.

Listening to this - and this is no criticism, as it is a big job - I can conclude that there is a decade in that.  First the data has to be recorded, then the evidence will have to be produced from the data, and when all that is done, standards will have to be drawn up.  Each of those, in the Irish way of doing business, will take a few years.  If that was to go ahead, it would take a long time.<\/p> <p>  Let us take the cost of a building - a Garda station the OPW works on, a Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine building, or any building.  The Department is probably carrying the costs of the porters and so on, and the OPW is carrying other costs such as maintenance.  Some buildings are owned by clients of the OPW, and sometimes it is just part of the OPW's job because it is a State building.  Would it make sense from the State's perspective for all the costs of the building to be under the OPW rather than in all the different Departments?  For example, some of the school package is done by public private partnership, PPP.  The cost of everything to do with that building could be obtained easily because that private body is responsible for the caretaker, the minding, the maintenance, the heating, the lights, the water, the rates, fixing the roof, and so on.  It could tell anyone that it costs &euro;3 million a year to keep that building as it is, but that cannot happen in the public service now because line Departments are carrying some of the costs, staff are coming from elsewhere, and so on.  The other way is much simpler.  Would there be a benefit in the OPW taking charge of that?

We now have sight and control of the funding and have moved to a preventative maintenance programme on the estate.  Some of what Deputy Fleming is saying is, therefore, beginning to happen.  It is like what I said earlier about ownership with the whole of Government estate.  The State wants sight of the whole-of-Government estate, but the responsibility and the accountability still rest with the owner of that estate.  It is about finding a mechanism to bring this information together.  It does exist out there.  The Office of Government Procurement is part of that, as is what we are doing here, and every other public body.  I see it as being achievable, perhaps in less time, but I am certain that it is the right direction of travel.  We will know total cost of occupancy, what we are doing with the State's estate, and where we fit in.<\/p> <p>  The bigger game will be in the future, if we can get to a point at which, when the State is looking at a site for delivery of a public service, whether national or local, somebody will look through the register and see what estate can be availed of, so that we are not out in the market but optimising the State's estate across all service delivery areas.  That does not mean the OPW has to be the entity; it means that every public body that holds estate is looking in and able to tap into other public bodies.  This is what we are saying about the property network.  We tap in, we are learning from other agencies and we are sharing.  We have seen it on the Intreo programme, where local authorities have given us space in their county halls to provide Intreo offices.  That meant we did not have to go out into the private sector to source it.  We are beginning to see efficiencies in the use of the State's estate and where we have a demand for increased staffing in a particular Department we are able to look to the local authority estate, see what is available on the register and talk to them.

We are streamlining the processes between public bodies in dealing with property transactions, which previously could have been quite cumbersome.  We now have streamlined processes, have put in place a single valuation and have seen a major improvement in transaction costs and transaction efficiencies.  That has been put in place.  We are looking at that in relation to disposals and inter-body uses.  When it comes to the management of our own estate, which is what the Senator is asking about, the OPW was previously 50:50 as between leased and owned.  Where a lease is particularly important to us is where it gives us flexibility around movements in numbers and Departments, so that we can exit by looking to exercise the break.  That works two ways.  If I am in a lease and the landlord has the decision, he or she can exercise the break too.  One is balancing that.  At the moment, we are at about 60:40.  Strategically, depending on location, function and duration, each entity will have policies in that regard.

There was a gap between the works being done and their recognition in terms of the householder or individual beneficiary.  It was not being reflected in lower premiums to households.  In fact, there were households where significant works had been done by the OPW flood programme where no benefit was achieved at all and they were simply uninsurable.  When the OPW looks at the value of individual benefit to properties, does it take this into account in terms of the wider public interest?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015093000002#G01000","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443618000,"counter":438,"content":"<p>When we look at the benefit, what we are talking about are the benefits of the scheme.

We are minded that we will be moving people who have competencies in certain areas to other areas where the focus is changing in terms of strategic planning, portfolio planning and so forth.  Where we need the people who have certain skills now to change direction, we are providing training and upskilling.  Divisions and functional areas throughout the organisation are looking at the competencies they need to fulfil their roles and determining whether there are any skills gaps.  We then focus the training on those identified areas.<\/p> <p>  The answer to the Deputy's second question is \"Yes\".  There is not much movement in terms of locations because our main locations have already been determined and we have a regional structure.  Our headquarters are in Trim.  We move people within the functional areas and people also make choices or decisions and seek to move to different areas.  It is more of an issue in the context of the estate portfolio and the work being done at the moment as to the current position with staff resources.  I am not hung up on the location but am more concerned about whether we have the skills and competencies within the organisation to do our work.  Staff can work in a number of different places and in the future, potentially, staff will go to the nearest location to their home, irrespective of what department they are in.  That is the potential for the future.  In that sense, staff could be in any location.  We have not been engaged in wholesale movement or closing of offices within the organisation.  In the future, however, we will have to increase our capacity to deliver on the capital programme in the area of flood relief.  We commission extensively for a lot of the work.  The private sector provides the inputs for projects and we oversee the work and act as the intelligent client.  We will be increasing our capacity to allow us to deliver on the flood relief capital programme in 2018 and beyond.  That is an area that we will have to consider carefully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015093000002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McGrath"},{"type":"speech","time":1443618000,"counter":479,"content":"<p>Was there a proposal to move staff from the National Botanic Gardens?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015093000002#M01100","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443618000,"counter":480,"content":"<p>No, I am not aware of one but within functional areas people can be located at different sites.

On flood relief schemes generally, we undertake a pre-feasibility study in terms of the various stages during which we undertake consultations with local stakeholders and local authorities.  We go through the pre-feasibility stage, the feasibility stage, the exhibition stage -which involves extensive consultation - and then the pre-design stage.  Under the Planning Acts, the exhibition stage deals with what, in the context of construction projects, would normally be referred to as the planning stage.  There can be various iterations as has happened on a number of schemes where we get a lot of observations which might have us reconsider what we have and then we have to go back to exhibition stage.  There are quite a few stages that must be undertaken.  After this we must consider ecological and archaeological issues that might arise.  One cannot go in and carry out works and come out and consider what has to be done because it is within a river.  We have to engage in a great deal of information gathering, extensive modelling, hydrology studies, surveying and hydraulic modelling, for example, on the CFRAM maps.  We have produced 40,000 such maps for the 300 areas and have surveyed 12% or 13% of the country.  Extensive works must be undertaken.  We procure consultants and contractors in compliance with EU rules and, as part of that process, we are obliged to obtain statutory consent.  Statutory consent is something new which has arisen.  We are the developer and would have undertaken the environmental impact assessment.  Consent is undertaken by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Under new EU regulations, the Minister is required to obtain an independent assessment of our assessment.  So that is another step that has to be undertaken.  Once we have the consent, we proceed to undertaking the actual work because we will also have completed extensive design work in relation to this and procuring the contractor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015093000002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McGrath"},{"type":"speech","time":1443618000,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Obviously, Ms McGrath with will respond in writing to the Chair.

Some 22 years ago, the Oslo Accord was signed between President Arafat and the late Prime Minister Rabin.  It was intended to be a confidence building measure between the two parties and to conclude the right of self-determination and independence by having a Palestinian state by 4 May 1999.  Some 22 years later in the occupied territories, there is a criminal, illegal, inhuman siege, which is suffocating 2 million people in one of the most densely populated areas on earth.  There is no movement at all for goods or individuals.  The population is being sent back to the Middle Ages.  In addition, the occupation also included three major offensives during this period and civilians and civilian targets were in the eye of the storm.  Obviously, during the offensives war crimes and crimes against humanity took place.  There has been no accountability on any level by the international community and, accordingly, no deterrents.  What happened will be repeated again and again against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.<br\/><br\/>Hamas operates in Gaza, and perhaps we deserve what happened for many reasons, but the situation in the West Bank is not better than death by any standard.  That is why the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, Christians and Muslims, which is the policy of the occupation, is taking place, in different ways, administratively, legally and practically.  The Judaisation of Jerusalem is taking place day and night as a continuation of the <i>fait accompli <\/i>policy of this belligerent occupation.  <br\/><br\/>The annexation and apartheid of the rest of the West Bank was almost completed, something which was considered by the International Court of Justice as a crime and which should be abolished completely.  Israel took no notice of that.  Settlements activities are expanding vertically and horizontally.  New settlements are built every day.  The Israeli occupation devours and grabs more land every day from Palestinians.<\/p><p>Bypass roads ghettoise and isolate Palestinian cities, villages and camps, creating enclaves. It has no means to expand, as hundreds of checkpoints all over the West Bank make movement of goods and individuals a mission impossible.  We have more than 6,000 Palestinian prisoners and, although Palestine has been recognised as a state, the prisoners are still considered to be terrorists and are not recognised as political prisoners according to the Geneva Convention.  At one time, 47 parliamentarians representing the Palestinian people were arrested and detained with no charge and for no reason.  Tortured legally and victims of medical negligence, many lost their lives.  Those in charge of the prisoners do not want a repeat of Bobby Sands' hunger strike, but they repress free will and they ensure prisoners lose every way of expressing it.  The situation in the West Bank is, effectively, a new brand of apartheid.<\/p><p> So this is the harvest of those accords - criminal siege in Gaza, ethnic cleansing in Jerusalem and a new brand of apartheid in the West Bank.  This is unprecedented in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  This is not what we as Palestinians are saying; it is being said by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the International Federation for Human Rights - all the international human rights organisations.  All UN fact-finding missions and all UN rapporteurs on Palestine also say this clearly.  Israel, by going on and on with its policy with no deterrents at any meaningful level, believes it is above international law and above international humanitarian law.  It is simply practising the rule of the jungle.  We at the PCHR represent victims and we believe in the rule of law.   We are an independent, professional organisation.  Of course, while we do believe that we never had justice under the occupation, our professionalism requires us to have the facts in our hands and to resort to the Israeli legal system and exhaust it.  That is why, over tens of years, with thousands and thousands of cases, we have resorted to the Israeli legal system.  We have legally documented all of the war crimes but we never, ever achieve justice for our victims.  We never have the chance for redress.  In hundreds of cases, the Israeli legal system provided full political cover for organised, systematic war crimes perpetrated by the Israeli Government, including the High Court of Justice.  The Israeli High Court of Justice legitimised torture against Palestinian prisoners, and it legitimised targeted killing, house demolition, and a lot of other matters that are illegal under international humanitarian law.  This is why, after that, we resorted to universal jurisdiction and that is why we fight cases against some of the Israeli suspects at military, security and political level, as well as those involved in the chain of command whom we suspect committed war crimes in different states, including Europe, the UK, Spain, Switzerland, South Africa and Sweden.  Unfortunately, soon after courts in the UK and Spain issued warrants to arrest and investigate some of these cases, apologies came: the laws are changing, providing more legal and political immunity for Israel and its leaders who are suspected of committing war crimes.<\/p><p>The ICC is the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;meof the human experience and when we try to resort to it, it is as if we invented it.  Given that we resort to international humanitarian law on human rights, Israel considers it warfare against the State of Israel.  Shame on it.  Israel also says we are the agents of terrorist organisations and we are misusing international humanitarian law.  We are saying, in simple, clear words that Israel practises the rule of the jungle in the occupied territories and against Palestinian civilians. The result of that is obvious and clear; it is incredible and criminal.  The result of the last offensive launched against Gaza was 557 children killed and 334 women killed.  Very cheap blood, very cheap souls.  Hospitals, operating theatres and ambulances are targeted.  Shelters and schools of UNRWA which chose to be used as shelters, were targeted day and night.  The electricity factory has been targeted along with our sewerage system.  Once again, they did not leave anything.  They stated clearly they want to send us back to the Middle Ages.<br\/><br\/>We have no right to be good victims and we have no right to give up.  We are a free people who will not accept the <i>status quo<\/i>.<font color=\"#FF4040\"> <\/font>We are entitled to our right of self determination, we are entitled to independence.  Israel should choose what it wants.  The PLO charter is simple and clearly talks about one secure Palestinian state for the Christians, Muslims and Jews.  Olof Palme and Bruno Kriesky suggested that for Arafat but this is interpreted as a call for the destruction of Israel.  He agreed upon the two state solution and Gaza was spared including Jerusalem in 1974.  Since 1974 the journey has been long, suffering increases and death is everywhere.  Of the accords I mentioned, this is its harvest.  We did not kill Yitzhak Rabin - they did.  The situation is so hard, so abhorrent, that what we ask is not too much, we simply want the rule of law and protection for our civilians.  We want to know our destiny and fate and we are entitled to our Palestinian state.  The situation may be hard and unprecedented but the way things are now we believe the worst is yet to come, but that does not make us feel despair.  We know and we are sure we are on the right side of history, that we will enjoy, and are enjoying our moral superiority in this criminal occupation.<\/p><p>We are sure that tomorrow is ours.  We are a free people who believe in the rule of law, not the law of the jungle.  We badly need clear-cut support for our aspiration of self-determination and independence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015093000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raji Sourani","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sourani for his very emotional contribution.

The Israelis are in full control and decide what kind of food we can eat, what kind of clothes we wear and what comes in or out of Gaza.  The Israeli High Court of Justice shamefully stated in response to a petition we submitted that nobody should worry about famine in Gaza because Israel counts how many calories each Gazan gets and will ensure nobody dies from hunger.  If this is not racism, how else does one describe it?<\/p> <p>  Trying to move is a mission impossible.  As many as 99.99% of residents are unable to move anywhere.  A very small percentage, perhaps between 1,000 and 8,000 people from a population of 2 million, are able to move between Gaza and the West Bank.  These are businessmen, some Palestinian Authority officials and some sick people who occasionally receive medical care in Israeli hospitals.  They move through the Erez checkpoint or Egypt, which opens the crossing at Rafah every two or three months.  The Sinai is a dangerous place to travel through but fortunately 4,000 or 5,000 are able to cross at Rafah.  Movement outside Gaza is almost a mission impossible.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the construction of Gaza, after three wars one can physically see the destruction and smell death all over Gaza.  The destruction is almost intact and nothing has been reconstructed.  UNRWA suggests that, at current levels, it will take between 25 and 30 years to reconstruct Gaza.  We are talking about the results of the war.  Some 65% of the population of Gaza are either unpaid or unemployed, 90% live under the poverty line and 85% are entirely dependent on UNRWA's food programme, the World Food Programme, etc.  Practically-speaking, we have been shifted to become a nation of beggars.  Are we so?  We have no illiteracy in Gaza and one of the highest percentage of university graduates on earth.  We have a strong and skilled business community and a highly skilled working class.  However, we do not have a right to be normal and use our potential.  We are not even allowed to treat our water or sewage, which is completely polluting our beaches and water table, making the water undrinkable.  All this is taking place in the name of security.  Our fisherman are not allowed to fish more than three nautical miles from the coast.  Farmers in Gaza, which is a tiny place, are not allowed to farm within 1 km of the borders.<\/p> <p>  Israel is making our lives hell.  We only have electricity for six hours each day.  We are not allowed to extract and use our gas, which lies just offshore.  In simple words, the situation is the biggest man-made disaster in modern history.  The law of the jungle applies in that part of the world.  That is not a secret and most members are aware of the position.  This information has been published by us and all human rights organisations and, therefore, nobody can say, \"We did not know.\"  The question is why Israel is not held accountable for the war crimes and crimes against humanity it is perpetrating.  I hope the conscience of the world, especially in western Europe, wakes up and follows the good example of Ireland in supporting the rule of law, rather than the law of the jungle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015093000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raji Sourani"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":506,"content":"<p>Are the tunnels still in operation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015093000002#G00100","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443603600,"counter":507,"content":"<p>The tunnels have almost stopped operating.

The phrase \"inhumane siege\" was used to describe the position in Gaza, which is temperate language considering the serious loss of life and suffering taking place there.  Given the other crises taking place throughout the world, the position in Gaza and Palestine has not featured on the front pages of our newspapers and has not been given the ongoing coverage in the broadcast media that it requires.<\/p> <p>  It is worth noting some of the figures provided to members in a briefing.  A total of 2,251 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians, were killed in the conflict in 2014.  In addition, among the young cohort of the population, 551 children were killed, 3,436 were injured and 1,500 were orphaned.  One also has the continued displacement of people and the day-to-day problems facing all sections of society in Gaza.  This is a stark reminder of the extremely difficult and totally unacceptable position that many Palestinians face.  <\/p> <p>  What options are available to Ireland to support reconstruction in Gaza and end the economic blockade that has been ongoing for the past eight years?  I understand only 1% of the construction materials needed to rebuild Gaza have reached their destination.  We are all aware of the great pledges that were made at the pledging conference.  As usual, these pledges have not been realised.  In fairness to Ireland, successive Governments have honoured our overseas development assistance and humanitarian aid pledges, and this continues to the case.  Other countries, as well as the European Union, which has been a good donor, should continue to try to rebuild Gaza.  <\/p> <p>  How can Ireland support efforts to try to ensure accountability for violations of international law in the conflict?  Mr. Sourani raised this issue in his concluding remarks.  I have in mind the Human Rights Council of the United Nations, in which Ireland participates, and the International Criminal Court. <\/p> <p>  The European Union is Israel's largest trading partner.  Surely, as a union of 28 member states with a population of 500 million, the EU should exert greater pressure to ensure Israel lives up to its obligations under international law.

I have been to the West Bank twice in the past three years and have certain memories that will always stay with me.  One is controlled movement, the appalling way Palestinian people are treated when they try to go to work, to visit people or to avail of education.  Another is the small farming village of Einun and how it stood up to the aggression and encroachment.  I remember in Hebron watching some newer settlers who, I understand, are much more aggressive than the older Israeli settlers who have been there from the beginning.  They walked around the lovely town carrying Kalashnikovs, Uzis or whatever, and that was normality.  <\/p> <p>  I also think about some of the very positive things, such as Al Rowwad and its theme of beautiful resistance, the youth groups, the theatre groups, the music and the composers we met there.  Great work was done on heritage in Birzeit.  There are many contradictions and how people survive in that situation I do not know.  How they survive in Gaza is almost impossible to comprehend.  There are two phrases I recall from Mr. Sourani's speech which resonated with me.  One is that the situation is making the region a nation of beggars and that the people have the right to be normal.  I am interested in his answer to the question put by Deputy Smith.<\/p> <p>  I have some questions.  I refer to people with disabilities.  Whatever about able-bodied people trying to cope with living in such a horrible situation, people with disabilities must face increased difficulties.  I would be interested to hear what sort of support is available for such people.  <\/p> <p>  A major conference in New York at the weekend discussed sustainable development goals.  Does Mr. Sourani see any scope in that for a better outcome?  It would make one lose faith or confidence in the UN.  I do not know how he feels about that.  Humanitarian aid is not a substitute for the denial of dignity or rights.  How do people hold on to their dignity in Gaza when they face such deprivation and destruction?<\/p> <p>  People here know of my support for Cuba.  I do not know how many resolutions were passed by the UN, but 97% or 98% of countries agreed that the blockade should stop.  It has not stopped and the same situation faces Palestine and Gaza when it comes to UN resolutions.  Does Mr. Sourani have confidence that the UN can do anything?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015093000002#H00200","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Mr. Sourani and Mr. Walsh are very welcome.  I wonder what we can do.  This committee has passed very strong resolutions and has passed them on to the Government.  During one summer, as a result of an Israeli blitzkrieg, there was an emergency recall of the Seanad and some very strong speeches, which were broadcast on YouTube and so on, were made.  That seems to have had very little effect.  <\/p> <p>  I was struck by two phrases used by Mr. Sourani, namely, whether the Israelis now presume themselves to be above the law and that what obtains in Gaza is the law of the jungle.  What can we or Mr. Sourani do?  There are human rights protocols attached to the EUROMED agreement, which is a trade agreement between the European Union and the state of Israel.  They are never monitored.<\/p><p>I wonder, in light of Mr. Sourani's professional involvement in these human rights cases, whether the Palestinian authorities or his organisation have thought of sending a dossier to the European Union committee which supervises EUROMED, telling it about clear and acknowledged international war crimes?  The Israelis have admitted that, when they said the blitzkrieg was a result of the tragic kidnapping and murder of three Israeli youths.  That is obviously collective punishment.  <\/p><p> Could Mr. Sourani give us any update on the Palestinian case against Israel before the International Criminal Court?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015093000002#H00300","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I would like to join in the welcome to Mr. Sourani and Mr. Walsh.  What they outlined to us is truly shocking and appalling.  The statistics provided to us by Tr&oacute;caire highlight the appalling situation that exists.  I apologise for having to leave the meeting; I missed some of the other contributions.  The witnesses referred briefly to the lack of construction activity in Gaza since 2014 and the fact that it would take 25 years to reconstruct all the buildings that had been levelled.  Has the policy on the transportation of building materials been loosened up in recent times?  What progress, if any, has been made recently?  It was stated that 80% or 90% of the water is unfit for human consumption.  How is the community managing to survive in Gaza with that level of contamination and lack of infrastructure?<\/p> <p>  The question we all have to ask is how, politically, we can keep the pressure on Israel to loosen up on the curtailment of activity in Palestine and to improve the human rights situation.  It appears that it is ignoring all international law.  Nobody is being brought before the International Criminal Court.  Why is that?  What can the international community, Europe and, in particular, our Government do to bring pressure to bear on the international community to examine the very serious situation which has persisted?  Over 2,000 civilians, as well as 550 children, have been killed in the past seven years.  Everybody seems to be acting with impunity.  They are my main concerns.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Walsh and Mr. Sourani referred to legitimised torture and killings and to the fact that the people have been turned into a nation of beggars, a phrase which struck me very severely, depending totally on the goodwill of other nations to provide the very basic necessities of life.  This is a major human rights situation which involves crimes against humanity.  How can we act collectively to bring the people responsible before the International Court of Justice?  How can we help the people in Gaza?  We are all here to learn how we can assist Mr. Sourani even further and to compliment him on the wonderful work he has done to highlight all of the human rights abuses over a long period of time.  We all feel pretty helpless and disappointed that very little progress has been made, particularly in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015093000002#J00200","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I have two speakers, so I will bring them in.

The issue of the torture of prisoners is of concern to Ireland.  What Ireland can do is win the case of the hooded men in the European courts.  That case has been used for the justification of enhanced interrogation techniques such as food and sleep deprivation, white noise, and stress postilions.  Ireland lost that case against the British Government in the 1970s but there has been further evidence on the effects of that torture on those people.  If that case is won, it would mean that countries such as Israel could no longer use those techniques because they would be officially deemed as torture.  That is something that Ireland can do but we must win that case because it is not only about the hooded men but also about countries using a European Court ruling from the 1970s as justification to do to Palestinians what was done in the North of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I have been to Israel, the West Bank and Palestine.  It is a most distressing situation.  In Jerusalem they are buying houses house by house and community by community.  There is a famous quote by a Prime Minister of Israel who said that as resolutions were being passed when they were building settlements, they were passing resolutions but he was creating facts.  The facts they were creating were settlements in the West Bank.  We know from our own history the consequences of settlements centuries later.<\/p> <p>  The United States is a big player in this and it can bring influence to bear because without the United States, Israel can do as it wishes.  The United States has had a very positive influence on previous peace negotiations.  The Irish Defence Forces have been in Lebanon.  There is a very telling book written by a member of the Irish Defence Forces in which he points out that because of an Israeli Defence Forces targeted attack on a compound of women and children in southern Lebanon which killed hundreds of women and children, one of the 9\/11 attackers, on seeing the TV report of that attack that killed innocent women and children, decided to join the jihad.  That is why he flew a plane into the Twin Towers.  If that is not enough of a compelling reason to change the situation in Israel and Palestine, General Petraeus and General McChrystal have said quite clearly that US foreign policy in the Middle East is killing US soldiers.  There is no more compelling reason for the United States to change its course on Palestine, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank than that, yet we see no change.  Unfortunately, the settlements continue to grow.  When Ronald Reagan was President of the United States, there were 40,000 settlers in the West Bank.  Today there are half a million, and that figure continues to grow.  It is a problem that will only get worse and become more intractable.<\/p> <p>  Ireland's role in helping the people of Palestine is winning the case of the hooded men to ensure that when Mr. Sourani goes back into court, the Israeli Government cannot use that European Court ruling as a defence for what is really torture and which was wrongly classified as enhanced interrogation techniques by the European courts because they were misled and information was withheld from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015093000002#K00100","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and apologise for being absent.  I had to go to the House for a question.  I regret that I missed the presentation but I am reasonably familiar with it because I have visited the territories on a number of occasions.  I have another angle on the issue.  I think it is appalling that human rights abuses continue with impunity.  Seemingly, nobody can influence those who matter to make them to stop.<\/p><p>There are a number of reasons for that.  One is the number of competing atrocities globally at the moment that have taken the focus away from Palestine in recent years.  In turn, this has affected any possibility of there being a global focus on the issue, notwithstanding the fact that these are very serious issues and serious human rights abuses are continuing, which they should not be.<\/p><p> Let us go back to the discussions we have had in this committee on numerous occasions in the past.  There is no focus on that area at present.  No one is saying we must do something about this.  There is no peace process in place.  There is no stage on which the various protagonists can address their issues, whether they be right or wrong.  There must be some structure whereby those who are aggrieved can make their case.  This has to happen at local level, in New York or Washington or wherever.  That is missing at present.  We know from our experience in trying to transition from war to peace that if the structure is not in place to further a peace element, the trickle-down does not materialise and there is no focus on the need to address the human rights issues or the issues that are causing the problems.<\/p><p> I will finish by saying what I have said many times in the past in respect of other situations.  As long as people focus on the past they are never going to resolve the future, but there is no focus on the present at the moment in respect of that subject.  I do not pretend to be an expert in the area but I know that if there is no structure in place to address the issues to which the witnesses no doubt referred in their contribution, we are going to remain where we are.  The sad thing about it is that things tend to get worse.  An atrocity today becomes a worse atrocity tomorrow by way of retaliation or response.  I cannot emphasise enough the necessity of intervening in a positive way by putting in place a structure for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015093000002#K00200","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":518,"content":"<p>There were some questions in between all the statements.

There was a question regarding settlement products and the labelling of settlement products.  In the EU the only states thus far that have introduced guidelines or regulations on the labelling of settlement produce are the United Kingdom and Denmark.  There is momentum at EU level to introduce EU-wide guidelines on labelling.  The EU High Representative, Ms Mogherini, has made some positive statements recently in that regard.  There are hopes that perhaps before the end of the year we might even have movement on that issue.<\/p> <p>  The Tr&oacute;caire position is that we are hearing about grave violations of human rights.  Mr. Sourani has eloquently put the case to the committee.  Matters of grave violations of human rights are not matters of consumer choice.  We need a far stronger response from the European Union and the international community.  We maintain that a ban on trade with the Israeli settlements is necessary.  To its credit, Ireland is the only EU member state that has publicly supported such a ban.  Labelling is an important first step but the EU should move towards banning settlement products.<\/p> <p>  Senator Norris mentioned the issue of the EU-Israel Association Agreement which regulates trade between the EU and Israel.  He referred to Article 2 which holds that the agreement is based on human rights.  However, there are no adequate mechanisms to monitor it.  The agreement is conditional on human rights but it is not monitored.  There is a sub-committee involving the EU and Israel on human rights but it is not effective.  The matter needs to be brought up at EU Foreign Affairs Council level.  It must be raised at political level.  We maintain that Ireland should raise the matter at that level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015093000002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garry Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Before I call Mr. Sourani to reply to the questions from members, we have the unusual matter of a vote in the Parliament this morning.

This is something very positive and reassuring for us.  We do not occupy Israel.  Israel has occupied us for the past 48 years.  We do not have nuclear arms.  Israel, according to Mordechai Vanunu, has 85 warheads, although that was 15 years ago.  We do not have the fourth mightiest army on earth.  Israel does.  Unlike the Israeli army, we are not overseeing a belligerent criminal occupation, but we are always accused of being the victimisers of the occupation.  It is like something from Kafka in the way it is always represented.<\/p> <p>  What can Ireland do?  I am keen for this respected committee to write to the foreign Minister about specific points.  Ireland is a member of the UN Human Rights Council.  A fact-finding mission from the council has just concluded and the report has been approved and endorsed by the Human Rights Council.  I suggest strongly that Ireland, regardless of whether it is a member, as it has done previously, should take the lead in this regard and take the recommendations of the fact-finding mission and try to ask Europe to act accordingly.  This means trying to implement all the recommendations, including referring the report to the International Criminal Court to investigate what has happened in the occupied Palestinian territories.<\/p> <p>  The point of departure is the criminal, illegal and inhuman siege on Gaza.  These are not our words.  They were said by the guardian of the Geneva Convention, the International Committee of the Red Cross.  The ICRC has used the words \"siege,\" \"illegal\" and \"inhuman,\" as well as statements to the effect that collective punishment against Palestinian civilians should be abolished immediately and completely, not partially.  These words come from an ICRC public statement.  Nothing less or more than that should happen.  The siege should be abolished.<\/p> <p>  It is unacceptable to us that Europe provides more legal and political immunity to suspected war criminals.  Article 1 of the Geneva Convention sets out in clear-cut terms the obligation of the high contracting parties.<\/p><p>It states that the high contracting parties of the Geneva Convention should ensure the due applicability of the convention.  Therefore, we are talking about a legal obligation on states.  It is not a proponent, it is not political.  They have to do it.  This is not a Palestinian invention; it came after the Second World War.  It is there to protect civilians at a time of war.  Accountability is a must, not only to take care of those who committed war crimes, but to deter them and others and ensure this does not recur.<\/p><p> Fourth, there is not a single word in the Oslo Accords about international law, international humanitarian law and human rights.  This is not a coincidence.  We know the Israeli legal team.  It numbered 38, headed by Mr. Joel Singer, one of the top-notch lawyers and the ex-military prosecutor in Israel.  Also, there was no legal adviser for the Palestinian negotiating team.  That is why, when we used to say constantly to respected foreign Ministers and other bodies in the European governments we must ensure respect for the rule of law, democracy and human rights, there was always the counter argument that they understand that fully but they have also to take care of peace and security.  Peace and security implies victimisation or the marginalising of the rule of law, democracy and human rights.  The question is, since when did the rule of law, democracy and human rights contradict peace and security?  These are complementary.  After 20 years, this showed this was absolutely wrong because the harvest we are having right now is the rule of the jungle.<\/p><p> Regarding point number five, all that Palestinians seek and ask for is simple.  We do not want more than the rule of law.  One is conveying a message to the Palestinian people and to the region and it is a very vital, important, strategic message.  We hate bin Laden and ISIS for the simple reason they operate under the rule of the jungle and if the people feel the West is on the same faulty steps and does not apply the rule of law, then the people will be very confused.  Ireland is a unique position.  It has the experience and the moral authority to lead at European level the way for rule of law at that part of the world in this precise conflict.  This, including the encouragement of using the International Criminal Court, ICC, is needed badly.<\/p><p> Regarding the United Nation's efficiency there, of course, the Quartet, of which the United Nations is a party, is complicit in the siege.  This is unique because what the United Nations should do is observe the rule of law and try to provide protection for the civilians under the occupation.<\/p><p>What is happening is that the United Nations is part of this siege according to the Quartet resolution.  It is unprecedented in the history of the United Nations.<\/p><p> The problem of the handicapped in Gaza is serious and chronic.  It is one of the problematic issues for many reasons.  These people not only have traumas, they also have personal or family problems.  This is a societal problem.  We are talking about tens of thousands of handicaps as a result of these three wars in the past five years.  Needless to say, besides the handicapped people problem, we have as well the psychological problem of the people.  There is a deep level of anger and frustration and that has been reflected negatively on the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015093000002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raji Sourani","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sourani.

One has no hope for tomorrow.  There is death and poverty all over the place.  One has nothing to lose, and that is the recipe.  It is a miracle we do not have al-Qaeda in Gaza.  I am not saying we do not have ISIS or al-Qaeda in Gaza.

That is why those, like me, who are angry and frustrated, who see the rule of the jungle operating and who see the civilised western governments providing legal and political immunity and not caring really about the applicability of the rule of law and international law, see what we have in that part of the world as the Roman Empire rules where there is law for masters but no law for slaves.  We, the Palestinians, are considered like slaves.  We have no holy blood, no holy souls and it is fine if we are killed or persecuted.  What seems most important is Israeli Jews, not that every human being is holy, irrespective of colour, sex, nationality, race or religion.  That is why we do not want to have selectivity.<\/p><p>A couple of days ago I came from London, and on the plane I read the <i>Daily Mirror<\/i>.  There was an interview in it with the Prime Minister of the UK in which he said that Assad should not be in power because he commits war crimes and crimes against humanity and that he should be held accountable and moved from authority.  I agree 100% with the Prime Minister of the UK, but this applies to Israel on the same level.  They are committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.  It is not a secret.  It has been broadcast live on air in real time with the whole world watching it.<br\/><br\/>Israel has asked the Pope to apologise because he knew about the Holocaust and did not react.  Can anybody say they do not know what is happening with the Palestinians?  They know and they have to act, otherwise there will be this alternative - the rule of the jungle.

As part of the Government's response to the crisis, the Minister for Justice and Equality brought proposals to the Government which were considered and agreed at a special Cabinet meeting on 10 September.  The multifaceted approach that is being adopted includes the establishment of an Irish refugee protection programme, which will provide international protection to up to 4,000 people under resettlement and relocation programmes.  It is expected that this number will be augmented by further family reunifications.  The number of people in need of international protection will be kept under review.  It has also been decided to establish a new cross-departmental task force, chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality, to deal with the operational and logistical aspects of the support programme.  A range of Government Departments will be represented on and involved in the task force, which has already had its first meeting and will work with non-governmental organisations, religious bodies and local authorities.  In addition, the Red Cross will implement certain elements of the programme.  The UNHCR is also represented on the task force.  The Red Cross will specifically lead the task of engaging with public pledges of support.<\/p> <p>  The Government has also decided to establish emergency reception and orientation centres for the initial reception of those arriving under the relocation programme.  It has also approved the provision of an additional package of processing resources to deal with the major increases in asylum applications and other immigration cases.  The resettlement programme has already commenced.  A number of people who were selected through the UNHCR process from Lebanon have already arrived.  They form part of the overall number of 520 people involved in that programme.  The first relocation measure to be approved by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 14 September last involves an overall number of 40,000 and Ireland will be taking 600 from that.  The next package of measures, which was agreed on 21 September, involves some 120,000 people who are in need of international protection.  The overall number that Ireland will take under that package is approximately 1,850.  The precise number has not yet been worked out, but that is the best estimate at this point.<\/p> <p>  As I have indicated, an interdepartmental and inter-agency task force has been established.  In addition, a number of subgroups have been established to look at specific areas.  In that context, the Department of Justice and Equality will take the lead in the process of relocating people to Ireland, in the refugee assessment process and in the establishment of the orientation centres.  Work has commenced with the Office of Public Works and the Department of Defence on looking at the available State properties that could possibly be used.  Other options will also be considered.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the city and county managers will take the lead in providing accommodation to people who are granted refugee status.  As I have said, the Red Cross will take the lead in the overall co-ordination and management of the many pledges of support that have come from the public.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will also liaise with the non-governmental organisation community.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. John Roycroft, has just been appointed to head up a new project and programme office that has been established in the Department.  That office will co-ordinate the various aspects of the programme across the Department.  Preparations are under way for working with our EU colleagues abroad.  The Refugee Applications Commissioner will outline the further arrangements in that regard.  The best practice for dealing with people who are arriving in these circumstances is for them to be accommodated in a single location, rather than being dispersed immediately.  It is likely that they will come with a common language and without a knowledge of Ireland.  It is considered best practice to deliver services in a co-ordinated fashion at a single centre rather than dispersing individuals immediately.  The intention is that these people will be processed through the asylum process very quickly.  After that has happened, other State bodies and agencies will take over the task of finding longer-term accommodation, etc.  That covers my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Kirrane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443603600,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I am the head of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  I am also the deputy chairperson of the European Asylum Support Office, which is the EU agency that is responsible for asylum operational issues in the EU.  The functions of my office in Dublin are to investigate applications for refugee status from individuals, applications from refugees for their family members to join them in the State and applications for subsidiary protection.  Two forms of international protection are processed by my office - refugee status under the Geneva Convention and subsidiary protection, which is a form of protection under EU law.  The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner employs 100 civil servants.  We also employ a panel of legal practitioners on a contract for service basis.  Both the civil servants and the legal practitioners undertake the interviews.  They will be doing the interviews for the people coming here under the relocation programme.  The actual recommendations are made to the Minister for Justice and Equality by civil servants in my office.  We also have a wide variety of other functions.  When we are processing asylum cases, we must schedule interviews, organise interpreters and carry out country of origin research.  A vast array of backroom work has to be carried out as well.  All of our case workers, panel members and other staff undergo rigorous training from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  The decisions we make in our office are subject to quality assurance by the UNHCR, which is the international agency with a mandate for protecting asylum seekers and refugees.<\/p> <p>  The plan for the Irish refugee protection programme is that people being relocated to Ireland from Greece and Italy will be processed by my office.  From an operational perspective, this will mean members of my office will participate in liaison teams in Italy and Greece to help in the selection of the applicants concerned and to organise their transport to Ireland and other logistical arrangements.  It will also involve processing applications.  Those applications will be processed at the emergency reception and orientation centres.  One of the specs in the establishment of these centres will be that interview facilities will have to be provided to my office.  This will involve my staff and panel members going to the office to organise the interviews.  Under the EU decision, there is a requirement for those coming in to be fingerprinted and issued with residence cards.  We will do that as well.  All the applicants concerned are from countries of serious conflict, such as Syria and Eritrea.  They are all likely to have well-founded claims for refugee status.  Accordingly, I will be able to prioritise them in line with powers I have under the Refugee Act.<\/p><p>Depending on the complexity of the cases involved and a range of factors, such as date of arrival and further numbers because they will be coming in groups over two years, it is anticipated that the processing of applications in the reception and orientation centres will take a number of weeks.<\/p><p> In terms of the readiness of my office, we have already commenced planning for this.  We have set up a working group with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, which is advising us on the approach we should take.  We intend to utilise our already well-tuned systems for interviewing, organising interpreters and undertaking country of origin research.  We have the process and the infrastructure in place.  I am also a member of the interdepartmental task force established by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We will be working closely with the UNHCR and a UNHCR expert on international protection and refugee law will be seconded to the office to guide us in the approach we take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kirrane and Mr. Costello for updating us on the situation.

While the staff who work there are exceptional and go far beyond the call of duty to look after the people who live there, the system is completely flawed.  The people live in terrible situations.  Some of them have been living in mobile homes for more than ten years.  These are people who are already here, but now we are going to bring more people in on top of that.  The places people are saying may be suitable as reception centres include empty Army barracks, one of which is in my constituency.  I would not like to bring my family to live in one of those barracks.  It is not fair to people.  We also have a serious housing issue to which Deputy Finian McGrath referred.  If one puts people into a reception centre and processes them, where are we going to house them afterwards given the serious housing issue?

As to the conditions, we intend that the facilities will be the best that can be provided and the intention is that they will not be in these centres for long periods.  Talk of ghettoisation is not what we have in mind.  The intention is that people will come into the centres, stay for a relatively short period and then be dispersed in small numbers throughout the country so that everybody can manage how that is dealt with from an integration perspective and so on.

Specifically, a task force has been established, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in to examine the issue of transiting those who have been granted refugee or other status from the direct provision.  It has been working over the past two months and will conclude its work in the next few weeks and report to the committee.  We have examined the number of people in the system who need to transition out.  Overall, a good proportion move within three months and the vast majority move within six months.  There is a recognition that there is a need to provide more information and services to these people, and the task force is examining producing an information pack for people to help them to transition more quickly from direct provision.  People move out relatively quickly.<\/p> <p>  The difference between this group and those who are in the direct provision system is that the intention is that they would be processed very quickly.  Part of the difficulty with the direct provision system is that children are already established in schools or people have families, and moving to a different location where accommodation may be available is not always very easy.

In regard to the first issue, we need to win hearts and minds among our own citizens.  Obviously the witnesses have heard the commentary around \"we have a housing crisis and we need to address that\" or \"we still have an unemployment crisis\" and so on.

I believe this will assist the Committee in better considering the high-level outputs and provide a solid basis for examining what has been achieved.  I will set out the Department's key considerations in framing output targets, but first I would like to provide some context for the current position.<\/p><p>The alignment of expenditure programmes with output targets and their publication within the Revised Estimates volume was an important development, and I am pleased to note that the committee may have some useful suggestions as to how these output targets may be improved.  My Department has been engaging with the committee secretariat to set out the context for the current indicators and discuss possible future developments.  The expertise on defence matters rests within the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, including the identification of appropriate output targets.  I understand that the pros and cons of possible approaches were discussed at length.  However, I will not enlarge upon these discussions beyond what may not have been fully reflected in the brief that the committee received from the secretariat.<\/p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for publishing the Revised Estimates volume, and my Department has had extensive engagement with that Department in framing the current measures.  This built upon the work that was previously undertaken in preparing annual output statements.  The space made available for output targets and associated reporting within the Revised Estimates volume has informed the approach used by the Department and has required a reduction in the amount of information that was previously provided.  However, this information is still reported within the annual report of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, and my Department has provided much of this information for inclusion in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's publication <i>Ireland Stat<\/i>, although this has not been activated by the Department as yet.  In this context, there is a significant amount of performance information produced and publicly available.  The output targets currently in use reflect those factors as well as the nature of defence provision and critical success factors that must be considered.  <\/p><p>Security is the bedrock on which a State's economic, political and social well-being is built.  Security challenges require a whole-of-Government response, and there are a range of Departments and agencies with security responsibilities that contribute to the State's overarching security framework.  The defence contribution encompasses defence of the State from external armed aggression, which is a contingency; the defence contribution to domestic security; and the defence contribution to international peace and security.  In addition, defence capabilities are used to provide a broad range of non-security supports which maximise the value for money of defence expenditure and reduce duplication of service delivery across the State.  The recently published White Paper provides a useful framework for considering those outputs which are critical to the successful delivery of the defence mission, which is &quot;To provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government.&quot;  The White Paper sets out a comprehensive assessment of the security environment and any threats that arise.  The ongoing monitoring of the security environment is a key requirement that has a major influence on the defence policy response, operational requirements and associated capability planning.<\/p><p>As outlined in the White Paper, Ireland continues to strongly support the multilateral system of collective security represented by the UN and the primary role of the UN Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  The EU is also a major player on the international stage, with an increasing capacity to influence the international security environment using all of the instruments at its disposal, including economic, diplomatic, political and military instruments, known as the &quot;comprehensive approach&quot;.  Within the framework of multilateralism and collective security, and in support of international peace and security, the White Paper states that Ireland will continue to contribute to a range of comprehensive and collaborative security arrangements within the EU, the UN and the OSCE, and bilaterally with other states.  This ongoing policy development represents a key defence output that contributes to Ireland's security.  Domestically, the continued refinement of the State's emergency planning framework and further development of defence capabilities in support of other Departments and agencies are also key policy areas for the Department.<\/p><p>As set out in the White Paper, the role of the Defence Forces reflects the Government's policy requirements and the operations that the Defence Forces may be required to undertake.  The roles have been updated to take account of new developments or those which have acquired an increased importance.  Many of these operations are demand-led and reflect the contingent nature of many defence operations - those that are dependent on need, or those that are subject to Government requirements, such as overseas missions.  As such, the target is to meet demand when required.  This is the nature of defence business and defence outputs.  <\/p><p>The general approach within defence is to develop memorandums of understandings with those Departments and agencies that may require defence assistance.  In many cases, this provides a means to clarify call-out procedures and the availability of defence assistance.  However, due to the demand-led nature of most of these services, they do not contain specific targets for numbers of operations.  The exception to this is the annual control plan agreed with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, which sets out Naval Service fisheries patrol day targets and Air Corps fisheries patrol flight targets.  The committee will see from the figures that we have some challenges in terms of outputs as regards Naval Service fisheries patrol days this year, for understandable reasons.  I will go into those later.  <\/p><p>The White Paper also considers future capability requirements.  It defines military capability as the ability to attain operational success in a given scenario, achieving desired effects under specified standards and conditions through ways and means.  It consists of a conceptual component, a moral component and a physical component.<\/p><p>There are a range of actions across the Department and the Defence Forces which are required to develop and maintain military capabilities.  These actions include, but are not limited to, investment in new equipment, education and training, maintenance and development of infrastructure, ongoing review of military doctrine, the development of appropriate human resources, HR, policies and the development of regulatory frameworks.  These actions are internal processes that contribute to capability outputs but are not capability outputs in themselves.  There is no universally accepted metric for military capability, which is a key output for Defence Vote 36.  This is a challenge for all countries including those with well developed performance reporting mechanisms.  The Department has closely examined the approach in other countries, such as New Zealand, which I know this committee has examined, where capability reporting is underpinned by a broad performance reporting framework including annual reports, with a view to identifying appropriate metrics.<\/p><p> Defence Vote 36 outputs are delivered through a single programme with three strategic dimensions which are interdependent.  First, defence policy, which is policy outputs; second, ensuring the capacity to deliver, which is capability outputs; and third, Defence Forces operations, which is operational outputs.  This provides a balanced perspective on defence outputs, all of which are critical to success.  My Department has engaged with the committee secretariat in reviewing this categorisation and I am satisfied that this represents a solid approach to categorising defence outputs and is not inconsistent with the approach taken internationally.<\/p><p> The refinement of output targets remains a work in progress, and I particularly welcome the signals from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that more space will be forthcoming in the 2016 Revised Estimates to report on outputs.  This will broaden the options for the Department in developing appropriate targets, and I intend to take this opportunity to expand reporting on military capabilities.<\/p><p> The current measurements of performance on Vote 35 Army Pensions are calculated to show the number of military pensioners in payment plus associated retirement, disability and dependants&rsquo; awards granted during the year and other related metrics.  This reflects the overall annual caseload activity or throughput of the programme.  Such performance measures are relevant and appropriate, bearing in mind the demand-driven and non-discretionary nature of the Vote and the fact that there are no goods or services provided to third parties.<\/p><p> Activity and output under the programme show an underlying upward trend reflecting the increased caseload arising from the continued rise in the number of military pensioners year on year, and a corresponding increase in related activity generally.  In that regard, the Department&rsquo;s military pensions output targets for 2013 and 2014, and for 2015 to date, were achieved and I am advised that the Department has no significant concerns around performance or service delivery of Defence Forces pension benefits to beneficiaries.  Following its engagement with the secretariat, the Department is very much of the view that the two output measures currently in use have merit and should continue in use, subject to review in light of the imminent transfer of the military pensions payroll processing function to the Civil Service Payroll Shared Services Centre, which is under the aegis of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p> I am not suggesting that we are perfect.  I believe we can and should work with the committee to try to modernise and change, where appropriate.  If the members have suggestions, we are all ears.  If we can produce better metrics that are effective at practically assessing improvements year on year, I am open to implementing them but I am not open to doing things for the sake of looking good.  <\/p><p> We have a White Paper now.  From a policy point of view the performance indicators for me will be related to how we deliver on the White Paper and the choices it contains.  The nature of defence, which is very different from many other Departments, is demand led.  We need to be ready to respond to an ask of Government or the State, whether that be at home or abroad, often in very difficult circumstances.  What we do control are issues such as fleet replacement programmes in the Naval Service.  We have a very good outcome from the capital plan announced yesterday where, over the next six years, we will see an increase in capital expenditure for defence of &euro;65 million, which is the first increase the Department of Defence has seen for very many years.  We are in a place now that can see the delivery of the ambition in the White Paper on Defence, and I intend on being proactive in terms of making that happen as soon as possible.  The more we can engage with this committee in terms of measuring performance as we go along around efficiency, management and performance, the better but we must make sure that any system or metrics we are putting in place are real in terms of their measurement and that they are relevant to an Irish situation as opposed to simply replicating a New Zealand model, which is a country that has very different challenges from Ireland.<\/p><p> We had this discussion this morning in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and they were also using a New Zealand model in terms of potential metrics for the future, despite the fact that New Zealand agriculture and Irish agriculture have fundamentally different challenges in terms of implementing rural development programmes and the Common Agricultural Policy.  New Zealand does not have any of that.  We should try to design together better metrics for Irish based challenges, and we are open to any suggestions members might have in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#AA00900","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":650,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the presentation.

I am conscious that we are beginning a new process and, to a certain extent, all of us are finding our way in terms of that process.  I do not know if any of the members would profess to be experts in the area of performance targets or indicators but the Minister's point, which is difficult to argue with, that there is no universally accepted metric for military capability is understandable.  At the same time, given that military capability is at the centre of what the Minister's Department does, we would like to hear his view on the New Zealand guidance.  Is it the correct way of setting out performance targets?  That has been the basis for discussion already between the Minister's Department and committee secretariat staff.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on that.  First, is there an acceptance by the Minister and his Department that the New Zealand guidelines is the correct way to go?  Second, would his Department have issues about the way the guidance has been applied to the performance measures?  It is easy to measure performance in terms of capital spent but in the area of military capability, and perhaps in some other areas of activity, it is far more difficult.  For example, the Minister alluded to the White Paper, and we commend him on all the work he has done in bringing that forward, but is the production of the White Paper an appropriate output measure to be considered or does it simply set a target and indicate a policy direction for the Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#BB00300","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I am not quite sure what members have got from us in terms of outputs and so on.  One of the frustrations we had is that the Revised Estimate that shows figures for the Department and then outputs is all on one page.  If we consider what New Zealand does, it has an outputs document, which is almost like an annual White Paper in itself, in terms of outputs across defence, with a series of metrics and performance indicators.  We have no problem with that because we do it anyway for our annual reports and if we could build it into a reporting mechanism that involved the committee and allowed us produce much more volume in terms of what we are trying to achieve, I would have no issue with that.  For example, I see the White Paper as a policy framework that needs to be implemented over the next ten years.<\/p><p>We will have an annual report on the White Paper each year, and I would love to be able to be here to speak to the committee about what we are achieving, changing and improving through the implementation of the White Paper.  It would be a very good performance metric and benchmark for us.  We are looking to increase significantly the size of the Army Ranger Wing.  We need to be questioned each year on how it is being done.  We have problems with recruitment in the Reserve.  This year, 179 people have joined the Reserve.  We have recruitment challenges, and we should be measured and tested against what we think we can do in a 12-month period and what we actually do.  A metric is already there for the Naval Service's role in fisheries protection with regard to hours at sea.  It is a good metric, but this year there is a good reason as to why, knowing we have a problem, we have decided to reprioritise.  This is what the Department of Defence must do.  If people are dying in the Mediterranean and we have ships that can save them, I am sorry, but that is a bigger priority for me than fisheries protection, and I make no apologies for it.  We have had other challenges, such as the late delivery of the <i>LE James Joyce<\/i>and an historical asbestos issue which needed to be resolved.  We have had a number of problems that have had an impact, but this is a good example of a benchmark against which we can be judged.  If we do not meet the benchmark I will need to produce good reasons.  If we could create other metrics and measurements for other outputs for the Department of Defence we should try to do so, but they need to be relevant to what we are actually doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#BB00400","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":654,"content":"<p>Does anyone else wish to speak on this?

The vast majority of people in our Permanent Defence Force are in the Army, and the focus is very much on overseas missions and assisting other arms of the State in the roles they have here.  Capability is very much designed around UNIFIL, UNDOF and training missions in Mali.  Capabilities must be framed in the context of the risk assessment and the response to it.  If we decided not to have any more overseas missions, our capability measurements would be totally different.  We would not need Mowags and the type of armour we use would be different.  That is what we mean when we say there is no set metric for capabilities, because every country has a different focus for defence.  Ireland is very different from our closest neighbour and from other countries.

The combined Estimates for defence and Army pensions for 2015 provided for gross expenditure of approximately &euro;898 million.  Of that sum, &euro;677 million was allocated to Vote 36, which is the Defence Vote.  More than 70% of the Defence Vote goes towards providing for the pay and allowances of up to 10,500 public service employees.  The remaining non-pay allocation provides mainly for the replacement and maintenance of essential equipment and operational costs.<\/p> <p>  The Army pensions Vote makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to or in respect of former members of the Defence Forces.  The 2015 Estimate provides a gross sum of &euro;221 million for the Army pensions Vote as a whole.  More than &euro;211 million of this allocation covers expenditure on all superannuation benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force and their dependants.  It is primarily demand-driven and non-discretionary.<\/p> <p>  Today&rsquo;s meeting is primarily about expenditure relating to 2015, and I take this opportunity to reflect on the importance, both financially and operationally, of having an effective strategic planning framework in place.  In a changing security climate, it was imperative that a strategic assessment of the security environment was undertaken.  This assessment ensures Ireland&rsquo;s defence policy framework is in a position to respond to emerging security challenges and contribute to international peace and security.  After an extensive collaborative process involving multiple stakeholders, I was very pleased to launch the White Paper on Defence in August.  This document reflects the current realities faced within the wider defence and security policy environment, acknowledges the increasingly complex nature of security threats in the world today and emphasises the need for a comprehensive response.<\/p> <p>   The White Paper sets out the roles the Government has assigned to the Defence Forces and considers associated capability requirements.  It sets out proposals on the replacement of major equipment platforms for the next decade and other priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.<\/p><p><font color=\"#002041\">It <\/font>provides clear direction and a pragmatic approach to defence and ensures that we can continue to rely on the service provided by the Defence Forces to the security of the State.  I would also like to highlight some of the other defence-related milestones and achievements throughout the year. <br\/><br\/>As of 15 September 2015, Ireland was contributing 482 Defence Forces personnel to 12 overseas missions throughout the world.  This level of overseas deployment reflects Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing contribution to international peace and security.  The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, with 198 personnel, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, with 141 Defence Forces personnel.  The Minister of State is on his way out to visit them at the moment.<br\/><br\/>In response to the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean and following Government approval, Ireland&rsquo;s overseas deployments now also include the Naval Service deployment to the Mediterranean.  The <i>LE Eithne<\/i>arrived in the south central Mediterranean on 23 May 2015, to assist the Italian authorities in humanitarian search and rescue operations.  The specific role of the Irish naval vessel is to provide a search and rescue capability and to undertake humanitarian rescue operations at sea in the Mediterranean.<br\/><br\/>The<i>LE Eithne<\/i>, during her deployment to the mission from 18 May to 17 July, rescued a total of 3,377 migrants from the waters between Libya and Sicily.  The <i>LE Niamh<\/i>was subsequently deployed and to date has been involved in the rescue of 4,020 migrants.  In total, 7,397 migrants have been rescued by the Irish Naval Service to date.  I think that number has risen since this was written.  Undoubtedly, this is a tragic and highly complex issue but the actions of both the <i>LE Eithne<\/i>and <i>LE Niamh<\/i>have highlighted the capability and commitment of Ireland&rsquo;s Naval Service to respond effectively to crisis situations.  Their outstanding efforts have saved lives, and, to that end, I am pleased to say that the <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>, which departed the naval base, Haulbowline last week, will continue to assist the Italian authorities in this ongoing humanitarian operation.  In the event of any further deployment beyond November 2015, I will revert to Government with proposals. <br\/><br\/>The White Paper reaffirmed my commitment to maintaining the permanent Defence Force personnel at a level of 9,500.  In that regard, a very active recruitment campaign is under way.  Already, in 2015, 194 personnel have completed, or continue, in training, and that number is expected to increase significantly by year end.  In addition, there have been 517 promotions across all ranks of the permanent Defence Force to date in 2015.<br\/><br\/>The Defence Forces continue to provide a military operational response to both the civil power and civil authorities, as required.  This is a vital public service role which highlights the attributes of the Defence Forces across a broad spectrum of areas including prisoner escorts, explosive ordnance disposal duties, air ambulance services, emergency aeromedical support roles, search and rescue missions and maritime patrols.<br\/><br\/>As we advance towards 2016, I expect the Defence Forces to play a very central role in the commemoration events that will take place.  Already in 2015, under the decade of centenaries commemoration programme 2012-22, the Defence Forces have participated in several events including the State commemoration of the funeral of O&rsquo;Donovan Rossa in August.  Additionally, the Defence Forces recently commenced the delivery of the national flag to all primary schools in the country.  This event started on 14 September 2015 and is scheduled to be completed before Proclamation day, 15 March 2016.<br\/><br\/>The recently published White Paper on defence also considered the further development of the Reserve Defence Force, RDF.  It outlines a range of measures which will be progressed during the next few years.  These measures build on the value for money review on the RDF and aim to improve on the overall effectiveness of the RDF.  They should also contribute significantly to recruitment.  If the RDF is doing more, more people will want to be part of it.  The truth is that it is more difficult to get into the RDF now.  There are fitness and other tests.  When people do get in, they are well trained and they are a resource we need to use more and will use more.<br\/><br\/>The naval vessel replacement programme has continued, and the <i>LE Samuel Beckett <\/i>was added to the fleet in 2015, joining the LE James Joyce which was delivered in April 2014.  A third ship purchased under this programme, the<i>LE William Butler Yeats<\/i>, is scheduled for delivery in July 2016.  The progressive and prudent approach taken to these purchases is testament to the value for money ethos prevailing within the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, with these vessels all procured without recourse to additional funding.  This has been achieved by careful management of financial resources and re-allocation of funding to meet additional requests for equipment and supports.<br\/><br\/>The Department works closely with the Defence Forces to ensure that they retain the capabilities to fulfil all roles assigned by Government, both at home and overseas.  In this context, the 2015 allocation allowed for the acquisition and upgrading of a range of priority defensive equipment.<br\/><br\/>The capital envelope for defence also makes provision for infrastructure development works.  The 2015 Estimate made provision for expenditure of &euro;18.5 million on new building works and ongoing maintenance of existing buildings and also included funding for the military archives building at Cathal Brugha Barracks.<br\/><br\/>Over the 2016-21 timeframe of the capital investment programme, significant capital funding will be expended on replacement programmes for defensive equipment across the Army, Naval Service and the Air Corps, including payments arising under the naval vessel replacement programme.  It will also provide for the ongoing refurbishment of a diverse Defence property portfolio and the provision of replacement or additional facilities, where required.  This capital funding envelope also provides for the development of a new institute for peace support and leadership training building on the UN training school in the Curragh.  The institute is intended to provide a new international resource in the area of conflict resolution, conflict prevention and peace-building.  If the committee wants to set up a separate meeting on that particular issue, I would be very happy to do it.  We have a very ambitious approach to developing something very special in Ireland over the next few years and I would happily spend an hour or two talking to the committee about it if it wants that.<br\/><br\/>Before concluding,  I want to refer again to Vote 35 - Army Pensions.  This Vote, which is demand-led, has funded the payment of military pension benefits of all categories to some 12,000 pensioners, including retirement pensions and gratuities, disability pensions, spouses&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s pensions.  Owing to the continued underlying increase in the numbers of retirement pensioners being paid from the Vote and the ongoing impact on pension payments of the exceptionally high numbers of retirements on pension in previous years, a net shortfall of some &euro;9 million is projected for 2015, as it was last year. Therefore, I would like to advise the committee that a Supplementary Estimate will be required later in the year. Similar to other years, this shortfall on the Army Pensions Vote will be met from savings within the Defence Vote.  We are not asking for extra money, we will make the necessary savings and arrangements in our own Vote 36 to be able to deal with this, as we did last year, and we debated it then.<br\/><br\/>In summary, across the combined Votes, expenditure is broadly on target.  Provision has been made to ensure the required funding is available within the Defence Vote to meet the Army pensions shortfall without recourse to any further Exchequer funding requirement.  If anyone has any comments or questions I will happily try to address them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#CC01500","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":669,"content":"<p>Before we go on to that we already wrote to the Minister commending the Naval Service personnel and the work they are doing in the Mediterranean.

I understand there was a fire on a naval vessel in the 1960s which affected two individuals and I have received correspondence from an individual on that subject.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this issue and I would appreciate if it would be possible for him to outline his position on it either to me or through the Chair.  I have no desire to go into the specifics here in committee but perhaps the Minister would be so kind as to provide me with his position.<br\/><br\/>In respect of the Minister's comments and those of the Chair, as an Irish person one must be immensely proud to observe the absolutely critical mission the Naval Service is completing in the Mediterranean at present.

I echo the sentiments of the Chair in commending all the personnel involved in what is a critical lifesaving mission in the Mediterranean.  Any person who is on board Irish territory in the Mediterranean while carrying out his or her duties can return home rightly proud of his or her involvement in the saving of so many thousands of lives under what I am sure have been horrific circumstances from time to time in recent months.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of the fleet, I was not aware that the name, the <i>LE William Butler Yeats<\/i>, had been selected.

The<i>LE Eithne<\/i>, which basically has been the flagship for the Irish Naval Service for some time, was the first to go and we had an asbestos issue with one of the older ships.  However, all those problems have been resolved and the fleet is back up and running fully.<\/p><p>The Deputy is correct in that the <i>LE Aoife<\/i>was the oldest ship in the fleet.  It is to become part of the Maltese Navy, probably for the next five years, while the Maltese seek to design and build a new vessel.  However, that ship will be put to good use in a part of the world that badly needs capacity at sea, that is, in the Mediterranean.  That vessel has been in Cork Harbour in a dockyard while getting a thorough survey and assessment as well as a bit of work done before going to the Mediterranean.  However, I understand it will be leaving within the next three weeks.  This is a big deal for the Maltese authorities who will be sending some of their senior military personnel to Cork for the ship's departure.  The oldest ship in the fleet at present is the <i>LE Aisling<\/i>, which was built in 1980.  Thereafter, the <i>LE Eithne<\/i>, the <i>LE Ciara<\/i>and the <i>LE Orla<\/i>are all from 1984.  When the<i>LE William Butler Yeats<\/i>arrives next summer, the<i>LE Aisling<\/i>will be decommissioned.  The next ship we will look potentially to replace may well be the<i>LE Eithne<\/i>.  The capacity of that ship is different from all the other ships in that it is the only ship with a helicopter landing pad, although it is not used any more.  Consequently, the Department is examining the possibility of what is described as a blue-green ship, which is a larger vessel that would have more capacity than simply being an offshore patrol vessel such as the<i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>, the<i>LE James Joyce<\/i>or the<i>LE William Butler Yeats<\/i>.  Even though they are really good at what they do and are almost ideal ships for what is needed in Irish waters, I believe we need to have one ship in the fleet that is slightly larger, has more capacity, has a helipad and can play a role both at home and abroad that perhaps is more comprehensive than is possible with some of the other vessels.  There now is enough in the capital programme, the Government having agreed it and published it yesterday, to be able to consider making replacements.  Decisions must be made in respect of budgeting as to whether the<i>LE Eithne<\/i>is to be the first one or whether the <i>LE Orla<\/i>or the <i>LE Ciara<\/i>or both should come first.  It takes about three years to decide that a ship is to be replaced.  One then goes to tender for its design and build and then one actually builds it and our engineers are part of that.  Am I under some time pressure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#EE00500","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I am advised that we must be finished by 3.15 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#EE00600","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":681,"content":"<p>I will be a bit quicker.

I join Deputy Farrell in complimenting everybody in the Naval Service on the work that is being done in the Mediterranean.  It is quite extraordinary and the Irish people at large are appreciative and proud of what their Naval Service is doing there.  Is the Minister confident the Government will agree to extend that activity beyond November?<\/p><p> In addition to the valuable work being done there, can we do more in our international role in addressing the asylum and refugee issue?  We can let it be known that along with what we are doing here indigenously to accommodate refugees, we are also very active daily in a way many other countries are not in this rescue mission.  Some of us are conscious of that but I do not know whether the message has gone abroad that we are daily doing something about that problem.  Does the Minister envisage any position in which our naval personnel can do something of a systematic nature to address human trafficking and abuse?<\/p><p> I am glad the Minister mentioned the reserves and he has made some very positive statements since taking office about the reserves and their role.  None the less, when I speak to reservists, they tell me their practical experience on an ongoing basis is one of impediments being put in their way, with recruitment falling short because of practical obstacles.  It was suggested to me recently that a group of people who passed the various tests which are correctly posed to those seeking to enter the reserves did not get in because the required Garda clearance for the group - there are 100 people - was not sent to the Garda authorities in time.  Neither the potential reservists nor the Garda have control over this and this would not suggest a very positive or proactive approach to recruitment on the part of the authorities with direct responsibility.  I ask that we bring in representatives of the reservists to hear directly from them, given that we had a very useful meeting with them some time ago.<\/p><p> I look forward to a further opportunity to debate with the Minister on the capital investment programme.  I commend the purchasing of naval vessels and the value for money in that respect.  What the Minister outlined today in that case is perfectly acceptable.  The Minister spoke about the peace support and leadership training for the Curragh, and I made a submission on that in the Green Paper.  Our party is very strongly committed to that.  I am conscious that 100,000 personnel are deployed by the United Nations at any given time, which is a lot of personnel in need of training.  Our expertise in peace support, leadership and military diplomacy gives us a capacity to meet a particular demand.  I would love to hear from the Minister at a later date about how ambitious he is for that initiative and how he sees it developing.<\/p><p> I note the Minister has achieved further savings.  The Department of Defence has been outstanding in this regard and I salute all the officials there in how they have achieved savings.  Nevertheless, those savings are being achieved against a background where we are told continually that the people serving in our Defence Forces are heavily dependent on family income supplement and they contend with very poor pay and conditions.  Given the savings, does the Minister accept something substantial must be done in terms of pay and conditions for serving members?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#EE01000","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":684,"content":"<p>There were many issues in that contribution and we are conscious of time, so I ask the Minister to be as brief as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#FF00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I do not have a reputation for being brief in this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#FF00300","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I could not comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#FF00400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I will try to be a little more brief than usual.  There are many good questions there, to be fair.  On the Mediterranean mission, the <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>is due to be back on 5 December.  It is another rotation of approximately eight weeks.  The plan now is that at that point we will not replace the vessel because the anticipation is there may not be much traffic at that time of the year because the weather may make passage difficult.  I certainly anticipate that, because of the success of the mission, we will send a ship back there early in the spring, perhaps in February or March.  Having said that, we will assess the issue and if the Italians say they need us to stay, we will have to respond to that.<\/p><p>This was very new for us during the summer and the Naval Service had three weeks' notice to send a ship to the Mediterranean.  This is putting much pressure on the service and it has performed really well, but it is affecting the other roles it must play.  If we are going to have an approach that keeps a ship abroad permanently on different missions - it is currently in the Mediterranean - we must reflect on whether eight ships is enough for the Irish Naval Service.  We have a responsibility in fisheries patrol and the role must be played as part of the Common Fisheries Policy.  It is not just a voluntary action.  If there is going to be a priority in the Government to maintain a ship in the Mediterranean, it will have resource consequences, just as keeping our Army in UNIFIL and the UN Disengagement Observer Force has resource consequences.<\/p><p>I must flag that idea but I believe in what we are doing in the Mediterranean, which is great work.  I want to ensure we can continue to play a positive role in a very tragic humanitarian issue.  We can reassess that close to the time.  The current plan is to bring home the ship, assess the mission, learn lessons and look to provide the Italians with the assistance of a ship in the spring.  That will be kept under review.<\/p><p>It would be a good idea to bring in the reservists.  I can quote the White Paper and list everything we are committing to do for the reserves.  It is a pretty strong statement.  I accept we are not getting a flood of people looking to join and there are issues to be considered.  We essentially have a reserve at half strength and that needs to change, so we will do it.<\/p><p>On the peace and leadership institute, I have spent much time talking and thinking about the issue and we made a strong commitment in the White Paper.  This concept will grow but we need to do it properly.  We will not do a rush job before the election, for example.  We will put an experienced group of people in place to plan and grow this idea.  We have money to spend on building what will essentially be a new university campus attached to the UN peacekeeping school.  It will become quite a big institute in future.  I will happily speak to the detail of this at a later stage.<\/p><p>Pay and conditions in the Defence Forces are linked to pay and conditions right across the public sector.  We have a new pay agreement and it will kick in from 1 January, costing the Government an extra &euro;300 million next year.  That will be factored into the budget in a few weeks.  The Defence Forces will benefit from that, like everybody else.  We cannot do separate deals for the Defence Forces while leaving out other areas within the public sector.  We would not get the money from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#FF00500","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":688,"content":"<p>Like everybody else, I commend the Army and the Naval Service on the work they do, and I also commend the Minister and his Department.

I would like to see barracks, in my constituency and elsewhere, used for Civil Defence or Reserve Defence Force training.

The Department is undergoing a process of seeking approval for a memorandum of understanding regarding Ireland's proposed participation in the German battle group of 2016.  I will now put some facts into the record for the reasons behind this proposal.  The motion is:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves Ireland&rsquo;s accession to the memorandum of understanding concerning the principles for the establishment and operation of a battle group to be made available to the European Union in the second half of 2016.<\/blockquote> <p>In commending the motion I will now outline the background to Ireland's participation in the German battle group.  The ambition of the EU is to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises.  This is a key objective in the continued development of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy.  In the Headline Goal 2010, the EU set itself the objective of being able &quot;to respond with rapid and decisive action applying a fully coherent approach to the whole spectrum of crisis management operations covered by the Treaty on the European Union&quot;.  This is a mouthful but it is eurospeak for saying that we need to have the capacity to respond to a crisis if and when it happens.  A key element of the Headline Goal 2010 is the capability to deploy forces at high readiness, broadly based on the battle groups concept.<\/p><p>The purpose of the EU battle groups is to undertake operations as outlined in the Amsterdam treaty.  These operations, known as Petersberg Tasks, include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.  In the Lisbon treaty these tasks were expanded to include joint disarmament operations, military advice and assistance tasks in supporting the reform and restructuring of security services and legal institutions in fragile states, conflict prevention and post-conflict stabilisation.<\/p><p>A central tenet of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations.  In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  This commitment has found expression in Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  Participation in EU battle groups represents another means for Ireland to express our commitment to the UN and its principles.<\/p><p>The Defence Forces contribution to this battle group will involve a Recce-ISTAR company together with staff posts at both the operational and force headquarters.  Recce is an abbreviation of reconnaissance and ISTAR is a military term meaning intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance.  The role of a Recce-ISTAR company is to operate in a forward position to generate and deliver specific information and intelligence to decision makers in support of the planning and conduct of operations.<br\/><br\/>The total number of Defence Forces personnel involved in this battle group will be approximately 175.  This level of resource commitment will only arise should the battle group be deployed to undertake an operation and should Ireland agree to participate, and if we agree to participate the triple lock will have to apply.  The commitment in terms of personnel leading up to and during the stand-by period, where the battle group has not been mobilised to undertake an operation, will be eight officers and two NCOs.  These will be deployed to battle group headquarters in Strasbourg and engaged in training and planning activities.<br\/><br\/>The German Battle Group Memorandum of Understanding is an agreement between the participants comprising the battle group, namely, Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Croatia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, which sets out principles regarding to the operation, deployment and management of the German battle group.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Sections 1 to 4, inclusive, deal with the definitions and reference documents that are applicable to this memorandum of understanding.  They define Germany as the framework nation and Austria as the logistic lead nation and broadly outline the purpose of the memorandum of understanding.<br\/><br\/>Sections 5 to 8, inclusive, deal with the consultation process, exercise, training, certification and operation of the battle group.  Most battle group training will take place in the contributing member states.  Irish troops will be mainly trained here in Ireland.  That said, a joint training exercise with other battle group elements will also take place in the east of Germany at some point.  Approximately 170 Defence Forces personnel will be required to deploy to Germany for this exercise, which is scheduled to take place from 18 to 29 April 2016.  The estimated cost of participation in this certification exercise will be in the region of &euro;955,000 to take account of transportation of equipment and the provision of food, fuel and other services in Germany.<br\/><br\/>One important issue to note is that each battle group participant retains the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces, irrespective of an EU decision to launch a battle group operation.  Equally, each battle group participant retains the sovereign right to withdraw its contingent at any time.  The command of each contingent remains under national control, with operational control delegated to the operational commander.  As such, any deployment of the Irish contribution as part of the German battle group will still be subject to the triple lock, which is a UN mandate, Government and D&aacute;il approval, and this will remain unaffected by Ireland signing the memorandum of understanding.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Sections 9 to 13, inclusive, outline the arrangements in terms of financing, logistics, classified information, the status of forces and the issue of claims and liabilities.  When a battle group participant is within the territory of another participant, the issues of jurisdiction and discipline and claims and liabilities of forces will be dealt with in accordance with the NATO Partnership for Peace Status of Forces Agreement, PfP SOFA.<br\/><br\/>A status of forces agreement is an agreement on the status of personnel engaged on overseas training and operations, whereby the host country agrees to extend certain rights and privileges to such personnel.  These include arrangements regarding jurisdiction in respect of certain crimes, powers of military police, enforcement of discipline by the superiors of the relevant personnel and determination of liability for damage to the property of third parties.<br\/><br\/>While all the other German battle group participants have signed the NATO PfP SOFA, Ireland has not yet done so.  We have previously acceded to the relevant provisions of the SOFA, generally through an exchange of letters with the European Union, NATO or lead framework nations for any operation in which we have participated.  It is intended to engage in a similar exchange of letters in relation to these matters in respect of our participation in the German battle group.  It should be noted that the immunities and privileges provided for in the SOFA, including those to which Ireland will accede through an exchange of letters, will not apply within Ireland.  SOFAs respect the principle of territorial sovereignty and given that there is a constitutional impediment to foreign forces being deployed in the State under their own command structures, effectively the terms of the SOFA are of no effect within the State, as no troops can be so deployed.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Sections 14 to 16, inclusive, deal with the process of participation of additional states in the battle group, the timelines for coming into effect and termination of the memorandum of understanding, and the process for dispute resolution.  The terms of the memorandum of understanding are similar to those that Ireland has previously acceded to for the 2008, 2011 and 2015 Nordic battle groups, as well as the 2012 Austro-German battle group.<br\/><br\/>While no battle group has deployed to date, the EU battle group concept has yielded many benefits to developing improved interoperability between the Defence Forces and the forces of other EU member states.  The battle group has also enabled the EU to develop its decision-making processes for rapid deployment on crisis management operations.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of battle groups is, very simply, to enable the Union to be more effective in contributing to international peace and security in support of the United Nations by putting in place a rapid response capability.  In this regard, it is worth again recalling the strong support of the United Nations for the EU&rsquo;s efforts in this regard.  During his recent visit to Ireland in May this year, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon commented positively on the EU-UN relationship and the importance of having a rapid response capacity.<br\/><br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s active engagement in EU battle groups enhances our capacity to influence the ongoing development and evolution of the rapid response capacity of the European Union, in particular, the role battle groups can play in reinforcing and acting as a strategic reserve for UN blue-hat operations.  Active engagement by Ireland across the range of activities under the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy means that Ireland can help shape this policy in a manner which is consistent with our values and our support of multilateralism and for the United Nations.<br\/><br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s participation in battle groups supports the development of rapid deployment skills and capabilities within the Defence Forces, together with improved interoperability with our partners.  It also enhances Ireland&rsquo;s credibility as a provider of professional and effective military forces for crisis management operations.  Finally, it reinforces our standing and capacity to influence the ongoing development of the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy in support of international peace and security and the UN.<br\/><br\/>The term &quot;battle groups&quot; is an unfortunate one because it conjures an image of an army going to war.  That is not what the UN battle groups concept is all about.  It is about trying to create an absence of war and intervene before conflicts arise, or while conflicts are under way, to try to protect civilians, separate warring parties and create peace and stabilisation in parts of the world that desperately need assistance to do that.  They have not been deployed yet even though they have been around for quite some time.  I suspect that may change.  Many countries are losing patience with spending money, training and preparing and not actually deploying that resource.<br\/><br\/>What Ireland is committing to, and which I hope the committee will give its support to, is to be part of that process, which is about Europe using its influence and resources to help create stabilisation in post-conflict situations or to help conflict in the first place.  It makes a lot of sense that, as a country that has a deep history in peacekeeping, we would be part of European efforts in that regard.  I hope the committee will be able to support what we are proposing to do next year to be part of a German-led battle group for the second half of next year.<\/p><p>Do members have questions or comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015093000002#A00300","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443623400,"counter":703,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister that for the lay person the term \"battle group\" is not a very good one.

If there is a fear that we could be dragged into conflict by the back door because we are part of a battle group, people should know that that cannot happen unless we choose to be part of it.  There are safeguards.  In the vast majority of circumstances, if a battle group is to be deployed, it will be deployed in a spirit with which I think Ireland will be comfortable.  We will have to pass the usual triple-lock test before our troops can be part of a mission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015093000002#C00400","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1443623400,"counter":705,"content":"<p>We have not yet signed the status of forces agreement, SOFA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015093000002#C00500","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1443623400,"counter":706,"content":"<p>That is true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015093000002#C00600","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1443623400,"counter":707,"content":"<p>Does that imply that we may do so in the future and, if so, what are the implications?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015093000002#C00700","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1443623400,"counter":708,"content":"<p>We may do so in the future but we are getting legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General.

The Minister indicated that she had received advice from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that this would be unconstitutional.  I am slightly sceptical about the use of advices from the Attorney General that nobody can see, question or read - advices from counsel can be quite nuanced - to shut down debate in this House, which is something that has happened quite a bit in the course of this D&aacute;il.  Has the Minister specifically obtained advices from the Office of the Attorney General - I am not referring to advices that have been hanging around for years - to the effect that there is a requirement to abolish the institution of civil partnership in order to legislate for homosexual marriage?

I will just go over the detail of the policy again and maybe add a little extra to what I said previously.  The policy based on the new constitutional context is that civil partnership registration will cease after a reasonably short period of transition.  As the Deputy knows, section 8 of this Bill repeals most of Part 7A of the Civil Registration Act 2004, which had set out the basis for registration of civil partnerships.  The status of current civil partners remains completely unchanged.  I think we are all very clear about that.  There is no question of removing any of the rights and obligations of civilly partnered couples or of changing their status in regard to each other.  They will be free to marry each other if they so choose, or to remain as civil partners.<\/p> <p>  I would like to say a little more about the legal advice I have received.  I have been advised that it would not be constitutional to keep civil partnership available and to open it to opposite-sex couples as this would create a risk of making civil partnership a potential competitor to marriage.  All of the advice I have makes it clear that making a marriage-like relationship available would violate the constitutional pledge to \"guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack\".  The legal advice I have is that civil partnership was legally and constitutionally justifiable because same-sex couples did not have the opportunity to marry.  Now that same-sex couples can marry, the rationale for civil partnership as a distinct institution has disappeared.  Accordingly, civil partnership is being wound down.  The State is constitutionally prevented from making an alternative legal relationship available to couples, even though some might wish to become civil partners rather than marrying.  That is the legal advice I have.  This is an obvious question that arises.  One has to consider it from a constitutional point of view.  I have set out the advice that is shaping what we are doing in the Bill in relation to the future of civil partnership.  It is very much based on advice relating to the role of marriage in the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015093000002#N00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1443623400,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply.  I do not doubt that the Minister has received this advice, even if I might not necessarily agree with it.  The Attorney General's office is the Attorney General's office.  Ministers and Governments are bound to follow the advice of the Attorney General's office.  The 2010 Act introduced cohabitation and provided for the rights of cohabitees.  If civil partnership is somehow a competitor to marriage, I suggest that the same thing must apply to cohabitation and giving rights to cohabitees.  I am not entirely convinced by the rationale we have heard.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is right when she says that civil partnership is a marriage-like institution.  I do not necessarily know why it has to be a marriage-like institution.  I do not know why the long-standing consanguinity impediments to marriage in Judeo-Christian traditions and Roman law, which predated marriage as a Christian institution, were introduced into civil partnership.  I remind the Minister that the concept underpinning civil partnership is that it gives rights to people living together as a family unit who wish to obtain legal protection for that unit and to give rights to each other in the event that something happens.  A common example of that in Ireland would be two elderly siblings who live together in a fairly dependent way.  They no have rights under the Mental Health or Pensions Acts or anything else.  If something happens one sibling, the other sibling has no rights even though they have been living together as a family for their entire lives, albeit obviously in a non-intimate way.  Irish law provides very little protection to people in such circumstances.  Why do we need to have the consanguinity impediments in civil partnership?  I do not know why civil partnership cannot be open to people who are not otherwise in a civil partnership or married, but are in a non-intimate relationship.  I note that intimacy is not a requirement for being treated as a cohabitee, although I suppose it is presumed that the couple were intimate at one point.  One way of avoiding this idea of competition would be to change the nature of civil partnership and open it up.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to make the point that marriage is a permanent institution, notwithstanding the divorce legislation in Ireland.  It has to be demonstrated that a marriage is irretrievably broken down in order to have it dissolved or to obtain a divorce.  The same thing does not apply to civil partnership.  They are two very different institutions.  I do not really see that one necessarily competes with the other.  People choose to marry or cohabit or whatever.  I think there are other ways around it.

The Minister mentioned administrative burdens to people who are in a civil partnership and wish to marry.  One of the biggest administrative burdens, applying equally to gay and straight couples who wish to enter into a civil marriage, is the inability to get married because of staff shortages in the registrar's office.  People can marry from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday but most people want to marry outside working hours.  We can discuss resources as much as we like but the reality is that resources are not there.  I will propose an amendment to section 54 of the 2004 Act, which sets out who can solemnise a marriage, to include peace commissioners and commissioners for oaths.  These people would clearly have to be accepted by the registrar and demonstrate suitability.  They should be trained and know how to do it.  There are already safeguards, including the requirement to give notice to the HSE, to be interviewed and so on.  All these safeguards should be maintained but it would allow people to get married at a hotel or venue of their choosing outside of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday.

Given the constraints on the committee's time, and I appreciate the difficulties it is labouring under, I will keep my presentation brief to allow maximum time for questions.<\/p> <p>  It was a very busy year, as the committee will see.  Much of the growth we experienced in the number of complaints was probably attributable to the number of new bodies that came into jurisdiction.  It was a very smooth transition in bringing new bodies to jurisdiction.  Some of the themes I have previously spoken to the committee about came to pass during the year.  The casebook celebrated its first anniversary.  Introducing the casebook was one of the commitments I gave when I first came here and I hope the committee finds it useful in its work.  <\/p> <p> The increase in the year was 11%, which was one of the biggest annual increases we have seen.  It posed some challenges for us in terms of dealing with the volume of complaints but in general, we are dealing well with the volumes that reach us, although we did have some difficulties with performance occasioned by some experienced members of staff retiring at the same time, which caused us certain challenges.  Members will see the details of where the complaints were, against who they were made and the outcomes were included in my remarks.  I will not go through them in detail here.  They are also included in the annual report.  <\/p> <p>  As part of our work, we see difficulties with particular agencies that are systemic.  I have mentioned a few of them in my remarks.  Tusla is one particular example.  We continue to have difficulties with the way particular cases are handled where adults are accused of child sex abuse.  While I would not for a moment want to do anything that would undermine the measures put in place to protect the safety of children, it is very important that people facing such serious allegations are also treated fairly and expeditiously and this has not always been the case.  We had a number of constructive meetings with Tusla to try to address these matters.  We have made some progress but it is fair to say that there is still work to be done.  <\/p> <p>  The committee recently took evidence from the Secretary General of the Department of Health about the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant schemes.  The committee was reassured that progress is being made.  I accept that this is the case.  I think we would all take the view that it would be much better if the matter had been concluded by now.  I can only hope that the committee's intervention will lead to an early satisfactory conclusion to that matter.  I continue to hold it under review.  <\/p> <p>  One of the issues I previously spoke to the committee about is the fact that my remit did not extend to private nursing homes.  I am very pleased that this has now been changed.  We ran a series of seminars around the country for the proprietors of homes.  One of the other themes I have talked to the committee about is standardised complaint handling.  As part of taking the private nursing homes into remit, we published our first model complaints policy and this is being adopted by the private nursing homes in dealing with complaints.  This will mean that not only can people come to my office where previously they had no access to independent redress, they can also have some assurance as to the process they can expect the private home to follow when they first deal with the complaint.  It is a substantial piece of work.  It will be some time before we see the impact in terms of volumes of complaints but we are very pleased that this has come about.  <\/p> <p>  Equally, I attended the launch by the committee of its report into issues around direct provision.  My predecessors and I have strongly made the case that people in direct provision and people using the immigration system generally should have the same access to the Ombudsman as people using any other public service.  We are pleased that the committee and the judicial inquiry concluded that this should be the case.  We are looking to have dialogue with the Department of Justice and Equality to progress that but I would welcome the committee's continuing support.  It still seems that there are groups of people, such as prisoners, who are not in jurisdiction who should have access to the services of the Office of the Ombudsman.  <\/p> <p>  The cases the committee sees before it speak for themselves.  I will not go through them in detail to allow members time to get around to questions.  In respect of Learning to Get Better, I want to highlight the fact that this is the first \"own initiative\" investigation to be undertaken by the Office of the Ombudsman in Ireland.  The power has existed for some time but it has not been exercised.  In exercising the power, I have been looking to those individuals who may have difficulty for one reason or another in bringing complaints to my office.  The kind of groups we are looking to for future initiatives could be homeless people or people with intellectual disabilities - people who for one reason or another are less likely to be able to complain.  That seems to me to be the most appropriate exercise of the power.  <\/p> <p>  The report looked at why we were getting low volumes of complaints about health care, which has been a concern of mine because I did not believe that this reflected high standards within the health service.  I believed there were factors operating that were discouraging people from complaining to my office.  The report identified a number of them, not least the fact that people were afraid to complain because they feared negative repercussions for themselves or their loved ones if they did so.  Unfortunately, we did get some examples.  <\/p> <p>  This has been a particularly innovative report.  It sparked a lot of interest from other ombudsmen's offices internationally because we used a set of techniques that are not normally used by ombudsmen.  We invited members of the public to come forward to the office and say what their experience of complaining had been like or if they had not complained, the reason they had chosen not to do so.  We held focus groups.  We went into a selection of hospitals and looked at complaint files to see how they had been handled.  We did things like review websites to see how easy it was to find out how to complain - not very easy was the initial conclusion.  We found that signposting to my office was not happening as it should be.  We have addressed all of those.  The other thing that was innovative about it was that we did work with the HSE.  We shared the draft recommendations of the report so that it could agree to implement them at the point it was launched.  It has agreed to do so.  However, we have met with it and requested a series of action plans.  We have said that we will want updates on the implementation of those action plans and that at a suitable period, perhaps a year after the action plans have been received, we will repeat the investigation on a smaller scale to make sure that the reassurance we have received is reflected in practice on the ground.<\/p> <p>  I will stop at this point.  I know it is a whistle-stop tour but in fairness to the members, keeping it brief is probably preferable.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015093000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall"},{"type":"speech","time":1443625200,"counter":783,"content":"<p>Before I let my colleagues in, I have a few questions to ask.  I commend the Ombudsman on the Learning to Get Better report.  I know that from the get go, this is an issue he has committed himself to changing.  I commend him and his team on the progress he has made.  However, I would relate to him my experience.  As he knows, it has changed from dealing with individual hospitals to dealing with hospital groups.  With the centralisation of administration, I have found that to be very frustrating as a public representative.  Obviously, all that we can do is clarify a patient's rights and issue.  As public representatives, we cannot get something to which a person is not entitled but I believe we have an important role to play in terms of our constituents.<\/p><p>In my experience, it has got much worse in terms of quickly getting clarification and answers as a public representative around somebody's experience within the hospital.  I have had a poor experience in recent times in this regard.  I ask that this be relayed by Mr. Tyndall's office to the various hospital groups.  I will not name the hospital or group but, in my experience, there has been a dramatic change in comparison with the past.  One could approach an advocate or an office within the hospital that would handle one's concern.  Now one is directed to a busy office and it is at the mercy of the gods whether one gets a response.  That is not acceptable, and, in respect of the change Mr. Tyndall is trying to bring about, I wanted to relay my experience to him.  Perhaps other members would like to comment on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015093000002#J00300","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443625200,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I thank the Ombudsman.

Mr. Tyndall made a number of recommendations which were accepted in full by the HSE, and he asked its officials to put the complaints procedure in place.  What timeline has he sought?  Given the Ombudsman is the last resort rather than the first, if the HSE starts to flag that complainants have recourse to the Ombudsman, is he inviting a channel of complaint?

For instance, we have provided standard text for use on websites and letters which makes clear that, in the first instance, people should try to resolve the matter locally, and if they fail to resolve the matter locally, it should come to my office.  We have been worried about inconsistencies in referral by hospitals to the HSE review process.  Some hospitals were referring while others were not and, by and large, the HSE review process was not proving an effective channel.  We are content, therefore, that once there has been an attempt to resolve the matter once locally, it should come to my office.  The bigger advantage for us is that the subject matter of the complaint is usually fresher in the minds of those concerned than if it has gone through a lengthy process.<\/p> <p>  The biggest problem we have hit in terms of dealing with consistency has been the number of people dealing with complaints within the HSE.  In the longer term, we think it is better that there should be some professionalisation of that process and that the people dealing with complaints should be of sufficient seniority because many of the people we were dealing with could not get responses, for instance, from consultants who would not deal with somebody whom they felt was insufficiently senior to ask questions of them about their practice.  In the longer term, we need to get the sense of having a smaller number of better qualified people doing it as their full-time job rather than many people doing it as a small part of their other duties and who have no expertise or clout.  We will take time to move them from where they are to where they need to be.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to the Chairman's point, I have not noticed greater delays for us in getting responses.  It is very much a curate's egg.  Some people are prompt and they are the same people who have always been prompt while others are slow and they are the same people who have always been slow.  Our IT systems are elderly and creaking and I want to introduce a measure of how long it takes me to get responses from individual bodies within remit and to publish the statistics about that in order that we can highlight areas of consistent bad practice - a league table - and then tackle the areas where it is worst.  However, I am interested in the Chairman's comment and I appreciate he does not, for the moment, want to mention the particular group.

I listened to a programme on radio while travelling to work today and a solicitor was advising people that if they were involved in an accident, they should not admit liability.

It is very welcome when we get the extensions.  We got the extensions to the 200 bodies in the 2012 Act.  We got the extension now to nursing homes but, ultimately, we have to ask if we should turn it on its head and say that the whole of the public service is within the remit unless there are specific reasons to do otherwise.  For instance, the Children's Ombudsman might have a remit in some areas rather than my office, which is fine.<\/p> <p>  As well as the ones the Senator mentioned, the one to highlight is the issue around clinical judgment.  Many complaints come to my office that we cannot deal with.  People say there is the fitness to practice process, the Medical Council, but we get the type of complaints where somebody says, \"I was not given the correct prioritisation on a waiting list and I had to wait much longer for treatment than I should have done.\"  That is a clinical judgment.  It has no impact on the ability of the doctor making that judgment to practice.  It is not a matter for the Medical Council.  It should never have been excluded, and it needs to be addressed.  I have had a positive and constructive meeting with the Minister for Health, and I have had similar meetings with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but, hopefully, we can wrap up some of these issues now and address them.<\/p> <p>  I have a meeting coming up with the Department of Justice and Equality to discuss the implications of a potential extension of remit.  I will raise the issue of the new arrangements at that point because as the Senator implied, it seems that the correct time to put a correct mechanism in place is before it is needed rather than after the event.  Surely there should be recourse to the Ombudsman under those circumstances.  All I can say is that, inevitably, much of the workload of my colleagues in southern Europe, for instance, the countries bordering the Balkans, Austria and so on is taken up with these issues because those are the pressing issues of the day and it seems odd that my office should be excluded from what is mainstream work for most Ombudsmen.  That is a general point I would make.<\/p> <p>  I am missing something but the Senator can remind me in a moment.  In resource terms, the issue for us is that we are to the pin of our collar, as they say.  For instance, when we lost skilled, experienced people through retirement and it took several months to fill their posts, work piled up; we have no head room.  When we have taken on new areas of work we have generally had additional resources to deal with that.  Principally, that has been not on the Ombudsman side, but the workforce stretches across all the offices.  The Standards in Public Office Commission, for instance, had additional staffing to deal with the lobbying.  We had additional staffing on the Information Commissioner's side to deal with the implications of the 2014 Act, and we had assistance when the 2012 Act was introduced.  We are monitoring the situation carefully with nursing homes.  An 11% increase in work is a substantial increase.<\/p> <p>  We have done a lot to streamline our systems.  As the Senator knows, a major effort was made under my predecessor.  I have introduced some further streamlining, and that is helping us to manage but, to be honest, it would not take much to push us over the edge.<\/p><p>The backlog that had built up has been reducing steadily; we have halved it in the past 12 months or so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015093000002#L01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443625200,"counter":812,"content":"<p>It has been reduced by 50%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015093000002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacqueline McCrum"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443625200,"counter":813,"content":"<p>We are on top of things but if we are to take on new responsibilities, we will need new resources.

The bodies on top of my list are the ones that have the most dealings with members of the public.  The Department of Social Protection is always high on the list but we have very good relations with it.  In general, if we identify something and have a robust debate on whether it needs to be done, when we have persuaded the Department that it needs to be done, it usually just gets on with it and does it.  I need to be clear that the Department tops the list not through any deficiencies on its part but simply because of volumes.<\/p> <p>  The odd issue tends to arise.  Let me mention one that affects several agencies.  Sometimes bodies make payments in error, and it is their error.  It can be a student grant body or a body dealing with welfare benefits.  Our general view is that if somebody gives false information and consequently gets a benefit to which he is not entitled, the State should claim that back because the money is being received fraudulently.  However, circumstances are different where people receive money through no fault of their own, as with somebody who moves away from home and is paying rent during the second year of a course only to find he or she is not only not entitled to the grant he or she applied for and got but also that he or she must repay it, with the consequence that he or she has no money to pursue his or her course of study.  It is through no fault of his own.  We take a view that this is not good administration.  At times, if we cannot resolve the various outstanding issues, they may be ones we bring to the committee.  We take the same view where people are asked to repay benefits many years after the event.  The money is taken from their pension when they eventually qualify for one.  We get cases like that.  These are systemic issues.  They are not huge areas.<\/p> <p>  With local authorities, the volume is simply associated with the fact that they are the housing authorities and are dealing with planning.  They are in many contentious areas.  There is not a pattern that I can identify.  When there is, we meet the County and City Management Association.  Generally, it is been possible to agree to collective solutions.  One or two councils manage to be outliers.  When everybody else agrees and implements a solution, they manage to find ways of interpreting the agreement in a way that was not intended.

I am sure the office does that, but could it be done in a more clear format?

We will make sure that we systematically reflect those issues in future reports.<\/p><p> The issue of legal privilege vexes my office in the same way it does the Ombudsman for Children.  It is very frustrating when a Department says, \"I have legal advice that says that you are wrong but you can't say it\".  That seems an entirely inappropriate way to deal with matters.  The committee will be aware that the legislation in respect of the Northern Ireland public services ombudsperson, NIPSO, is currently working its way through.  That explicitly says that the ombudsperson is entitled to access to documents, even those protected by privilege.  There is no bar to legislating on this issue.  Our legal advice is that the current legislation might allow us to go to the Circuit Court and ask for an order to have that revealed to us.  It has not been tested.  We do not know what the outcome would be.<\/p><p> Fundamentally, the committee has to understand that we see a lot of information that is confidential in the course of our work.  We talked about issues around child care, for instance.  We see a lot of files that are highly confidential and we need to see them in order to form a judgment.  That does not mean that we immediately put that into the public domain.  If something were covered by legal privilege, there is no reason we could not see it, use it to help us form a conclusion and then not formally publish it within the context of the report.<\/p><p> I have always felt it was a weak tactic.  If one has an argument that says one is right, why would one not reveal that argument?

I suspect the delay on clinical judgment is because there will be groups of professionals who will not want to see the jurisdiction extended.  It is worth saying, just briefly, that as Ombudsman if the jurisdiction comes my way I will not be making comments about individual clinicians.  It is the bodies and the treatment that are in jurisdiction, so one will not see, as one would with a proceeding before a professional body, a doctor, nurse or other medical professional named in my reports.  The role of an Ombudsman is a different one.  As I said, there is a huge lacuna at the moment.  Both the Minister for Health and his Department and the HSE are supportive because their jurisdiction on this is very unclear.

The table to which the Vice Chairman refers is the departmental output table of 2015.  It lists all of the different outputs by all elements of my Department.  I believe an evaluation has been done as to whether they are specific, measurable or relevant.  My own observation is, as Minister heading into the next Estimates process, that I believe there is an opportunity to make them even more output focused.   I will give the committee a small example of what I mean.  If we were to look at the figures on the sustainable development of airports or the outputs in public transport in the future, we need to have figures on the number of people who use public transport or the number of people who use different airports.  I will now turn to the figures on tourism.  We are increasingly moving towards looking at the spend by tourists to Ireland, alongside the numbers of tourists.  These are the measures the Department and I use to evaluate our performance.  It would be helpful for the coming 12 months if those things converged with the measures in the Estimates process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015093000002#E00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1443606000,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and I welcome his statement in which he and his Department accept the necessity for improved performance output around documentation and I welcome the willingness to try to improve.  If we as a Parliament can work with Departments like the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport we will all benefit in the long run.<\/p> <p> Regarding the output measures and the associated targets to be included in the Estimates, in some cases they are not specific enough to be meaningful.  The Minister addressed this when he spoke about the airport example.  I suggest the implementation of recommended actions in accordance with stated milestones.  While that is aspirational, it needs to be contextualised.  On the plan to continue work on smarter travel projects, it becomes very difficult to measure what the output ultimately is in that regard.  I am not being critical and I do not look for a direct answer other than an engagement that says this is where we need to get to.<\/p> <p> The desire to develop the Wild Atlantic Way discovery points is a vision which becomes difficult to measure in terms of the output.  It would help if there was a more specific aim, for example, to develop four of the Wild Atlantic Way discovery points over the next 12 months.  Or, regarding smarter travel, it would help to identify two or three projects which could be delivered within a time-frame.  It may make it easier, for those of us on this side of the table, to hold the Minister and his Department to account on where things fall between the cracks.  If we can get this right over a period of time it will serve the country better in the long run because it will mean that all of us are more keenly focused on how money is spent if it does get spent.  The Minister will not be left in the difficult situation at the end of the year of having money left over from various projects that he is then in a position to spend on other pet projects in the run-up to an election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015093000002#E00400","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1443606000,"counter":847,"content":"<p>There is fairness in what the Deputy has said, however some of the measurements that are included go in the direction of being very output focused.

If one looks at section D and sports it states that Sport Ireland legislation is to be published, and there are measures about the distribution of funding for local authority swimming pools.  These are specific proposals.  There is opportunity to make more progress on making them even more output focused on elements that are not related to legislation because legislation is binary in that it is either published or it is not, it is either enacted or it is not.  However, we can track how many people come to Ireland, how they spend when they come here and the duration of their stay.  This is the sort of data that Tourism Ireland tracks and upon which it reports back to my Department.

If I look at tourism, measurement number one is to agree 2013 business plan for implementation by tourism agencies.  The committee has said that this is not specific but I argue that it is pretty specific.  The committee says it is not measurable and I could argue about that.  It is certainly relevant, yet the committee has said that it is not.  If we make things more specific it will be possible to make a more careful evaluation of whether they are being delivered or are on track, or not delivered as the case is.

It is easy to judge in sport if something is working or if an athlete is performing or otherwise but how is the overall picture in sport measured?  Is it measured by achievements or by the amount of money the Department gives and the value it gets for it?<\/p> <p>  I have the same question about the road networks.

I am clear within my own Department what my priorities are.  When I came into office those objectives were published.  I meet every month with the management boards of the Department and we review where we are with the priorities that we have set.  That is partly by virtue of necessity because there are so many different things going on within my Department that I have to be very clear on what the particular matters are that I believe are important to the country and that I want to make happen.  I have a list against which I evaluate where we stand on different matters but other things happen that take up one's time and energy and can sometimes get in the way of priorities.  For me, that is more of an argument as to why clear priorities are needed in the first place.  One can always be taken off course by events.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's question on how we evaluate things - it depends on the policy area.  I will give the example of sport.  The Deputy is correct about how we evaluate the output in sport.  One of the outputs that we track is the number of medals that national athletes win.  We look at that every year.  That tracking is done by the Irish Sports Council.  We also track levels of participation in sport.  Much of the work that the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar has underway on Healthy Ireland will allow us to get outputs and look at the number of people by age group who participate in sport.  This has led to one insight for me that I feel strongly about, which is how we drive sporting participation, particularly among more disadvantaged communities.  That is something that has only emerged from looking at the outputs from sport.  Outputs will vary and will depend on what part of the Department we look at.  <\/p> <p>  If we look at new roads projects, it is as simple as asking if the project is funded.  Where does it stand in the planning process?  Has work begun on it?  When will the project open?  If we look at maintenance, I would track that through the amount of funding that we make available to local authorities to help them replenish and sustain roads that are already there.  That is how we would look at that.  <\/p> <p>  I have already touched on the question of tourism.  Another area of transport is sustainable and smarter travel.  We track the number of people using public transport and the numbers and trends.  For example, we track how many people use Leap cards.  These are all very carefully looked at by me and my officials who work in the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015093000002#F00800","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1443606000,"counter":856,"content":"<p>I apologise for not calling Deputy O'Donovan earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015093000002#F00900","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1443606000,"counter":857,"content":"<p>That is fine.

I acknowledge the work the Minister has done on the ports and specifically the port in my constituency, the Shannon Foynes Port Company, and the decision the Minister's Department has made to link it to the national road network, which is hugely important.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the decision of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, after years of waiting and years of the Celtic tiger and many missed opportunities, to finally proceed with a bypass of Adare in County Limerick.

The first is the 9% VAT rate, which has made a massive difference to them.  The second is a very simple concept but something that has been hugely welcomed in that part of the country - the Wild Atlantic Way.   A series of signposts has brought people, for example, from my part of the country, Limerick, into county Donegal where they might not have thought of holidaying before.  It is a measurable outcome.  <\/p><p> There are aspects of the tourism policy on which more could be done.

I will differ gently with the Deputy and say that we do not give a leg-up to anybody and we certainly do not give a leg-up to any familiar faces.

I am disappointed that the Killarney to Farranfore route has been omitted from the capital plan.  Is it possible to have this route added to the capital plan at this late stage?  The gridlock in Killarney is well known and has an impact on tourism as well as on commuters who are trying to access other areas in the county.  It is very detrimental to the local economy.  There is only one way of addressing the significant bottleneck resulting from the uplift in the economy, with increasing traffic and heavier vehicles using that particular route between Killarney and Tralee.  I am most disappointed with this omission, because the groundwork has been done and the project is shovel-ready.  The plans were put on display in Killarney for public consultation some 15 years ago, and we were very optimistic that this would proceed within four to five years.  With the downward trend and collapse of the economy it was put on the back burner.  That project should be examined as a matter of urgency.  I ask the Minister, who has responsibility for tourism as well as transport, to go back to the Cabinet to have this project included, because of the significant investment in preparations for the project.<\/p> <p>  The development of the Wild Atlantic Way has increased visitor numbers and generated additional moneys.  I wonder if a proportion of the additional revenue generated from the Wild Atlantic Way will be used to improve the infrastructure and the community facilities on this route.  That is only right and fitting.  There is also a need to consider the omission of panoramic scenic roads on the seashore, such as the road from Tralee to Cloch&aacute;n on the Dingle peninsula.  Deputy Brendan Griffin was very involved with the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, in having the Cloch&aacute;n peninsula included.  Such deficiencies need to be corrected.  This should be put right over the next couple of years.  For many of the communities along the route tourism is a new concept, as in the past their areas were not marketed.  Now, with the major influx of tourists, services need to be expanded.  There is a need for community groups to get together to service the influx - for example, by providing parking areas for camper vans.<\/p> <p>  The old country pubs are a major part of the culture and tourism product.  We need to look at pubs that are in danger of closing because their owners are finding it difficult to sustain them.  We also need to look at the internal transport system, as many remote areas need to have better access to transport.  I raised the issue of hackney licences with the Minister last week, as people are finding it difficult to get a hackney licences.<\/p> <p>  The IFA raised issues arising from the abolition of the milk quota and the impact it will have on rural roads, with the transport of milk from the farm gate to the co-operative in heavier tankers.  Rural roads on the western seaboard are deteriorating due to adverse weather conditions, with some areas getting twice the rainfall that Dublin gets.<\/p> <p>  On the N72, which is gateway from Cork to Killarney, there are a number of acute bends near the railway bridges at Rathmore.  The National Roads Authority, in conjunction with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, needs to straighten out the road at these railway passings.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Griffin and I are very much aware of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015093000002#J00400","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1443606000,"counter":871,"content":"<p>Is this about performance measurement?

First, I will deal the capital spend and the percentage we are investing in regional and local roads.  Out of &euro;10 billion programme that I announced yesterday afternoon, some &euro;2.4 billion is for regional and local roads.<\/p><p>When I was drawing up the announcement that was made yesterday, I first gave priority to rebalancing our expenditure in favour of making sure that over time, we have enough money to maintain what we have.  I then looked to identify a small number of additional new roads projects that will make a big contribution to the three priorities I have outlined all year - removing bottlenecks to access to ports, airports and job creation, facilitating regional connectivity and dealing with the issue of congestion.<\/p><p> I appreciate what the Deputy is saying regarding his disappointment about the failure to include the road he has mentioned but I had to make choices all over the country in regard to what we could and could not go ahead with.  While I accept his disappointment about the failure to make provision for a route through Killarney, I remind him that we have met other priorities in his county.  For example, we have recognised the need to support the road in Dingle at some point in the future.  We gave a very clear commitment yesterday to the development of the road between Baile Bh&uacute;irne and Macroom.  The development of the road in question, in the interests of improving connectivity between County Kerry and Cork city, is a long-standing issue that Deputy Griffin has been raising with me for well over a year.  We have not been able to do everything that people would like us to do.  That is a reflection of the need to continue to make choices about how we spend the money that is available now and in the future.<\/p><p> I would like to respond to the points that the Deputy made regarding tourism.  He spoke about the whole idea of reinvesting back into the development of the Wild Atlantic Way.  We are already working hard to do that.  Earlier this month, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, outlined details of a new programme to develop between 145 and 150 information points that are located all along the Wild Atlantic Way.  This is being done to try to provide better experiences for those who visit the locations in question.  We now have plans in place for four signature discovery points.  This work is under way.  Over time, we will continue to upgrade the experiences that exist along the Wild Atlantic Way, based on the money we have at our disposal.  The Deputy made a point about infrastructure along the Wild Atlantic Way.  We have not been able to make progress with any additional roads in County Kerry other than the two major projects I have already mentioned.  We are looking to make progress elsewhere along the route.  For example, we are seeking to make a contribution to the route along the N59 in County Donegal.<\/p><p> The Deputy raised the question of hackney licences with me in the D&aacute;il last week.  I understand the NTA has been in contact with Deputies on this matter in the last year.  I know that people want the area of knowledge to be below the county level.  However, the NTA is strongly of the view that this would give rise to many other difficulties.  For example, there might be people who are very well qualified to drive within a particular cluster of communities but are not qualified to drive beyond that.  It is for that reason that the NTA is of the view that at the moment, we should not change the licensing regime, which I support.<\/p><p> The Deputy also made a point about the effect of the abolition of milk quotas on regional roads.  I remind him that &euro;2.4 billion of the &euro;4.9 billion we are investing in the maintenance of existing roads will be spent on regional and local roads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015093000002#J00700","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443606000,"counter":875,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

It would be remiss of me not to thank him for yesterday's announcement regarding the N22 road between Macroom and Baile Bh&uacute;irne, which is great news for the Kerry constituency and the south-west region.  I think it is a game-changer.  It will be the greatest socioeconomic development for Kerry in many years.  I would also like to mention the N69, the Adare bypass and the Dingle relief road.  They comprise a great suite of measures for County Kerry.  I would like to express gratitude on behalf of the people of Kerry.  Yesterday was a very good day for the county, after many dark years.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is aware that I have been raising the need to try to boost winter tourism for many years.  I believe we have an excellent opportunity to boost visitor numbers to Ireland in the shoulder months.  I suggest that the Wild Atlantic Way is an excellent vehicle in this regard.  We should market that product as a winter experience as much as a summer experience.  I have always used the example of standing on Slea Head looking out to the Atlantic in January, as distinct from July.  I think people should be coming from all over the world to experience the ferocious wilderness and invigorating energy of the sea in months like January.  Having previously raised this issue in parliamentary questions and received responses from the Minister, I know that extra expenditure was provided in 2015 to try to market the shoulder months and the winter months.  Do we have any update on how that it going?  Are we getting a worthwhile return on our efforts to boost off-peak visitor numbers?  Do we need to put more money in?  Is there a tipping point that needs to be reached so that a real impact can be made?  I suppose I am looking for as much data as possible on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015093000002#K00300","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speech","time":1443606000,"counter":877,"content":"<p>We have made additional funding available to support longer advertising campaigns through Tourism Ireland.

It is clear that the investment we have made in tourism to date is yielding extraordinary results.  If I recall correctly, the visitor figures that were released yesterday show that there has been an increase of between 13% and 15% in the number of visitors to Ireland so far this year.  I have every reason to believe we will finish this year with a double-digit increase in the number of people coming to Ireland.

It is clear to me, as someone who comes from a tourism county, that large numbers of tourists have been in the country this year.  That is really encouraging in counties like Kerry.  I suggest we can try to make this more sustainable by spreading it into the winter months as much as we can.  Unfortunately, people are traditionally laid off during the winter because of the seasonal nature of tourism.  It is something we could be cognisant of in future.  We could put more effort into it.  We should try to continue the existing efforts to boost activity in the winter months.  We should see if we can do something about this aspect of the matter.  I have looked at other countries.  I am aware that efforts are being made in this regard already.  It seems to be something that has been pushed by Scotland in the last couple of years.  The figures have been quite good there as well.  We should try to keep this issue on the agenda.  I reiterate that it has been a good tourism season.

It would be remiss of me not to congratulate the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and all their staff.  Tourism has been a tremendous success story over the last four or five years.  A large number of jobs have been created.  There have been benefits to the economy.  Many overseas visitors have come here.<\/p><p>It is a great success story and is no doubt due to issues the Minister raised, such as the reduction in VAT and the cessation of the &euro;3 per passenger departing from an airport.<\/p><p> I will comment on the greenways.  I come from a town that has a magnificent greenway.  Unfortunately, it starts not in the town of Carlingford, but at the marine which is approximately 400 yd. north of Carlingford on the sea.  That greenway is being used throughout the year.  It is encouraging visitors at weekends to come and stay in Carlingford and in the villages of Omeath.  Both towns have benefited greatly from the greenway.  It is proposed to extend it, to Omeath and on to Newry, and eventually, perhaps not in my day, to Portadown along the Clanrye river.  It has been encouraged by Newry and Mourne District Council.  I would emphasis the greenways anywhere they are and congratulate the landowners involved, through whose co-operation this has happened.  I invite the Minister to look at this greenway from Carlingford to Omeath, with a view to extending it from the marina to King John's Castle on the pier in Carlingford along the sea.  It would have to be built up on stilts - I have seen one in Portugal done similarly.  As far as greenways in part my of the world are concerned, it would be the jewel in the crown.

It contains 73 actions, all of which reflect my view that aviation and our airports are not a consequence, but a cause, of economic growth.  If one looks at what is happening in all of the airports at present, if one looks at the engagement that this Government has had with the aviation sector, it has brought more jobs into Ireland, it has brought more tourists into Ireland and it has developed a platform for our country to grow sustainably in the future.  By 2020, we believe, Irish airports will handle approximately 33 million passengers per year.<\/p> <p>  In that document, I guess there are only two points I would want to emphasise.  The first is that the number one policy that underpins everything we would do in aviation is safety and security.  That is the bedrock upon which we grow our access to the rest of the world.  We have placed considerable focus on how we can grow connectivity, how we can grow competition on key routes into Ireland and how we can support the State and regional airports.  There are different steps against different airports, depending on their nature.  Each of the State airports, which, as the committee will be aware, are Dublin, Cork and Shannon, have clear plans regarding how they want to develop in the future.  For the regional airports, one of which is in Deputy Griffin's constituency, I am pleased to be able to say that earlier in the year we published the regional airport plan, which outlines the supports that we want to give to regional airports between 2015 and 2019 and outlines the legal framework within which we need to make those supports available and that has now been agreed with the European Commission.  The next phase, in aviation, will be setting in place the national aviation development forum, which will be a broad group of stakeholders across the sector which we will use to consult as we look to develop Irish aviation in the future.<\/p> <p>  On maritime, there are two sections to which I would draw the committee's attention.  The first is the status of the Harbours Bill 2015, which has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and will shortly come here for Committee Stage consideration.  I believe this is the most important legislation on the ports sector for decades and I look forward to working with the committee to ensure its enactment.  I also launched, earlier this year, the new national maritime safety strategy, which concludes 33 actions to make the maritime sector, our seas and rivers, as safe as possible.<\/p> <p>  I continue to place considerable value on the Irish Coast Guard and the work that my Department has done in upgrading the fleet of helicopters available to it.  The deployment of new Sikorsky helicopters gives them tools that will significantly improve the already great service that they can deliver.  With the services and technology available through Valentia Island and the work that the Irish Coast Guard has done there, it now has the ability to cover the breadth of Ireland.  It is a sign of the support the Government has given them.<\/p> <p>  On sports, I merely want to underscore the importance of the setting up of the Sports Ireland organisation.  The Bill in that regard has now been enacted.  I also note that work is already under way on the national indoor arena in the National Sports Campus in Abbotstown and in supporting our athletes as they get ready for the Olympics in Rio in 2016.<\/p> <p>  We will never have the money needed to support everything that everybody wants us to do but I believe, across my Department, we are making steady progress in areas that will be to the benefit of the country in the long run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015093000002#L00700","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1443606000,"counter":890,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to and engaging with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015093000002#L00800","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443606000,"counter":891,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 12.30 p.m. until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 7 October 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
