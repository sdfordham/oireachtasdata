As part of the Government's response to the crisis, the Minister for Justice and Equality brought proposals to the Government which were considered and agreed at a special Cabinet meeting on 10 September.  The multifaceted approach that is being adopted includes the establishment of an Irish refugee protection programme, which will provide international protection to up to 4,000 people under resettlement and relocation programmes.  It is expected that this number will be augmented by further family reunifications.  The number of people in need of international protection will be kept under review.  It has also been decided to establish a new cross-departmental task force, chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality, to deal with the operational and logistical aspects of the support programme.  A range of Government Departments will be represented on and involved in the task force, which has already had its first meeting and will work with non-governmental organisations, religious bodies and local authorities.  In addition, the Red Cross will implement certain elements of the programme.  The UNHCR is also represented on the task force.  The Red Cross will specifically lead the task of engaging with public pledges of support.<\/p> <p>  The Government has also decided to establish emergency reception and orientation centres for the initial reception of those arriving under the relocation programme.  It has also approved the provision of an additional package of processing resources to deal with the major increases in asylum applications and other immigration cases.  The resettlement programme has already commenced.  A number of people who were selected through the UNHCR process from Lebanon have already arrived.  They form part of the overall number of 520 people involved in that programme.  The first relocation measure to be approved by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 14 September last involves an overall number of 40,000 and Ireland will be taking 600 from that.  The next package of measures, which was agreed on 21 September, involves some 120,000 people who are in need of international protection.  The overall number that Ireland will take under that package is approximately 1,850.  The precise number has not yet been worked out, but that is the best estimate at this point.<\/p> <p>  As I have indicated, an interdepartmental and inter-agency task force has been established.  In addition, a number of subgroups have been established to look at specific areas.  In that context, the Department of Justice and Equality will take the lead in the process of relocating people to Ireland, in the refugee assessment process and in the establishment of the orientation centres.  Work has commenced with the Office of Public Works and the Department of Defence on looking at the available State properties that could possibly be used.  Other options will also be considered.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the city and county managers will take the lead in providing accommodation to people who are granted refugee status.  As I have said, the Red Cross will take the lead in the overall co-ordination and management of the many pledges of support that have come from the public.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will also liaise with the non-governmental organisation community.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. John Roycroft, has just been appointed to head up a new project and programme office that has been established in the Department.  That office will co-ordinate the various aspects of the programme across the Department.  Preparations are under way for working with our EU colleagues abroad.  The Refugee Applications Commissioner will outline the further arrangements in that regard.  The best practice for dealing with people who are arriving in these circumstances is for them to be accommodated in a single location, rather than being dispersed immediately.  It is likely that they will come with a common language and without a knowledge of Ireland.  It is considered best practice to deliver services in a co-ordinated fashion at a single centre rather than dispersing individuals immediately.  The intention is that these people will be processed through the asylum process very quickly.  After that has happened, other State bodies and agencies will take over the task of finding longer-term accommodation, etc.  That covers my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Kirrane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443603600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I am the head of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  I am also the deputy chairperson of the European Asylum Support Office, which is the EU agency that is responsible for asylum operational issues in the EU.  The functions of my office in Dublin are to investigate applications for refugee status from individuals, applications from refugees for their family members to join them in the State and applications for subsidiary protection.  Two forms of international protection are processed by my office - refugee status under the Geneva Convention and subsidiary protection, which is a form of protection under EU law.  The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner employs 100 civil servants.  We also employ a panel of legal practitioners on a contract for service basis.  Both the civil servants and the legal practitioners undertake the interviews.  They will be doing the interviews for the people coming here under the relocation programme.  The actual recommendations are made to the Minister for Justice and Equality by civil servants in my office.  We also have a wide variety of other functions.  When we are processing asylum cases, we must schedule interviews, organise interpreters and carry out country of origin research.  A vast array of backroom work has to be carried out as well.  All of our case workers, panel members and other staff undergo rigorous training from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  The decisions we make in our office are subject to quality assurance by the UNHCR, which is the international agency with a mandate for protecting asylum seekers and refugees.<\/p> <p>  The plan for the Irish refugee protection programme is that people being relocated to Ireland from Greece and Italy will be processed by my office.  From an operational perspective, this will mean members of my office will participate in liaison teams in Italy and Greece to help in the selection of the applicants concerned and to organise their transport to Ireland and other logistical arrangements.  It will also involve processing applications.  Those applications will be processed at the emergency reception and orientation centres.  One of the specs in the establishment of these centres will be that interview facilities will have to be provided to my office.  This will involve my staff and panel members going to the office to organise the interviews.  Under the EU decision, there is a requirement for those coming in to be fingerprinted and issued with residence cards.  We will do that as well.  All the applicants concerned are from countries of serious conflict, such as Syria and Eritrea.  They are all likely to have well-founded claims for refugee status.  Accordingly, I will be able to prioritise them in line with powers I have under the Refugee Act.<\/p><p>Depending on the complexity of the cases involved and a range of factors, such as date of arrival and further numbers because they will be coming in groups over two years, it is anticipated that the processing of applications in the reception and orientation centres will take a number of weeks.<\/p><p> In terms of the readiness of my office, we have already commenced planning for this.  We have set up a working group with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, which is advising us on the approach we should take.  We intend to utilise our already well-tuned systems for interviewing, organising interpreters and undertaking country of origin research.  We have the process and the infrastructure in place.  I am also a member of the interdepartmental task force established by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We will be working closely with the UNHCR and a UNHCR expert on international protection and refugee law will be seconded to the office to guide us in the approach we take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kirrane and Mr. Costello for updating us on the situation.

The three groups primarily being considered at the moment are Syrians, Iraqis and Eritreans.  Effectively it would be for the Italian and Greek authorities to look through those caseloads with the assistance of EU agencies and with Irish liaison officers.

While the staff who work there are exceptional and go far beyond the call of duty to look after the people who live there, the system is completely flawed.  The people live in terrible situations.  Some of them have been living in mobile homes for more than ten years.  These are people who are already here, but now we are going to bring more people in on top of that.  The places people are saying may be suitable as reception centres include empty Army barracks, one of which is in my constituency.  I would not like to bring my family to live in one of those barracks.  It is not fair to people.  We also have a serious housing issue to which Deputy Finian McGrath referred.  If one puts people into a reception centre and processes them, where are we going to house them afterwards given the serious housing issue?

As to the conditions, we intend that the facilities will be the best that can be provided and the intention is that they will not be in these centres for long periods.  Talk of ghettoisation is not what we have in mind.

Specifically, a task force has been established, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in to examine the issue of transiting those who have been granted refugee or other status from the direct provision.  It has been working over the past two months and will conclude its work in the next few weeks and report to the committee.  We have examined the number of people in the system who need to transition out.  Overall, a good proportion move within three months and the vast majority move within six months.  There is a recognition that there is a need to provide more information and services to these people, and the task force is examining producing an information pack for people to help them to transition more quickly from direct provision.  People move out relatively quickly.<\/p> <p>  The difference between this group and those who are in the direct provision system is that the intention is that they would be processed very quickly.  Part of the difficulty with the direct provision system is that children are already established in schools or people have families, and moving to a different location where accommodation may be available is not always very easy.  We often have to wait for summer or the end of the school term before families will move.  A delay happens because people in direct provision are already established and have links to the community and, therefore, are seeking accommodation in those communities.  With this group, on the basis that there will be quick processing of their cases, there is more flexibility in terms of matching accommodation to the families in a more efficient manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Kirrane"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Mr. Costello said a selection would be made in the hot spots such as Italy or Piraeus.

I believe this will assist the Committee in better considering the high-level outputs and provide a solid basis for examining what has been achieved.  I will set out the Department's key considerations in framing output targets, but first I would like to provide some context for the current position.<\/p><p>The alignment of expenditure programmes with output targets and their publication within the Revised Estimates volume was an important development, and I am pleased to note that the committee may have some useful suggestions as to how these output targets may be improved.  My Department has been engaging with the committee secretariat to set out the context for the current indicators and discuss possible future developments.  The expertise on defence matters rests within the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, including the identification of appropriate output targets.  I understand that the pros and cons of possible approaches were discussed at length.  However, I will not enlarge upon these discussions beyond what may not have been fully reflected in the brief that the committee received from the secretariat.<\/p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for publishing the Revised Estimates volume, and my Department has had extensive engagement with that Department in framing the current measures.  This built upon the work that was previously undertaken in preparing annual output statements.  The space made available for output targets and associated reporting within the Revised Estimates volume has informed the approach used by the Department and has required a reduction in the amount of information that was previously provided.  However, this information is still reported within the annual report of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, and my Department has provided much of this information for inclusion in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's publication <i>Ireland Stat<\/i>, although this has not been activated by the Department as yet.  In this context, there is a significant amount of performance information produced and publicly available.  The output targets currently in use reflect those factors as well as the nature of defence provision and critical success factors that must be considered.  <\/p><p>Security is the bedrock on which a State's economic, political and social well-being is built.  Security challenges require a whole-of-Government response, and there are a range of Departments and agencies with security responsibilities that contribute to the State's overarching security framework.  The defence contribution encompasses defence of the State from external armed aggression, which is a contingency; the defence contribution to domestic security; and the defence contribution to international peace and security.  In addition, defence capabilities are used to provide a broad range of non-security supports which maximise the value for money of defence expenditure and reduce duplication of service delivery across the State.  The recently published White Paper provides a useful framework for considering those outputs which are critical to the successful delivery of the defence mission, which is &quot;To provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government.&quot;  The White Paper sets out a comprehensive assessment of the security environment and any threats that arise.  The ongoing monitoring of the security environment is a key requirement that has a major influence on the defence policy response, operational requirements and associated capability planning.<\/p><p>As outlined in the White Paper, Ireland continues to strongly support the multilateral system of collective security represented by the UN and the primary role of the UN Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  The EU is also a major player on the international stage, with an increasing capacity to influence the international security environment using all of the instruments at its disposal, including economic, diplomatic, political and military instruments, known as the &quot;comprehensive approach&quot;.  Within the framework of multilateralism and collective security, and in support of international peace and security, the White Paper states that Ireland will continue to contribute to a range of comprehensive and collaborative security arrangements within the EU, the UN and the OSCE, and bilaterally with other states.  This ongoing policy development represents a key defence output that contributes to Ireland's security.  Domestically, the continued refinement of the State's emergency planning framework and further development of defence capabilities in support of other Departments and agencies are also key policy areas for the Department.<\/p><p>As set out in the White Paper, the role of the Defence Forces reflects the Government's policy requirements and the operations that the Defence Forces may be required to undertake.  The roles have been updated to take account of new developments or those which have acquired an increased importance.  Many of these operations are demand-led and reflect the contingent nature of many defence operations - those that are dependent on need, or those that are subject to Government requirements, such as overseas missions.  As such, the target is to meet demand when required.  This is the nature of defence business and defence outputs.  <\/p><p>The general approach within defence is to develop memorandums of understandings with those Departments and agencies that may require defence assistance.  In many cases, this provides a means to clarify call-out procedures and the availability of defence assistance.  However, due to the demand-led nature of most of these services, they do not contain specific targets for numbers of operations.  The exception to this is the annual control plan agreed with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, which sets out Naval Service fisheries patrol day targets and Air Corps fisheries patrol flight targets.  The committee will see from the figures that we have some challenges in terms of outputs as regards Naval Service fisheries patrol days this year, for understandable reasons.  I will go into those later.  <\/p><p>The White Paper also considers future capability requirements.  It defines military capability as the ability to attain operational success in a given scenario, achieving desired effects under specified standards and conditions through ways and means.  It consists of a conceptual component, a moral component and a physical component.<\/p><p>There are a range of actions across the Department and the Defence Forces which are required to develop and maintain military capabilities.  These actions include, but are not limited to, investment in new equipment, education and training, maintenance and development of infrastructure, ongoing review of military doctrine, the development of appropriate human resources, HR, policies and the development of regulatory frameworks.  These actions are internal processes that contribute to capability outputs but are not capability outputs in themselves.  There is no universally accepted metric for military capability, which is a key output for Defence Vote 36.  This is a challenge for all countries including those with well developed performance reporting mechanisms.  The Department has closely examined the approach in other countries, such as New Zealand, which I know this committee has examined, where capability reporting is underpinned by a broad performance reporting framework including annual reports, with a view to identifying appropriate metrics.<\/p><p> Defence Vote 36 outputs are delivered through a single programme with three strategic dimensions which are interdependent.  First, defence policy, which is policy outputs; second, ensuring the capacity to deliver, which is capability outputs; and third, Defence Forces operations, which is operational outputs.  This provides a balanced perspective on defence outputs, all of which are critical to success.  My Department has engaged with the committee secretariat in reviewing this categorisation and I am satisfied that this represents a solid approach to categorising defence outputs and is not inconsistent with the approach taken internationally.<\/p><p> The refinement of output targets remains a work in progress, and I particularly welcome the signals from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that more space will be forthcoming in the 2016 Revised Estimates to report on outputs.  This will broaden the options for the Department in developing appropriate targets, and I intend to take this opportunity to expand reporting on military capabilities.<\/p><p> The current measurements of performance on Vote 35 Army Pensions are calculated to show the number of military pensioners in payment plus associated retirement, disability and dependants&rsquo; awards granted during the year and other related metrics.  This reflects the overall annual caseload activity or throughput of the programme.  Such performance measures are relevant and appropriate, bearing in mind the demand-driven and non-discretionary nature of the Vote and the fact that there are no goods or services provided to third parties.<\/p><p> Activity and output under the programme show an underlying upward trend reflecting the increased caseload arising from the continued rise in the number of military pensioners year on year, and a corresponding increase in related activity generally.  In that regard, the Department&rsquo;s military pensions output targets for 2013 and 2014, and for 2015 to date, were achieved and I am advised that the Department has no significant concerns around performance or service delivery of Defence Forces pension benefits to beneficiaries.  Following its engagement with the secretariat, the Department is very much of the view that the two output measures currently in use have merit and should continue in use, subject to review in light of the imminent transfer of the military pensions payroll processing function to the Civil Service Payroll Shared Services Centre, which is under the aegis of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p> I am not suggesting that we are perfect.  I believe we can and should work with the committee to try to modernise and change, where appropriate.  If the members have suggestions, we are all ears.  If we can produce better metrics that are effective at practically assessing improvements year on year, I am open to implementing them but I am not open to doing things for the sake of looking good.  <\/p><p> We have a White Paper now.  From a policy point of view the performance indicators for me will be related to how we deliver on the White Paper and the choices it contains.  The nature of defence, which is very different from many other Departments, is demand led.  We need to be ready to respond to an ask of Government or the State, whether that be at home or abroad, often in very difficult circumstances.  What we do control are issues such as fleet replacement programmes in the Naval Service.  We have a very good outcome from the capital plan announced yesterday where, over the next six years, we will see an increase in capital expenditure for defence of &euro;65 million, which is the first increase the Department of Defence has seen for very many years.  We are in a place now that can see the delivery of the ambition in the White Paper on Defence, and I intend on being proactive in terms of making that happen as soon as possible.  The more we can engage with this committee in terms of measuring performance as we go along around efficiency, management and performance, the better but we must make sure that any system or metrics we are putting in place are real in terms of their measurement and that they are relevant to an Irish situation as opposed to simply replicating a New Zealand model, which is a country that has very different challenges from Ireland.<\/p><p> We had this discussion this morning in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and they were also using a New Zealand model in terms of potential metrics for the future, despite the fact that New Zealand agriculture and Irish agriculture have fundamentally different challenges in terms of implementing rural development programmes and the Common Agricultural Policy.  New Zealand does not have any of that.  We should try to design together better metrics for Irish based challenges, and we are open to any suggestions members might have in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#AA00900","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the presentation.

I am conscious that we are beginning a new process and, to a certain extent, all of us are finding our way in terms of that process.  I do not know if any of the members would profess to be experts in the area of performance targets or indicators but the Minister's point, which is difficult to argue with, that there is no universally accepted metric for military capability is understandable.  At the same time, given that military capability is at the centre of what the Minister's Department does, we would like to hear his view on the New Zealand guidance.  Is it the correct way of setting out performance targets?  That has been the basis for discussion already between the Minister's Department and committee secretariat staff.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on that.  First, is there an acceptance by the Minister and his Department that the New Zealand guidelines is the correct way to go?  Second, would his Department have issues about the way the guidance has been applied to the performance measures?  It is easy to measure performance in terms of capital spent but in the area of military capability, and perhaps in some other areas of activity, it is far more difficult.  For example, the Minister alluded to the White Paper, and we commend him on all the work he has done in bringing that forward, but is the production of the White Paper an appropriate output measure to be considered or does it simply set a target and indicate a policy direction for the Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#BB00300","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I am not quite sure what members have got from us in terms of outputs and so on.  One of the frustrations we had is that the Revised Estimate that shows figures for the Department and then outputs is all on one page.  If we consider what New Zealand does, it has an outputs document, which is almost like an annual White Paper in itself, in terms of outputs across defence, with a series of metrics and performance indicators.  We have no problem with that because we do it anyway for our annual reports and if we could build it into a reporting mechanism that involved the committee and allowed us produce much more volume in terms of what we are trying to achieve, I would have no issue with that.  For example, I see the White Paper as a policy framework that needs to be implemented over the next ten years.<\/p><p>We will have an annual report on the White Paper each year, and I would love to be able to be here to speak to the committee about what we are achieving, changing and improving through the implementation of the White Paper.  It would be a very good performance metric and benchmark for us.  We are looking to increase significantly the size of the Army Ranger Wing.  We need to be questioned each year on how it is being done.  We have problems with recruitment in the Reserve.  This year, 179 people have joined the Reserve.  We have recruitment challenges, and we should be measured and tested against what we think we can do in a 12-month period and what we actually do.  A metric is already there for the Naval Service's role in fisheries protection with regard to hours at sea.  It is a good metric, but this year there is a good reason as to why, knowing we have a problem, we have decided to reprioritise.  This is what the Department of Defence must do.  If people are dying in the Mediterranean and we have ships that can save them, I am sorry, but that is a bigger priority for me than fisheries protection, and I make no apologies for it.  We have had other challenges, such as the late delivery of the <i>LE James Joyce<\/i>and an historical asbestos issue which needed to be resolved.  We have had a number of problems that have had an impact, but this is a good example of a benchmark against which we can be judged.  If we do not meet the benchmark I will need to produce good reasons.  If we could create other metrics and measurements for other outputs for the Department of Defence we should try to do so, but they need to be relevant to what we are actually doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#BB00400","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Does anyone else wish to speak on this?

The vast majority of people in our Permanent Defence Force are in the Army, and the focus is very much on overseas missions and assisting other arms of the State in the roles they have here.  Capability is very much designed around UNIFIL, UNDOF and training missions in Mali.  Capabilities must be framed in the context of the risk assessment and the response to it.  If we decided not to have any more overseas missions, our capability measurements would be totally different.  We would not need Mowags and the type of armour we use would be different.  That is what we mean when we say there is no set metric for capabilities, because every country has a different focus for defence.  Ireland is very different from our closest neighbour and from other countries.  Ireland is a country that is similar in size to New Zealand and Israel, but the capabilities in terms of measurement are obviously entirely different, depending on the challenges faced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#CC00300","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>It is the methodology used rather than the actual events themselves.

The combined Estimates for defence and Army pensions for 2015 provided for gross expenditure of approximately &euro;898 million.  Of that sum, &euro;677 million was allocated to Vote 36, which is the Defence Vote.  More than 70% of the Defence Vote goes towards providing for the pay and allowances of up to 10,500 public service employees.  The remaining non-pay allocation provides mainly for the replacement and maintenance of essential equipment and operational costs.<\/p> <p>  The Army pensions Vote makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to or in respect of former members of the Defence Forces.  The 2015 Estimate provides a gross sum of &euro;221 million for the Army pensions Vote as a whole.  More than &euro;211 million of this allocation covers expenditure on all superannuation benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force and their dependants.  It is primarily demand-driven and non-discretionary.<\/p> <p>  Today&rsquo;s meeting is primarily about expenditure relating to 2015, and I take this opportunity to reflect on the importance, both financially and operationally, of having an effective strategic planning framework in place.  In a changing security climate, it was imperative that a strategic assessment of the security environment was undertaken.  This assessment ensures Ireland&rsquo;s defence policy framework is in a position to respond to emerging security challenges and contribute to international peace and security.  After an extensive collaborative process involving multiple stakeholders, I was very pleased to launch the White Paper on Defence in August.  This document reflects the current realities faced within the wider defence and security policy environment, acknowledges the increasingly complex nature of security threats in the world today and emphasises the need for a comprehensive response.<\/p> <p>   The White Paper sets out the roles the Government has assigned to the Defence Forces and considers associated capability requirements.  It sets out proposals on the replacement of major equipment platforms for the next decade and other priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.<\/p><p><font color=\"#002041\">It <\/font>provides clear direction and a pragmatic approach to defence and ensures that we can continue to rely on the service provided by the Defence Forces to the security of the State.  I would also like to highlight some of the other defence-related milestones and achievements throughout the year. <br\/><br\/>As of 15 September 2015, Ireland was contributing 482 Defence Forces personnel to 12 overseas missions throughout the world.  This level of overseas deployment reflects Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing contribution to international peace and security.  The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, with 198 personnel, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, with 141 Defence Forces personnel.  The Minister of State is on his way out to visit them at the moment.<br\/><br\/>In response to the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean and following Government approval, Ireland&rsquo;s overseas deployments now also include the Naval Service deployment to the Mediterranean.  The <i>LE Eithne<\/i>arrived in the south central Mediterranean on 23 May 2015, to assist the Italian authorities in humanitarian search and rescue operations.  The specific role of the Irish naval vessel is to provide a search and rescue capability and to undertake humanitarian rescue operations at sea in the Mediterranean.<br\/><br\/>The<i>LE Eithne<\/i>, during her deployment to the mission from 18 May to 17 July, rescued a total of 3,377 migrants from the waters between Libya and Sicily.  The <i>LE Niamh<\/i>was subsequently deployed and to date has been involved in the rescue of 4,020 migrants.  In total, 7,397 migrants have been rescued by the Irish Naval Service to date.  I think that number has risen since this was written.  Undoubtedly, this is a tragic and highly complex issue but the actions of both the <i>LE Eithne<\/i>and <i>LE Niamh<\/i>have highlighted the capability and commitment of Ireland&rsquo;s Naval Service to respond effectively to crisis situations.  Their outstanding efforts have saved lives, and, to that end, I am pleased to say that the <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>, which departed the naval base, Haulbowline last week, will continue to assist the Italian authorities in this ongoing humanitarian operation.  In the event of any further deployment beyond November 2015, I will revert to Government with proposals. <br\/><br\/>The White Paper reaffirmed my commitment to maintaining the permanent Defence Force personnel at a level of 9,500.  In that regard, a very active recruitment campaign is under way.  Already, in 2015, 194 personnel have completed, or continue, in training, and that number is expected to increase significantly by year end.  In addition, there have been 517 promotions across all ranks of the permanent Defence Force to date in 2015.<br\/><br\/>The Defence Forces continue to provide a military operational response to both the civil power and civil authorities, as required.  This is a vital public service role which highlights the attributes of the Defence Forces across a broad spectrum of areas including prisoner escorts, explosive ordnance disposal duties, air ambulance services, emergency aeromedical support roles, search and rescue missions and maritime patrols.<br\/><br\/>As we advance towards 2016, I expect the Defence Forces to play a very central role in the commemoration events that will take place.  Already in 2015, under the decade of centenaries commemoration programme 2012-22, the Defence Forces have participated in several events including the State commemoration of the funeral of O&rsquo;Donovan Rossa in August.  Additionally, the Defence Forces recently commenced the delivery of the national flag to all primary schools in the country.  This event started on 14 September 2015 and is scheduled to be completed before Proclamation day, 15 March 2016.<br\/><br\/>The recently published White Paper on defence also considered the further development of the Reserve Defence Force, RDF.  It outlines a range of measures which will be progressed during the next few years.  These measures build on the value for money review on the RDF and aim to improve on the overall effectiveness of the RDF.  They should also contribute significantly to recruitment.  If the RDF is doing more, more people will want to be part of it.  The truth is that it is more difficult to get into the RDF now.  There are fitness and other tests.  When people do get in, they are well trained and they are a resource we need to use more and will use more.<br\/><br\/>The naval vessel replacement programme has continued, and the <i>LE Samuel Beckett <\/i>was added to the fleet in 2015, joining the LE James Joyce which was delivered in April 2014.  A third ship purchased under this programme, the<i>LE William Butler Yeats<\/i>, is scheduled for delivery in July 2016.  The progressive and prudent approach taken to these purchases is testament to the value for money ethos prevailing within the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, with these vessels all procured without recourse to additional funding.  This has been achieved by careful management of financial resources and re-allocation of funding to meet additional requests for equipment and supports.<br\/><br\/>The Department works closely with the Defence Forces to ensure that they retain the capabilities to fulfil all roles assigned by Government, both at home and overseas.  In this context, the 2015 allocation allowed for the acquisition and upgrading of a range of priority defensive equipment.<br\/><br\/>The capital envelope for defence also makes provision for infrastructure development works.  The 2015 Estimate made provision for expenditure of &euro;18.5 million on new building works and ongoing maintenance of existing buildings and also included funding for the military archives building at Cathal Brugha Barracks.<br\/><br\/>Over the 2016-21 timeframe of the capital investment programme, significant capital funding will be expended on replacement programmes for defensive equipment across the Army, Naval Service and the Air Corps, including payments arising under the naval vessel replacement programme.  It will also provide for the ongoing refurbishment of a diverse Defence property portfolio and the provision of replacement or additional facilities, where required.  This capital funding envelope also provides for the development of a new institute for peace support and leadership training building on the UN training school in the Curragh.  The institute is intended to provide a new international resource in the area of conflict resolution, conflict prevention and peace-building.  If the committee wants to set up a separate meeting on that particular issue, I would be very happy to do it.  We have a very ambitious approach to developing something very special in Ireland over the next few years and I would happily spend an hour or two talking to the committee about it if it wants that.<br\/><br\/>Before concluding,  I want to refer again to Vote 35 - Army Pensions.  This Vote, which is demand-led, has funded the payment of military pension benefits of all categories to some 12,000 pensioners, including retirement pensions and gratuities, disability pensions, spouses&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s pensions.  Owing to the continued underlying increase in the numbers of retirement pensioners being paid from the Vote and the ongoing impact on pension payments of the exceptionally high numbers of retirements on pension in previous years, a net shortfall of some &euro;9 million is projected for 2015, as it was last year. Therefore, I would like to advise the committee that a Supplementary Estimate will be required later in the year. Similar to other years, this shortfall on the Army Pensions Vote will be met from savings within the Defence Vote.  We are not asking for extra money, we will make the necessary savings and arrangements in our own Vote 36 to be able to deal with this, as we did last year, and we debated it then.<br\/><br\/>In summary, across the combined Votes, expenditure is broadly on target.  Provision has been made to ensure the required funding is available within the Defence Vote to meet the Army pensions shortfall without recourse to any further Exchequer funding requirement.  If anyone has any comments or questions I will happily try to address them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#CC01500","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Before we go on to that we already wrote to the Minister commending the Naval Service personnel and the work they are doing in the Mediterranean.

I understand there was a fire on a naval vessel in the 1960s which affected two individuals and I have received correspondence from an individual on that subject.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this issue and I would appreciate if it would be possible for him to outline his position on it either to me or through the Chair.

I echo the sentiments of the Chair in commending all the personnel involved in what is a critical lifesaving mission in the Mediterranean.  Any person who is on board Irish territory in the Mediterranean while carrying out his or her duties can return home rightly proud of his or her involvement in the saving of so many thousands of lives under what I am sure have been horrific circumstances from time to time in recent months.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of the fleet, I was not aware that the name, the <i>LE William Butler Yeats<\/i>, had been selected.

I do not know how old the <i>LE Orla<\/i>and the<i>LE Ciara<\/i>are but the Minister might inform me in his response.<\/p><p>I echo the sentiments of the Chair regarding the retirement of the Chief of Staff - I was going to say Secretary General - and commend the work he completed in recent years.  Over the 25 or 30 years since I was a young boy, I have always been greatly interested in the conduct of the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Army, particularly in respect of peacekeeping and similar matters.  They rightly are a source of immense pride among Irish citizens.  The Minister has rolled out a recruitment programme, which is welcome, and obviously, as has been mentioned, fleet renewal across all three services will be improved.<\/p><p>I revert to a matter on which I have touched three or four times as we have discussed the Estimates over the years, namely, the ministerial air transport service, MATS.  Is there an update, for instance, on the aircraft that currently is in the United States?  Has it been sold?  I believe it has been but perhaps the Minister can update the joint committee in this regard and on the sort of money the Department might have received for that aircraft.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#EE00300","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":148,"content":"<p>There are a number of questions if the Minister wishes to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#EE00400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":149,"content":"<p>They all are good questions.  First, in respect of the fleet replacement programme, the White Paper states we want to have a minimum of eight ships in the fleet.  We got a little bit caught out this year, if I am honest, as earlier in the year we had decommissioned the<i>LE Aoife<\/i>without having the<i>LE James Joyce<\/i>available and as a consequence were without one ship for a couple of months.  We then also made a commitment to send a ship to the Mediterranean.  The<i>LE Eithne<\/i>, which basically has been the flagship for the Irish Naval Service for some time, was the first to go and we had an asbestos issue with one of the older ships.  However, all those problems have been resolved and the fleet is back up and running fully.<\/p><p>The Deputy is correct in that the <i>LE Aoife<\/i>was the oldest ship in the fleet.  It is to become part of the Maltese Navy, probably for the next five years, while the Maltese seek to design and build a new vessel.  However, that ship will be put to good use in a part of the world that badly needs capacity at sea, that is, in the Mediterranean.  That vessel has been in Cork Harbour in a dockyard while getting a thorough survey and assessment as well as a bit of work done before going to the Mediterranean.  However, I understand it will be leaving within the next three weeks.  This is a big deal for the Maltese authorities who will be sending some of their senior military personnel to Cork for the ship's departure.  The oldest ship in the fleet at present is the <i>LE Aisling<\/i>, which was built in 1980.  Thereafter, the <i>LE Eithne<\/i>, the <i>LE Ciara<\/i>and the <i>LE Orla<\/i>are all from 1984.  When the<i>LE William Butler Yeats<\/i>arrives next summer, the<i>LE Aisling<\/i>will be decommissioned.  The next ship we will look potentially to replace may well be the<i>LE Eithne<\/i>.  The capacity of that ship is different from all the other ships in that it is the only ship with a helicopter landing pad, although it is not used any more.  Consequently, the Department is examining the possibility of what is described as a blue-green ship, which is a larger vessel that would have more capacity than simply being an offshore patrol vessel such as the<i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>, the<i>LE James Joyce<\/i>or the<i>LE William Butler Yeats<\/i>.  Even though they are really good at what they do and are almost ideal ships for what is needed in Irish waters, I believe we need to have one ship in the fleet that is slightly larger, has more capacity, has a helipad and can play a role both at home and abroad that perhaps is more comprehensive than is possible with some of the other vessels.  There now is enough in the capital programme, the Government having agreed it and published it yesterday, to be able to consider making replacements.  Decisions must be made in respect of budgeting as to whether the<i>LE Eithne<\/i>is to be the first one or whether the <i>LE Orla<\/i>or the <i>LE Ciara<\/i>or both should come first.  It takes about three years to decide that a ship is to be replaced.  One then goes to tender for its design and build and then one actually builds it and our engineers are part of that.  Am I under some time pressure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#EE00500","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I am advised that we must be finished by 3.15 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#EE00600","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I will be a bit quicker.

Were a new Government to make a different decision, that would be a political decision rather than an operational one.

I join Deputy Farrell in complimenting everybody in the Naval Service on the work that is being done in the Mediterranean.  It is quite extraordinary and the Irish people at large are appreciative and proud of what their Naval Service is doing there.  Is the Minister confident the Government will agree to extend that activity beyond November?<\/p><p> In addition to the valuable work being done there, can we do more in our international role in addressing the asylum and refugee issue?  We can let it be known that along with what we are doing here indigenously to accommodate refugees, we are also very active daily in a way many other countries are not in this rescue mission.  Some of us are conscious of that but I do not know whether the message has gone abroad that we are daily doing something about that problem.  Does the Minister envisage any position in which our naval personnel can do something of a systematic nature to address human trafficking and abuse?<\/p><p> I am glad the Minister mentioned the reserves and he has made some very positive statements since taking office about the reserves and their role.  None the less, when I speak to reservists, they tell me their practical experience on an ongoing basis is one of impediments being put in their way, with recruitment falling short because of practical obstacles.  It was suggested to me recently that a group of people who passed the various tests which are correctly posed to those seeking to enter the reserves did not get in because the required Garda clearance for the group - there are 100 people - was not sent to the Garda authorities in time.  Neither the potential reservists nor the Garda have control over this and this would not suggest a very positive or proactive approach to recruitment on the part of the authorities with direct responsibility.  I ask that we bring in representatives of the reservists to hear directly from them, given that we had a very useful meeting with them some time ago.<\/p><p> I look forward to a further opportunity to debate with the Minister on the capital investment programme.  I commend the purchasing of naval vessels and the value for money in that respect.  What the Minister outlined today in that case is perfectly acceptable.  The Minister spoke about the peace support and leadership training for the Curragh, and I made a submission on that in the Green Paper.  Our party is very strongly committed to that.  I am conscious that 100,000 personnel are deployed by the United Nations at any given time, which is a lot of personnel in need of training.  Our expertise in peace support, leadership and military diplomacy gives us a capacity to meet a particular demand.  I would love to hear from the Minister at a later date about how ambitious he is for that initiative and how he sees it developing.<\/p><p> I note the Minister has achieved further savings.  The Department of Defence has been outstanding in this regard and I salute all the officials there in how they have achieved savings.  Nevertheless, those savings are being achieved against a background where we are told continually that the people serving in our Defence Forces are heavily dependent on family income supplement and they contend with very poor pay and conditions.  Given the savings, does the Minister accept something substantial must be done in terms of pay and conditions for serving members?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#EE01000","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>There were many issues in that contribution and we are conscious of time, so I ask the Minister to be as brief as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#FF00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I do not have a reputation for being brief in this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#FF00300","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I could not comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#FF00400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I will try to be a little more brief than usual.  There are many good questions there, to be fair.  On the Mediterranean mission, the <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>is due to be back on 5 December.  It is another rotation of approximately eight weeks.  The plan now is that at that point we will not replace the vessel because the anticipation is there may not be much traffic at that time of the year because the weather may make passage difficult.  I certainly anticipate that, because of the success of the mission, we will send a ship back there early in the spring, perhaps in February or March.  Having said that, we will assess the issue and if the Italians say they need us to stay, we will have to respond to that.<\/p><p>This was very new for us during the summer and the Naval Service had three weeks' notice to send a ship to the Mediterranean.  This is putting much pressure on the service and it has performed really well, but it is affecting the other roles it must play.  If we are going to have an approach that keeps a ship abroad permanently on different missions - it is currently in the Mediterranean - we must reflect on whether eight ships is enough for the Irish Naval Service.  We have a responsibility in fisheries patrol and the role must be played as part of the Common Fisheries Policy.  It is not just a voluntary action.  If there is going to be a priority in the Government to maintain a ship in the Mediterranean, it will have resource consequences, just as keeping our Army in UNIFIL and the UN Disengagement Observer Force has resource consequences.<\/p><p>I must flag that idea but I believe in what we are doing in the Mediterranean, which is great work.  I want to ensure we can continue to play a positive role in a very tragic humanitarian issue.  We can reassess that close to the time.  The current plan is to bring home the ship, assess the mission, learn lessons and look to provide the Italians with the assistance of a ship in the spring.  That will be kept under review.<\/p><p>It would be a good idea to bring in the reservists.  I can quote the White Paper and list everything we are committing to do for the reserves.  It is a pretty strong statement.  I accept we are not getting a flood of people looking to join and there are issues to be considered.  We essentially have a reserve at half strength and that needs to change, so we will do it.<\/p><p>On the peace and leadership institute, I have spent much time talking and thinking about the issue and we made a strong commitment in the White Paper.  This concept will grow but we need to do it properly.  We will not do a rush job before the election, for example.  We will put an experienced group of people in place to plan and grow this idea.  We have money to spend on building what will essentially be a new university campus attached to the UN peacekeeping school.  It will become quite a big institute in future.  I will happily speak to the detail of this at a later stage.<\/p><p>Pay and conditions in the Defence Forces are linked to pay and conditions right across the public sector.  We have a new pay agreement and it will kick in from 1 January, costing the Government an extra &euro;300 million next year.  That will be factored into the budget in a few weeks.  The Defence Forces will benefit from that, like everybody else.  We cannot do separate deals for the Defence Forces while leaving out other areas within the public sector.  We would not get the money from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015093000002#FF00500","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1443603600,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Like everybody else, I commend the Army and the Naval Service on the work they do, and I also commend the Minister and his Department.

The Department is undergoing a process of seeking approval for a memorandum of understanding regarding Ireland's proposed participation in the German battle group 2016.  I will now put some facts into the record for the reasons behind this proposal.  The motion is:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves Ireland&rsquo;s accession to the memorandum of understanding concerning the principles for the establishment and operation of a battle group to be made available to the European Union in the second half of 2016.<\/blockquote> <p>In commending the motion I will now outline the background to Ireland's participation in the German battle group.  The ambition of the EU is to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises.  This is a key objective in the continued development of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy.  In the Headline Goal 2010, the EU set itself the objective of being able &quot;to respond with rapid and decisive action applying a fully coherent approach to the whole spectrum of crisis management operations covered by the Treaty on the European Union&quot;.  This is a mouthful but it is eurospeak for saying that we need to have the capacity to respond to a crisis if and when it happens.  A key element of the Headline Goal 2010 is the capability to deploy forces at high readiness, broadly based on the battle groups concept.<\/p><p>The purpose of the EU battle groups is to undertake operations as outlined in the Amsterdam treaty.  These operations, known as Petersberg Tasks, include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.  In the Lisbon treaty these tasks were expanded to include joint disarmament operations, military advice and assistance tasks in supporting the reform and restructuring of security services and legal institutions in fragile states, conflict prevention and post-conflict stabilisation.<\/p><p>A central tenet of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations.  In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  This commitment has found expression in Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  Participation in EU battle groups represents another means for Ireland to express our commitment to the UN and its principles.<\/p><p>The Defence Forces contribution to this battle group will involve a Recce-ISTAR company together with staff posts at both the operational and force headquarters.  Recce is an abbreviation of reconnaissance and ISTAR is a military term meaning intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance.  The role of a Recce-ISTAR company is to operate in a forward position to generate and deliver specific information and intelligence to decision makers in support of the planning and conduct of operations.<br\/><br\/>The total number of Defence Forces personnel involved in this battle group will be approximately 175.  This level of resource commitment will only arise should the battle group be deployed to undertake an operation and should Ireland agree to participate, and if we agree to participate the triple lock will have to apply.  The commitment in terms of personnel leading up to and during the stand-by period, where the battle group has not been mobilised to undertake an operation, will be eight officers and two NCOs.  These will be deployed to battle group headquarters in Strasbourg and engaged in training and planning activities.<br\/><br\/>The German Battle Group Memorandum of Understanding is an agreement between the participants comprising the battle group, namely, Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Ireland, Croatia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, which sets out principles in relation to the operation, deployment and management of the German battle group.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Sections 1 to 4, inclusive, deal with the definitions and reference documents that are applicable to this memorandum of understanding.  They define Germany as the framework nation and Austria as the logistic lead nation and broadly outline the purpose of the memorandum of understanding.<br\/><br\/>Sections 5 to 8, inclusive, deal with the consultation process, exercise, training, certification and operation of the battle group.  Most battle group training will take place in the contributing member states.  Irish troops will be mainly trained here in Ireland.  That said, a joint training exercise with other battle group elements will also take place in the east of Germany at some point.  Approximately 170 Defence Force personnel will be required to deploy to Germany for this exercise, which is scheduled to take place from 18 to 29 April 2016.  The estimated cost of participation in this certification exercise will be in the region of &euro;955,000 to take account of transportation of equipment and the provision of food, fuel and other services in Germany.<br\/><br\/>One important issue to note is that each battle group participant retains the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces, irrespective of an EU decision to launch a battle group operation.  Equally, each battle group participant retains the sovereign right to withdraw its contingent at any time.  The command of each contingent remains under national control, with operational control delegated to the operational commander.  As such, any deployment of the Irish contribution as part of the German battle group will still be subject to the triple lock, which is a UN mandate, Government and D&aacute;il approval, and this will remain unaffected by Ireland signing the memorandum of understanding.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Sections 9 to 13, inclusive, outline the arrangements in terms of financing, logistics, classified information, the status of forces and the issue of claims and liabilities.  When a battle group participant is within the territory of another participant, the issues of jurisdiction and discipline and claims and liabilities of forces will be dealt with in accordance with the NATO Partnership for Peace Status of Forces Agreement, PfP SOFA.<br\/><br\/>A status of forces agreement is an agreement on the status of personnel engaged on overseas training and operations, whereby the host country agrees to extend certain rights and privileges to such personnel.  These include arrangements regarding jurisdiction in respect of certain crimes, powers of military police, enforcement of discipline by the superiors of the relevant personnel and determination of liability for damage to the property of third parties.<br\/><br\/>While all the other German battle group participants have signed the NATO PfP SOFA, Ireland has not yet done so.  We have previously acceded to the relevant provisions of the SOFA, generally through an exchange of letters with the European Union, NATO or lead framework nations for any operation in which we have participated.  It is intended to engage in a similar exchange of letters in relation to these matters in respect of our participation in the German battle group.  It should be noted that the immunities and privileges provided for in the SOFA, including those to which Ireland will accede through an exchange of letters, will not apply within Ireland.  SOFAs respect the principle of territorial sovereignty and given that there is a constitutional impediment to foreign forces being deployed in the State under their own command structures, effectively the terms of the SOFA are of no effect within the State, as no troops can be so deployed.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Sections 14 to 16, inclusive, deal with the process of participation of additional states in the battle group, the timelines for coming into effect and termination of the memorandum of understanding, and the process for dispute resolution.  The terms of the memorandum of understanding are similar to those that Ireland has previously acceded to for the 2008, 2011 and 2015 Nordic battle groups, as well as the 2012 Austro-German battle group.<br\/><br\/>While no battle group has deployed to date, the EU battle group concept has yielded many benefits to developing improved interoperability between the Defence Forces and the forces of other EU member states.  The battle group has also enabled the EU to develop its decision-making processes for rapid deployment on crisis management operations.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of battle groups is, very simply, to enable the Union to be more effective in contributing to international peace and security in support of the United Nations by putting in place a rapid response capability.  In this regard, it is worth again recalling the strong support of the United Nations for the EU&rsquo;s efforts in this regard.  During his recent visit to Ireland in May this year, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon commented positively on the EU-UN relationship and the importance of having a rapid response capacity.<br\/><br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s active engagement in EU battle groups enhances our capacity to influence the ongoing development and evolution of the rapid response capacity of the European Union, in particular, the role battle groups can play in reinforcing and acting as a strategic reserve for UN blue-hat operations.  Active engagement by Ireland across the range of activities under the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy means that Ireland can help shape this policy in a manner which is consistent with our values and our support of multilateralism and for the United Nations.<br\/><br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s participation in battle groups supports the development of rapid deployment skills and capabilities within the Defence Forces, together with improved interoperability with our partners.  It also enhances Ireland&rsquo;s credibility as a provider of professional and effective military forces for crisis management operations.  Finally, it reinforces our standing and capacity to influence the ongoing development of the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy in support of international peace and security and the UN.<br\/><br\/>The term &quot;battle groups&quot; is an unfortunate one because it conjures an image of an army going to war.  That is not what the UN battle groups concept is all about.  It is about trying to create an absence of war and intervene before conflicts arise, or while conflicts are under way, to try to protect civilians, separate warring parties and create peace and stabilisation in parts of the world that desperately need assistance to do that.  They have not been deployed yet even though they have been around for quite some time.  I suspect that may change.  Many countries are losing patience with spending money, training and preparing and not actually deploying that resource.<br\/><br\/>What Ireland is committing to, and which I hope the committee will give its support to, is to be part of that process, which is about Europe using its influence and resources to help create stabilisation in post-conflict situations or to help conflict in the first place.  It makes a lot of sense that, as a country that has a deep history in peacekeeping, we would be part of European efforts in that regard.  I hope the committee will be able to support what we are proposing to do next year to be part of a German-led battle group for the second half of next year.<\/p><p>Do members have questions or comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015093000002#A00300","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443623400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister that for the lay person the term \"battle group\" is not a very good on.

For Ireland to be part of the deployment of a battle group, were it to be deployed, there would have to be an UN mandate and the approval of both the D&aacute;il and the Government.  If there is a fear that we could be dragged into conflict by the back door because we are part of a battle group, people should know that that cannot happen unless we choose to be part of it.  There are safeguards.  In the vast majority of circumstances, if a battle group is to be deployed, it will be deployed in a spirit with which I think Ireland will be comfortable.

I would have thought the purpose of the vote was to accommodate the myriad types of family arrangements that are in place in Ireland.

The Minister indicated that she had received advice from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that this would be unconstitutional.  I am slightly sceptical about the use of advices from the Attorney General that nobody can see, question or read - advices from counsel can be quite nuanced - to shut down debate in this House, which is something that has happened quite a bit in the course of this D&aacute;il.  Has the Minister specifically obtained advices from the Office of the Attorney General - I am not referring to advices that have been hanging around for years - to the effect that there is a requirement to abolish the institution of civil partnership in order to legislate for homosexual marriage?

I will just go over the detail of the policy again and maybe add a little extra to what I said previously.  The policy based on the new constitutional context is that civil partnership registration will cease after a reasonably short period of transition.  As the Deputy knows, section 8 of this Bill repeals most of Part 7A of the Civil Registration Act 2004, which had set out the basis for registration of civil partnerships.  The status of current civil partners remains completely unchanged.  I think we are all very clear about that.  There is no question of removing any of the rights and obligations of civilly partnered couples or of changing their status in regard to each other.  They will be free to marry each other if they so choose, or to remain as civil partners.<\/p> <p>  I would like to say a little more about the legal advice I have received.  I have been advised that it would not be constitutional to keep civil partnership available and to open it to opposite-sex couples as this would create a risk of making civil partnership a potential competitor to marriage.  All of the advice I have makes it clear that making a marriage-like relationship available would violate the constitutional pledge to \"guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack\".  The legal advice I have is that civil partnership was legally and constitutionally justifiable because same-sex couples did not have the opportunity to marry.  Now that same-sex couples can marry, the rationale for civil partnership as a distinct institution has disappeared.  Accordingly, civil partnership is being wound down.  The State is constitutionally prevented from making an alternative legal relationship available to couples, even though some might wish to become civil partners rather than marrying.  That is the legal advice I have.  This is an obvious question that arises.  One has to consider it from a constitutional point of view.  I have set out the advice that is shaping what we are doing in the Bill in relation to the future of civil partnership.  It is very much based on advice relating to the role of marriage in the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015093000002#N00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1443623400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply.  I do not doubt that the Minister has received this advice, even if I might not necessarily agree with it.  The Attorney General's office is the Attorney General's office.  Ministers and Governments are bound to follow the advice of the Attorney General's office.  The 2010 Act introduced cohabitation and provided for the rights of cohabitees.  If civil partnership is somehow a competitor to marriage, I suggest that the same thing must apply to cohabitation and giving rights to cohabitees.  I am not entirely convinced by the rationale we have heard.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is right when she says that civil partnership is a marriage-like institution.  I do not necessarily know why it has to be a marriage-like institution.  I do not know why the long-standing consanguinity impediments to marriage in Judeo-Christian traditions and Roman law, which predated marriage as a Christian institution, were introduced into civil partnership.  I remind the Minister that the concept underpinning civil partnership is that it gives rights to people living together as a family unit who wish to obtain legal protection for that unit and to give rights to each other in the event that something happens.  A common example of that in Ireland would be two elderly siblings who live together in a fairly dependent way.  They no have rights under the mental health or pensions Acts or anything else.  If something happens one sibling, the other sibling has no rights even though they have been living together as a family for their entire lives, albeit obviously in a non-intimate way.  Irish law provides very little protection to people in such circumstances.  Why do we need to have the consanguinity impediments in civil partnership?  I do not know why civil partnership cannot be open to people who are not otherwise in a civil partnership or married, but are in a non-intimate relationship.  I note that intimacy is not a requirement for being treated as a cohabitee, although I suppose it is presumed that the couple were intimate at one point.  One way of avoiding this idea of competition would be to change the nature of civil partnership and open it up.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to make the point that marriage is a permanent institution, notwithstanding the divorce legislation in Ireland.  It has to be demonstrated that a marriage is irretrievably broken down in order to have it dissolved or to obtain a divorce.  The same thing does not apply to civil partnership.  They are two very different institutions.  I do not really see that one necessarily competes with the other.  People choose to marry or cohabit or whatever.  I think there are other ways around it.

The Minister mentioned administrative burdens to people who are in a civil partnership and wish to marry.  One of the biggest administrative burdens, applying equally to gay and straight couples who wish to enter into a civil marriage, is the inability to get married because of staff shortages in the registrar's office.  People can marry from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday but most people want to marry outside working hours.  We can discuss resources as much as we like but the reality is that resources are not there.  I will propose an amendment to section 54 of the 2004 Act, which sets out who can solemnise a marriage, to include peace commissioners and commissioners for oaths.  These people would clearly have to be accepted by the registrar and demonstrate suitability.  They should be trained and know how to do it.  There are already safeguards, including the requirement to give notice to the HSE, to be interviewed and so on.  All these safeguards should be maintained but it would allow people to get married at a hotel or venue of their choosing outside of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday.

Before changing those categories, which is what the Deputy suggests, we would have to consider implications and what it might mean.  It is a matter for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection because it comes under related legislation.  My understanding is that currently there are no plans to change the categories of bodies or organisations that may apply to have their members entered on the register of solemnisers.  I appreciate that the Deputy has said he wants to bring forward an amendment to change that but it would have to be considered carefully in the context of any implications.<\/p> <p>  It is anticipated that the increased demand for marriage solemnising arising from the implementation of the same-sex marriage provisions in this Marriage Bill will be offset to a significant extent by the cessation in the registration of civil partnerships, which is provided for in the Bill.  As the Deputy mentions, registrars are employed by the HSE which is responsible for their terms and conditions of employment.  I take the point made by the Deputy about weekends, which is reasonable.  I know there are some discussions ongoing on broader issues relating to the human relations side of registrars.  I take the point and I will certainly relay the Deputy's concern to the relevant Ministers.  Clearly, there is a demand for weekend ceremonies as well.  Under the current terms and conditions of employment of registrars under the HSE, that is not a possibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015093000002#O01400","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1443623400,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.
