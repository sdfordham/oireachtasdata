I wish all of them well in their work.  I extend our thanks to Deputies Kieran O'Donnell and Eoghan Murphy for their contribution to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I wish them well with the banking inquiry.  I have no doubt the report that this committee finished on the way a banking inquiry should be conducted will be of great assistance to them.  At least we have pointed the way for that committee.

With regard to what we have been dealing with over the past couple of weeks and what transpired on the floor of the D&aacute;il yesterday, an impression was given and picked up by the media that the Committee of Public Accounts had exhausted the options available to it when it came to dealing with the whistleblower and everything around the issue.  Any member may correct me if I am wrong.  It is important that the public has set out for it what exactly were the options we were given and where we were in that process.<\/p><p>  My understanding is that two recommendations were made to us by the legal adviser.  The first was characterised as the quickest and cleanest option, which was to interview representatives of the Revenue Commissioners about all these issues.  There was a second option, upon which we had not decided.  It was that we could apply for a resolution to be laid before the D&aacute;il to deal with these matters.  That would have taken an application to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, but we had not decided on that.  There was agreement by all committee members that the decision would not be taken until representatives of the Revenue Commissioners had testified before the committee.<\/p><p>  One member, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, gave the impression on the floor of the D&aacute;il that the Committee of Public Accounts was not in a position to deal with these issues when two recommendations had been made by the legal adviser and we had not definitively decided on the second one.

It was incorrect to seek to put on record that this had been the case.  In having representatives of the Revenue Commissioners before us today, we will have the opportunity to explore the issue further.  It is clear from the statement of the Accounting Officer from the Revenue Commissioners that she is quite happy to discuss aspects of the dossier which came before us in the context of the work she has done relating to tax evasion.  It was agreed that we would reconsider the issue after this meeting with representatives of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is totally untrue to say we had come to the end of the road and we could not proceed.  We had acted within the context of the legal advice received.

That was reiterated very clearly and I checked and rechecked that with the legal adviser.  It was made very clear that any matters pertaining to specific individuals or allegations of political obstruction are beyond the remit of this committee.<\/p><p>  The dossier contains essentially two elements, or possibly three elements.  One relates to allegations of tax evasion, and they are only allegations.  Allied to that is the possibility of improper or corrupt payments, and those are only allegations.  To top all of this off, there is a narrative of political obstruction and blockage.  That is what the whistleblower alleges in the dossier.  The legal person has made it absolutely clear to us repeatedly that it is beyond the remit of the committee to capture and investigate all those matters.<\/p><p>  There will be witnesses from the Revenue Commissioners before us today and I have read Ms Feehily's opening statement, like everybody else I am sure.  We will make what progress we can on the issue.  It remains my view that the full breadth of what is alleged in the dossier cannot be fully, fairly and adequately assessed within this committee unless we stray beyond our remit.  The legal person has told us that such action will land us in all sorts of difficulties.  I wish the position were different and we did have the scope to investigate all these matters.  Notwithstanding what I did, I was perfectly entitled to do so as a Member of the Oireachtas and I acted in a considered fashion.  It remains open to us to make the application to which Deputy Deasy refers to the CPP.  I would wager that even in doing that, we would still run up against difficulties in terms of scope.  The allegations in the dossier are considerable and wide-ranging.  They are very profound.  That is the position as I understand it and as I clarified it on Tuesday evening, when the legal adviser came before the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014120400003#B00800","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1417687200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I have never experienced the kind of misinformation and disinformation that I am now hearing.

The document is not a document of the committee.  Each member will have it as their personal papers.  The matter that was raised by Deputy McDonald in the D&aacute;il yesterday is a matter for the House.  We have agreed on how to dispose of the issues here before us in terms of the two options, in terms of the legal advice we received and in the context of not naming individuals.  That is what we normally do here.  What has been described by both speakers and by Deputy Costello is in line with the decision taken last week.  Members are free after that to use their own judgment in relation to what they do in the House.  I cannot allow what happened in the House yesterday under the Ceann Comhairle to pertain here at this meeting because it is against legal advice, and I think we all understand that.

For the record, I would say that prior to the committee receiving any legal steer on these matters, I, as an individual, had sought advice from the parliamentary legal adviser.  In fact, I understand I was the first person to bring the dossier to the attention of that individual.  At every step anything that I have done or said has been guided by the legal advice afforded to me but I agree with the Chairman.  We in the Committee of Public Accounts should strive to do as much as we can and the options have been set out.  I do not think there is any disagreement on that.  I remind committee members that we were told very clearly by that same legal adviser that we would run into issues around the Abbeylara judgment in terms of how we deal with these issues.  That is where not only this committee, but any committee of the Oireachtas, runs into the sand.  That was in the part the rationale for taking the decision and making the statement that I am fully entitled to make as a Member of the Oireachtas on the floor of the D&aacute;il yesterday.

I issued a clear audit opinion on the account.  In addition, arising from our testing of Revenue systems for the assessment, collection and allocation of revenues, I have presented reports on the implementation of local property tax and on the taxation of rental income in the report on the 2013 accounts of the public services.  Those reports are currently scheduled for consideration by the committee in April 2015.  Accordingly, I will defer my outline of the findings of those reports until the later meeting.<\/p><p>  The focus of this morning&rsquo;s meeting is the special investigation undertaken by Revenue in relation to what are called the \"Ansbacher accounts\".  There is no specific report in relation to that from my office, so I have looked back on previous reports on that matter to provide a background to the committee's proceedings.  The existence of such accounts first came to public notice in early 1997 during the proceedings of the McCracken tribunal.  The accounts involved a complex system whereby individuals in Ireland could have bank accounts offshore, held nominally by Ansbacher Cayman Limited, with no official bank record in Ireland of deposits in the accounts, and yet with ready access to their funds in the State.<\/p><p>  The McCracken tribunal report was published in August 1997.  In January 1998, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment appointed an official from her Department to examine the books and documents of Ansbacher Cayman Limited, under provisions of the Companies Acts.  Following the completion of the examiner&rsquo;s report, and a petition from the Minister, the High Court appointed inspectors to inquire further into the affairs of Ansbacher Cayman Limited in September 1999.  In parallel with the High Court inspectors&rsquo; work, Revenue set up its own special project team in September 1999 to examine the tax affairs of 120 individuals who were identified in the examiner&rsquo;s report.  Including those cases, and others discovered by Revenue in the course of its inquiries and-or by the High Court inspectors, Revenue identified a total of 289 cases for investigation.  The Accounting Officer will be able to inform the committee about the investigation process applied in those cases and the resourcing of those investigations. <\/p><p>  By the end of 2013, Revenue had collected a total of almost &euro;113 million from settlements in Ansbacher cases, consisting of tax, interest for late payment and penalties imposed.  Figure 1 outlines the timing of receipts by Revenue arising from its investigations of Ansbacher cases.  This indicates that the peak in receipts was in 2007, when a total of &euro;35 million was received.  Since then, a small number of cases have been settled each year, and yields have been commensurately lower.  In 2013, around &euro;80,000 was received in payment of Ansbacher settlements.  Only a handful of the 289 cases identified remain to be finalised.  The committee may wish to note that late payment interest and penalties amounted to &euro;63 million, or almost 56% of the Ansbacher receipts.  This is consistent with the use of Ansbacher accounts over many years to evade tax.  In comparison, we estimated in a report on tax audit settlements presented last year that interest and penalties applied more generally in tax audits account for just over 20% of the yield.  It is important also to note that in a significant number of the Ansbacher-related cases investigated, Revenue found that there was, in fact, no tax liability or that any tax due had been duly paid.<\/p><p>  To put the Ansbacher investigation into a broader context, Revenue has carried out ten special investigations since the late 1990s.  My predecessors reported each year on Revenue&rsquo;s progress on those investigations over the period 1999 to 2010, by which time the special investigations were all substantially complete.  By the end of 2013, Revenue had collected just over &euro;2.7 billion from those investigations.  It may be worth noting that, over the same period, Revenue&rsquo;s routine tax audits and investigations yielded a total of around &euro;2.6 billion. <\/p><p>  Figure 2 shows the total financial yield from each of the special investigations.  While the number of Ansbacher cases involving settlements was small, the average settlement in yielding cases was relatively high - an average of &euro;790,000 per case.  This compares to averages of around &euro;1.5 million in 28 tribunal-related cases, &euro;190,000 in NIB offshore investment cases and &euro;120,000 in trusts and offshore structure cases.  Unlike the Ansbacher cases, some of the investigation initiatives involved voluntary disclosure provisions, which provided incentives in appropriate circumstances for tax evaders to settle with Revenue.  Where such incentives existed, the average settlements were lower.<\/p> <p>Finally, because of the operation of Ansbacher accounts over a period stretching back at least to the 1970s, it is worth noting that many of the account holders would have had an opportunity to avail of tax amnesties in 1988 and 1993.  By declaring the existence of such off-shore funds, account holders had the incentive in the 1993 amnesty to pay just 15% of the tax due, with no payment of interest or penalties.  A small number of the Ansbacher account holders were not required to make settlements following the special investigation, on the basis that they had made declarations under that amnesty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014120400005#D00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417689000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend today&rsquo;s meeting. I understand the committee&rsquo;s focus for today is on the action taken by Revenue in relation to the information received from the authorised officer&rsquo;s Ansbacher reports.  I welcome the opportunity to assist the committee in this regard and I will endeavour to be as open and transparent as possible.  At the same time, the confidentiality of taxpayer information is a central element in the tax system and under section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, it is a criminal offence for any past or serving Revenue officer to disclose taxpayer information.  I appreciate the committee has always understood this any time I have appeared before it previously.  This obligation is not affected by the fact that elements of the information enter the public domain and the information retains its character as &ldquo;taxpayer information&rdquo; and therefore retains the protection of section 851A.  I am also, inevitably, somewhat constrained by the passage of time and because many of the senior Revenue officers who dealt with the authorised officer&rsquo;s reports have retired.<br\/>As reported to the committee in the past, over 15 years ago the Revenue Commissioners commenced an investigation into the operation of the Ansbacher accounts and the tax affairs of the Irish resident account holders following the publication of the McCracken report.  A copy of the report of the authorised officer completed in June 1999 was received shortly afterwards from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  This report contained information about the alleged involvement of 120 named individuals with Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited.  On receipt of the report, a special project team led by a very experienced senior official was set up to investigate the tax affairs of the named individuals, associated persons and trusts.  This team consisted of around 20 experienced Revenue staff.  The authorised officer&rsquo;s report was a very important contribution to these investigations.  The team examined all the information which came to Revenue from the authorised officer and his Ministers whether there was evidence of an Ansbacher deposit or not.  From the outset it was recognised that the investigations would be complex and time consuming.<br\/>In parallel with the authorised officer&rsquo;s report, in September 1999 Revenue also obtained High Court orders against two financial institutions and two other entities.  These orders required the parties to supply information, particulars and documentation in relation to the Ansbacher deposits.  Some 200,000 documents were received on foot of these orders alone over a four-year period. <br\/>As the investigations and examinations continued, the extensive use of legislative powers was necessary, requiring the production by financial institutions and other third parties of books, records, and documentation that were relevant to establishing the liabilities or otherwise of account holders and other named individuals.  Following receipt, in July 2002, of the High Court inspectors&rsquo; report into the affairs of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, an application was made to the High Court for access to the supporting papers to the report.  This application was held in open court over three days and the information, when Revenue received it, proved particularly important in progressing investigations into individual cases.  Another helpful order enabled the authorised officer to allow Revenue to inspect and copy microfilm records which he held.  Since the start of the investigation 26 High Court orders were obtained against financial institutions and third parties relevant to the liabilities of the Ansbacher account holders, the most recent in 2013.  Revenue received over 300,000 documents in the course of this investigation.  Advanced investigative computer software was used in collating, interrogating and managing the vast volume of financial documentation concerned. <br\/>Turning to the Companies Act 1990, over the period from September 1999 to February 2011, Revenue received extensive reports, information, books and documents from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation - under the various titles that ministerial portfolio held over those years -  relating to Ansbacher accounts.  All of this information has been examined and followed up and is included in the cases which were investigated by the Ansbacher project team on which Revenue has previously written to the Public Accounts Committee.  My officials also advise me that over this period many helpful meetings were held with the authorised officer. <br\/>Altogether, the investigations and examinations identified some 289 cases.  The number of connected entities consisting of trusts, associated companies, offshore entities, etc., related to the 289 substantive cases was nearly 700.  As of now, 283 cases have been finalised.  Of the remaining six, five have made a payment on account and four are under appeal.  138 of the finalised cases yielded &euro;113 million in tax, interest and penalties.  58 significant settlements have been published in the quarterly tax defaulters list and are on the public record, most with the designation &ldquo;Ansbacher&rdquo;. <br\/>From the outset, there were a small number of cases already under investigation as a result of other Revenue projects, for example tribunal-related investigations.  These are recorded separately and those particular cases yielded over &euro;6 million. <br\/>In addition to the 289 cases, as a result of increased knowledge of the use of offshore structures and trusts used in the transmission of funds, Revenue set up a number of other projects including a very successful offshore assets project team. For example, one Ansbacher-related High Court order resulted in additional yield of &euro;25 million in a spin-off investigation.  A second such investigation in relation to trusts and offshore structures has resulted in an addition &euro;65 million to date.  This investigation is ongoing and the final yield is likely to exceed &euro;115 million.  The combined yield, therefore, from the Ansbacher investigations and two spin-offs will likely exceed &euro;250 million.  The knowledge gained has also allowed Revenue to break new legal ground and support the case for changes to Revenue's investigative powers. <br\/>It is important from a fairness perspective to put on record that although a person may be named in an Ansbacher report, that in itself is not proof that an Ansbacher account was held by that person, nor is it proof of tax evasion. This was underlined by the High Court inspectors in their report published in June 2002 and I quote: <blockquote>CAVEAT: It is important to bear in mind that a finding that any particular individual is a client of Ansbacher, is NOT a finding that the person evaded tax.  As will be seen further on, persons who have been identified as clients did not necessarily have deposits with Ansbacher.  Some such persons simply borrowed money from Ansbacher in the ordinary course of business, a transaction giving rise to no tax liability whatsoever.  Others again established Trusts to which they never transferred any assets.<\/blockquote>In this context, around half of the cases under investigation - 145 cases - were finalised and did not result in any yield from this project.  Of these, 69 cases were established to be foreign non-resident cases with no liability to Irish tax.  20 cases were covered by the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act 1993.  The balance of cases included individuals who were bank clients but not deposit holders and cases that had correctly declared the deposits in their annual tax returns of income. <br\/>As the Comptroller and Auditor General has just said, his office has regularly reported in his Annual Report on progress of the Ansbacher project and presented these updates to the PAC in the normal way, and they were examined.  Progress was also reported each year in Revenue&rsquo;s annual reports from 1999 to 2007. <br\/>Turning to the question of prosecutions, Revenue actively considered prosecution under the Taxes Acts in a number of cases.<\/p> <p>However, an essential element for a successful criminal prosecution is the availability of relevant original documents and that element was largely missing.  There were very few original documents available and there was no legal mechanism to compel Cayman entities to produce documents or their employees to give evidence.  The time elapsed was also a very significant factor.  The Ansbacher accounts ran from 1971 until the mid-1990s.  The time elapsed was typically in excess of ten years.  Section 1078(7) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that proceedings have to be instituted within ten years from the date of the commission of the offence.  In consultation, however, and in co-ordination with other relevant agencies which were considering their prosecution options, Revenue officials provided witness statements to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at their request.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I am satisfied that Revenue made full and appropriate use of all the information received from the authorised officer&rsquo;s reports, the High Court inspectors&rsquo; report and its underlying documents.  I want to assure the committee in particular that all the authorised officer&rsquo;s material referred to Revenue by the Ministers for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was fully examined and followed up, wherever it took us.<\/p><p> Revenue allocated and maintained a significant experienced investigative resource in a dedicated project team.  We made extensive use of legislative powers to seek books and records, and where these powers did not achieve success we went to the High Court to progress the investigation and overcome blockages.  We obtained, as I have said, a significant number of orders.<\/p><p> Revenue staff have shown resilience and persistence in bringing all the cases identified to conclusion, with a significant yield of &euro;49 million in tax and a further &euro;64 million in interest and penalties.  The lessons learnt from this investigation have been important in the success of other related projects, in developing new law and supporting enhanced investigative powers.<\/p><p> As the Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out, our inquiries into Ansbacher were part of a series of special investigations into serious tax evasion involving various forms of bogus non-resident accounts and offshore accounts which have yielded in total &euro;2.7 billion in tax, interest and penalties to date.  These investigations were comprehensively followed through and they provided a model for similar investigations in other revenue jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014120400006#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417689600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>May we publish your statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014120400007#F00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417689600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014120400007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1417689600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Feehily for attending today at relatively short notice to address the issues that have come into the public domain in recent times.

He sees a situation where the addendum report was pretty well ignored until he got a response.

As the 2000s progressed and as I mentioned to Deputy Ross, other investigations were taking place.  The investigation into bogus non-resident accounts ran in parallel in 2001.  We were also dealing with matters relating to High Court orders, offshore assets and tribunals.  During those years, Revenue received sanction for 300 additional staff.  We increased the number of people dealing with this group of cases from 20 to 30.  The number of people on the team reached 30 in 2001.  We maintained that number of people working on these cases until 2005.  The ratio of people to cases was extraordinarily high by Revenue or any other standards.  By the time the case base reached 289, there were 30 officers involved.  There was also a structure in place for the first couple of years of the process whereby very regular meetings were held.  These were led by very experienced assistant secretaries who were all qualified inspectors of taxes in their own right and one of whom was a qualified barrister.

Did the then board of Revenue or any senior officials give an official opinion to the Department of Finance with regard to this amnesty?  Some people, including a number of academics, remain of the opinion that the tax amnesty in question was unnecessary.  There were massive differences between the 1988 amnesty, which was operated on the basis that all outstanding taxes be recouped, and the 1993 amnesty, which was known as the \"15% incentive amnesty\".  There is a theory - I have heard it outlined on a number of occasions - that as the investigations into the Ansbacher accounts proceeded in the period 2003 to 2005, plenty of people in senior positions in Revenue had major misgivings with regard to the way in which the legislation relating to the 1993 amnesty was drafted.  Some Ansbacher account holders availed of the 1993 tax amnesty and when they were pursued, they had the certificates they had obtained as a result of that and these made them immune from prosecution.  This is a really important point.  Some 20 Ansbacher account holders availed of the tax amnesty and there is a suggestion that the legislation under which that amnesty was established was politically motivated.

I recall there being some criticism of the then board because the amnesty yielded a lot of money.  The board had stated that it was not necessary and should not be done because there would not be very much money forthcoming.  I remember that aspect of a conversation taking place after the yield emerged.  Revenue was not in favour of amnesties in general and would not have liked this one at all.  The committee will be aware that in the past there have been various voluntary disclosure schemes, which are incentivised.  However, the Revenue position would always be that we should get the tax.  That is just a general position of revenue organisations across the globe.  We do not like to walk away from tax.  I do not think I am commenting on policy when I say that the general position of Revenue and similar organisations elsewhere is that we do not favour amnesties which let people off paying tax.

In law, those certificates were sufficient evidence to the rest of Revenue to the effect that, at any time in the future, we could not look behind them.  A special unit was established.  Those present from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General will recall that Revenue had to suspend its internal audit function because of the difficulty of finding officials who had never seen tax files.  An assurance had to be given that such officials would never see such files in the future and this meant that their careers had to be managed.  I recall this because I worked in human resources, HR, at the time.  We were obliged to suspend the internal audit function in order to find people who we could state were in compliance with the law because they had never been involved - as tax inspectors within the Collector General's office or anywhere else - in cases in the past.

It was made known to the powers that be in spring 2004, but by July 2004 the investigation was closed.  That was a cause of comment in the D&aacute;il at the time.  If I recall correctly, Deputy Rabbitte questioned quite vigorously the closing of the inquiry.  It was obviously a subject of commentary.  Did Revenue have a view on it?  Does Ms Feehily recall?

I am delighted to be back on this very important committee.  The fact is that the authorised officer was stood down in 2004 by the then Minister.  Given that the report goes up to 2011, one would imagine that given the understanding, concern, respect and commitment of a top civil servant and that only six of the 283 cases are outstanding, in order to continue the work in the past seven years one wonders whether the situation could not have been resolved by means of a round-table discussion with the authorised officer, even by successive Ministers and everybody involved in this very notable case going back to the 1980s and 1990s?<\/p> <p>Given that this concerned the Ansbacher cases, it amazes me that this matter was not dealt with during the seven year commitment made by that civil servant.  Is it not the case that the focus of Mr. Ryan's concern is the 700 entities and not the six outstanding cases?  Ms Feehily stated, \"The number of connected entities consisting of trusts, associated companies, offshore entities, etc., related to the 289 substantive cases was nearly 700\".  What does Ms Feehily mean by \"related\"?  What is her definition of \"related\"?  It seems to be a huge amount of companies, practically 100% of related companies.  Ms Feehily mentioned there was over &euro;2 billion collected.  I am new to this matter, but it would appear to me that Mr. Ryan's concern is not focused on the six unfinished cases but rather the 700 related entities, which would be in this reference book. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014120400019#S03600","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417697400,"counter":400,"content":"<p>To be clear, when I say \"related\", I was simply including that detail to show the complexity of the project.  If we refer to 289 cases, a person might wonder what we have been doing for the last umpteen years.

Typically, a case would have a person, perhaps a family member, a discretionary trust or a special purpose vehicle and maybe another trust.  That is what I mean when I refer to \"related\" entities.  The first thing we had to do was connect them all and they became one case.  I assure the Deputy that the entire 700 entities have been connected to the 289 cases.  They have been investigated, examined and followed through on.  If my language was not precise enough, I apologise for that.  There is no loose thread in relation to the entities that were connected to these cases, every single one of them.

One would imagine that there would be a register of complaint with the Director of Corporate Enforcement and likewise with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, if this is something that is criminal by nature and if there was tax evasion by entities outside of the 289 cases.

I assure the Deputy that every single piece of information we received from the officer and his Ministers was examined and followed through on, wherever it took us.  I cannot comment on his dissatisfaction.  As Deputy Deasy pointed out, if he had asked us, I could only have given him answers that would have been in the same vein as those I am giving to this committee.

We work closely with all of the agencies.  In this particular set of cases, we have shared considerable information.

We are a double act.  I will begin with the investment plan before passing the floor to Mr. O'Riordan to present the second point, which is the European semester and the annual growth survey.<\/p> <p>I would like to start with a few introductory words about the new Commission.  As members know, 2014 has been a year of major change in the European Union.  The ball started rolling with the European Parliament elections in May.  We had changes at the helm of the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission and have basically had a major overhaul of the main personalities driving the EU agenda.<br\/>The new European Commission President, Jean-Claude Junker, has made it clear that he does not intend it to be business as usual.  He wants to make a fresh start and to focus the European Union's activities on the key challenges faced by its citizens.  He has put together a ten-point agenda, concentrating on the areas in which he believes concrete action should be taken during his term of office.  The key message from the new Commission is that the European Union needs to be bigger and more ambitious on the big things and smaller and more modest on the small things.  Basically, a stricter application of the principle of subsidiarity should be applied.  That is our <i>leitmotif<\/i>for going forward.<br\/>What are the priorities?  We are going to discuss the first big priority today - a new boost for jobs, growth and investment.  The investment plan is central to this.  The biggest challenge is the economy.  We have low growth and high unemployment across the EU.  Youth unemployment, in particular, is of major concern.  The second priority is to have a more connected digital single market.  The third priority is to have a more resilient energy Union, with a forward-looking climate change policy.  The fourth priority is a deeper and fairer Internal Market with a strengthened industrial base.  The fifth priority is to have a deeper and fairer economic and monetary union.<br\/>I would like to underline to the committee that President Junker has been clear in the importance he attaches to the social agenda.  The social agenda has not perhaps been to the fore over recent years as Europe has tried to manage the crisis, but it is very much back in vogue.  The President has told the European Parliament that the stability of our single currency and the solidity of public finances are as important to him as social fairness in implementing the necessary structural reforms.  He has, on a number of occasions, underlined that he is a strong believer in the social market economy.  I would like to send that message very clearly because it is an important highlight of the new Commission.<br\/>Another priority is a reasonable and balanced free trade agreement with the US.  Justice and fundamental rights based on mutual trust is another priority.  Developing a new policy on migration is another priority as migration issues are of major concern.  Another priority is for the EU to be a stronger global actor.  Creating a Union of democratic change is another priority.  That is a broad brush of the new priorities, the new Commission and where the emphasis lies.<br\/>I will move on to the investment plan, adopted by the Commission two weeks ago.  After years of stagnation, there are still major challenges to get Europe back on the road to prosperity.  The investment plan is designed to help to address this.  The new Commission only took office on 1 November and three weeks into its term, it has already launched its new &euro;315 billion investment plan.  The aim is basically to kick-start investment, growth and jobs in Europe.<br\/>This plan has been developed in close co-operation with the European Investment Bank, which is the largest multilateral lender and borrower in the world.  With the sovereign debt crisis over, there is a need for a fresh impetus to unlock investment.  While investment is taking off in the US, Europe is lagging far behind.  Despite the fact there is ample liquidity in Europe, investment levels are &euro;440 billion below their peak in 2007.  This is holding the EU back and is leading to sluggish recovery and only very marginal changes in the high unemployment levels we have currently.<br\/>The investment plan is taking a new approach.  Its focus is mainly on capturing riskier projects that would not normally attract support.  This is an innovative approach going beyond what we normally do in existing EU programmes and also going beyond the traditional activities of the European Investment Bank.  In essence, it changes the way public money is used.  Public money will not be used as grants in this particular plan but rather it will be used to leverage private funds.  It will provide a guarantee to investors to help to tap into the liquidity that is already there.  This block of funding aims to remove the fear factor or the reticence private investors have in funding major projects.  It aims to remove that fear factor in order to help unlock the funds they have available.<br\/>The plan is built on three strands.  The first is the creation of a European fund for strategic investments, guaranteed with public money.  This is to mobilise the &euro;315 billion of additional investment by 2017.  The fund will be hosted by the European Investment Bank and co-funded by the European Investment Bank and the European Commission.  It will provide partial risk protection and will complement current activities by focusing exclusively on strategic investments that are necessary for Europe's return to growth but investments that have a different risk profile to projects currently funded by the European Investment Bank.  We are not trying to displace one sort of funding with another but are trying to tackle or open up a new seam of projects that would never be funded without giving some kind of guarantee to get them off the ground.<br\/>The fund is supposed to be operational by the middle of next year.  The EU will provide a budget of &euro;16 billion in funding while the European Investment Bank will contribute an additional &euro;5 billion in risk-bearing capacity.  However, this is only the beginning.  Based on prudent assumptions and historical experience, we expect this seed funding to turn into a &euro;315 billion investment in the real economy because the multiplier effect is calculated as 1:15, so for every &euro;1 of public funding mobilised in the fund, we anticipate that &euro;15 of total investment which would otherwise not have happened will be generated.  The advice the Commission has had from the European Investment Bank and other banking and investment experts is that it is a reasonable assumption to make and that this could be the multiplier effect of the initial investment.<br\/>The second part of the plan, which I think will be particularly interesting to members, is the establishment of a pipeline of projects in areas of strategic importance, such as broadband, energy networks, transport infrastructure, education, research and innovation and energy efficiency.<\/p> <p>They are the broad areas which obviously cover a whole swathe of activity.<br\/>Investment in small and medium enterprises and mid-cap companies will be a particular target.  SME investment in Ireland took a big hit during the crisis and this plan has the potential to help to address that issue.  The first list of potential projects is due to be announced later this month.  This list is currently being developed by a task force chaired by the European Investment Bank, EIB and the European Commission with the member states feeding into this.  As I understand it, it is primarily officials from the Department of Finance who are feeding in the Irish element of this.  I must stress, however, that being on the list is not a guarantee of funding and not being on the list does not mean a project is ineligible either.  However, we hope the list will provide relevant and transparent information about projects that may be of interest to investors.<br\/>On the question of how projects are selected, funds will be channelled to viable projects with real added value for the European social market economy.  Such projects are in areas like digital technology, energy, education and so forth and have the potential to boost employment.  There are three key criteria used in the assessment of projects.  The first is the potential for EU-wide added value and whether the projects support EU global objectives.  The second is economic viability and value which means projects with high socio-economic returns will be prioritised.  The third criteria is whether the projects are shovel ready, that is, ready to start within the next three years at the latest.  There must be a reasonable expectation of capital expenditure in the 2015 to 2017 period.  Projects must have the ability to leverage funds and draw in private investment.  The money provided by us is only the initial funding.  The projects must be able to stand on their own two feet, so to speak, and be able to attract private sector investment to achieve the multiplier effect to which I referred.<br\/>The fund will have a dedicated committee consisting of experts who will validate every project from a commercial and societal perspective.  The identification of specific projects will be carried out by those close to the situation on the ground, for example, by regional and local authorities and those operating in a particular market.  The fund should be operational by the middle of 2015.  The fund does not foresee any division or pre-allocation by member state or sector.  There is no <i>a priori <\/i>earmarking as would be the case with, for example, Structural Funds.  Projects will be chosen according to their viability and the process is not political but technical in nature.<br\/>The final strand of the investment plan is a roadmap to make Europe more attractive to investors by removing bottlenecks and establishing a more stable business-friendly and predictable regulatory environment.  The establishment of a genuine single market in energy, the digital sphere, capital, public procurement and services is part of this.  The new emphasis on promoting investment is a key element of the broader economic strategy of the European Commission which is based on the three inter-related elements of the investment plan, structural reform and fiscal responsibility.  Mr. O'Riordan will focus on the second and third elements when he addresses the semester and annual growth survey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014120400003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417702500,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Nolan.  We will now deal with questions on the investment plan, following which Mr. O'Riordan will make his address.  My first question is on the document itself, which refers to the fact that member states can help to augment the amount of money available by putting some of their own money in.  The European Commission says that in the context of the assessment of public finances under the Stability and Growth Pact, it will take a favourable position towards capital contributions from member states to the fund.  My reading of that is that such contributions would fall outside the 3% deficit criteria, so if Ireland decided to spend additional money on this fund, that would not be taken into account in our deficit calculations.  Am I correct in my understanding?  Has that provision done the tour of European capitals?  Are all of our colleague member states on board with that?  Having attended the COSAC conference at the weekend, it strikes me that there would not be unanimity across Europe on how we treat expenditure and whether contributions to this investment fund should adhere to Stability and Growth Pact rules.<\/p><p>  My second question relates to the multiplier referred to by Ms Nolan.  My understanding is that we are taking around &euro;16 billion that has not been spent from the Europe 2020 funds and existing European budgets and adding &euro;5 billion to that from the EIB to get a total of roughly &euro;20 billion.  We are going to look for a further &euro;40 billion through securitisation or through senior debt and then use that &euro;60 billion to leverage a further &euro;240 billion for individual projects.  As Ms Nolan said, this is essentially a multiplier of 1:15.  She maintained that we are likely to get that effect with the fund, but I would worry about that because the types of projects being earmarked for support are riskier than those normally supported by the EIB.  We met representatives of the EIB last year.  While it is an extremely good organisation, it is very cautious in terms of its investments.  While I would not doubt that the EIB could get the 1:15 multiplier, I wonder if we will actually see that.  While I welcome this commitment, I believe the amount being put up initially is not huge and is existing money, in effect.  I am not convinced we will see the quantum of investment envisaged as a result of that initial amount.<\/p><p>  When it comes to setting out the list of projects, the document before us says that geography will not be taken into account.  How can Ireland ensure that it gets a fair share of the cake, bearing in mind that infrastructure in some parts of Europe, particularly in the newer member states in the east, is a lot worse than ours?  My concern is to ensure that we get some of the infrastructure investment in particular.<\/p><p>  On page 14 of the document it is argued that the Commission has made \"better regulation\" one of the main priorities of this mandate.  We all want better regulation but I ask Ms Nolan to give me some concrete examples of what this will entail and the type of changes we can expect to see.<\/p><p>  I invite members to pose questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014120400005#D00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1417702500,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Nolan to this meeting and thank her for her presentation.  The Chairman has raised a few seminal issues.  On the multiplier effect, we must bear in mind that it is not a question of more than &euro;300 billion being available, which sounds like a huge pot of money, albeit to be spread across the European Union.  I have some concerns about the mathematics behind that.<\/p><p>  Ms Nolan referred to a dedicated committee and I ask her to explain how the projects will be assessed.  Will there be quotas for different countries or will they be chosen irrespective of the country of origin?  The Chairman referred to regional concerns.  Under previous funding for transport, for example, there was a cross-border condition attached to funding.  Obviously, on the mainland of Europe, road and rail networks would often traverse several different countries but that is not the case here, apart from our attachment to one part of the United Kingdom in Northern Ireland.  Will that impact on the level of funding that will be available to us?<\/p><p>  Ms Nolan also mentioned that the investment fund would be open to projects not funded by the EIB.

My apologies for my colleague who is interrupting me, Chairman.<\/p><p>  I thank our guests and Ms Nolan for her introductory statement.  I agree that the selection of critical infrastructure is a key factor in the ongoing investment programme for Europe, as it will impact on the alleviation of youth and general unemployment and will lead to the future development and growth in the EU.  I emphasise the word \"growth\".  The method of identifying projects will be of significant importance.  Identification of the infrastructural deficits and other issues that are likely to impede industrial and economic growth is the key.  We have had a recession for some considerable time right across Europe.  This country, ironically, is doing better than most of our colleagues and is certainly doing better than most of our colleagues in the eurozone.  Is it recognised that we must deal as soon as possible with the infrastructural deficits?  I see that 2017 has been set as the date by which time when most things are likely to happen.  One of the major problems in the EU is the lack of speed in identifying problems and putting in place the necessary remediation measures.<\/p><p>  I will revert to my signature theme.  I have seen no reference to the adoption of a single currency across the EU for some considerable time.  I presume that is based on the equivocation about the eurozone and the pressure it came under.  I am firmly of the belief that as long as we have a multiplicity of currencies in the EU, we will never have stability.  I believe that is a necessary target.  The possibility of achieving that is more remote than it was a couple of years ago but it is an issue that needs to be brought to the fore.  If the United States had five or six different currencies it would be the laughing stock internationally, but the EU - with a much bigger population and much greater opportunity of having a serious positive economic impact - could benefit if it were possible to put the single currency back on the agenda.<\/p><p>  My final point is that this is not a political process but a technical operation.  I worry about technical operations.  All my life I have been worried about them because they tend to proceed very slowly.  Anything that proceeds slowly in the present climate is not to the advantage to the cohesive future of the EU or to the people of the EU.  Issues such as youth unemployment, unemployment in general and the lack of economic growth must be tackled.  I would like to see more specific and energetic activation to ensure we meet the targets in these areas.<\/p><p>  We have spoken about the new Commission, Parliament and Council, yet despite the best efforts of everybody in individual member states and in the EU institutions there is a great deal of work to be done on the problems we have inherited. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014120400006#E00600","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1417703100,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

What we are discussing is at the proposal stage.  This is a proposal from the Commission regarding member state participation in the fund, which we would like to see happening because it will leverage more funding for investment.  The Commission has said in its proposal that it would like to see that funding be treated in a certain way and not as part of the stability and growth pack calculations.  The matter is under discussion.  I understand COSAC holds a different view.  Member states are making their views known at various meeting in Brussels preparing the ground for the summit meeting of the European Council which will take place later this month.<br\/>The proposal will be discussed by the Heads of State and Government on 18 and 19 December.  We have to see if that is accepted and it is why the European Commission is backing it.  We feel we can leverage more funding if we treat it as productive investment from the member states.<br\/>I did calculate the multiplier.  It has been said that a ratio of 1:15 is a conservative estimate of what can be leveraged from the initial capital.  As I have said, this has been developed not only by the Commission but with the European Investment Bank, which has a great deal more experience in how much one can leverage in terms of crowd-in in investment on the basis of the initial outlay.  The EIB has models that say the ratio is 1:18, but we have gone for the conservative estimate on the basis of historical experience.  The ratio may turn out to be much better than 1:15 but it may turn out to be worse.  Who knows?  We have to see what happens.  The data have been feed into the system and this is what has come out the other end.<br\/>On the issue of the share-out of the cake to the geographical regions, as I said there is no <i>a priori <\/i>earmarking for member states or for specific sectors.  It is done on the basis of the viability of the projects.  Every member state will be trying to go through its list of the projects in the pipeline to try to ensure that the project it submits will have a genuine chance of crowding in investment.  There will not be 100% funding of one individual unless we can attract extra private sector and public sector investment.<\/p> <p>That is the reality.  The projects will stand or fall on their merits in this regard and on whether they are meeting the criteria I explained in my opening remarks.  I would say it is in the interests of every member state to put forward its best and most viable projects.  I am sure Ireland is working on that right now.  Maybe it has already submitted some projects.  That is the way we expect things to pan out.<\/p><p> I was asked what is meant by \"better regulation\".  One of the innovations of the new Commission is that Commissioners will no longer simply be able to put something on the Commission agenda and have it adopted.

Mr. Timmermans was not inclined to pursue some kind of legislation on the issue at European level.  The European Parliament and key stakeholders were pressing for the legislation to be pursued.  In the end, it made it through the sieve.  Compared to the structure that is in place now, there will be much more vigilance about what is going into the Commission agenda and what the Commission will be adopting.  Each Commissioner will have to defend what he or she proposes to do on the Commission's work programme and why it is necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014120400007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1417703700,"counter":498,"content":"<p>When is it expected that this work programme will be published?

That is what better regulation means, at least from our perspective.  Regulations that have become obsolete, for various reasons, will also be reviewed to see if we need to get rid of them.  Proposals that are in the circuit but have not been adopted will be reviewed to ascertain whether they are unnecessary in light of the new thinking.  We already had the refit exercise.  This is building on that exercise.  That is how this is expected to work.<br\/>I was also asked how the projects will be assessed.  I do not have much more to add to my remarks on the criteria, on who is involved and on the committee that is being established by the Commission and the European Investment Bank with input from member states.<br\/>Many projects will be cross-border projects.  I refer not only to the Border here but also to the many borders across Europe.  Perhaps large infrastructural projects that cross various national frontiers will be jointly submitted by a number of member states.  This will be a factor.  From our perspective, it does not matter.  We welcome cross-border initiatives because that is where the added value of EU activity can come into play.<br\/>I assure Deputy Eric Byrne that there are many bottlenecks in many markets.  We do not really have a single digital market or a single energy market.  There are many problems with the way our markets work in Europe that cause bottlenecks, put off investment and make people cautious.  The unstable economic situation has been a major turn-off for investment.  These are the things we are setting out to tackle with this investment plan.<br\/>I will explain what I meant when I said this process is a technical operation.  Obviously, the overall goals are extremely political.  We are trying to select projects that will reduce unemployment, etc.  Clearly, there are major political issues here.  When I spoke about a technical operation, I was referring to the fact that projects will be selected on their technical merits, their viability and whether they have a good chance of attracting the necessary investment.  That is what I meant by &quot;technical&quot;.  As I said, it is not the case that an <i>a priori<\/i>block of money will go to each member state or each individual sector.  It is an open situation until the projects are selected.  I hope I have answered most of the questions.

It is a pleasure to be here.  I will make some introductory remarks about the annual growth survey.  As members will be aware, the survey launches the annual cycle of economic governance, sets out the European Union's economic priorities and gives member states policy guidance for the following year.  The role of the EU in this regard is to provide policy direction and country-specific recommendations and to ensure respect for commonly agreed rules.<\/p> <p>The objective is to ensure that the structural, fiscal and monetary policies are combined in an integrated, growth friendly way to effectively tackle pressing challenges - acting on both the demand and supply sides of our economies.  This requires action at all levels of government, from global to European, national, regional and local levels.<\/p><p> For 2015, the Commission recommends that countries pursue economic and social policy based on three main pillars, as alluded to by Ms Nolan, including a renewed boost and focus on investment, a fresh commitment to structural reforms and fiscal responsibility.  Simultaneous action is required in all three areas as it is critical to restore confidence and reduce the uncertainty that has been impeding investment and to maximise the strong mutually reinforcing effects of all three pillars working together.  This is a new emphasis in the strategy this year.  The Commission also proposes to streamline and reinforce the European semester and to improve ownership of the process and simplify the procedures, starting with the semester starting now.<\/p><p> With specific regard to structural reforms, deepening the Single Market is the overriding priority at EU level.  For this we need to break down regulatory and non-regulatory barriers in energy, transport, telecoms and the Single Market for goods and services to ensure that the EU regulatory framework supports jobs, growth and investment.  The Commission will also prioritise work to make EU laws lighter, simpler and less costly for the benefit of citizens and enterprises.  It will further strengthen its regulatory tools such as impact assessment.  This relates to the discussion we had earlier and is an important tool to ensure the rules adopted are fit for purpose and appropriate.  Employment and social indicators will be increasingly used to give a more rounded view of countries' economies.<\/p><p> At member state level, for 2015 the Commission recommends focusing attention on a number of key reforms.  The areas chosen are relevant for all member states, but will be fine tuned to meet the particular issues and concerns of each country.  The areas identified for reform are the following: making labour markets more dynamic and inclusive and tackling unemployment; making pensions and social protection more sustainable; developing more flexible product and services markets; improving business investment conditions; enhancing the quality of research and innovation; and improving public administration.<\/p><p>On the fiscal responsibility side, member states have made significant strides to cut their fiscal deficits.  Deficits have declined from almost 7% of GDP in 2009 to 3% in 2014.   The number of countries under the excessive deficit procedure has decreased from 24 in 2011 to 11 in 2014.  However, there is a need to continue with responsible and growth friendly fiscal policies.  Meanwhile, countries with more fiscal space should try to promote more domestic demand and stimulate investment.<\/p><p> The European Commission also assessed 16 euro area countries' budgets for 2015, focusing on their compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.  In that respect, the Commission concluded that Ireland is compliant with the provisions of the so-called corrective arm of the excessive deficit procedure and is expected to bring the general government deficit below the 3% of GDP reference value of the treaty in 2015.<\/p><p> In regard to the European semester, the aspects we have mentioned are designed to streamline and reinforce the European semester by giving it a sharper focus and a more political role.  A more focused European semester should strengthen the social market economy and increase the effectiveness of economic policy co-ordination through increased accountability and improved ownership by all actors, including national parliaments, social partners and others.<\/p><p> The new economic policy cycle will also simplify Commission outputs and reduce reporting requirements of member states, while making the process more open and multilateral.  The discussion on the European semester is also important in view of the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy, which will be presented in time for discussion at the spring 2015 European Council.  For the EU to succeed in meeting its jobs and growth challenges, there is a need for broad consensus on the right policy direction and strong stakeholder support for reform efforts.  This means that national parliaments, the social partners and civil society at large all need to be more involved in the implementation of policies decided at EU and national levels.<\/p><p> In this context, I have this committee's excellent report here.  There is much appreciation for its work in this respect and on developing this political contribution to the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy.  I attended the launch event and I believe that the reforms introduced in the European semester process already reflect some of the Committee's aspirations.  I trust that more aspects of its contribution will be addressed in the mid-term review proper.  The committee's call for moving away from any \"centre driven, top-down, non-inclusive approach\" is well noted and the improvements outlined in the annual growth survey under discussion today go very much in the direction of the inclusive, bottom-up approach that we all want to see.<\/p><p> We hope and trust that this process will succeed and work as well as it can to help Ireland to strengthen its recovery.  I look forward to contributing and working constructively with the committee to that effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014120400007#F01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick O'Riordan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417704300,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Riordan for his contribution and for his comments on our political contribution to the review of the Europe 2020 strategy.  Deputy Durkan attended the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC, in Rome on Monday.  Ireland had put forward a number of amendments in its contribution, relating to our political contribution and what we agreed here.  Some nine out of ten of our proposed amendments were accepted, including all relating to the Europe 2020 strategy.  These included the use of social indicators, as set out in the alert mechanism report and the development, where feasible, of indicators that would assess social issues, such as job quality, zero contract hours and poor quality work.  The contribution will be sent to the Commission and we are hopeful it will take account of it and bear in mind it is not just the views of this committee, but of the 28 committees of the European Union.<\/p><p>  In regard to the three pillar approach of  the annual growth survey, Mr. O'Riordan spoke about boosting investment and the need for member states with more fiscal space to encourage domestic demand, with a particular emphasis on investment.  Ireland now has an investment spend 40% lower than in 2007.  Countries like Germany have more fiscal space and the ability within their current budgets to spend more, but we read and hear they are unlikely to do so.  How can the Commission put pressure on these countries to spend more?  It is all very well to call for them to invest more, but unless strong pressure is put on them, I cannot see them coming to the table on this.  I do not believe \"calling\" for them to invest will make them do so.

The work done by the committee in the run-up to the COSAC meeting was reflected in the submissions from other countries also.  Everybody seemed to identify the same obstacles and the necessary remediation.  The questions we are asking are how are we to go about doing this and what should we prioritise.  If the right decisions are taken initially, we will see a quicker and more dramatic response.  For example, in European banking recently interest rates have been extraordinarily low.  This should provide a great opportunity to investors to invest in job creation projects, but they are slow to do so because of the risk factors already referred to.  To what extent have the risk factors been addressed in a meaningful way?  Is the proposal likely to activate people?<\/p><p>  Another issue that arises in Mr. O'Riordan's submission is the question of ownership.  The committee also addressed the issue of the ownership of the European project and of everything that is European.  <\/p> <p>It was interesting that at least one if not two countries at the COSAC meeting referred to the weakness of the eurozone.  There was a clear indication on their part that they did not see themselves as taking ownership of anything that was involved in the eurozone - in fact, in the European project, because it is not possible to talk about the eurozone in isolation from the entire euro project.  If we do, we become isolationists ourselves.  I do not want to go into the precise details of that, but I ask the witnesses the extent to which they think the euroscepticism that is rampant across the European Union at the present time is being addressed or is likely to be addressed in the context of what we are discussing now.  <\/p><p> Without a specific project targeting this particular area, we will always have criticism and it is likely to grow.  There was a reference earlier to the fact that currently there is criticism and dissident, and diffident, opinion throughout Europe for a variety of reasons, mainly political.  However, the political reasons should not impede the progress of the 500 million people in the European Union.  To what extent do the witnesses think all the European member states, euro and non-euro, will contribute to the objective of ensuring that structural fiscal and monetary policies are combined in an integrated and growth-friendly way?  If there is no cohesion, we cannot proceed in any direction.  <\/p><p> I have already referred to the issue of taking ownership.  That is hugely important.  Even in this country we regularly speak about \"them\" - the Europeans - and \"us\".  We are Europeans, as is every other person throughout the European Union.  The problem is that we do not seem to be able to get around the mental block of taking ownership of that project and saying \"we Europeans,\" as opposed to \"them and us\".<\/p><p> The next point to which I wish to refer concerns structural reforms, the deepening of the single market as the overriding priority and the identification of the barriers to this.  The identification of barriers is of huge importance.  If the barriers are not identified properly, there can be no resolution.  We can talk around it and we can talk by it, but we will not actually address the subject matter.  <\/p><p> The last point I will make concerns national parliaments - as the Chairman knows, we have discussed this at length - and the degree to which their influence will be reflected in the way the European project is progressed.  The immediate question concerns the extent to which those whose national parliaments are not pro-European are going to influence the European project.  Are they likely to become a barrier to the progression of the project we are now discussing?  Are they likely to become an obstacle and as a result impede the progress that we all deserve? <\/p><p> I congratulate the Chairman and the committee for clearly identifying the headline issues in the subject matter for discussion at the COSAC conference.

We recently had a debate during Private Members' time in the D&aacute;il during which it was noted that, while the economy has been improving, there was some concern regarding certain aspects of our society.  In some way, Mr. O'Riordan touched on this when speaking on the employment and social indicators.  The Government had a role in pursuing that agenda last year during its Presidency.  There was debate on the country-specific recommendations last time, and this is the first year in which we have had those recommendations since we came out of the bailout.  From where I am sitting, I do not think they have caused a lot of trouble.  There has been strong liaison with the Government in terms of the things they are working on anyway.  Many of them are part of our programme for government and are a requirement.  Some of them were laid down previously by the Troika - for instance, the legal services Bill.  Many of them are part of our processes in Government in improving low pay and that whole area.  Have other countries experienced problems?  There was reference to more national accountability.  Has there been a huge demand for this within Ireland?  I do not see it being debated in Parliament and I have not seen it raised as a specific issue or problem.  Many of the country-specific recommendations, if not all of them, would have, I imagine, cross-party agreement in Parliament in terms of what they are about, which is improving the lot of the people and such issues.<\/p><p>  Areas of reform were mentioned.  There are two in particular.  Reference was made to making pensions and social protection more sustainable.  What is called the pensions time bomb is a cross-Europe issue and I suppose it is something that needs to be tackled in this country.  I am sure other countries also have particular concerns about this.  The second area is improvement of business investment conditions.  With the co-operation of the German government and the German Minister for Finance, an &euro;800 million package was announced a couple of weeks ago for SME investment.  We have gone a long way towards ensuring that issue is sorted.  Access to finance is an issue that has been raised consistently with regard to SMEs.

We have passed all the exams as laid out for us and we are praised for being in conformity with the fiscal treaty.  Our deficit must be down to 3% of GDP next year, and we are going to achieve this.

As if things were not bad enough, this is the icing on the cake.  To echo what Deputy Durkan stated, one of the things that struck me most - I also attended the COSAC meeting in Rome - was a considerable unease that is growing across the European Union members and a diversity of opinion on where Europe is going and what types of intervention are necessary.<\/p> <p>It was very disconcerting to listen to the representations of the Greek and Italian members, particularly the Greek contribution, about the situation in their countries and the Italian view that its economy was not in a very difficult position.  There seemed to be almost a two-tier approach, with some countries being determined to stick to fiscal rectitude, while others were effectively stating Europe was stagnating, moving into decline, increasingly marginalised in the world and was not and would not be a major player.  There was a sense that there was a lack of solidarity within the European family, so to speak, between certain northern European members and the southern European members about their priorities for Europe.<\/p><p> It is very depressing that 120 million Europeans are experiencing poverty and that the number has increased since the Europe 2020 strategy began.  This may not be a fair comment, but the strategy relies too much on structural reforms such as deepening the Single Market &ndash; there has been a single market since 1992; breaking down regulation in certain areas; seeking greater efficiency; making labour markets more dynamic and ensurig sustainability.  It is all very worthy, but there is a lack of acceptance that many European countries, including this one, want a genuine growth package that will seriously stimulate the European economy in the way the Federal Reserve was able to stimulate the US economy and the Bank of England was able to stimulate the UK economy.

With the resources at its disposal, it has done the maximum in an incredibly short period to put together this programme in order to stimulate, promote and encourage more investment.  <\/p><p>  The Senator has mentioned the countries that have more fiscal space.  As Ireland gets its country-specific recommendations, CSRs, in a number of areas, it is in this excessive deficit procedure because our deficit needs to come down.

It is a partnership approach which has been reinforced in the streamlining being introduced.  With the involvement of more actors, it is important to have ownership.  It is not a case of recommendations that this should be done by an outside body but of getting everybody to agree in discussions.  There are bilateral meetings between the Commission and member states.  The one with Ireland is taking place this afternoon.  There is continuous engagement and a partnership between the Commission and member states to discuss the challenges at a country-specific level and see what needs to be done to address them.<\/p><p>  In response to Deputy Bernard J. Durkan&rsquo;s point about ownership, it is crucial and recognised in Brussels.  Every effort is being made to increase it.  I can only endorse and welcome what he has said.  We are Europeans and these European issues and challenges concern us all.  The CSRs for Ireland might involve a degree of homework or pointing to things that need to be addressed.  The benefit of the process for Ireland in all of these recommendations being issued to all of the other countries is perhaps just as significant as, if not more so, the recommendations issued to other countries.  Growth, investment, a reduction in employment, increased demand for our exports and so on in other European countries can have an enormous impact on Ireland&rsquo;s growth prospects.  Irish Ministers and officials discuss the economic challenges and issues in all countries, which is an important benefit of the process.  I compliment the committee on its contributions to the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC, and its efforts and engagement.  It is remarkable that the policies and ideas it has developed are coming into, and being reflected in, European policies.<\/p><p>  In terms of the need to activate investment, the approach taken here, in identifying the challenges in different countries, involves seeing where the problems and blockages are to encourage creating the mood and committees such as this one to discuss the investment programme across Europe.  It is bringing investment back onto the agenda which will I hope encourage people because there is a lot of money that is not being used productively and there is enormous scope to do this.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge what Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne said about the social and employment concerns that had rightly been flagged and prioritised during the Irish Presidency.  It is welcome that they are reflected here.  The CSRs are designed to address issues where there is room for progress and scope to do things.  There is no point proposing ridiculous things that have no chance of being achieved, or things that are already being done.  The challenge is to see where reform is needed and have collective consensus in prioritising several areas.  It is not possible to list all aspects of Government policy.<\/p> <p>It is a case of working in partnership with the governments to see what is the collective opinion of the Commission and then having it discussed with the other European partners as to where progress can be most useful and effective.  I know the Commission has recognised and appreciated the co-operation with the Irish Government and the Irish authorities throughout the entire process and that is continuing.<\/p><p> On the question about investment in small and medium business, as the member said this has been one of the key challenges and issues.  We know there are problems on both the supply and the demand sides and this has been discussed at length.  Ireland has taken great steps with the public programmes and with the involvement of KfW.  Funds are on the table and we hope now that as demand increases in the economy there will be more call for using these funds and that the issue becomes more one of demand - having enough SMEs demanding money - and that there is sufficient money available for them to expand and invest.<\/p><p> I take note of Deputy Byrne's points about the degree of compliance.  Ireland is one of five countries that were fully compliant as regards the budgetary review process.  A number of other countries are partially compliant so there is a different gradation of responsiveness, of degrees of compliance.  We know there are problems in some areas that remain to be addressed.  There is specific consideration analysis of the budgets for each particular member state.  The process is ongoing for some of them - that is up to March of next year.  Some countries will be reviewed at that time to see their degree of compliance.<\/p><p> Growth needs to be stimulated across Europe.  I do not think Ireland is in a bubble situation.  We know that the growth has been very strong this year.  The projections set out in the Irish budget have been considered to be compliant.  There is obviously a debate around the degree, the exact growth figure and so on, but the expectation is that growth continues on a sound, solid and sustainable basis for the next couple of years.  One can never tell what is around the corner. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014120400010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick O'Riordan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417706100,"counter":523,"content":"<p>My question was to find out if our growth was disproportionate to the growth in Europe.

If Ireland had not received EU and IMF assistance it would have been forced to close its schools and hospitals and to stop its social welfare system.  Nobody was prepared to loan to Ireland.  The EU loaned two thirds of the money and the IMF loaned one third.  I thought there was remarkable solidarity which ensured that the country could keep functioning normally and it could continue to protect the most vulnerable from being left to one side.  It kept the schools open and the public system working.  There was also solidarity shown by countries outside the eurozone.

It is linked to a disillusionment about politics in general.  I attended a conference last week at which Professor Brigid Laffan from the European Institute in Florence had a very interesting graph which showed that across Europe there is a significant decline in trust in both national governments and in the European Union.  In most cases, there is a greater decline in trust in the case of national governments than in the European Union, with the exception of possibly two or three countries, including Germany, where there is more confidence or trust in the national authorities than in the European Union.  The general trend was extremely depressing.<\/p><p>  One of the ways in which we can combat this trend is to make an effort to turn the economy around.  The situation could be improved if economic conditions improved and things were going better in the economy and if unemployment levels decreased.  The investment plan hopes to achieve these aims.  It would also help if national politicians returning from meetings in Brussels would stop Europeanising failure and nationalising success.  This is frequently the outcome at various European Council meetings and we see it all the time.  We are the European Union; it is not something extraneous to us.  The European Union is only the sum of its parts, the member states.  We all make up the European Union.  It would help if it could stop being treated as some extraterrestrial body without any particular ownership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014120400011#K00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1417706100,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I agree entirely with the points made by Ms Nolan.  However, to what extent are the European institutions totally focused on those issues?  What are the causes?  What is motivating those who are Eurosceptics in all parts of Europe?

To what extent have the European institutions identified the cause or causes of this cynicism and the scepticism across the rest of Europe?<\/p><p>  Ms Nolan correctly identified that it is convenient for national politicians to blame Europe for everything, to walk away and say it is a European problem.  The reality is that every single directive is referred back to member state governments, parliaments and institutions, for them to make the corrective measures if they wish to do so.  Unfortunately, the two events are not always related and connected in the way they should be.  It is a little like voting in the secrecy of the ballot box.  Sometimes people detach themselves from the possible consequences - I will not go further - and we could be coming to a stage in Europe where people are about to do that.  I hope the European institutions, individually and collectively, are focusing on this situation.<\/p> <p>There will be serious consequences because every single emphasis, that I have noticed, emanating from some member states in recent years seems to demonstrate their pulling away from Europe and becoming more nationalistic in their approach.

Other council members in attendance with me today are Mr. Sebastian Barnes, Professor Alan Barrett and Dr. Donal Donovan.

The council secretariat is represented by Ms Sarah Doyle, Mr. Eddie Casey, Mr. Andrew Hannon, Mr. John Howlin, and Dr. Thomas Conefrey, head of the secretariat and chief economist.<\/p> <p>The secretariat continues to have very useful interaction with the staff of the Oireachtas, which enhances the engagement we as a council have with this committee.  I would like to acknowledge the co-operation of the Oireachtas staff in this ongoing work.<br\/>Today I will cover our seventh assessment report, which was published last Tuesday, 25 November.  The report is written in line with the mandate of the council set out in the fiscal responsibility Acts of 2012 and 2013 and also with the memorandum of understanding between the council and the Department of Finance.  At our last appearance before the committee in June, I began by noting the progress being made in restoring the public finances and the economy to health.  In the intervening months, there have been further encouraging signs that the recovery in the Irish economy is solidifying and that the public finances are improving.  The general Government deficit is likely to fall below the 3% excessive deficit procedure ceiling in 2015, and the debt-to-GDP ratio is beginning to fall, albeit from a very high level.  Market confidence has improved greatly and the State's creditworthiness has been restored.  At the same time, economic recovery appears to be taking hold, with employment growing and the unemployment rate falling steadily.  Of course the recovery is not yet being felt evenly across the population, and the crisis has left several challenging legacy problems that require ongoing careful policy attention and action.<br\/>It was not always obvious that a recovery pattern of the sort now emerging would materialise.  Concerns existed that the implementation of such an enormous programme of fiscal consolidation as that followed since 2008 could trip the economy into a deflationary spiral and even become self-defeating in budgetary terms.  These concerns have not come to pass, as the deficit has fallen from a peak of 11.5% of GDP in 2009 and, as noted, signs of a broad-based recovery are evident.  While the consolidation measures had a negative impact on domestic demand, they have succeeded in moving the State's finances towards sustainability and in creating the conditions for a return to growth in employment and incomes.<br\/>Thanks to the improvements in macro and fiscal aggregates, it was against a comparatively more favourable backdrop that budget 2015 was framed.  Despite the announcement of an expansionary package of measures amounting to just over &euro;1 billion, the deficit as a percentage of GDP is expected to fall to 2.7% in 2015, in line with the requirements for exiting the excessive deficit procedure.  Achieving this objective has been the key focus of fiscal policy in recent years and is an important milestone on the path towards more sustainable public finances.  However, as pointed out in the council's pre-budget 2015 statement, compliance with the official targets does not mean that the overriding task of repairing the public finances has been accomplished.<br\/>It is the council's assessment that budget 2015 reflects a missed opportunity to move the public finances more decisively into a zone of safety by following through on previous plans. The State's expenditure is expected to exceed its income by around &euro;7 billion in 2014, a gap which is being closed through additional borrowing.  In this context, the decision in budget 2015 to opt for an expansionary package of tax cuts and expenditure increases necessarily results in higher borrowing, larger national debt interest costs and higher debt levels than could have been achieved if previous plans had been adopted.  The stance in budget 2015 means that the deficit is projected to be more than one percentage point higher in 2015 than could have been achieved if previous plans had been implemented.  An opportunity to create a larger buffer to guard against adverse near- and medium-term growth shocks has thus been missed.  All else being equal, the larger deficits will result in the debt level being roughly &euro;10 billion higher in 2018 than if previous plans had been adopted.<br\/>The council is keenly aware of the limited tolerance for further tax increases and expenditure cuts following eight consecutive contractionary budgets, compounded by the impact of a deep and prolonged recession.  The improved creditworthiness of the State and stabilisation of the debt-to-GDP ratio have reduced the urgency of further adjustment efforts.  Nonetheless, it remains the judgment of the council that implementing the plan outlined in the last stability programme update, SPU, and then following the less demanding requirements of the budgetary rule and preventive arm of the stability and growth pact, SGP, would have been, on balance, the most appropriate fiscal stance.<br\/>The expansionary measures in budget 2015 are estimated by the Department of Finance to increase GDP growth in 2015 by 0.3 percentage points.  The benefits of this limited short-run stimulus, in our view, do not outweigh the longer-term gains and enhanced certainty that would have accrued from implementing one last adjustment effort.<br\/>I would like to turn now to a major theme of the fiscal assessment report concerning the importance of Ireland's new budgetary framework and the outlook for the public finances beyond 2015.  A positive legacy of the crisis is Ireland's strengthened budgetary framework, incorporating both domestic and European elements.  With the State having exited the EU-IMF programme, a new phase of fiscal policy surveillance guided by the new budgetary framework will begin.  Adhering to the new fiscal framework should help to smooth future boom-bust cycles, guide Government debt to safer levels, and underpin borrowing capacity during the period when debt will remain unavoidably high by adding credibility to Government plans.  If implemented effectively, the budgetary framework can also act as a bulwark against the types of political pressure that have contributed to inappropriate fiscal policy in the past.  At previous appearances before the committee, I described the new framework and elaborated on some of its potential benefits.  We are now at the point of implementation and so new challenges have emerged.<br\/>A major weakness of Ireland's approach to fiscal policy prior to the crisis was that the annual budgetary process paid insufficient attention to multi-annual fiscal planning.  Expenditure plans focused almost exclusively on the following year's spending plans, with medium-term expenditure profiles seen as indicative and subject to change in later years.  With spending determined on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>year-to-year basis, this inevitably contributed to pro-cyclicality in fiscal policy.<br\/>The need to set out credible medium-term plans for the public finances, including multi-annual ceilings for expenditure for each department for the next three years, is a key component of Ireland's budgetary framework.  Budget 2015 did not include such a well-specified plan for the public finances.  Published tax revenue projections assume no change in policy in the medium term, despite budget commitments to cut taxes in the coming years.  Moreover, the budget spending profiles assume that spending will remain unchanged after 2015, despite higher figures for expenditure being set out in the comprehensive review of expenditure for 2015 to 2017.  Taken together, the lack of detail underpinning the Government's medium-term projections for both expenditure and revenue means, in turn, that considerable uncertainty surrounds the overall projected path for the general Government deficit.<br\/>Spending plans have been revised upwards each year since 2012, with budget 2015 raising the expenditure ceilings for 2015 to 2017.  The almost continuous raising of the Government's expenditure ceilings undermines the purpose of multi-annual expenditure planning, which is designed to protect against the type of pro-cyclical trend in Government spending observed in the run up to the crisis.  The lack of a well-anchored medium-term plan raises the risk that incoming cyclical revenues will be spent rather than saved, leading to unsustainable spending levels.<br\/>The absence of a well-specified medium-term plan for the public finances in budget 2015 indicates that, although public awareness of and political support for the budgetary framework have increased, problems with implementation remain.  For the framework to be implemented effectively, domestic ownership is essential.  While the new budgetary framework is not without flaws, the complementary national and European elements provide a valuable structure to guide Irish fiscal policy.  Rather than being viewed as something imposed on Ireland, it should be seen as a framework that is in the national interest, in that it helps to create the conditions that underpin sustainable growth in Irish incomes and employment and also ensures the future fiscal capacity of the State.<br\/>Broad political support and advocacy of Ireland's budgetary framework will be vital if it is to act as an effective guide to sound management of the public finances.  This is especially important now that the degree of direct external surveillance has eased with the ending of the programme.  The Oireachtas, as well as the council, can play a vital role in ensuring the effective implementation, monitoring and enforcement of the new budgetary framework.<br\/>Finally, on several occasions over recent months the question has been raised as to whether the council feels its advice is being ignored.  In this context, it is important to note that our reports are not directed solely at the Government.  Our analysis is also aimed at raising public awareness and stimulating debate around important public finance issues and fiscal policy options.  As representatives of the public, the Oireachtas can play a vital role in helping to promote informed public debate around the various issues raised in the council's analysis.<br\/>To conclude, I thank the committee for providing us with the opportunity to attend today, and we look forward to taking questions and hearing the views of members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014120400002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417702200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>In the context of the question-and-answer session, I propose that we adhere to the same rules we have used at recent meetings.

One point that sometimes becomes lost in the debate is the fact that we have supported the broad thrust of the policy that is currently being pursued and also that which was pursued by the previous Government immediately post-crisis.  It is important to say that.  When we get into matters of detail, it is clear that there have been differences.  We are not naive enough to think that everything we recommend will be followed.  On the one hand, we look at matters purely from the point of view of economics while, on the other, we realise that there is a need to find a balance in respect of different factors, both political and economic, when decisions are made.  In addition, the Government may reach judgments which are different from ours on the economics involved.  There have been important cases in which we felt we had influenced the Government's approach.  In the D&aacute;il debate following the pre-budget statement - at which the Deputy was in attendance - the Minister explicitly said that the target for the deficit in 2015 was set at 2.7% - partly in response to our report - in order to have some margin of safety around the requirement to get the deficit below 3%.  That is a very concrete instance in which our advice was at least partially taken on board.  Of course, we recommended that the Government should go further and set a bigger target.  However, it does seem that our advice had an impact on the decisions taken by the Government.<\/p><p>  The point about our role in advising the Government and providing our analyses to the Oireachtas and the public is an important one.

We have concluded in each of our reports that this is the case.  The Deputy referred to the endorsement function, which only relates to the macroeconomic forecasts which underlie the budget and the stability programme.  Recognising the uncertainty that exists around any set of forecasts, we have been in a position to endorse those to which I refer.  It is important that we are in a position whereby we can give our best opinion of, for example, what should be the fiscal stance.  We should also be in a position to be able to increase the level of criticism if the deviation from what we think should be the appropriate fiscal stance becomes larger.  This might be referred to as hedging our bets, but it is important that we do not have just one volume in terms of our criticism.

In that context, I will focus on the issue of contract manufacturing.  The committee discussed this matter previously with representatives from the Department of Finance and the council drew attention to it in its report in the context of the accuracy of GDP figures.  What is the council's best guess regarding the distortion of the figures as a result of contract manufacturing?  The officials from the Department of Finance indicated that the position in this regard is impossible to model at this point.  Is there a way to try to strip out contract manufacturing from the relevant figures in order to discover what is the real level of GDP?  Those figures have been distorted as a result of the inclusion of contract manufacturing.  We might be meeting targets but this could be at a level that does not really exist.  I will return later to the question of the revision of GDP, a development that did not really benefit Ireland but that did have a benefit statistically.  Is contract manufacturing here to stay and, if so, should we be trying to strip the figures relating to it out of the overall figures for GDP?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014120400004#C00600","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417702200,"counter":546,"content":"<p>The real issue here relates to the uncertainty that it creates around growth forecasts.

There has been no real growth; what we have is statistical growth.  The key issue on which I want to focus is the expenditure benchmark.  This is a huge issue which the council has outlined in its report and on I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance.  The public is not aware of the restraints in increasing expenditure in the State.  In that parliamentary question I asked what were the limits to which we could increase expenditure as a result of the six pack rule and the Department advised that between 2015 and 2016 we could increase expenditure by &euro;400 million.  Given the fact that public sector increments will be due to be paid in that period and taking account of other factors such as inflation, how will the State be able to remain within that benchmark in 2016?

This shows that there is very little additional room for additional expenditure increases or tax cuts because when we have discretionary changes in taxes, that is counted also.  The way it works is that we can increase expenditure beyond the benchmark if we have discretionary revenue raising measures, but when we have discretionary measures that reduce revenue, that is also factored into the calculation of the expenditure benchmark.  The situation in respect of the figures for 2016 is very tight and there is no room either for additional expenditure increases beyond those already projected for that year or revenue reducing measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014120400005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1417702800,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McHale and his colleagues for their presentation.

If one has extraordinary costs, as we have had during the crisis, again, there is a good reason to run a deficit, but then there are reasons to run smaller deficits as well.  For instance, we face major demographic pressures from an ageing population and good fiscal policy would indicate that if one did not have other constraints, one should probably be running surpluses to prepare for that.  We also still have very large debts and in a very fragile global economy, that leaves us vulnerable.

There are similarities.

I put it to the members that under the legislation setting up IFAC, its primary function is to give the assessment to the Minister.  Unlike a body such as the Ombudsman for Children, who has wide-ranging functions in legislation to contribute to the public debate or comment on various issues that affect children, IFAC does not have a similar range of functions.  The legislation is very short and the primary function of IFAC is to the Minister.  The debate that happens in the public domain is natural but the Government seems to dismiss the views of IFAC every year, which is dangerous as the council was set up for a very good reason.  We did not listen to the few prophets who spoke out during the boom and that caused us problems.

It was always intended, on the basis of the model under which we were set up, that the channels of influence had to be in part through the media, through public debate and public representatives and that the very issues we were talking about would be highlighted more and more so that when the Minister decided to do X, Y or Z, there was a much broader and more robust context in which he was doing it.

We all understand, I hope, the thrust of what they have been saying in the advice they have been giving.  I did not understand until now that Fianna F&aacute;il would take &euro;2 billion out of the budget as recommended but I did understand the rest.  The witnesses can give me the answer that it is none of my business, that they have a particular remit and engaging with the politics is not part of it but in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, if the Government had proceeded to implement the advice to the letter of the law and against the fact that the indicators, especially with regard to the deficit, are ahead of target, and in the current febrile mood where there is such a cranky environment after eight contractionary budgets, as they say in their statement, and six long years of recession and so on and people feeling they cannot take any more, does the Government not have to make decisions or are we in a circumstance where, notwithstanding the Government's huge majority, it goes out of business, the Fiscal Advisory Council is still in business counselling prudence and so on but there is chaos politically?  We could easily find ourselves in that circumstance if the Minister for Finance had proceeded to implement the letter of the witnesses' advice.  I understand the reason that advice is proffered but no Government could take the recommendations and say even though the skies fall we will implement them.  We really have tested people's forbearance as far as it can be done, especially when the backdrop is the economic indicators being largely positive.  There is a huge conflict for the average citizen when they hear Ministers and financial and economic commentators saying that all the macro-indicators are generally positive when the combination of wages decline and tax increases means that they have taken a severe hit over six years.

We are driven by our view of the appropriate policy but as Professor Barrett said, even though we are non-partisan, part of the job of independent fiscal institutions is to raise certain political or reputational costs of inappropriate policies.  That becomes even more important when all the political pressures are pushing in a particular direction.  Those political pressures, not just in Ireland but in other countries as well, can lead to mistakes in fiscal policy.  There is a large amount of literature on deficit buyers and pro-cyclicality where those pressures probably becomes strongest in good times.  That can lead to pro-cyclical policies that are followed later by being forced into extreme contractions so they are over-expasionary in the good times and forcibly overly contractionary in the bad times.

Some voice telling us that we have to balance the books on the odd occasion is valuable because the forces that led us over a cliff in 2008 have not gone away.  As a Member of the Parliament in the three years since 2011, I believe we have not reformed enough of the machinery.<\/p><p>  There are 100 sections in the Finance Bill but there is not an ounce of economic analysis in terms of who benefits, the effect it will have, the income distribution consequences and so on.  As I understand the term fiscal, it should refer to both the way we implement the tax system in this document rather than just the macro aggregates with which the witnesses deal.  There are 100 measures, some of which seem strange.  One of them proposes to abolish a &euro;0.5 million income limit.  Another is that capital allowances previously disallowed can now be used and so on.  In economic terms there is an immense amount of analysed activity taking place and I am sure much of it is counter-productive.  There is a ceiling of &euro;0.5 million in the special assignee relief programme.  I do not know whether any cost-benefit analysis was done of that, who lobbied hardest and so on.<\/p><p>  The Wright report shows the Department of Finance to be seriously deficient in economic expertise, with 93% of staff not qualified in economics at master's level.  In Ottawa, from where Mr. Wright came, 60% of similar staff were qualified.  The economic analysis Professor McHale and his colleagues bring is very important.  However, I do not know whether those deficiencies in the Department of Finance have been rectified yet.<\/p><p>  People have referred to the macro-economic aggregates but a deeper analysis needs to be done.  The more macro-economic good news that is published, the more people will be marching outside these Houses because they have not seen the effects of that.

A tax-free allowance used to mean just that, a tax-free allowance and it is a strange kind of tax.  I acknowledge we needed the money at the time we did it.  I hope the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council will extend its role to consider all the State's economic policies because its input is badly needed.  I made the point in the Seanad today that the debate on the Finance Bill was like one from 40 years ago, in that none of the developments in economics since then appear to have influenced the budgetary process at all.  This is an important subject and we lost out seriously between 2008 and 2011 by not having the expertise at this committee which today's witnesses possess.  More interventions and statements made by them will only improve the quality of decision-making, which I would welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014120400007#F00800","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417704600,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Barrett for his remarks and for his encouragement, which has been greatly valued by us since our establishment.  Basically, we must deal with the mandate we have been given, which has four well-defined elements to it, namely, the endorsement function, assessing budgetary forecasts, assessing compliance with fiscal rules and assessing the fiscal stance.  The type of elements about which the Senator is talking often are referred to as focusing more on costings and broader micro-policy evaluation.  There are independent fiscal institutions that do that kind of work and if one looks across fiscal institutions across the world, in the Netherlands, for instance, the Central Planning Bureau has a long tradition of doing such costing work.  The Office for Budget Responsibility in the United Kingdom also conducts costing work of that type and one sees huge variations in this regard.  One point I would make however is that independent institutions that have such a mandate tend to be a lot bigger than we are.  As the Senator is aware, that type of cost-benefit analysis and costing work is a highly resource-intensive activity.  As for comparing us with fiscal institutions in other countries, I have actually just returned from a conference in Spain, which has set up a new council. It currently has 45 staff members and the people there were complaining about the size because they want to get to a staff complement of 70.  When I told them the size of our organisation, they really could not believe it.  While part of the reason for that is they have a mandate that requires them to do things our mandate does not require us to do, I agree with the Senator that this type of work needs to be done.  At the executive level, the new Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service is doing more of that sort of cost-benefit analysis.  However, I will repeat something I have stated in public previously, which is that an Oireachtas budget office that would do this type of work would be a valuable addition to the overall institutional framework in Ireland.  While this could be done by a much-expanded fiscal council, I believe we are working well with the mandate we have at present in our current size.  I believe we do it very efficiently, in part because we have such excellent people working for us.  I will take this opportunity to thank the secretariat, who do the heavy lifting.  The reason we can do this with such a small staff is because of the quality of the people we have.  However, the Senator's broader points that there must be much greater input into the policy process at that micro-economic level, as well as the potential of an Oireachtas budget office to do that, certainly are worth considering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014120400008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1417704600,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as an cur i l&aacute;thair sin.  While I support fiscal responsibility wholeheartedly, the key question concerns the manner in how it is achieved.  Social justice and fiscal responsibility are not mutually exclusive in any way and at a time when people are dying on the streets, it is important that those elements are focused upon.  One key point on which Deputy Pearse Doherty has spoken is the issue of the expenditure benchmark.  It appears to me that in reality, it is an expenditure cap or an expenditure break.  Given the pressures on public services and public sector pay in the next year and given that the Taoiseach already has indicated policywise that the top rate of tax will be brought down by one percentage point, from what I can discern this potentially would wipe out the 0.6% increase.  It is likely that the aforementioned promise by the Taoiseach is not actually achievable within that expenditure break as it is currently, unless there is further reduction in other parts of the expenditure sheet.  My first question is to confirm whether that is the case.  Second, is this a real European rule or is it one of those European rules that countries regularly break and get away with?  If it is a real European rule, what are the outcomes or ramifications for this country if it is breached?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014120400008#G00300","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417704600,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I will respond to the first part of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's remarks.  Yes, there is an important issue here that we highlighted in the June fiscal assessment report and we came back again and highlighted it in our recent report.  It is not for us to say what may have to give on either expenditure or revenue specifically.  Those are political and social decisions the Legislature and the Government must decide.  However, what we did stress both times and which we continue to stress is that it is important that the Government initiates a debate on some of these difficult choices by being more explicit about the fact that, as the Deputy correctly stated, one cannot have everything.  There are pay pressures, ageing pressures and potential taxation reduction pressures and one cannot have all of these.<\/p><p>  Within the context of a credible medium-term budget budgetary framework, it is appropriate for a government to set out some broad options, not necessarily decisions, that indicate trade-offs on these different aspects.  This is why we were somewhat disappointed that the recent budget essentially just contained a set of technical numbers, chosen perhaps somewhat arbitrarily, and did not address the meat of the issue, which are these policy choices.  We would not expect any government to provide extreme detail about its precise policy plans for the year or two ahead; that is not common.  However, I refer to the broad thrust of policies such as, for example, whether the wage bill is likely to go up or down as a percentage of GDP, whether benefits are likely to rise or fall and similarly with tax rates, direct taxation and other arrangements.  In other words, what is the thrust of the envisaged policy directions of the Government?

However, let me try to give the Deputy an answer that is as helpful as possible.  I believe the point about the expenditure benchmarks and ceilings is that, fundamentally, they ought to be a good idea or there is a strong case for them.  In a way, they are an implication of what one needs to get to one's targets for the budget balance.  In a sense, they are not adding anything to the other rules that are supposed to support getting to them.  However, because one pre-commits to it, there is a case that it avoids the risk that as extra tax revenue comes in, one simply spends it without thinking about whether it is structural or cyclical.  Obviously, we are painfully aware of how that can go wrong.<\/p> <p>It is important in terms of public sector efficiency.  If there is a three-year plan, one really just thinks about what one is doing for the next three years and tries to deliver it.  If every year one is basically focusing on having a fight in the budgetary process to get a bit more cash, one may not think about long-term planning in the same way.  Basically, that is the reason for having these kinds of rules.  There is an EU dimension, because of the EU expenditure benchmark, and also domestic expenditure ceilings, which happen to coincide.  We should not forget the domestic element and it would be helpful if the Government put more emphasis on the domestic part in addition to the EU part.<\/p><p> With regard to the EU part itself, members will be aware that the EU rules are very complex.  Many of the details still have to be fully clarified as the new EU regime comes in.  The EU expenditure benchmark definitely is a real one and countries are expected to meet it.  In certain circumstances, one could eventually be sanctioned in some ways.  The sanctions are not the same as those under the excessive deficit procedure, which is part of what is called the corrective arm.  However, even the preventive arm implies some sanctions.  Under this regime - I believe I am right - no country has yet been sanctioned under the preventive arm.  Enforcement before the post-crisis reforms never really occurred under the preventive arm so we are in somewhat unknown territory.  However, there is provision for that ultimately.  However, the real point is that there should be a strong interest in managing expenditure on a multi-year basis, which the rules are supposed to underpin this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014120400008#G01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417705200,"counter":608,"content":"<p>The witnesses mentioned that because of growth, stimulus would be less useful.

In other words, I refer to a combination of selling the stakes to pay down the debt and having a gross shock next year.  It is striking that, with the more conservative estimate of &euro;13.4 billion, a gross shock next year of just 1.2 percentage points, followed by a return to the growth that is currently projected, would result in the same debt-to-GDP ratio in 2018, which is 95% of GDP.  The point of that sort of calculation is that it does not make a huge difference to the time path of the debt-to-GDP ratio and could be offset by a relatively small shock.  Even if one used a more optimistic estimate of the value of the bank stakes, which is approximately &euro;21 billion, one would conclude that a gross shock of 1.9 percentage points would leave one with the same debt-to-GDP ratio in 2018 as the one currently projected.  In other words, it would fully offset the advantage of selling the stakes.  Selling the stakes to pay down debt does help the debt-to-GDP ratio but, at the same time, the effect is somewhat limited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014120400009#H00700","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1417705200,"counter":614,"content":"<p>Do the witnesses mind if I proceed to Deputy Mulherin?

The Deputy has mentioned that EUROSTAT's design essentially must stay on the general Government accounts, but the Government seems to have concluded that EUROSTAT will allow Irish Water to be off the general Government accounts, but there is a real risk in that regard.  As the Deputy knows, there were two tests that needed to be passed.  The share of revenue coming from non-Government sources as a fraction of the total output of Irish Water must be greater than 50%.  We have been examining how that output will be measured.  The Government is using a Revenue measure of output.<\/p><p>  Another possibility is that the denominator in the calculation will be operating costs.  It then becomes much closer whether the 50% test will be passed.  There is uncertainty about how EUROSTAT will rule on this issue, but we will not know until next April or perhaps even for a number of years.  It may take it a number of years to see, for instance, how the revenues being billed actually match the revenues coming in.  In its calculations it is billed revenue that is being used; therefore, the assumption is that the revenue will be raised.  Initially, EUROSTAT may accept this, but it may then look at the pattern in terms of the discrepancy between billed revenues and actual revenues.  There is uncertainty that is a source of risk and could potentially have a big impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014120400010#J01100","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1417705800,"counter":628,"content":"<p>None of us will know probably until March next year.

The first was on bank recapitalisation and the possibility that had surfaced at the EU summit attended by the Taoiseach two years ago.  The idea could have been that the ESM would take over part of the capital the Government had put into the Irish banks and would do so without requiring a Government guarantee, which, other things being equal, would have meant a reduction in the Government's debt by the same amount.  That proposal has not gained much political traction in European circles since the summit.  To our knowledge, there has not been any public intimation at political level in Europe of progress since our last report.  That is why we did not mention it, as there was nothing to mention.  It remains a political decision for which there does not appear to be a great deal of support.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's second question was on the status of the Anglo promissory note.  In early 2013 it was replaced by long-term Government bonds.  There are two aspects to this.  First, the bonds were of a considerably longer duration than the original promissory note.  While this did not affect the total size of the debt, it improved its profile considerably - at least for this portion of the debt - as the repayment and liquidation period of the bonds was much longer.  The second aspect was they had a shorter-term financial nature because under the agreement with the ECB, they had to be repaid according to a minimum schedule starting next year.  Without getting into too technical a level of detail, there are two effects as this happens.  One is that there is some interest cost to the Government because as it sells these bonds on the open market, the interest will no longer come back to be included in the budget.  On the other hand, as it sells the bonds, it may well be and probably is the case that there will be capital gains, given that interest rates are very low.  Both of these things could offset each other and there might be a gain in the budget as these transactions take place.  Their timing is a matter for the Central Bank, of course, and it may well pursue a timing plan which has significant effects on the budget.<\/p><p>  I should note in respect of the beneficial effects of these operations, that while they are good for the budget, they do not count, by and large, in the measurement of the budget deficit for the purposes of compliance with the excessive deficit procedure.  Members may recall in the debate on the fiscal council's views the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, made the point that actually the deficit for next year was really 2.5%, not 2.7%.  The 0.2% difference relates to the net beneficial effect of the Central Bank's operations which cannot formally, according to EUROSTAT rules, be counted.  Of course, economically it can be counted, but from the point of view of measurement, it is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014120400011#K00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1417706400,"counter":638,"content":"<p>Has the council done much work on the comprehensive review of expenditure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014120400011#K00900","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417706400,"counter":639,"content":"<p>We have certainly looked very carefully at all of the documents produced.  We believed it fell somewhat short in terms of good bottom-up expenditure planning.  One of the things about which we talk in the report is that expenditure planning tends to be done more on a top-down basis as determined by the fiscal rules and then ceilings are given to particular Departments without fully taking into account the pressures on them.  One then sees a pattern of ceilings being raised year after year as the pressures become apparent.  Ideally, one should have more bottom-up expenditure planning underpinned by a comprehensive review of expenditure to identify pressures, where efficiencies can be made, with the best prioritisation of expenditure.  Following this process, one would then set realistic expenditure ceilings taking into account these pressures and opportunities to achieve efficiencies.  Ideally, Departments would then be held to these ceilings.  More use could be made of the comprehensive review of expenditure procedure to engage in bottom-up planning.  One would then move from a system of what are sometimes termed \"soft budget constraints\" where one tells Departments, \"This is your budget and you had better stick to it,\" but then changes the ceiling when pressures emerge.  We have seen this particularly in the Department of Health.  What one wants to move to is a hard budget constraints system under which the initial ceilings reflect the realities and the pressures on a Department.<\/p> <p>When one has hard budget constraints, it is better from the point of view of planning at the Department&rsquo;s level because it will have a good idea of its budget.

Someone has taken a decision somewhere and it is an important one.<\/p><p>  Reading through the budget, I got a feeling of a lack of ownership about some of the fiscal rules.  There was much discussion about the EU fiscal rules which come from Brussels.  There was little discussion about the domestic budgetary rule or the domestic expenditure ceiling framework.

It is also important to state these are good rules which will be taken seriously.  Instead, they were really downplayed in the budget documentation.

Other studies examine the balance between outpatients, GP services and hospitalisation, whether hospitalisation is extremely expensive, and the average length of stay is long.  Top-level budgets for the health service just did not work.  They just ignored them because the alternative was to throw patients out.  If we are carrying out analysis, one might say that we can keep the healthiness but reduce the budget by not keeping people in.  Certain treatments here take 11.6 days when they would take 3.7 days internationally.  It is down to the way VHI pays hospitals.

I would like to introduce my colleagues, Ms Angela Fitzgerald and Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll from the HSE.  In my statement I want to provide the committee with what I hope will be helpful background information on the current arrangements for treating patients with deep brain stimulation and the key considerations in terms of shaping future provision.<\/p><p>  Deep brain stimulation, DBS, is a neurosurgical intervention for the management of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, dystonia and essential tremor.  DBS is an established technology that uses a surgically implanted pulse generator device, called a neurostimulator, similar to a cardiac pacemaker, to deliver controlled electrical stimulation to precisely targeted areas in the brain.  Stimulation aims to interrupt faulty communication between the brain and the muscles that result in involuntary muscle movements.  DBS is targeted at those patients with movement disorders whose conditions are no longer adequately controlled by drug therapy.  Currently, DBS treatment is not available in Ireland and patients requiring treatment are referred overseas under the treatment abroad scheme.<\/p><p>  The treatment abroad scheme, TAS, is operated by the HSE and allows patients access to proven treatments not available in Ireland in another EU-EEA country or Switzerland.  The funding for the treatment is approved under the TAS in accordance with the provisions of the relevant EU regulation.  Under the terms of the scheme, a hospital consultant must provide medical evidence of the details of the patient&rsquo;s condition and must certify that the treatment concerned is not available in this country; there is urgent medical necessity for the treatment; there is a reasonable medical prognosis; the treatment is regarded as a proven form of medical treatment; and the treatment abroad is in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner.  DBS treatment satisfies the treatment abroad scheme criteria in terms of the treatment not being available in this jurisdiction and the efficacy of the treatment.  However, there is still a requirement for patients to be assessed on an individual patient basis to ensure that the other criteria are satisfied consistently and there is equity in the application of TAS across all patient cohorts.<\/p><p>  In the absence of a DBS service in Ireland, patients are currently referred to DBS centres abroad for assessment, surgery and follow-up care.  At present, DBS patients are referred to two centres in the UK, Oxford and Newcastle.  Recently, three patients have gone to Belfast for treatment.  The HSE has agreed costs with Oxford and, more recently, Belfast, but such arrangements do not preclude a doctor in Ireland referring a patient to any other centre in the EU or EEA under EU Directive 883\/2004.<\/p><p>  Over the period 2012 to 2014, the total number of  patients seeking to access DBS abroad increased by 182%, from 50 to 170, with a corresponding increase in the cost, of the order of &euro;1,117,950.  Therefore, the overall cost increased from approximately &euro;400,000 to &euro;1.5 million.  Over the same period, the number of new patients remained relatively static with an average of 25 new patients per annum.  The total cost of the whole treatment abroad scheme in the current year for all treatments is estimated at approximately &euro;9 million. <\/p><p>  In October 2012, HIQA published a health technology assessment, HTA, into the provision of DBS services via the TAS versus the feasibility of providing the service here in Ireland.  The HTA conclusions are important in terms of informing future decisions about the organisation and delivery of the DBS service for the future.  Results of an economic analysis comparing the current TAS service delivery to a prospective national DBS service show that the current median cost per patient for the existing TAS-funded service is &euro;44,700 over ten years.  Providing DBS services in Ireland would cost the HSE an additional &euro;20,900 per patient over ten years.  Over five years, the incremental budget impact of a national DBS service is &euro;1.84 million more than the estimated &euro;4.29 million to treat the same number of patients through the TAS over the same period.<\/p><p>  The assessment also highlighted the importance of ensuring that there is adequate planning for the establishment of a DBS service in Ireland, including the development of appropriate and consistent theatre access and additional neurosurgical services.  The report acknowledged that while a national DBS service may address the existing equity issues that exist in regard to those patients that are unable to travel for DBS care, it may give rise to new ethical issues due to the diversion of resources from other effective treatments or from the overall health care fund.<\/p><p>  The TAS continues to offer timely access to deep brain stimulation treatment, as evidenced by the increase in referrals of 182% over the period 2012 to 2014.  In the past 12 months alone, the numbers have increased by 60%.  Furthermore, in order to improve timeliness of access, the TAS has implemented initiatives to streamline the application process.<\/p><p>  The HSE appreciates that there are challenges for movement disorder patients in terms of accessing this service abroad and therefore the recent option whereby patients can avail of the service in the North of Ireland is welcome.  The referral of patients to Queen's University Hospital, Belfast and The Belfast Trust means that, with immediate effect, DBS surgery will now be available to movement disorder patients without the requirement for overseas travel.  This will ameliorate some of the financial and logistical burden on the patient and should also enable improved access for those patients who were precluded from availing of the service under the TAS.  For 2014, it is expected that ten patients will be treated in Belfast.<\/p><p>  It is acknowledged that proximity to the service will also potentially increase the demand.  It is expected that the additional costs will be partially offset by the reduction in the cost per case from availing of the service in Belfast.  The indicative savings are of the order of &euro;7, 200 per case, with further savings envisaged over time particularly with the potential development of outpatient follow-up in the Irish system.  It is expected there will be further savings in regard to the reduction in pharmaceutical costs associated with DBS as a result of the patients availing of the surgery.  It is also anticipated that in time this service will be developed further, with the possibility that multidisciplinary out-patient follow-up clinics could be conducted in the South providing further convenience for the patients.<\/p><p>  The option of developing a DBS service in the Irish health system will be kept under continual review within the context of the overall Estimates process and other competing priorities.  It is not possible to consider this service for 2015, as the funding is already fully committed to meeting existing service priorities.  It is important to state that the TAS is a demand-led scheme and as such the funding arrangements do not enable a transfer of funding to support the development of the service on a continual basis.   We are confident that in the short term the combined access to the UK and Northern Ireland will allow patients timely access to the service.<\/p><p> This concludes my statement.  I and my colleagues will be happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1417686300,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. O'Connell, Ms Fitzgerald and Dr. Carroll.

Dr. O'Connell speaks of the costs of providing the service in Ireland.  My head works in an all-island dimension and I was saying, \"No, that can't be right because there are savings to be made\".  I understand that it related to establishing the service in this State.  I am clarifying that for colleagues who may also on first reading Dr. O'Connell's presentation have understood that there were no savings to be made.  Dr. O'Connell goes on to clarify later that in his presentation in terms of access to the North of Ireland and the service there.  There is no hospital called Queen's University in Belfast.  I know it very well.  It is the Royal Victoria Hospital and we should just acknowledge it for what it is and what it is known.  However, Queen's University would have an interest in the Royal Victoria Hospital and that is, of course, a positive.<\/p><p>  It is very important to note that Dr. Quigley and his colleagues there have already performed a very small number of cases.  My understanding is that this was where people were not in a position to travel for complicated circumstances relating to Parkinson's disease for whom the journey or flight was just not a prospect.  They shared some of that detail with us here.  Dr. Gavin Quigley indicated some of that.  However, they have had the experience and are up for the task.  Without any question in my mind, making DBS available on the island of Ireland is a powerful and positive development for everyone who regards this island as home.  This must be a great encouragement to us to facilitate this development.  <\/p><p>  I take from Dr. O'Connell's position as national director of acute hospitals that he and the HSE are supportive of this access being provided at the Royal Victoria Hospital.  Could he clarify whether this is the case in his response?  That is my interpretation of his contribution.  As he said, it is not about just the saving that can be made.  There is an estimate of some &euro;7,200 per case.  There is also the significant saving to the individual themselves that is not reflected in his contribution.  They no longer have to book flights and make hotel arrangements.  For somebody facing a first surgery or consultation involving DBS and even subsequently for battery changes, the challenge of airport terminals is quite something.  It is a challenge for any of us who are in full health.  The people affected usually cannot travel alone so there is a multiplication of cost in terms of travel, hotel accommodation, etc.  That is a huge improvement for people here.  <\/p><p>  It was indicated by Dr. Gavin Quigley that critically what was required at the outset to facilitate the establishment of an all-island service based at the Royal Victoria Hospital was the appointment of two DBS nurse specialists - one based at the Royal Victoria Hospital and another presumably based at the neurological institute at the Mater hospital.  It would be a case of one north and one south.  Their role would be in assessment and, very importantly, follow-up as it is crucially important.  Could Dr. O'Connell indicate to us his expected response to that identified need?  On the last day, a panel appeared before us on this issue.  Is that being provided?  Can we have certainty that this is included in terms of the national service plan for 2015?<\/p><p>  I know this matter was addressed earlier this week with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the broader context of neurological issues.  I am not sure if it involved Dr. Carroll but I know it was attended by Dr. Gavin Quigley, Dr. Richard Walsh and Professor Tim Lynch.  I regard that engagement as very positive and indicative of good intent.  While it had a wider remit in terms of neurological issues, my understanding is that DBS was addressed in the course of that engagement.  <\/p><p>  Are Ms Fitzgerald, Dr. Carroll and Dr. O'Connell in a position to expand on the opening statement to give us the certainty with regard to the HSE's support for the establishment of this all-island service with the resultant savings to our health budgets and significant improvements in convenience for sufferers seeking access to this procedure and its follow-on supports?  I again that the witnesses for their presentation and I look forward to hearing more in their response to our respective questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400005#D00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1417686300,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Connell for a very comprehensive presentation and for setting out all the issues and the way the HSE is approaching it.

Could he clarify whether he sees a further increase over the next two to three years or whether he thinks it has levelled out in respect of the numbers who will be seeking the assistance of the HSE?<\/p><p>  The second issue is the economic assessment of working with medical providers abroad.  In his presentation, Dr. O'Connell set out where the HSE has looked at this and decided that this is the best way of approaching it.  Is the HSE looking at other areas where it is more cost-effective to link up with institutions abroad rather than try to develop a service here?  I know there would be a number of areas where that would happen.  Is an overall review taking place in respect of that?  Medicine is getting specialised within each different area.

I realise I am straying slightly from the subject matter of the presentation this morning but believe we need to examine this in our long-term planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400005#D00400","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417686900,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I will be brief because Senator Colm Burke covered one or two of the points I wished to raise.<\/p><p>  When I was growing up, I regarded Parkinson's disease as an older person's disease.  The first time I really understood it was when a good friend of mine got it at a very young age.  The world opened its eyes to the disease when actor Michael J. Fox got it.  It was driven home to many young people then that the disease was not peculiar to older people.<\/p><p>  We had great presentations three weeks ago, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in stated.  What impressed me most was the presentation by the lady with Parkinson's disease.  I cannot remember her name.  She outlined how deep brain stimulation had changed her life.  It changed not only her life, but also circumstances for her family.  She referred to having regained the ability to dress and wash herself and sew on buttons, which we take for granted every day.  I went home thinking about how privileged we were to hear the lady's insight into the effect of deep brain stimulation on her and her family.<\/p><p>  Most things are down to cost, which we all understand, but as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, remarks were made on the last occasion on having two nurses, one in the South and another in the North.  Senator Burke is always talking about doctors and other health professionals.  I am always amazed at the work nurses do before patients even see a consultant or anybody else.  We must acknowledge that.<\/p><p>  I would love it if those who want deep brain stimulation, whose number seems to have has increased by 60%, did not have to travel, particularly across the water.  I accept that the North is not too far away.  I hope that we will soon be able to have a facility in Dublin.  If we do not have the relevant expertise, perhaps surgeons could travel here to carry out the work.  It is wonderful work and a huge step in the right direction for those living with Parkinson's disease.<\/p><p>  I was speaking briefly to a friend of mine who has just contracted the disease.  She was a nurse.  She spoke of deep brain stimulation with great respect and interest.  She referred to what it would do for her as an individual living alone.<\/p><p>  I welcome the delegates and thank them again for outlining the benefits of examining all the figures.  It is important that we continue to work together as a committee to have a facility in the southern part of the island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400006#E00200","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417686900,"counter":683,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their questions.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for the clarification at the beginning on Belfast.  I was very pleased the committee was able to hear from Ms Tufts, a recipient of deep brain stimulation, on the last occasion it discussed this issue.  As stated, it is very powerful to hear the stories of the recipients.  We believe the therapy is efficacious; there is no doubt about it.  The issue is merely about where it is delivered and how much it costs.  However, we would like to provide the therapy for all patients who require it.<\/p><p>  I was asked whether we support the development and growth of a service which could well be an all-island service in Belfast.  Clearly, we do so by agreeing costs with Belfast, by supporting the commencement of a service there and by our having already traded three patients there this year.  I was asked whether we would support, in the long term, a centre in Dublin.  It is quite possible.  It is purely a matter of having a cost-benefit analysis of what critical mass of patients would warrant setting up a centre.  Such a centre would possibly be in addition to that in Belfast although it might itself become the all-island centre, depending on the relative caseloads in the two centres.<\/p><p>  Many members talked about travel for patients.  This was a theme that emerged quite strongly in the previous meeting with the representatives of the service in Belfast, the patients and their representatives.  The fact is that all patients will have to travel to have this kind of service, which could be provided in but one or, at most, two centres in a country the size of Ireland.  Even if we had the service in Dublin, patients with Parkinson's disease from Letterkenny, Galway and Cork would still have to make a train journey of a couple of hours to get here to receive the treatment.  There would be overnight stays.  Cases are not necessarily day cases.  This kind of neurosurgical intervention requires that some patients would have to have hotels.  However, we would clearly like to minimise the burden of travel, which is why we are as keen as the committee to have an all-island solution that minimises the need for people to fly to Britain for treatment.  To that end, we would like to develop the follow-up service, with a multidisciplinary clinic, so nurses and other health professionals working with neurologists and neurosurgeons could do the simple tasks, such as the battery changes, thus eliminating the need to travel. <\/p><p>  We are very supportive of the concept of a multidisciplinary team approach both to the work-up and post-operative management of the cases.  That does not necessarily have to be done by the same team that carries out the actual operation in the operating theatre.  There are numerous examples of therapies and surgical operations in Ireland where the follow-up team is different from the one carrying out the operation.  As long as the transfer of information about what actually happened and the requirements is smoothly managed, the potential risk of loss of continuity of care is managed.<\/p><p>  We are very supportive of growing this.  However, there is no funding in the current service plan for growing the team at present.  If the current number of neurologists, neurology-linked nurses and other team members in Dublin were willing to take on this role, we would not step in the way.  However, in terms of funding additional resources, there is simply no money to do that.  There are more pressing requirements to increase the number of staff in a number of disciplines that are more severely embarrassed at present than those associated with Parkinson's disease, given that the condition is being managed on the island already this year.<\/p><p>  I was aware that the neurologists and neurosurgeons from Belfast met the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently.  I was not privy to the discussion so I cannot really comment on it but it is clear to me there is growing interest in what can be done to address the issues to which the members all referred.<\/p><p>  With regard to Senator Burke's question about future demand, we will eventually get to a point where we saturate the service and have a rate of treatment of patients that meets the demand.  It is not really clear we are there yet because the patients who will be suitable will comprise a minority of all patients who have neurological conditions.  They must all go through a phase of attempting pharmacological therapy.  When that fails, they become suitable.  There are numerous clinical gateways that need to be entered to establish whether one is suitable for a procedure.<\/p><p>  It is worth saying that under the treatment abroad scheme, it is possible for a doctor to refer to a centre elsewhere in Europe if he has a relationship with that centre or knows it is a centre of excellence.  The patient must be happy to travel to that centre in the expectation of a better outcome.  The development of an all-island service does not necessarily preclude the possibility that Parkinson's disease and other conditions might be treated on the Continent.<\/p> <p>With regard to an economic assessment of the cost-effectiveness of this approach and other therapies managed by the treatment abroad scheme, TAS, there is an ongoing awareness of the constant tension between the economic cost of adding travel and the inconvenience for patients of servicing someone overseas or in Northern Ireland compared to the infrastructural outlay and set-up costs of establishing a treatment centre for those conditions in Ireland.  Every year the number of cases we are dealing with and the spend - which, as I said, now totals &euro;9 million - is assessed and reviewed.  The range of treatment therapies that are administered through the TAS is broad and there are individual assessments of each of the broad themes of work which occur.  Ultimately, it is a matter of whether we get the greatest economies of scale by doing it overseas, and that will have to be assessed, or by doing it in Ireland, which also has to be assessed.  The assessments must be done on a condition-by-condition basis each year.  I will ask Ms Fitzgerald to speak on the cross-border directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417687500,"counter":685,"content":"<p>The cross-border directive is not specifically about the Border within Ireland; it relates to all European borders.  I am sure the Senator is well aware of that.  A process is currently in place between the HSE and the Department of Health to look at the implications with specific reference to the North of Ireland.  It is more likely that we will see migration in the other direction, because their access issues are just a bit better than ours, but I suppose there are other concerns around the wider European context.  There is a process under way to look at how we manage that.<\/p><p>  With specific reference to the matter in hand, it is probably less relevant because there is access in the North and we seek to access its service.  What is probably of equal relevance, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is well aware, is the conduit by which we have achieved other all-Ireland solutions, such as Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT.  If we were seeking to develop an all-Ireland service, we would try to do it under that construct, and we have done that quite successfully in other areas, particularly complex areas.<\/p><p>  We do need to distinguish the current arrangements for delivering the service under the TAS - in which case we would expect the treating hospital to have a lot of the infrastructure in place, and that is what we are paying for - from a scenario in which we develop an all-Ireland service and put the infrastructure in place ourselves.  The questions around cost savings are relevant in that context as well, because the cost savings referred to in the document show that we have now got a better price than we were getting when we were sending people overseas, so it would possibly allow us to treat more patients.  The cost implications of setting it up here largely relate to the set-up costs.<\/p><p>  To answer the question, there is a process under way, with particular reference to this, but it will not result in increased demands that might displace us; it might just enable patients to access it without reference to the treatment abroad scheme.  Because Tim Lynch and his colleagues have worked very closely with the treatment abroad scheme, they have tried to make sure that this service almost behaves as if it is a cross-border one.  Patients who meet the clinical criteria are getting relatively free access.  That is evidenced by the increase in referrals in the past three years.  The point is well made; we do need to consider the implications.  It is less relevant for this than, perhaps, for other services, but in the context of an all-Ireland solution, we have good mechanisms already in place to enable some of that to be considered, and we are talking to the Department of Health about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1417687500,"counter":686,"content":"<p>In the context of cross-border health care, I wish to ask about undue delay.

From our point of view, we are likely to see patients seeking access elsewhere, but equally, eastern European countries will have access to our services.  The question of delay is a significant one.  We have a programme of access reform to address delay for our own patients.  The challenge is that we could attract patients from other countries.  The only issue is that there is a level of reciprocity.  Every country is being faced with the same challenge.  Because the expectation has been raised, there are other burdens on the patient in terms of travel costs.  That will possibly be one of the limiting factors.  It is the single biggest issue member states are now having to consider and there is no easy answer to it.  Perversely, if a country improves access, it leaves itself slightly more open to inward migration.

In relation to the additional personnel needed, the number really is very small.  What was identified by the team in Belfast was a single nurse there, a deep brain stimulation, DBS, nurse specialist and one here.  The remark was made that the money is not there.  I would not expect it to be a full-time post of itself, but I stand to be corrected on that.  Dr. O&rsquo;Connell said there would be no issue if somebody volunteered to take on the position.  Could we not have a more proactive approach in terms of establishing the availability of somebody within the neurological service at the Mater hospital who could perform the specific role of DBS nurse specialist?  The assessment will presumably be progressed by Professor Lynch and Dr. Walsh, among others, but a nurse is a critical support element within the team, especially so in terms of follow-up.  The issue is being addressed again.  It has become current following on from the paediatric cardiac decisions.  The health Minister in the North, Mr. Wells, has taken a significant step in supporting and facilitating that.  We all want to be on the one page.  I do not want to go to the next meeting of the North-South Interparliamentary Association in Stormont in May and be embarrassingly slapped back on the basis that we could not even secure a single appointment of a DBS nurse specialist in Dublin in order to properly facilitate the advent of an all-island service at the Royal Victoria Hospital.<\/p><p>  Dr. O&rsquo;Connell is looking at the matter from his perspective, but I must look at it in terms of the political engagement that is my life - sadly, I might add, but I have to do it.

In my own clinical practice, as well as from a clinical programme point of view, it is very important that individuals have access to diagnosis and a full range of treatments, oral and parenteral, and then the higher-specification treatments such as deep brain stimulation.  It is important that we consider the treatment of these individuals as a whole and develop care pathways that will take care of all the needs of these individuals.<\/p><p>  The  neurology clinical programme has developed a model of care which is currently under consultation.  One of the care pathways is for individuals with Parkinson's disease, and DBS is part of that treatment pathway.  That is the first step in identifying exactly what the pathway should be, and access to a full multidisciplinary team is extremely important for all aspects of the management of anybody with a significant movement disorder.  By a full multidisciplinary team I mean physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and psychology.  Individuals with a significant disability as a result of movement disorder really require access to a full multidisciplinary team.  The nursing piece aspect of DBS is very important, but it is only part of the jigsaw of treatments that these individuals need access to.  They also need access to rehabilitation services.  In the course of my work I worked in the movement disorder service in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  It was a multidisciplinary team not only in terms of specialist disciplines but also with neuro-rehabilitation, neurology and neurosurgery, with which we worked very closely in providing services to patients.

In particular, I extend my gratitude to Deputy Seamus Healy, who attended a local launch of these guidelines in Thurles and arranged this invitation to allow me to raise before this committee the vitally important issue of access within the built environment.<\/p><p>  I would like to introduce my colleagues who worked with Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, members and staff to develop the third edition of the access guidelines.  Dolores Murphy is the IWA&rsquo;s access and housing officer.  Bridget Boyle is the regional access co-ordinator for the eastern region.  Vijoy Chakraborty is the IWA&rsquo;s senior occupational therapist.  Additionally, I would like to recognise the IWA staff in the Visitors Gallery, who worked on developing this edition of the access guidelines and the large number of IWA members and staff who are following this session online in one of the IWA&rsquo;s 57 resource outreach centres.<\/p><p>  The Irish Wheelchair Association was founded in 1960 and is a national organisation dedicated to the achievement of full social, economic and educational integration of people with disabilities as equal, independent and participative members of the community.  The IWA has a nationwide network of 20,000 members and employs in excess of 2,000 staff to support members to live independently within their local community.  The question of access for people with limited mobility and wheelchair users is the single biggest issue to impact on individual lives.  Without good accessibility, the ability of people to live independently and to be treated as equal is severely impacted on.<\/p><p>  In 2009, the IWA was given a mandate by its membership to develop the first edition of the best practice access guidelines.  A second edition, incorporating updated standards and new guidelines, was published in 2010.  Since 2010 we have undertaken a number of initiatives on access and worked with many local authorities during the review of Part M of the building regulations to extend the IWA's best practice access guidelines.  We have also worked on many high-profile builds over recent years, the most notable being the Aviva Stadium at Lansdowne Road and Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport.  Other examples of our work include the regeneration of Grafton Street in Dublin and Portlaoise hospital.<\/p><p>  There have, therefore, been many successes for the IWA in improving access within the built environment.  However, these improvements have been largely piecemeal, on individual projects and where the IWA was invited to participate on building projects because we became aware of the building project at an early stage or due to personal contacts that existed between the organisation undertaking the building project and the IWA.  The objective from this point on is to encourage systemic change to ensure that good access is at the core of planning for new builds and on building projects to renovate existing buildings.<\/p><p>  To develop our access guidelines, a number of guiding principles were followed.  We recognised that there are minimum standards for accessibility set out in the building regulations, primarily Parts B, K and M, and that there are standards recommended within the technical guidance documents that accompany the building regulations.  The IWA&rsquo;s best practice access guidelines build upon these minimum standards to deliver best practice in accessible design.  The IWA also recognises that other bodies are working on accessibility matters, including the National Disability Authority, NDA, and the building control sections within the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.  The IWA&rsquo;s access guidelines utilise and build upon the work of these entities in a collaborative manner.  The IWA recognises that accessibility is an issue across the world and each country has guidance and standards for all aspects of access within the built environment.  The IWA&rsquo;s guidelines use the highest level of access standards that exist elsewhere and within Ireland to ensure that our standards represent the best practice by international standards.<\/p> <p>We recognise there are legacy issues in addressing existing buildings with poor levels of access, and these issues require a strategic approach to incentivise access upgrades.  By adopting these principles, we ensure that our work on accessibility constantly builds upon the work of others, thereby avoiding duplication or competition.  The objective of improving access to the built environment can only be achieved when all parties work together.<\/p><p> By working with external organisations on various building projects, advising IWA members and statutory bodies and supporting commercial entities on access matters, the IWA identified new areas that would benefit from being incorporated into our access guidelines, such as guidance for sports stadia and for once-off outdoor events.  A consultation process took place with more than 1,000 IWA members, local authorities and other disability organisations to identify what additions and updates were required to our access guidelines.  This process led to the publication of the third edition of our access guidelines.<\/p><p> The guidelines were launched on 4 July 2014, Independence Day in the US, at the Aviva Stadium because the IWA worked with that stadium's architects and management on gaining the highest levels of accessibility for our members, wheelchair users and others with impaired mobility.  The Aviva stadium has 120 wheelchair accessible spaces located at different viewing points, all providing an uninterrupted view of soccer and rugby games.  Since the national launch of the guidelines in July, a number of local launches have taken place in 26 locations throughout the country and attendees included Members of the Oireachtas, local authority councillors and staff, IWA members, architects, builders and HSE officials.  In total, approximately 1,000 people attended the local launches and this initiative has further raised awareness of access issues.  The next step is to ensure that the third edition of the IWA's access guidelines is used to impact further on standards of accessibility within the built environment.  This can only be achieved by ensuring all new legislation and public policy recognises the importance of good access, ensuring planning decisions reflect the highest standards of accessibility as outlined in the guidelines, and supporting organisations and individuals in developing best practice building plans when preparing a disability access certificate application.<\/p><p> I will now address the matter of the assistance of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  We are here today to ask the committee to support our work by endorsing the IWA's best practice access guidelines and recording its support for our work in this regard.  Committee members can be champions for the highest levels of accessibility when discharging their duties as Deputies, Senators, public policy-makers and legislators.  Committee members can ensure that any new building projects within the health sector utilise the guidance and standards detailed in the IWA's best practice access guidelines. They can also propose a business tax incentive scheme to the Government for access upgrades to existing buildings.  This would be similar to the home renovation scheme announced in the 2013 budget.<\/p><p> In concluding this opening statement, I would like to restate my sincere gratitude to the committee for its invitation to make a presentation on the access guidelines and accessibility in the built environment.  I acknowledge that creating an environment with the highest level of accessibility is a long-term objective, but this can only be achieved by undertaking short and medium-term actions.  All members of society must be aware of the importance of good accessibility and all new legislation and public policy must be access-proofed.  We need a continued drive to raise the minimum standards of accessibility to the level articulated in the third edition of the access guidelines.<\/p><p> I thank the members listening to this opening statement and we are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Hoey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417689300,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hoey for such a comprehensive opening statement and congratulate the witnesses on the comprehensive document that is this edition of the guidelines.

I attended the local launch of the guidelines in Thurles and met IWA members and staff, so I felt the committee would be supportive of this, as it has.<\/p><p>  There is no doubt that this edition of the guidelines is a significant and detailed body of work that is available to the construction sector, architects, local authorities, public building bodies and those who seek to facilitate access to the built environment for those with limited mobility.  Since the guidelines were first introduced in 2009, they have been used with regard to various organisations, structures and buildings, as indicated by Mr. Hoey, including Croke Park, the Aviva Stadium, Marks &amp;amp; Spencer, various local authorities, Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport, the National Gallery and a host of other entities.  Many projects have used the expertise and information available in the guidelines and worked with the Irish Wheelchair Association to improve accessibility for those with limited mobility.  I endorse the guidelines and expect that this committee will champion them in future.  I hope the committee will recommend access-proofing as public policy.<\/p><p>  I thank the representatives of the Irish Wheelchair Association for the work they do throughout the country.  It is a very significant and important organisation with 20,000 members, 2,000 members of staff and 57 centres nationwide.

It was also a great honour to be asked to launch this edition of the guidelines regionally.  It is a document that has been prepared in the kind of language people like us can understand.  It is not a technical document, although it is sufficiently technical to allow us to understand the raw material and assume this was a deliberate strategic approach that was taken to compiling the guidelines.<\/p><p>  I congratulate the witnesses on the publication of the guidelines and I believe their efforts today will be rewarded with the full support of committee members.  It was an opportune time for the publication of these guidelines.  The Irish Wheelchair Association has 20,000 members and 1,000 were sampled in compiling this document so it is a comprehensive piece of work.  I acknowledge this on behalf of the committee and extend our gratitude to the witnesses and the Irish Wheelchair Association for their dedication and commitment.<\/p><p>  Ambitious social and public housing plans were recently proposed so, as I said, the timing of this publication is opportune.  Many committee members are aware of the complex nature of local authorities and the difficulties, costs and barriers that exist when seeking to adapt a dwelling to allow accessibility for those with limited mobility.  Getting this right from the outset is essential.<\/p> <p>It is vital that we have a comprehensive, understandable and user-friendly tool that will ensure cost-effective outcomes.  That is in the interest of all stakeholders from the perspective of costs but, most important, it is in the interests of service users.  Of course, getting it right at the outset is also far more cost-efficient for the Exchequer.<\/p><p> The question then is how we can build more comprehensive relationships among stakeholders and ensure this document is embedded as an obligation in terms of how we approach design.  The delegates referred to the application of the local authority guidelines since 2010.  I would be interested to hear about how they have evaluated their own success over that period in the context of how the 2009 guidelines have been implemented.  How can we learn from what has happened since 2010 and how can we make this document more effective in the sense of ensuring its recommendations are applied in the context of living environment design in a way that makes a real difference to people?  How do the delegates envision us working together to make that happen?  Securing the support of this committee is straightforward enough, but what happens after that in so far as the delegates envisage rolling out the guidelines?  It might not be a question of statutory obligations, but we should be aiming for a general understanding of best practice and how local authorities, State bodies and agencies will have as the centrepiece of the roll-out of any built living environment an accommodation of the needs of people with varying degrees of ability and disability.<\/p><p> I congratulate the delegates once again on the publication of this document.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400010#J00500","speaker":"1188","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417689900,"counter":712,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for their presentation and the documentation they provided.

This is the third edition of the access guidelines since the previous document in 2009.  Clearly, there is a steady progression going on, but will the delegates indicate what proportion or percentage of the previous recommendations and guidelines have been implemented?<\/p><p>  The Irish Wheelchair Association worked with many local authorities during the review of the building regulations.  Youghal Town Council had two of its councillors represented on the local disability awareness group during the period I was on the council.  When the previous access guidelines were published in 2009, the members of that group took to the streets with the local authority engineers to see where improvements could be made.  That was a very worthwhile exercise.  One of those individuals was a mobility scooter user and it was very useful for the others to see at first hand the difficulties he encountered along the way.<\/p><p>  The delegates referred to the importance of having standards that represent best practice internationally.  How do we measure that and will the delegates give an example of a country where best practice is in operation?  The delegates made several clear recommendations which I am sure will have the full support of the committee.

We have 57 centres throughout the country.  The key for this document to work is that it is not an IWA national policy document or a document of this committee; it is something that has to be owned, lived and breathed at local level.  That means staff from our local centres interacting with local architects and builders and, most important, with staff in local authorities.  It is about building relationships in order that when there is a building project, those involved in designing and building it do not come to the IWA by exception, rather it is part of what they do.  That is what I mean by systemic change.  Access should not be an add-on or extra but very much part of the process of planning any project.<\/p><p>  We endorse what the Deputy said about the cost when something goes wrong.  It is far less costly to get it right at the beginning.  The Aviva Stadium is a wonderful example of that and is on a par with any stadium in the world when it comes to accessibility.  It was the people around the table with me and in the Gallery who engaged with the builders and architects on that project and made it happen.  It is an example of doing it right, which ensures there is cost-effectiveness.<\/p><p>  The local launches showed how we intend to roll this out.  More than 1,000 people took part in that initiative, the majority of whom were not aware of the national launch in the Aviva Stadium.  The access strategy is now on the table of a range of local decision-makers, but we need to build on that.  The plan we are trying to put in place involves a number of levels of access supports, from local to regional to national level.  The objective is to have an access response available for people at the most local level.  It will not work if people come to me.  They need to approach their local centre.<\/p><p>  Deputy McLellan asked for an example of best practice internationally.  There are different examples in different parts of the world, and our guidelines have unashamedly incorporated the best of them.  In terms of how we use them, I would point to the Aviva Stadium as an example of a facility of the highest standards.  It is about working together on planning and then bringing the concept into reality.<\/p><p>  I will ask my colleagues to comment on the question regarding the obstacles people face in their communities.  It might be nice for members to hear a different voice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400011#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Hoey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417689900,"counter":715,"content":"<p>Obstacles in the community are reported regularly to IWA, particularly in the consultations that were held in our resource centres throughout the country before we wrote up this third edition of the guidelines.  Obstacles arise when people try to access the most basic facilities.  We have regular reports, for example, that public toilet facilities available to wheelchair users are not fit for purpose for most people who require them.  Wheelchair users might find they cannot close the bathroom door behind them or, even if they can get it closed, they are unable to manoeuvre within the space.  That is a perennial problem and one of the major barriers to wheelchair users' capacity to get out and about and have a social life.<\/p><p>  Another persistent issue that is reported relates to parking.  We often hear, for instance, about parking that is not properly designed and has inadequate space for the person to take his or her wheelchair out of the car and transfer into it.  In some cases, parking is provided at a location that is not adjacent to the person's destination.  We have had reports, too, of buildings with lifts that are not sufficiently large to allow a person using a powered wheelchair to enter or have a person accompany him or her.  At one of our public consultations in Cork, a person reported a building that had a lift which went only to the second floor but not the third or fourth.<\/p> <p>If a person wanted to be part of what was happening in that building, he or she could only be part of what was happening on floors 1 and 2.  Numerous problems are reported in this regard and they are legacy issues, but we hope there may be a way to deal with and address some of them.  That is why we have suggested a tax incentive scheme might be considered which could encourage and promote businesses, community services and facilities to undertake adaptation works that would improve the facilities available.<\/p><p> The Irish Wheelchair Association is regularly asked whether there is a grant or some facility available to support people and help to improve the service they are providing.  This could relate to a person with bed and breakfast accommodation, a youth club or a local community resource centre.  There is no such grant available.  We consider the availability of a tax incentive to undertake works, particularly intended to provide increased and better levels of access, would be an incentive to promote better accessibility in existing buildings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400011#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Dolores Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417690500,"counter":717,"content":"<p>I will elaborate on the point made by Ms Murphy about the burning issues people encounter on a daily basis.  As a person who uses a wheelchair, I can report first-hand on the matter.  It is about taking the natural journey.  Let us suppose I use my car in the morning.  Can I get into it?  Ms Murphy made the same point.  Do I have sufficient space to open the door of my car?  When I arrive at my destination, can I get out of my car?  It is a question of accessible car parking.<\/p><p>  Another issue our members often encounter relates to footpaths that are not accessible.  They are either not wide enough or the surface is not conducive to use of a wheelchair.  A person may not have ramped access to a footpath.  Again, it is about taking the natural journey.<\/p><p>  I am keen to reinforce one point relating to access to the built environment.  It is more than a question of getting into a building; it is about what it opens up for a person with a disability.  The ability to access a building includes access to education, employment and social interaction.  It is about what everyone expects.  There is one question I always pose when I talk about access: can I go where you go?  To me, that is the essence of the issue.  We can also discuss access with reference to egress.  Can I get out of a building?  I may be able to get in, but can I get out?  It is all about safe evacuation.  We have covered this issue extensively in our guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Bridget Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1417690500,"counter":718,"content":"<p>Before we move on, I acknowledge the presence of Mr. Hugh Farrell, Mr. Mark Barry, Mr. Liam O'Rourke, Mr. Joe O'Connell and Ms Anita Matthews from the Irish Wheelchair Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400012#L00300","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1417690500,"counter":719,"content":"<p>I thank the deputation for a comprehensive presentation.  My first question relates to selling an idea and about engagement.  One point may be helpful from our point of view.  Do we have a figure for the total number of people who are wheelchair bound or who need to use wheelchairs?  Another interesting figure is the number who are dependent on wheelchairs and living alone.  These figures are relevant in emphasising the importance of adapting buildings and streetscapes.<\/p><p>  Another point relates to engagement with various players involved in the construction industry.  The first group is local authorities.  When we were engaged in refurbishment in the city centre in Cork, I recall the engagement of the local authority with the association.  That engagement was extremely important.  What is the current level of engagement with local authorities?  Are there clear targets set in each local authority area?  I imagine in any local authority area there are at least 20 or 30 places which need to be adapted.  It is a question of setting out a clear programme for when the work will be done to make the necessary changes and seeing if these targets are being met by local authorities.<\/p><p>  There are several important players when it comes to design and construction.  There are four main players, namely, the local authority, architects, engineers and the Construction Industry Federation.  What level of engagement has there been with them?  I have referred to local authorities, but what is the position with architects, engineers and the Construction Industry Federation in showing forward thinking and planning?<\/p><p>  While we have gone through a downturn in the building industry, we are moving on.  In Cork three or four major projects are under way, involving over &euro;200 million in expenditure.  It is important at this stage to ensure the mistakes made in the past are not made in the future.  I am curious about the level of engagement.  What can we do to assist it?  I am keen to see where we go on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400012#L00400","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1417690500,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I join my colleagues in welcoming the deputation and thank it for the access guidelines which are most interesting to read.  This is not an area about which I claim to know a great deal, other than having experiences, particularly with children's groups, when trying to access a venue or seeking to hold an event in a venue.  Sometimes we are told venues are fully accessible, but when we arrive there are two steps to be negotiated and the people concerned suggest we simply lift in those in wheelchairs.  We have to be mindful of the dignity of the persons concerned.  Sometimes I have to make the point that we were told in advance that the venue was accessible.  That brings me to my first question.  Is there a list of venues available?  Community and voluntary organisations regularly put it to me that they want to hold meetings or events and engage in activities.  They are keen to support venues that are fully accessible, rather than waiting to see whether someone is coming who is in a wheelchair.  The idea in the first instance is to hold the event somewhere that is accessible.  This would be useful and is something we could all promote and a way to promote best practice.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to the report of the Ombudsman for Children dating from September 2009 on a review of complaints on behalf of children in the provision of housing.  It concerns the adaptation of a house.  There were some recurring concerns in the report about what constituted a suitable housing standard for a child with special needs.  One of the children concerned was in a wheelchair and it was a question of agreeing on what was appropriate in terms of housing adaptation.  The deputation has referred to the engagement with local authorities since the guidance was issued.  Has it improved significantly?  Is it something we should be tracking?  Should we go back to the report of the Ombudsman for Children and ask what has happened since and whether the level of engagement is consistent throughout the country?<\/p><p>  My final question relates to the health care sector.  We expect hospitals and such venues to be accessible.  On Tuesday we visited the site of the new national children's hospital and the potential associated satellite centres.  This will involve renovation of older buildings.  I hope and expect those involved are taking the access guidelines on board.  It made me think of nursing homes.  In recent years I have visited numerous nursing homes, many of which purport to be accessible, but it is exactly as Ms Murphy said.  The lift may go to the second floor, but there may be three floors and there are activities on the third floor.  Technically, wheelchair users could squeeze in but not if it is a living environment or to be a person's home.  The high dependency needs of some wheelchair-bound users are not catered for.  A nursing home may claim to be fully accessible, but in reality it may not be in the sense that it cannot become a person's home.  <\/p><p>  These are my random thoughts.

It had never struck me that there might be a problem.<\/p> <p>The main bathrooms in these relatively large apartments were not accessible for a person in a wheelchair.  A guest of mine in a wheelchair was using the facilities in Leinster House in what was designated as an accessible bathroom, but when a mishap occurred the door could not be opened and it was difficult to get a body in to rescue the person.

A number of years ago I was involved in a local school that ran a very interesting project during transition year.  A number of students came up with the idea of borrowing wheelchairs and spending a day or two in them.  This initiative made all of us, not just the young people, feel how it would affect an individual to be in a wheelchair 24\/7.  I remember from my interaction with the students, the impact of being in a wheelchair had on them when they encountered difficulties a few minutes from the school.<\/p><p>  When I was a councillor on Dublin City Council, I was very involved in the committee on disability.  The city council  did exceptional work and now most new buildings have access for wheelchairs. <\/p><p>  I wish to comment on the materials used for playground surfaces.  I have a granddaughter and I frequent a number of playgrounds - when my children were growing up, there were swings in the back garden - and I notice that different materials, including tree bark is being used.  I note that the presentation referred to the use of sand and gravel, but in our local playground they took out the sand and replaced it with bark.  The parents are happy with bark because sand caused problems.  Will the use of bark cause problems for people in wheelchairs?  <\/p><p>  There are now changing rooms for babies, but is there any indication of the height level of the changing table?<\/p><p>  I agree with the proposal for a business tax scheme to encourage businesses to upgrade existing buildings.

However, if somebody  needed to go to the lavatory, I would have to send them across to the local pub to access a disabled toilet.<\/p><p>  I thank the Irish Wheelchair Association for the work they do on the ground.

Many of us have constituency offices.  I too made it my job to have a ground floor office, but it was impossible to find a property to rent that would have disabled facilities on the ground floor.  My concerns were twofold, I was thinking of people with mobility issues but also of mothers with young children who might want to access the office.  It might be an interesting exercise for the IWA to do an audit of constituency offices and how they rate in terms of access.  That would put accessibility four square in the minds of public representatives.  The IWA might consider taking on that as an exercise.  I would be delighted for somebody to come and do an audit of my office to highlight the issues.<\/p><p>  During my time in college I was the equality officer in the Students' Union.  One of the tasks we undertook was an accessibility audit of the campus.  I remember what struck me, and this echoes the point made by Ms Boyle on whether a person with disabilities can do what another person can do.  One of our findings was that the ATM bank machine was too high.  I see in some places, they have been adapted, but in the villages and towns with which I am familiar the machines are of a standard height.  Does the IWA get a buy-in from the banks and businesses?  I think Deputy Byrne's suggestion of a tax incentive for businesses to improve accessibility is a worthy recommendation.

Unfortunately, there are no hard facts and figures.  The local census will tell us that approximately 11% of the population have a physical disability of some sort, but the figure is not broken down between people who use wheelchairs and those who do not.  Similarly, there is no census figures that we can use reliably to determine isolation, but from our local intelligence, we tend to know the pockets and the number of people, and we have local responses for local issues.  We are trying to speak to the Central Statistics Office about how to reflect this in future censuses, but I am sure there are a hundred different groups asking the CSO to add different questions to the survey.  This committee may be able to help us in that regard.<\/p><p> the level of engagement with the local authorities is increasing.  There are access committees in most local authority areas and we have a seat on most access committees of the local authorities.  We are talking about systemic change and it is not for me to say that X council is brilliant but Y council is not.  It is a case of raising everybody up to the highest level.  Unfortunately we still have personality driven approaches.  In the councils where we have the best interaction it is because somebody has a personal experience of disability.  We want to raise awareness of these issues to such a point that it does not matter whether people have personal experience, but that it becomes ingrained in what they do, that access and accessibility is a right of every member of society. I will ask Mr. Vijoy Chakraborty to give an example of how we are planning for the long-term future by making an input before people qualify as architects or occupational therapists.  There is a number of initiatives which Mr. Chakraborty will develop.<\/p><p>  With regard to the points made by Senator van Turnhout on claims that buildings are fully accessible, that is something we deal with on a daily basis.  It is not that business is trying to pull the wool over anybody's eyes.  It is that the people who are making the claims do not really understand what the term \"fully accessible\" means.  That is one of the reasons for this document.  It is an issue that requires systemic change.  It is not that IWA wants to be held up as the best, the IWA wants to inform and come up with access solutions and advice.  IWA wants to develop a facility where it does not matter whether one has a local sweet shop or a bank with an ATM, one can call IWA and somebody from a local centre can give the business objective and straightforward advice.<\/p> <p>We can also provide solutions, as some solutions to accessibility are very inexpensive.  It is just about thinking outside the box and so on.<\/p><p> Hospitals have been mentioned and I commented on legacy issues.  There are very few new hospitals around the country.  I live in Cavan and the hospital there was built in the late 1980s or early 1990s; I used to work there.  There are accessibility issues with that location, and it is one of the newer hospitals.  Would the 2014 standards be applied to a 1990 build?  We have a piece of work in tackling the legacy pieces, not just in hospitals but across society.  Ms Murphy will address the issue of private rented accommodation.  Deputy Catherine Byrne made some very relevant points and I am glad she is going to support the call for a tax incentive and so on.  Mr. Chakraborty will speak to how we are systemically trying to change and refer to the Dublin Airport Authority and a specific piece of influential work.  We will take up every offer and we can do an access audit of every constituency office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400013#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Hoey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417691700,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I engage with professionals and those designing places in the years to come but I have a role as a practice educator as well.  There are occupational therapy students who get nine-week or 11-week placements with the Irish Wheelchair Association.  During their placements, they get a good understanding of access issues.  Much of my role in the association concerns access.  We are also in the process of engaging with the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland, RIAI, to see if we can even develop a continuing professional development course.  Accessibility might be covered in a chapter when somebody is becoming an architect but not everybody may have gone through the process.  Having some engagement with the RIAI means we can target the issue early.<\/p><p>  Recently we had contact from Bank of Ireland, which wanted to officially determine the possible areas in which it can improve.  One of the officials came to us and we went out with a person in a wheelchair to go to a local bank.  They had a perfect understanding afterwards, as the person could not open the doors through which people had to go, for example.  There was also the issue of ATM height, etc.  We are engaging with banks and they must bring the issue back to management.  The process could be subject to budgets, etc.<\/p><p>  Many public playgrounds can be considered wheelchair-accessible as long as there is proper flooring and one or two facilities which people in a wheelchair can access, such as vertical panels.  Children with disabilities will also want to experience some kind of challenge when they go to a playground.  They want to take risks.  We are advocating for this.  There is some playground equipment that could be used by people in wheelchairs, and this relates to Deputy McLellan's point about barriers to use.  Much of the time people might consider if designs need to be changed or if they can get away with just the minimum standards.  This can be the biggest barrier in implementation.  As long as there are levels and gates which are accessible, the playground is technically wheelchair-accessible.  Is that any good for children in wheelchairs and what motivation do they have when they visit that playground?  In any public playground, the procurement policy should have a clause detailing how many pieces of equipment can be usable by people in wheelchairs.<\/p><p>  We are engaging with many agencies about changing places, including Dublin Airport.  The work is still in progress at terminal 2 after a number of years.  We are also working with the National Gallery of Ireland and there will be another adult changing facility available there.  Recently, we have been engaging with Inclusion Ireland, another organisation, and we will have a meeting next Monday about the changing place campaign.  We are associated with that.  The question was asked regarding guidelines, and these are included in our guidelines<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400014#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vijoy Chakraborty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417691700,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I will pick up on some questions, particularly those regarding housing.  There was mention of private rented housing and whether there is guidance or regulation required.  Building regulations are applied to private housing, even if it is rented, but prior to 2000, the regulations did not mention anything about accessibility.  What was provided was not required to comply with any accessibility elements.  When newer building regulations were introduced in 2000, only the minimum amount was required.  For example, the term used was for a house to be \"visitable\" rather than accessible.  There is a higher expectation for public areas of apartment buildings but with regard to space where people would enter and live, the requirement was for the unit to be \"visitable\".  This means that somebody with a disability could enter and be there in a social area.  The bathroom facilities required may not be adequate for somebody who is a wheelchair user.  That is still the case, although building regulations have been upgraded; there is now a 2010 version of those regulations but the section on housing has not changed.  The section on public buildings has been changed.  It is still only required that a unit be visitable, which is not suitable for somebody using a wheelchair.<\/p><p>  Senator van Turnhout asked about the Ombudsman and work done by it some years back.  We are aware of that work but the Senator asked what has changed since.  The answer is probably that not a lot has changed.  The case in question concerned social housing and no such housing has been built in the intervening years.  Towards the end of the boom, there were some examples from councils - Dublin City Council is the one in question - which were \"piecemeal\" or random.  On Londonbridge Road there is a social housing project built by Dublin City Council towards the end of the boom and accessibility was integrated.  A percentage of the units built there were designed to be suitable for people using wheelchairs, and particularly those using powered wheelchairs.  The people concerned would have been involved with consultation and design processes.  It is a good quality housing project with a mix of different family units and general and particular accessibility features.  Unfortunately, that came at the end of the boom and the practice was piecemeal.  It was never \"systemised\" or developed into a process.<\/p><p>  That is the challenge now.  The social housing strategy launched last week by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, discusses eliminating the social housing list.  There are almost 4,000 people with disabilities nationally on social housing lists.<\/p> <p>A similar number of people with disabilities would be expected to move out of congregated settings.  These are people who need a particular type of housing design.  There is a great deal of government documentation in that regard, including the national housing strategy for people with a disability and the congregated settings report, while the local authorities are required to set up housing and disability steering groups.  Many of the pieces of the jigsaw are in place or are being put in place, but the challenge is how one translates that into the supply of social housing that is suitable to the needs of people who have a mobility impairment.  That has not existed up to now and it must happen.<\/p><p> As my colleagues mentioned, accessible design works best when there is an engagement with the client group, the people who will use the facility.  That engagement can be established and maintained over time.  It is not a once-off engagement but something that would be established and worked through.  There have been many examples of that but, again, the challenge is for it to become part of the mainstream way of doing business.<\/p><p> In terms of consultation with people with disabilities, often an assumption can be made that the designers will know best, that they know what they are doing when they are proposing accessible design.  In our experience, that has not necessarily been the case.  When the end user is involved much of the discussion would deliver a change to an initial design to a design that meets the requirements of the people who will use it.  There was one example this week in which my colleague, Vijoy Chakraborty, was involved.  The National Rehabilitation Hospital will be rebuilt and planning permission has been approved or is in the process of being approved.  One might think that all the experts would know about the design but they have set up a consultation group which involves the Irish Wheelchair Association, DeafHear and the National Council for the Blind as well as staff, users of the hospital, the designers and the developers.  That is the process and those consultation meetings will happen over a period of time.  The process takes in the experience and guidance of the user of the hospital and the various organisations representing people with disabilities, and it will eventually deliver a very good quality hospital design.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400014#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Dolores Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417692300,"counter":730,"content":"<p>Senator van Turnhout raised the question of whether the witnesses have had any consultation with the national children's hospital regarding its design.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120400015#O00200","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417692300,"counter":731,"content":"<p>Not at this stage, but we have made our services available.
