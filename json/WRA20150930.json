A request for tenders (RFT) was then issued on 12 December 2013.  The RFT and the PIN were issued on both the Government etenders website and on the website of the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU).  The closing date for receipt of tenders was 28 February 2014.  All tenders received in response to the RFT were evaluated on the basis of the detailed criteria and according to the marking scheme set out in the RFT documentation which is available on the department&rsquo;s website at .  As part of its development of the JobPath approach the Department held a number of consultation and information events and documentation from these events is also available on the Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>Tenders submitted as part of this public procurement process were submitted, in accordance with procurement norms, on a confidential basis.  The department disclosed the names of the successful bidders in its contract award notice which was issued on 9 July 2015 (the contracts having been concluded on 5 June 2015).  Turas Nua Limited and Seetec Limited were selected following the completion of the public procurement process.<\/p><p>JobPath is not singled out for funding from the European Union Social Funding\/Horizon 2014-2020 fund and neither is the Local Employment Service (LES).  There are no plans at present to request EU funding in respect of either JobPath or the LES.<\/p><p>The services to be provided under JobPath are in addition to, not a substitute for, the services provided directly by the department and those currently delivered by companies contracted for the provision of the LES.<\/p><p>JobPath is being delivered through a payment by results model and all initial costs are borne by the contractors.  JobPath is so structured that the contractors cannot recover their costs or make a profit unless and until they get jobseekers into sustainable jobs, of at least thirty hours per week.  Contractors will be paid via a combination of registration fees and job sustainment fees.  A registration fee may be claimed only when a jobseeker has developed a personal progression plan and job sustainment fees will only be paid for each 13 week period of sustained employment, up to a maximum of 52 weeks (i.e. 4 payments).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000071#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Conservation Grant","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000072#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[33031\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000072#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide an update on her Department's administration of the water conservation grant; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>The Department of Social Protection, on behalf of the Department of Environment, Community, and Local Government (DECLG), is paying the &euro;100 per annum Water Conservation Grant to households (primary dwellings) which registered their principal private residence with Irish Water by 30th June 2015.  1.3 million registrations were made by the deadline and Irish Water has transferred a file of registered households to this Department.<\/p><p>All of those registered households on that file will receive a letter by the end of September 2015, inviting them to apply for the Water Conservation Grant.

The report culminated in recommendations which involve measures to introduce clarity and consistency across the various pension products, increase consumer understanding and provide a better result for the consumer.  Since publication, a range of measures have been taken to deliver on the report&rsquo;s recommendations and work is ongoing in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  For example, as recommended in the report, the Central Bank has undertaken a number of themed reviews aimed at ensuring implementation of the requirements of the Consumer Protection Code.  This includes a review of annual pension statements to confirm that information on charges is being provided in a way that seeks to inform the customer.  The review found that the vast majority of firms were in compliance with the code.  Where the Bank identified a small number of firms where the format of annual statements was not as required, those concerned were required to submit implementation timelines for full compliance.    <\/p>  <p>  The report also recommended that specific actions should be taken to improve trustees&rsquo; knowledge and awareness of pension charges.  In this regard, the Pension&rsquo;s Authority has updated its trustee training material and information on its website on pension charges for scheme trustees and consumers.  The Authority has also recently released a new edition of the Trustee Handbook which includes dedicated information of fees and charges and trustee obligations in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  In parallel, my Department is involved in complementary EU negotiations on a review of the IORPs (Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision) Directive which lays down basic requirements for occupational pensions.  It is anticipated that final provisions will result in improved consistency of information to scheme members in pension benefit statements including transparency of charges. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 the Pensions Board was restructured into the Pensions Authority and the Pensions Council.  The role of the new Pensions Council is to provide advice on pensions and to give a much stronger prominence to consumer concerns.

In 2014, some 1,550 employees were being supported through this programme at a cost of &euro;12.6 million.    <\/p>  <p>  The EmployAbility programme is a national employment service dedicated to improving employment outcomes for job seekers with a disability.  EmployAbility participants are people with a disability who are able to work a minimum of 8 hours per week and who need the support of a job coach to obtain employment in the open labour market.  In December 2014, some 2,936 people were availing of the service, and the cost of the service in 2014 was &euro;8.5 million. <\/p>  <p>  The employment support programme for people with disabilities provides various labour market supports for people with disabilities, assisting them with finding paid employment or preparing them for employment through a training or employment programme.

From a peak of 31.2% in June 2012, the seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate has fallen to 20.7% as of August, reflecting the impact of government policy and the overall improvement in the labour market.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by unemployed jobseekers and, in accordance with the EU Council Recommendation for a Youth Guarantee, by young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee implementation plan.<\/p>  <p>  As Ireland already had many of the recommended component parts of a Youth Guarantee under services such as Intreo, Youthreach, VTOS, PLC programmes and JobBridge the main plank in Ireland is to prioritise access to these existing supports for young people, who become unemployed, with the objective of ensuring that they have an opportunity for employment, further education or work experience within the recommended period of four months as per the EU council recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard our first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs. Accordingly operating processes are being refined in each of our regions to prioritise the early engagement of young people through Intreo to ensure that all young people receive expert advice and have access to progression options. In addition as part of our commitment to engage with 100,000 long-term unemployed people through the Intreo\/JobPath process during 2015 we are prioritising engagement with the c 25,000 young people who are already long term unemployed. In implementing these processes DSP making extensive use of the services of Local Employment Services and Job Clubs.<\/p>  <p>  For those who do not find employment through the process just described, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes. Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s. Overall, over 23,300 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  In addition we have recently introduced new programmes specifically for young people including JobsPlus youth &ndash; an employment subsidy for unemployed people under 25 years of age which is payable after four months of unemployment, and First Steps &ndash; a work experience programme for very disadvantaged young people. It should be noted that some of the initiatives planned under the Guarantee required primary legislation to allow positive discrimination on age grounds in the provision of employment services and supports.<\/p>  <p>  Given the recent introduction of changes systemised data is not readily available on employment outcomes on all programmes specifically for those jobseekers under 25. However, some indicative figures are available. For example,<\/p>  <p>- a follow-up survey, published by SOLAS in 2013 of F&Aacute;S Trainees who exited training in May\/June 2012, found that 36% of full-time trainees under 25 had gained employment.<\/p>  <p>- An Indecon report surveyed JobBridge interns who had finished their internships by end August 2012. The survey indicated that 39% of young participants progressed into employment immediately on completion of the internship and that the proportion in employment rose to about 60% five months after completion. Analysis of administrative data on those under 25 who have completed a JobBridge internship more recently shows a similar progression rate to employment immediately on completion of the internship, at 37%.<\/p>  <p>- JobsPlus provides subsidies to employers for the full-time employment of those formerly long-term unemployed on the Live Register. Currently there are 4,901 participants benefitting from JobsPlus, 664 (13.5%) of whom are under 25. It is too early to know what might be the employment outcomes once the JobsPlus subsidy expires.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has initiated an extensive impact evaluation programme which will assess, using counterfactual econometric methods, the impacts of programmes and processes on employment outcomes. This will include the longer-term employment outcomes for young jobseekers under 25.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000075#WRH01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000075#WRH01250"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[33591\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000075#WRH01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when an application for disability allowance will be finalised for a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1087","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":160,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department is in receipt of an application for disability allowance from the above named person on 10 September 2015.

ESRI research has showed that, unlike the position in other countries, income inequality has fallen in Ireland in recent years, largely because of the overall maintenance of the welfare system. <\/p><p>Social transfers play a crucial role in redistributing resources to those most in need. In 2013 (the most recent data available), social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of poverty rate from 38.4 per cent to 15.2 per cent, thereby lifting almost a quarter of the Irish population out of income poverty. This represents a poverty reduction effect of 60.4%. Ireland is the best performing EU country in reducing poverty through social transfers (excluding pensions).<\/p><p>Social impact assessment is an evidence-based methodology to estimate the likely distributive effects of policy proposals on poverty and social inequality, including the impact on family types, life cycle groups and gender. <\/p><p>The Department published integrated social impact assessments of Budgets 2013, 2014 and 2015 (using the ESRI SWITCH model) which included the main welfare and tax measures. The analysis for 2015 found that, for the first time since the recession, budgetary policy resulted in an increase in average household incomes of 0.7 per cent (equivalent of &euro;6 per week). The distributive impact varied according to the component measures. Welfare increases favoured lower income households, while tax reductions were more beneficial to middle and higher income groups. <\/p><p>One of the key objectives of Budget 2015 was to assist unemployed families to return to work.  <\/p><p>I introduced the new Back to Work Family Dividend scheme, which enables long-term unemployed jobseekers with children who leave welfare to return to work to retain the child-related portion of their social welfare payment on a tapered basis over two years.  This includes One Parent Family Payment recipients who similarly go back into the workforce.  <\/p><p>The Dividend will help increase the pace of the progress we are making in helping people back to work, thereby reducing poverty.  It will help boost the recovery, reduce welfare expenditure in the long-run, and, most importantly, help the families in question to build a better financial future for themselves. <\/p><p>The Budget also provided for the expansion of JobsPlus to provide subsidies to employers to recruit and employ an additional 3,000 long-term unemployed jobseekers.  This scheme has proven to be particularly successful with the longer-term unemployed (i.e. unemployed for more than two years.)<\/p><p>I was also pleased to be in the position to increase Child Benefit from &euro;130 to &euro;135 per month, which will benefit over 611,000 households with children. This helps all families with children but also has the additional benefit for unemployed families in that it is work neutral as it is retained in full when they return to the workforce.<\/p><p>I also announced a number of welfare initiatives which would benefit pensioners, carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of a welfare payment. These initiatives included the re-introduction of a Christmas Bonus and an increase in the Living Alone Allowance.<\/p><p>The Christmas Bonus was abolished by the previous Government in 2009. I was pleased to be in the position to partially restore the Bonus last year. A bonus of 25% was paid in the first week of December to long-term welfare recipients including all pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and long-term jobseekers at a cost of &euro;65 million in recognition of the position of vulnerable households.<\/p><p>I also increased the Living Alone Allowance by &euro;1.30 per week from January, bringing the rate up from &euro;7.70 to &euro;9 for pensioners and people with disabilities.  The Living Alone Allowance is a payment made to pensioners and people with disabilities who live alone and was last increased in 1996. <\/p><p>Looking ahead to Budget 2016, the Government&rsquo;s Spring Statement, published last April, stated that<i>&ldquo;On the basis of present estimates, Budget 2016 will include a package within the range of &euro;1.2 billion to &euro;1.5 billion, to invest in services, support employment and boost growth potential while still maintaining fiscal prudence.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>The Government has decided that this &lsquo;fiscal space&rsquo; will be split evenly between taxes and expenditure.  The expenditure component, of up to &euro;750 million, will have to address public sector pay demands, as well as capital and current expenditure. It is within this context that deliberations for Budget 2016 will be considered.<\/p><p>I held my annual Pre-Budget Forum on 3 July, during which I listened to the views and recommendations of almost 40 community and voluntary groups in relation to the their priorities for the upcoming Budget. The National Economic Dialogue held later that month was also a valuable contribution to the overall budgetary process. The scale and composition of the 2016 DSP Budget package is currently under consideration and will be announced on October 13.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000077#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payments","counter":190,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000077#WRK00450"},{"type":"question","counter":191,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[33633\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000077#WRK00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent, if any, to which she is aware of any hardship to lone parents, arising from changes in the one-parent family payment, with particular reference to situations where the payment subsequently fell short of the previous entitlement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":192,"content":"<p>The primary goal of the reform to the one-parent family payment scheme is to maximise the opportunities for lone parents to enter into and increase employment by providing them with enhanced access to the wide range of education, training and employment supports that make up the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services.<\/p><p>Of the 25,500 customers exited the one-parent family payment scheme on 2 July, 2015, approximately 12,000 incurred no change in their income.<\/p><p>Approximately 2,400 were new family income supplement recipients and saw an increase in their income.

Earlier this year it held two smaller events in Belfast, while next February it will hold \"Surge\" for the first time in India.  This Irish company continues to operate from their headquarters in Dublin where they employ 130 people.<\/p>  <p>  The number of people attending the event each year has increased rapidly and last year 22,000 people attended the event. It is predicted that this year&rsquo;s Web Summit at the RDS in November will have approximately 30,000 attendees, with 2,000 start-ups, 1,000 leading investors and 650 speakers due to take part.<\/p>  <p>  In preparation for Web Summit 2015, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland engaged with other governmental stakeholders to discuss a number of issues raised by the Web Summit team.  These issues centred on Dublin city services, infrastructure (broadband\/Wi-Fi, public transport and accommodation) and the availability of a suitable conference venue of scale.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, the decision to move the Web Summit event in 2016 to another location is a commercial decision by the organisers.  Both IDA and Enterprise Ireland have enjoyed working with the Web Summit and look forward to continuing their relationship in the future both at home and abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000081#WRO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":275,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000081#WRO00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Feedstuffs","counter":274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000081#WRO00500"},{"type":"question","counter":275,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[33463\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000081#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the procedures in place to deal with complaints from farmers regarding the nutritional value of animal feedstuffs purchased and whether his Department will initiate legal action in the event of breaches of the minimum nutritional value of such feedstuffs.","asker":"1083","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":276,"content":"<p>The EU Regulation (EC) No 767\/2009 on the placing on the market and use of feed requires that manufacturers of feed ensure that the product is sound, genuine, unadulterated, fit for purpose and of merchantable quality.

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.

Specifically, the Government will provide &euro;399m in operating subvention to Irish Water in 2015 and &euro;479m in 2016.  This subvention will be paid in respect of the child allowance of 21,000 litres per child per annum, a product subsidy and the capping of domestic water charges at the rates set out in the Water Services Act 2014.<table><tr><th><\/th><th>2015 <\/th><th>2016 <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Domestic Billed Income <\/td><td>271 <\/td><td>274 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Government subvention excluding working capital loan to Irish Water <\/td><td>399 <\/td><td>479 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000089#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Rates","counter":447,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000089#WRW00800"},{"type":"question","counter":448,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[33603\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000089#WRW00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he or his officials have assessed the impact of the small business rate relief scheme in Northern Ireland; if consideration has been given to introducing a similar scheme here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1206","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":449,"content":"<p>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the Small Business Rate Relief Scheme in Northern Ireland.  Within this jurisdiction, the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970 provides for the operation of rates waiver schemes.  Under the provisions, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme providing for a waiver of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property.  The formulation of such a scheme is a matter reserved for the members of the relevant local authority and is subject to my consent as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. <\/p>  <p>  I would consider carefully any application received for a rate waiver scheme.  In considering any such application, it has to be borne in mind that a waiver of rates for one class of ratepayer could unfairly impact on other businesses in the area by giving a competitive advantage to a certain group through a reduction in costs.  As such, it would be necessary to consider State Aid rules in relation to the provision of any such relief. <\/p>  <p>  Recent developments have seen some local authorities introduce locally designed business incentive schemes which promote the use of vacant commercial property.  Such schemes rely upon Part 9 of the Local Government Act 2001 which provides that the functions of local authorities include providing grants, loans guarantees or other financial aid to promote the interests of the local community, including economic interests.  Unlike rates waiver schemes, no Ministerial sanction is required for the setting up of these schemes. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the continued need to restrain the costs on businesses.  My Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting, and where possible to reduce, ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard.  The national average ARV decreased each year from 2010 to 2014; 2015 is not directly comparable due to the local authority mergers and the necessity to harmonise rates across new local authority areas. <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review, and am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000089#WRW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000089#WRW01100"},{"type":"question","counter":451,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[33460\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015093000089#WRW01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the cost of restoring all cuts in central Exchequer funding to local authorities since 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":452,"content":"<p>Central Government funding to local authorities presents a complex picture, with allocations coming from a range of Departments and Offices for a variety of purposes.
