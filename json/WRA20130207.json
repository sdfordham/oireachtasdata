T  he EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy forms an integral part of the Union&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy. In the area of Common Security and Defence Policy, the role of the Presidency is now limited to supporting the High Representative and the European External Action Service in this regard.  However, that said, this arrangement provides Ireland with an opportunity to influence the Common Security and Defence Policy agenda. <\/p><p>  As part of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Council 2013 I have prioritised a number of areas that I would like to progress during our Presidency.  These priorities are:<\/p><p>1. Preparations for the European Council in December 2013, which will include a thematic discussion on security and defence\/military capabilities.<\/p><p>2. Continued development of the Common Security and Defence Policy and the Comprehensive approach to crisis management.<\/p><p>3. Addressing the impact of the Financial Crisis on Defence, including collaboration in the provision of Defence capabilities (Pooling and Sharing).   <\/p><p>4. Support for current and future Common Security and Defence Policy Operations. <\/p><p>5. Enhancing EU\/UN Relations, in particular, through EU engagement and participation in UN Peacekeeping;<\/p><p>6. EU cooperation in the area of Maritime Security and Surveillance with a particular focus on improving cooperation between EU Navies and other EU security actors and leveraging innovation through security sector research and development;  <\/p><p>7. Development of capabilities in support of Common Security and Defence Policy and Freedom, Security and Justice through enhanced cooperation between the European Defence Agency and the European Commission in the field of research and innovation in the security sector.<\/p><p>8. Support for Jobs, Growth and Innovation through focusing on the role of SMEs in fostering innovation in the security sector.<\/p><p>Also, in response to external developments, other issues may arise which warrant detailed discussion and decisions to be taken.<\/p><p>  In summary, the topics discussed during our Presidency will centre on how Ireland and the Union as a whole can contribute to the enhancement of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy, a critical component of the EU&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy, which is central to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy objectives. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700040#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Green Paper on Defence","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700040#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[6080\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700040#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will outline the details of what is contained in the Green Paper on the Future of Ireland's Defence Policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[6125\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700040#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the date on which the Green Paper on Defence will be published.","asker":"1022","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[6081\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700040#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will outline the details of what is contained in the Green Paper on the Future of Ireland's Defence Policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1094","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 37 and 42 together.<\/p><p><b><\/b> I am of the view that the preparation for a new White Paper on Defence will benefit greatly from an informed and wide-ranging debate on Ireland&#8217;s defence policy.

This support continues to take place within the framework of the EU's comprehensive engagement in Somalia, with a view to responding to the priority needs of the Somali people and its new Government and to stabilizing Somalia.

The Equitation School has discharged this task with considerable distinction down through the years and, through its participation and numerous successes in equitation events at home and abroad, it has successfully promoted the qualities of the Irish horse.  Army riders competing on Irish bred horses provide an instantly recognisable symbol of Ireland at prestigious international events. In addition to its competition activity, the Equitation School continues to support the Irish horse industry and it encourages breeders and producers, who may have horses suitable for top-level competition, to have them assessed by the School with a view to their purchase or lease.

A Battlegroup is a standard technical military term and it consists of about 1,500 personnel.The purpose of a battlegroup is to undertake operations (commonly referred to as the Petersberg Tasks which are set out in the Amsterdam Treaty) such as rescue tasks, peacemaking, peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks.Ireland participated in order to enhance both our own military capabilities and our inter-operability with other Member States&rsquo; Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  Our contribution was a Reconnaissance Company.If the Battlegroup had been deployed, Ireland&rsquo;s contribution would have amounted to approximately 175 personnel.During the standby period, one officer was deployed to the Battlegroup Headquarters in Ulm, Germany for training and planning activities. <\/p><p>The costs of equipment and additional training for participation in the Battlegroup was marginal.The capabilities and equipment in respect of Ireland's contributions to the Battlegroups already resided within the Defence Forces.Training of Irish troops for the Austro-German Battlegroup took place in Ireland and no joint field exercises or manoeuvre training took place.There were no specific additional costs arising in association with the preparation and standby period.<\/p><p>  In relation to the Nordic Battlegroup, Ireland has been invited to participate and discussions are at a very early stage.The second Force Generation Conference was held in Sweden in early December 2012.

The advantage of this approach is that the professionals, who deal with a particular sector on a daily basis, can bring their skills and expertise to bear and can quickly identify who is best placed to provide support in an emergency situation. At a national level, the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, which I Chair, provides strategic direction and coordination of emergency planning. <\/p><p>  The Government Task Force was established after the 9\/11 attacks and is comprised of Ministers and\/or senior officials from all Government Departments and key public bodies. It meets on a regular basis, the most recent meeting was held on 17 December 2012 and the next meeting is scheduled for 18 February 2013. <\/p><p>  The Government Task Force provides a forum for keeping emergency planning high on the agenda of all Government Departments and it examines crosscutting issues that impact across Government. It is a forum for sharing of information and, from time to time, experts are invited to make presentations to the Task Force on any emerging emergency planning issues.<\/p><p>  The Government Task Force meeting held on 9 November 2012 focussed on winter preparedness. After that meeting, together with my colleague Leo Varadkar T.D., Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, we both launched the 'Be Winter-Ready' information campaign for 2012-2013. <\/p><p>The purpose of this campaign is to provide timely information to the public on how to prepare for winter with the advice being delivered via Aertel pages, booklets and through the &ldquo;Be Winter-Ready&rdquo; website www.winterready.ie  .<\/p><p>  In December 2008 the Roles and Responsibilities in Emergency Planning was approved, which identified the lead Department and the supporting Departments and Agencies responsible for over 40 separate emergency scenarios. As part of this process, national guidelines for coordinating a national level emergency\/crisis response were put in place, which outline how a National Coordination Group is convened under the lead Government Department given that responsibility.   To illustrate this, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is designated the lead Department in coordinating the national level response to severe weather emergencies and during recent severe weather events, chaired meetings of the Severe Weather National Coordination Group, which included senior representatives from Government Departments, the Defence Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Met Eireann, the National Roads Authority and other State Agencies. <\/p><p>  This National Coordination Group examines all of the issues arising from severe weather events and provides a forum for sharing of information and helps to bring about a coordinated &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; national response in such circumstances. The Group has met a number of times in 2012, particularly during the flooding in June 2012 that affected Cork and in early December 2012 in anticipation of a severe cold spell and possible heavy snowfall. The National Emergency Coordination Centre also provides support when the National Coordination Group is activated in response to a specific crisis\/emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700041#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":56,"content":"<p>Question No. 30 answered with Question No. 9.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":57,"content":"<p>Question No. 31 answered with Question No. 26.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Missions","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700041#WRB01850"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[6127\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700041#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will commit to protecting the triple-lock mechanism.","asker":"984","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>In accordance with the provisions of the White Paper on Defence 2000, the Government is committed to maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to international peace support operations through the deployment of Defence Forces personnel on UN mandated peace support operations.

It is the firm policy of the Government that depleted uranium munitions will never be used by the Defence Forces.   Ireland has voted in favour of the four resolutions on depleted uranium taken at the United Nations General Assembly since 2007, most recently in December 2012 when General Assembly Resolution 67\/36 was supported by 155 States. These resolutions requested the UN Secretary-General to seek the views of member States and relevant international organisations on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium. <\/p><p>  Research carried out to date by the relevant international organisations, including by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), has concluded that depleted uranium does not pose a significant radiological risk.

This confirmed that, while there is no practical method of testing people who may have been exposed to depleted uranium, thorough medical examinations are carried out on all Defence Forces personnel returning from deployment overseas.  These include tests intended to detect signs of those disease processes most likely to arise in cases of contamination with depleted uranium.  To date, no evidence of an unusual incidence of disease has been found. <\/p><p>  At present, there is no international framework or treaty relating to depleted uranium munitions and, consequently, no internationally agreed definition or prohibition.  To achieve the political momentum required for implementing an international ban, a necessary condition would be to establish conclusively the negative impact of depleted uranium on human health and on the environment. <\/p><p>  The Government supports further study and research by relevant international organisations and the scientific community and is not currently considering the introduction of legislation on depleted uranium weapons.

Where neither of those pensions is payable, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable in most public service pension schemes to bridge the gap.<\/p><p><br \/>  One of the conditions for payment of a supplementary pension is that the pensioner, through no fault of their own, does not qualify for Social Welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate.  It is therefore necessary to claim any available Social Welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700042#WRC02600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700042#WRC02650"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[6427\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700042#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider transporting elements of the Nuclear Weapons (Prohibitions of Investments) Bill 2012 into one of the forthcoming Finance Acts thereby prohibiting investment of public moneys in companies that are involved in the manufacture of nuclear weapons, their components or delivery systems and compelling the National Pension Reserve Fund to divest circa &euro;10 million of public money that the fund currently has invested in such companies.","asker":"1034","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":117,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government announced the establishment of the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) in September 2011.

The Government agreed with the recommendation of the Inter-Departmental Expert Group on the Design of a property tax (the &ldquo;Thornhill group&rdquo;) that the Local Property Tax should be centered on the principles of equity, transparency and simplicity. In terms of these principles, it was also considered that a universal liability should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions, in order to keep the rate of the tax as low as was possible.   In making its recommendations for exemptions and for deferrals of Local Property Tax (LPT), the Thornhill group had regard to the following criteria:<\/p><p>  -\tAbility to pay<\/p><p>  -\tReliefs create costs which have to be paid for, either by taxpayers who do not benefit from the relief, or by reductions in public expenditure<\/p><p>  -\tReliefs should be designed to address clear economic and social policy needs<\/p><p>  -\tCare needs to be taken in designing relief to ensure they are targeted based on need, and there are not unintended and inequitably distributed gains<\/p><p>  -\tThe Local Property Tax is intended to be a tax on the benefit from ownership of a residential property<\/p><p>  -\tSuch residential properties have monetary and non-monetary values which are independent of incomes<\/p><p>  -\tAnd that the Local Property Tax is not assessed on incomes.<\/p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 contains provisions for deferrals for individuals whose income is under certain limits.  These provisions are targeted at cases of need, and have reference to income stressed home owners, allowing enhanced deferrals where there is low income and liability to mortgage interest.  <\/p><p>  Part 12 of the Act sets out the conditions for deferral of the charge.  Where the residential property is the sole or main residence of a liable person and their estimated gross income from all sources does not exceed &euro;15,000 for a single person, or &euro;25,000 for a couple, during the year covered by the return, they will be eligible to apply for full deferral of the LPT charge.  <\/p><p>  In addition, for income stressed owner-occupiers who have an outstanding mortgage, an adjusted gross income limit will apply.  In these cases, the income thresholds of &euro;15,000 or &euro;25,000 may be increased by 80% of the annual mortgage interest payments.  This type of deferral is available until the end of 2017.<\/p><p>  Owner-occupiers may be eligible to apply for partial deferral where the gross income from all sources is less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple.  For income stressed owner-occupiers who have an outstanding mortgage, these thresholds may also be increased by 80% of the annual mortgage interest payments.  In these cases the owner-occupier will qualify for deferrals of 50% of the LPT liability and the balance of 50% of the tax must be paid. <\/p><p>  Deferrals of LPT will attract an interest charge of 4%, simple interest, which is half of the Revenue default rate.  Any amount deferred will be a relatively small part of the overall value of the property, even where the deferral lasts for a number of years.  <\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners will be responsible for the administration of the Local Property Tax and will be issuing guidelines to homeowners in the near future, including details of how to claim a deferral of the tax.<\/p><p>  In order to facilitate liable persons and assist with budgeting for payment of the new tax, a range of payment options will be available to pay LPT, including the option to pay LPT in equal instalments.  Such instalment payments can be made by way of deduction at source from employment or occupational pension income or from certain payments from the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

Teaching is fulfilling work which makes a huge social contribution. Following the Report of the Primary Education Committee, 'Males into Primary Teaching' in 2005, a coordinated promotion campaign to encourage boys as well as girls to enter primary teaching was undertaken. This campaign promoted the rewards of being a teacher such as the value to society, work\/life balance, career satisfaction, diversity of skills, professional development, conditions of employment and job security.  One of the key functions of the Teaching Council is to promote teaching as a profession.  It uses a variety of methods including promoting the Codes of Professional Conduct for Teachers, career exhibitions and the development of a website as an online resource for guidance counselors, careers officers and those who may be considering teaching as a profession.  The Teaching Council also produced a DVD, entitled Cro&iacute; na M&uacute;inteoireachta which celebrates the quality of teaching in Ireland and affirms the valuable role that teachers play in enabling learners to reach their potential and in preparing young people for life.

The appeals process <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">has a statutory basis in both primary and secondary legislation and Appeals Officers are quasi-judicial officers and are required to be free and unrestricted in discharging their functions. As far back as 1958, the Supreme Court found that Appeals Officers are required to free and unrestricted in the performance of their duties. The high level of appeals allowed <\/font>(54% in 2012<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">) is evidence of the indep<\/font>  endence of the process.  There are no plans to take legislative steps to change the method by which Appeals Officers are appointed.<\/p><p><br \/>  The report also criticises the delays being experienced by appellants. There was a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals from 2009 to date which has placed extraordinary pressure on the SWAO. Significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, improving business processes and implementing a new operating model.  <\/p><p><br \/>  As a result of these measures, there has been significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from an average of 13,500 to 32,558 in 2012 and processing times have been reduced by 10.3 weeks overall in 2012 with time for an oral hearing time down by 13 weeks and the time for summary decision up by 2.7 weeks.  Of course, further improvement is needed.   In that regard, -<\/p><p><br \/>  -The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012;<\/p><p><br \/>  -There is a major programme of process redesign and modernisation currently underway in relation to many scheme areas which will reduce backlogs and will also reduce the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals;<\/p><p><br \/>  -It is planned to recruit additional Medical Assessors in 2013 which will assist in reducing the time taken for appeals where a medical assessment is required.<\/p><p><br \/>  All these measures together will reduce the waiting time for appellants.<\/p><p><br \/>  Concern was expressed in the report that the higher number of summary decisions in 2011 indicated a move away from oral hearings. I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that the increases in the number of summary decisions in 2010 and 2011 was a result of having eight very experienced retired appeals officers working exclusively on summary decisions which had the effect of front loading summary decisions. The percentage of summary decisions was 69% in 2010 and 65% in 2011, the two years for which the retired officers were retained, and has since dropped to 60% in 2012.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to consistency and transparency in decision making, this is addressed in a number of ways by the Department through training and communication and in relation specifically to the SWAO it is the statutory responsibility of the Chief Appeals Officer to convene meetings of Appeals Officers for the purpose of ensuring consistency.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Department provides funding to a number of agencies involved in providing advocacy and information services to persons regarding their social welfare rights and how to process its systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700044#WRE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals","counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700044#WRE02950"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[6473\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700044#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will review the refusal of carer's allowance\/benefit in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":239,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s benefit from the person in question on the 13th March, 2012.

The Department has co-funded these grants for local authority anti-litter awareness and education initiatives since 1997. Local Authorities are responsible for selecting suitable projects for funding and deciding on individual grant allocations. The scheme requires that projects selected should promote greater public awareness and education in relation to litter, and since 2008, graffiti. They should also, where possible, focus on voluntary initiatives by community and environmental groups and involve schools and young people in anti-litter and anti-graffiti action. Typically, eligible projects include local media campaigns, clean-ups, primary\/secondary school competitions, exhibitions and the production of videos, posters and leaflets. The maximum grant for a project may be up to 70% of the cost, with the balance being met by local contributions.   <\/p><p>A total of &#8364;1,100,000 was made available to fund suitable projects under the scheme in 2011, while &#8364;1,000,000 was made available during 2012.

Advertisements under this campaign appeared in national, regional and local newspapers and magazines over the course of the peak summer period, also providing information on how to report illegal dumping activity to the Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s lo-call number 1850 365 121. The total cost incurred by my Department in relation to this campaign was less than &#8364;1,000 - these costs were associated with the professional costs of producing and sizing the advertisements. <\/p><p>In addition, National Spring Clean (NSC), run by An Taisce and co-financed by my Department, is a multi-sectoral initiative that promotes public awareness and participation in local litter clean-ups and awareness actions to improve the local environment.\u00a0 The campaign, which includes a central role for local authorities to co-ordinate and assist events at local level, is traditionally run annually throughout the month of April. Volunteers are equipped with free materials donated by NSC sponsors and the collected litter is recycled or disposed of in partnership with local authorities.

There was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government was strongly of the view that payment of compensation to landlords in such circumstances could not be justified in the current economic climate.  The Government has no plans to re-examine the decision not to proceed with such legislation at this time.<\/p><p>  Although legislative intervention may not be feasible, NAMA is playing a role in dealing with problems caused by upward only rent reviews applying to NAMA properties.  I have been advised that, by the end of 2012, the Agency had granted 212 applications for rent abatement with an aggregate annual value of &euro;13.5 million. A further 56 applications are currently under review. Of the 276 eligible applications received to date only 8 have been refused representing a 97% approval rate by NAMA.<\/p><p>  I would also mention that the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a Commercial Leases Database by the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  This Database will assist in providing readily accessible, accurate information in order to determine the market rent payable in respect of comparable commercial properties.  Work is underway to ensure that the Database will be operational at an early date.<\/p><p>  Finally, I wish to highlight the existence of a rent review arbitration code which was drawn up by a group of experts whose membership was drawn from all stakeholders in the commercial property arena.  The code, which can be found on www.justice.ie, provides a mechanism to deal with the resolution of rent review disputes in the commercial property sector.  The effectiveness of the Code and the extent to which it is utilised by stakeholders will be reviewed and assessed over the next coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700046#WRG00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport","counter":312,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700046#WRG00850"},{"type":"question","counter":313,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[6456\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700046#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will outline on a county basis the amount of money invested by his Department to purchase Garda vehicles in 2012 and to date in 2013; the number of vehicles that were purchased; if he will outline the equipment and technology those vehicles are equipped with; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":314,"content":"<p>Decisions in relation to the provision of Garda vehicles are a matter, in the first instance, for the Garda Commissioner in the context of his identified operational requirements and in the light of available resources.

Secondly, even where a will was registered, such registration would not guarantee the validity of the will if the statutory requirements in relation to signature, witnesses etc. had not been complied with, or if the will had been made under conditions of duress or undue influence. Moreover, there could be no guarantee that a registered will was in fact the final will of the testator concerned.

Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members, including that of a streamlined, single application procedure and that of an appropriate appeals procedure. This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na puts a particular emphasis on tacking sexual crime and crime against children as well as  pro-active cooperation with all relevant Departments, organisations and agencies to improve the safety of children. A comprehensive policy document on the investigation of sexual crimes against children and child welfare was developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with Children First National Guidance 2011 adopted as Garda policy.  Interaction with the HSE and Children and Family Services is an integral part of that policy in relation to all investigations of child abuse.  I am advised that a strategic committee has been established within an An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, chaired at Assistant Commissioner level, to liaise with the HSE's National Director of Children and Family Services, to ensure that all matters of strategy and policy in the field of inter-agency working receive proper direction.<\/p><p>  A Sexual Crime Management Unit has also been established within the Garda Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit, which is part of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  The Unit is responsible for evaluating and monitoring the number of investigations each year into child sexual abuse, child neglect and other sexual offences, to ensure that they are receiving appropriate attention, advising on the investigation of such crimes and promoting best investigative practice.  The unit interacts, as appropriate, with contact points in relevant agencies in relation to complaints of sexual abuse made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   I am also assured that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and HSE personnel have undergone joint and intensive training in the specialised skills necessary for interviewing children.  The Garda College, in conjunction with HSE colleagues, is constantly reviewing the training to ensure it is accordance with best international practice.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, given the need for sensitivity and confidentiality surrounding sexual crimes, there is a clear advantage from an investigative perspective both for the victims and for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conducting relevant interviews away from Garda stations.  A network of dedicated interview suites has been established by my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in six strategically chosen locations throughout the State which are used by the Garda authorities to record interviews with such victims. The roll out and utilisation of these interview suites is a huge step forward in terms of how child victims of sexual and violent abuse are dealt with by the criminal justice system. The Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime is an independent body which operates under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is allocated an annual budget from the Department to provide funding for services and supports to victims of crime.  In 2012, it allocated &euro;138,070 to 4 non-governmental organisations who work in the Sexual Violence sector.  Funding was granted primarily towards the provision of an accompaniment service for victims of sexual violence attending interviews with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and attending court.  It also allocated &euro;14,000 to CARI (Children at Risk in Ireland) towards the provision of their court support and accompaniment service for children, especially but not exclusively children who are sexually abused. is service also supports non-abusing parents of these children.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that judges are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters, concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  is also includes the allocation of the business of the courts, scheduling of cases and management of lists which are matters for the judiciary and in particular the Presidents of the courts. In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.<\/p><p>  There are a small number of situations where statute has created exceptions to this approach most notably by providing for mandatory sentences for murder and presumptive minimum sentences in the case of certain firearms and drug trafficking offences.  Except for exceptional circumstances, I am of the view that the Oireachtas should be cautious in prescribing mandatory sentences.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.  The Law Reform Commission is currently examining the law in relation to mandatory sentences and I understand this work will be completed this year.  The Deputy may be aware that the Law Reform Commission, after detailed study some years ago, recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines but favoured non-statutory sentencing principles. <\/p><p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  Information on over 1,000 cases is detailed on the website and the Committee recently announced that it is shortly to recommence populating the online database with information on sentencing in the criminal courts.  The Deputy may be aware that the ISIS committee also announced they are planning to recommence providing information on sentencing in relation to specific issues in which context an analysis has been published on rape sentencing prepared by the Judicial Researchers Office under the guidance of Mr. Justice Peter Charleton.  I understand that seminars are also planned, including one focusing on the work of the Sentencing Council in the UK. Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, in September 2012, I announced a strategic review of penal policy. I have established a working group to carry out this review which will examine all aspects of penal policy and I expect the Group to report later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700047#WRH01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700047#WRH01150"},{"type":"question","counter":377,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[6576\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700047#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason the Garda Armed Response Unit has been patrolling Dundalk town, County Louth, and suburbs for the past six months or so; his views on the appropriateness of such patrols by the Armed Response Unit; the reason such patrols are not carried out by the Garda&iacute; stationed in Dundalk; if the Armed Response Unit are briefed on community affairs and if they have the same knowledge of community issues as the regular Garda&iacute; stationed in this town; his views on whether this deployment should be reviewed; the way the decision to have the Armed Response Unit patrol Dundalk was arrived at; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":378,"content":"<p>The deployment of Garda resources and personnel is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.

This demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the cause of international peace. This continues to be the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations. <\/p><p>  Ireland is currently contributing 437 Defence Forces personnel to 11 different missions throughout the world. Ireland&rsquo;s main deployment is in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 361 personnel, with smaller contributions in Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Afghanistan and EUTM Somalia.  <\/p><p>  As regards future deployment of Defence Forces Personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered. <\/p><p>  Ireland received an invitation from the Operational Commander of Operation EUNAVFOR ATALANTA to contribute an Autonomous Vessel Protection Detachment (AVPD) to the Operation. Currently, EU NAVFOR has received offers from five Member States to provide AVPDs.  As a result, the requirement for additional AVPDs does not arise in the immediate future. However, the potential for the future contribution of an AVPD, by Ireland, is still under active consideration by the Defence Forces.   We have also received an invitation from the UN requesting the deployment of a specialist training team on Conventional Munitions Disposal (CMD), mine and specialist search awareness to support the work of the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) in South Sudan. The request is currently under consideration.<\/p><p>  The EU has also invited Ireland to contribute personnel to the European Union Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali), which was established by the Council of the European Union on 17 January 2013 to provide military training and advice to the Malian Armed Forces. This request is currently under active consideration and an announcement will be made shortly in this regard.<\/p><p>  The Department of Defence constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas.  At this time, it is not anticipated that there will be any major additional deployments of troops to further overseas missions in 2013. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700047#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Expenditure","counter":387,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700047#WRH01950"},{"type":"question","counter":388,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[6538\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700047#WRH02000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he is satisfied regarding the adequacy of the budget for 2013 to meet the full schedule of requirements within the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":389,"content":"<p> The Gross provision for the Vote for Defence for 2013 is &euro;686m.

Whilst my Department&rsquo;s property portfolio is kept under constant review, as I indicated to the House previously there are no plans for further barrack closures. In addition to these installations a number of other smaller properties are used by Reserve Defence Force (RDF) Units throughout the country. As the Deputy is aware a major re-organisation of the Reserve is being implemented and this will result in a new organisational structure for the Army Reserve based on a &ldquo;Single Force&rdquo; concept where Defence Forces Units will have Permanent and Reserve elements. These Units will be based in Permanent Defence Force (PDF) installations throughout the country and in 16 locations outside of those installations. As a result a number of smaller properties currently occupied by the Reserve will be closed and these will be disposed of. In accordance with standard practice my Department will be contacting the various Government Departments and State Agencies to establish if those bodies have an interest in acquiring any of these properties. When my Department has exhausted all possible sales to other State Agencies and Government Departments the remaining properties will be disposed of by public tender\/auction with the proceeds being used to fund the upgrading of Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure. As a result of these closures there will be some small savings on utilities and maintenance but it is not possible to quantify those savings at this stage. However, this new model for the Reserve will offer significant advantages in terms of training, improved interoperability and will enhance the overall capability of the Defence Forces. These changes will reduce direct expenditure on the Reserve by &euro;11 million, whilst maintaining the budget for Reserve training activity.<\/p><p>FULLY OPERATIONAL MILITARY INSTALLATIONS<\/p><p><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Installation<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Kilworth Camp, Kilworth <\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Naval Base, Haulbowline<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Collins Barracks <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>Finner Camp, Bundoran <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel <\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Cathal Brugha Barracks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>McKee Barracks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>St. Bricin&#8217;s Hospital <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>Renmore Barracks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>Defence Forces Training Centre, Curragh Camp<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>Stephens Barracks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>Sarsfield Barracks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>Aiken Barracks, Dundalk<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>Gormanston Camp<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>Custume Barracks, Athlone<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>Glen of Imaal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> -<\/td><td>Kilbride Camp<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700047#WRH02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Recruitment","counter":393,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700047#WRH02350"},{"type":"question","counter":394,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[6540\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700047#WRH02400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which promotional posts are filled or outstanding in the Air Corps; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":395,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[6542\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700047#WRH02500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of positions waiting to be filled in the Naval Service, at all ranks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":396,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[6543\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700047#WRH02600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which if any of the outstanding promotional positions to be filled in the Army, at all ranks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":397,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152, 154 and 155 together.<\/p><p>The following table outlines the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, by Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as at 31 December 2012, the latest date for which figures are available, and the total vacancies, by rank, for Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, based on the total Permanent Defence Force rank establishment of 9,500.<\/p><p>A number of promotions are ongoing within the Permanent Defence Force in order to fill rank vacancies.

This amount, includes &euro;2.5 million in respect of the current UNIFIL mission and &euro;6.4 million in respect of repatriation costs of equipment from the MINURCAT mission in Chad. The amount owing in relation to the MINURCAT mission is the subject of ongoing negotiations with the UN. Ireland is not entitled to any reimbursement in respect of Defence Forces participation in EU-led missions as all troop contributors to such missions are responsible for their own costs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700047#WRH03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Planning","counter":405,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700047#WRH03250"},{"type":"question","counter":406,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[6545\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700047#WRH03300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"his views regarding the ability of the Defence Forces to meet any emerging requirements of an emergency nature in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":407,"content":"<p>   My priority as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible.Emergency planning in this country is structured around the &lsquo;Lead Department&rsquo; principle, which means that the Department that is responsible for an activity in normal conditions will maintain that responsibility in an emergency. There is no one national emergency response plan; however, there are robust processes in place for the inter-agency cooperation at the national, regional and local levels.    Whilst the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency, as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather emergency in its Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role under the multi-agency Framework.  At National level, representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, by both my Department and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency. The Defence Forces are also represented on the eight Regional Working Groups that have been established under the Framework and, on an ongoing basis, designated members of the Defence Forces, based around the country, act as Liaison Officers to Local Authorities.<\/p><p>  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is available for deployments in response to emergencies and crises.

I have emphasised to the HSE the high priority the Government and I attach to this issue.<\/p><p>  In January 2012, a detailed plan for the achievement of compliance by NCHDs with the Working Time Directive was submitted to the EU Commission.  The plan affirmed Ireland's commitment to achieving compliance with the Directive over a three-year time period.  It committed to implementing the measures necessary, including: new work patterns for medical staff, transfer of work undertaken by NCHDs to other grades, and the organisation of hospital services to support compliance.  Compliance with the directive is of benefit to NCHDs and also supports patient safety.    The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address the issue as a priority, stating that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the non-consultant hospital doctor workforce, in line with the Implementation Plan submitted to the Commission in 2012. The HSE is currently finalising its National Operational Plan to support the implementation of the National Service Plan 2013. This will specify in greater detail the actions to be taken during the year in relation to EWTD compliance. A key priority for the HSE in 2013 will be a further reduction of average weekly hours worked and also a reduction in the duration of shifts undertaken.<\/p><p>  S.I. No. 494 of 2004 European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004, which transposed the EU Working Time Directive for doctors in training, provides for:<\/p><p>  - A maximum 48 hour average working week;<\/p><p>  - A 30 minute rest break every 6 hours during period on-site on-call;<\/p><p>  - 11 hours rest every 24 hours or equivalent compensatory rest before return to work; and<\/p><p>  - 35 hours continuous rest per week or twice a fortnight or 59 hours continuous rest per fortnight.<\/p><p>  The 2010 Contract of Employment for NCHDs, which these staff sign on appointment, reflects the above provisions.  The contract also provides that NCHDs shall not be required to work more than 24 consecutive hours on-site.  A related agreement between the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation provides that the contract is subject to the requirements of the Directive.<\/p><p>  As part of the measures agreed between health service management and the consultant representative bodies at the Labour Relations Commission in September 2012, consultants will support the implementation of required revisions to NCHD work patterns and reduction in NCHD working hours to comply with the provisions of the EWTD.  These include ward-based rostering, use of cross cover at SHO level, replacement of NCHD hours by Advanced Nurse\/Midwifery Practitioner hours where appropriate, transfer of certain duties to other staff and other measures set out in Ireland's 2012 Plan to drive EWTD compliance.  <\/p><p>  I want to ensure that NCHDs can progress to consultant level.  However, it is not sustainable, in the light of the State's serious financial difficulties, to continue to recruit at the previous rates.  If we are to continue to provide consultant-level career opportunities for doctors and, subject to the limitations on available resources, to replace consultants who retire and where possible expand overall capacity, this can only happen on the basis of a lower-cost model.<\/p><p>  I have asked the Executive to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the range of hours worked by NCHDs in the public health service and the number of risk assessments that have been carried out in the past two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700049#WRK01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":496,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700049#WRK01450"},{"type":"question","counter":497,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[6375\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020700049#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the number of non consultant hospital doctors in acute\/general hospitals; the number in each category of medical or surgical; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":498,"content":"<p>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.

An acute stroke unit consists of a discrete area of a hospital that exclusively or principally takes care of stroke patients and is adequately staffed by a specialist multidisciplinary team. An acute stroke unit provides high-dependency care including physiological, neurological monitoring and rapid treatment of stroke and associated complications, early rehabilitation and palliative care. Nursing staff in a dedicated stroke unit develop the crucial expertise on appropriate stroke patients assessment, treatment, monitoring &amp; management. Stroke unit care is underpinned by a comprehensive specialist multidisciplinary team including speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, clinical nutrition, social work and clinical psychology. The HSE has established a number of clinical care programmes to improve and standardise patient care throughout the organisation by bringing together clinical disciplines and enabling them to share innovative solutions to deliver greater benefits to every user of HSE services. One of these programmes has been established in the area of stroke care. The National Stroke Programme plan provides for the development of Stroke Units in all acute hospitals currently without units, who admit patients with stroke via the ED, with prioritisation of hospitals with high numbers of stroke admissions annually.
