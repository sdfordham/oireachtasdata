FDII represents 150 companies across meat, dairy, consumer foods and beverages and has consistently called for the introduction of a statutory code to address the unfair trading practices that flow from the imbalance of power between retailers and suppliers.  The supply sector, food companies and producers, which employs approximately one in eight people across the economy, is seeing increasing pressure on margins and escalating costs in retailer supports.  This is leading to reduced product choices, reduced quality, lack of competition and diversity and, ultimately, poorer value for the consumer.<\/p><p>  Examples of unfair trading practices are many and varied but can include retrospective price adjustments, retrospective financing of promotions and other practices that effectively lead to retrospective payments or excessive transfer of risk.  This reality has been acknowledged by the European Commission and the UK Competition Commission.  Other EU member states, including our nearest neighbour, have introduced measures up to and including legislation to combat these negative effects.  We must do so for the sake of the Irish agrifood sector and we must do this by way of a statutory code.  The European Commission continues to look closely at this issue and previous speakers before this committee have cited the European voluntary initiative on business-to-business relations in the food chain as an alternative to the Irish statutory code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013042300003#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366722300,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly for coming before the joint committee.  It is interesting to hear the other side of the story, having listened to the case presented by a number of other groups.  Mr. Kelly will have followed our deliberations and will no doubt have noted that one could have concluded from most of the previous presentations that there were no problems in the sector, the current system is fair, everybody loved everybody else and every supplier was perfectly happy with the prices being paid for their products.  Mr. Kelly painted a different picture.<\/p><p>  Many of the other groups that appeared before us indicated they would not have a problem with a voluntary code but would have a difficulty with a statutory code.  They appeared to indicate that their principal objection was not to the power provided by a statutory code but the bureaucracy it would create.  Would it be possible to introduce a national statutory code that would have teeth but would not create unnecessary bureaucracy?  In designing any scheme, it is necessary to consider the benefits of the scheme in the context of the work required to achieve the desired outcome.  I am interested in Mr. Kelly's response to this because the creation of bureaucracy was the main argument presented against a statutory code.  I assume from Mr. Kelly's contribution that Food and Drink Industry Ireland favours a strong statutory code.  <\/p><p>  Food and Drink Industry Ireland represents the industry.  We also have primary producers, processors and retailers.  How do the processors believe they measure up in terms of demand from retailers?  In other words, one suspects that the primary producer is the weakest link in the power chain.  How much pressure is being applied to processors to drive down prices?  Is the financial pressure on processors forcing them to put pressure on suppliers and primary producers?  Some of us suspect that this pressure is forcing processors to switch to cheaper ingredients, including imports.  Does Mr. Kelly believe the recent horsemeat scandal was an indirect, if unjustifiable, action caused by ever increasing demand for cheaper ingredients?<\/p><p>  Will Mr. Kelly outline the position in terms of quality versus price as pressure is applied by large multiple retailers?  Is quality being diminished to secure more competitive prices?  We heard some figures on the prices at which beefburgers are retailing.  I am interested in industry's experience of price pressure.  Is this pressure forcing the industry to use lower quality ingredients?  Has price pressure on Irish food and drink manufacturers forced them to source lower quality products or materials outside the State?  <\/p><p>  We heard very little about product labelling.

It also stated the process of getting companies operating in the food chain to sign up to the initiative had begun.  How successful has this been?  How widespread has it been?

Obviously, any additional legislation will bring with it a degree of additional bureaucracy.  However, this should be set against bringing a greater degree of balance to the trading relationships within the sector.  We believe the benefits will far outweigh any increased bureaucracy.  As for bureaucracy, there is much to be learned from the voluntary process.  I will come back to Deputy Thomas Pringle's particular question on that issue shortly.  We spent a significant amount of time on the issue, as did the officials in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation who worked with Mr. John Travers.  They explored the issue in great detail at national level in terms of how the market worked and what was taking place in other member states.  This brings them to a position where they have a more informed view of the code that will finally be put in place.<\/p><p>  We have learned significantly from what has happened across the water in Britain, where a voluntary code was brought in in 2000.  In 2010 what is known as the grocery sector code of practice, or GSCOP, was placed on a statutory basis.  In recent months an ombudsman was finally introduced.  We can learn from the mistakes made in Britain and also identify the good parts of what was done there.  Obviously, there will be an additional bureaucratic burden associated with this, but we believe the benefits will far outweigh that burden.<\/p><p>  The issue of price and pressure and so on was raised.  It is worth bearing in mind that initially the objective behind this approach was to deal with unfair trading practices.  It is not appropriate to address price setting in this context.  It is subject to normal commercial negotiations which are generally tough.  A problem arises with retrospective changes to contracts.  For example, demands can arise where there are changes to the conditions or where there is an excessive transfer of risk, whereby the cost of promotions must be largely borne by suppliers, whereas the benefits will largely accrue to the retailers.  This indirectly places a significant cost burden on suppliers.  However, just as important, this can have a remarkably negative impact on the business planning process and can result in rather bumpy cashflow and also minimise one's ability to forecast how cash movements will unfold.  This has a negative impact on companies and a downward impact on pricing.<\/p><p>  It is worth examining how each category is structured with regard to cheaper ingredients and so on.  Most categories will have the full spectrum, from premium to budget products.  There is a variety of other factors feeding into this issue alaso, including consumer sentiment, the money a consumer has in his or her pocket which is causing him or her to trade down and commodity prices which are having a notable impact on the cost of ingredients.  The overriding factor is whether a product is safe.  A number of lessons have been learned in recent months in this regard, but many of these cases have to do with deliberate fraud in various parts of the food chain.  It should not take away, however, from the fact that the downward pressure on pricing has an impact on the sustainable margins of companies and their ability to reinvest in the business, manufacturing operations and innovation, which is the lifeblood of the industry because if we are not innovating or bringing new products to the market, consumers will go elsewhere.<\/p><p>  I will outline some points specifically on labelling.  European legislation, specifically a regulation on the provision of food information for consumers, is being implemented and large aspects of the regulations will take effect from December 2014.  The Commission is considering extending the country of origin labelling regulations which currently apply to beef to other meat products such as poultry, lamb and so on.  Broadly, our colleagues in Meat Industry Ireland and most major export companies support the extension of country of origin labelling regulations to these products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013042300005#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366724100,"counter":21,"content":"<p>On listing fees, issues relating to invoices, etc., does Food and Drink Industry Ireland have evidence of specific incidents involving the multiples?

Would putting an ombudsman, or an independent adjudicator, as the relevant official is known in the UK, provide a practical solution?  Would it represent a step forward?

Mr. Kelly referred to the importance of innovation.  One of the innovations I have witnessed in the area in which I live - I believe this to be the case in all rural areas - is the emergence of farmers markets.  Approximately 18 months ago there was a major brouhaha with regard to whether raw milk could be sold.  This was symptomatic of something greater.  I grew up on a farm and when the hens laid too many eggs, the excess were sold to a local shop.  That shop is no longer there but if it were and if we sold our excess eggs to it, I am of the view that both parties would be fined.<\/p><p>  There are extensive health and safety regulations in place and anyone who makes pork pies, apple pies or whatever and sells them at a farmers market must, in theory, comply with those regulations.  The great majority of the regulations are not adhered to by most people.  How could one possibly comply with them if one is baking or whatever in one's own kitchen?  Surely there ought to be a voluntary assumption of risk whereby it must be stated that pies sold at, for example, farmers markets are not produced by a commercial enterprise or that one's eggs were not produced by hens kept in a battery.  I accept that I am being slightly facetious in saying so but some such batteries resemble factories.  If one accepts that certain foods or whatever are not produced by a commercial enterprise and that the relevant hygiene standards do not apply, then one is accepting the risk involved.  Said risk is the same as that which obtains in respect of raw milk.  Should a differentiation be made and should consumers be able to choose?  It is clear that foodstuffs, etc., presented at farmers markets elsewhere throughout Europe have been produced.  The states involved do not, on the face of it, appear to be as preoccupied - as is increasingly the case in this country - with closing down small businesses which demonstrate a modicum of innovation.  Perhaps as larger businesses go bust they concentrate their efforts on smaller ones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013042300007#H00500","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1366724100,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Kelly.

We do very good business and have extremely strong relationships with them.  As is the case with all forms of business, times are tough.  Most of the practices which obtain in Ireland, England and throughout Europe emanated, possibly, from Walmart in the United States, which bought Asda in the UK.  Business is business.  If I have a product listed with a supermarket chain in the USA, the UK or Ireland, I do not enter into the arrangement with my hands hanging.  It is necessary for me to organise a spending budget in order that I can put in place a promotional calendar with the chain in question for the year.  This is something we have come to accept and it is extremely tough to deal with.  However, that is the way of life.  I suppose that in order to educate the other members of the committee we might other suppliers to come before the committee.  All suppliers have been obliged to come to terms with dealing with those in the retail trade.  Buyers are under huge pressure and must meet their targets.  We, in turn, must meet our targets.

However, the authorities in Britain calculated the cost of running the office of the ombudsman at &pound;5 million.  At that stage, this equated to 1p on people's weekly shop.  That is for a market of 60 million people as opposed to one of 4.5 million.  The draft statutory code for this jurisdiction refers to the appointment of an officer who would have a series of powers that would be quite similar in a number of respects to those of an ombudsman.  It is difficult to comment further until the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation publishes the legislation and the associated statutory code.  In the context of what was available in draft form, it was envisaged that an officer would be appointed.

Deputy Martin Ferris is probably tired of looking at me in coming here to make presentations on this matter.  This legislation has dragged on for so long that I am concerned about the commitment made on the part of all those concerned to progress it.<\/p><p>  Farming and the food industry make a hugely important contribution to the economy and rural society, something that has become more apparent during the economic downturn.  It is an export-driven industry, with the volume of exports growing to a record &euro;9 billion last year.  Farming, the food sector and related service industries maintain an estimated 300,000 jobs in the economy and contribute to economic activity in every parish and town in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The report recently commissioned by the IFA and undertaken by the UCD professor of agriculture and food economics, Mr. Alan Renwick, on the cattle and sheep sectors shows how embedded primary agriculture is in the local economy.  Farming and the agrifood sector have the potential to capitalise on growing global demand for sustainably produced food products and further increase employment and exports.<\/p><p>  The Government's Food Harvest 2020 food targets are ambitious.  Farmers are willing and able to increase production but only on the basis that they will be fairly rewarded for their work and investment.  A major threat to realising this objective is posed by the reality that primary producers are not getting fair play in the food supply chain and that their viability is being seriously challenged, both in domestic and European markets.  The dominant position of the large retail groups in Ireland and across the European Union is widely recognised and forcing down the prices paid to food suppliers to below cost of production levels, in some cases.  For example, liquid milk producers are receiving 33 cent a litre, on average, with production costs near 40 cent a litre.  The food supply chain in Ireland, in our main export market, the United Kingdom, and most of Europe is characterised by the concentration of buying power in the hands of a small number of very large and powerful retail groups with significant market share.  In Ireland almost 80% of the retail grocery trade is controlled by three players - Tesco, Musgraves and Dunnes.<\/p><p>  Farmers are very disappointed at the delay on the part of the Government in the publication of the consumer and competition Bill which is to include a statutory code of practice for the grocery goods sector.  The two Government parties made a big play of this issue in the run-up to the general election over two years ago.  The programme for Government committed to \"enact the Fair Trade Act, which will ban a number of unfair trading practices in the retail sector such as \"hello money\" which suppliers have to pay to secure a place for their goods on supermarket shelves\".  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, gave the IFA a personal commitment and made repeated promises that the legislation would be prioritised for publication, first, before the end 2011, then in 2012, followed by before the end of 2012.  I understand the legislation has been \"A listed\" for Government approval since last autumn and the Government's inaction in the matter is unacceptable.<\/p><p>  The inability of the Government to address the serious inequities in the food supply chain is putting primary producers under severe income pressure and some processors are in danger of being forced out of business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013042300008#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Bryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366725300,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I welcome the IFA back before the committee.

I concur with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s point that legislation will be forthcoming.  I hope it will satisfy the necessary requirements.  The big issue for everyone now is the state of the farming sector, in particular in the past 18 months.  Each and every electoral representative has been trying to highlight the situation on fodder and how it has made matters much worse than was the case.  The producer on the ground is the one who is suffering most.  He or she is also the victim of increased costs in oil, diesel and feedstuffs.<\/p><p>  The loopholes in labelling were raised by Mr. Bryan.  If ever the issue was brought home to retailers, consumers and producers it was in the recent debacle with horsemeat and the lack of traceability.  A lack of a proper labelling system was evident.

What are the witnesses' views on that?<\/p><p>  An issue that arose from the evidence given by the retailers is that they negotiate a price and the contract price is there but the code of practice will cover issues that arise outside of the contracted price.  Does Mr. Bryan have any figures on those additional costs?

We all saw what happened with the horsemeat scandal, which was the tip of the iceberg and not the first time issues were raised about the ingredients going into final food products be they agriculture-based or any other food products on supermarket shelves.<\/p><p>  What has come to the fore is that the legislation in Europe, and the State, are not strong enough to protect the consumer as well as the farming interest.  The primary producer, the farmer, and the consumer must be protected because everyone would agree from what happened in the horsemeat scandal that the people in the middle, the major processors, the importers and the supermarkets, cannot be trusted.  There was a breakdown in the process.  They were given latitude but they were labelling product that clearly was not what it said on the tin.  The consumer deserves to be protected and the only way that can be done is through a code of conduct, which must be backed up by regulations, to ensure the courts can adjudicate in instances where anomalies occur.<\/p><p>  The UK legislation appears to be stringent, for example, an ingredient that is more than 2% of the product must be indicated on the label.  We all know that is not the case here.  We have products in all the multiples, even after the horsemeat scandal, that are labelled as Irish product yet there is a high percentage of non-Irish ingredients in them.  It is a major issue, and it is affecting Irish agriculture.  There is only one way to deal with it and that is through primary legislation here.  I would be fully supportive of that because it will protect the primary producer but also the consumer.  The farmers want to make sure the consumer is protected because ultimately they will gain from it also.<\/p><p>  The independent supermarket ombudsman is a very good proposal.  I would go further, and Mr. Bryan might have included this in his proposal, and allow the consumer make submissions to the ombudsman as can be done with the Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, to whom consumers who have a gripe with a supermarket can make a complaint directly.  A period of time should be given for an adjudication to be heard, and statutory powers should be given to the ombudsman also.<\/p> <p>This is a matter that should be considered by the relevant Minister, be it under the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It probably is a mixture of both.  As for what is happening in the United Kingdom, while I have examined the legislation in place there, does Mr. Bryan believe it is working on the ground?  On the face of it, having read the legislation, it appears to at least be protecting the interests of consumers and farmers.  While I could touch on many other issues today, I note the fodder shortage has been mentioned, I will keep to the agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013042300011#M00500","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366727100,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bryan for his presentation and will raise a couple of matters.  While others have dealt with the issue, I refer to hello money.  It is very interesting because many of the large multiples have appeared before the joint committee and they all deny it exists.  Can the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, bring evidence before the joint committee to prove it still is being sought?  One reason for abolishing the groceries order in 2006 was to cut out the fact that hello money was being sought.  What was the IFA position in 2006 on the abolition of the groceries order?  My second question relates to proposed European Union legislation and as Mr. Bryan noted, such legislation may take a lot longer to pass than Irish legislation.  Were Ireland to introduce legislation, does Mr. Bryan think it might have a disadvantageous effect on our producers?  One of the large multiples that appeared before the joint committee last week operates in nine countries, while Tesco operates worldwide.  Were Ireland to introduce a legislative Bill, might that affect our producers were the multiples to source the products from areas which did not have such legislation?  Does Mr. Bryan believe it would affect our primary producers in that way?  Unless such legislation was passed on a worldwide or European Union basis, could putting in place legislation in Ireland have a detrimental effect on our producers?  The multiples could then begin to source the products in other countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013042300012#N00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366727100,"counter":50,"content":"<p>As they were shorter, I will start with the last questions.  On Senator O'Neill's question regarding hello money, I have had discussions with the Chairman on this issue over the past three or four years, when vegetable growers approached the Chairman and told him they were asked for hello money.  Several representatives from the horticultural sector have approached us but they will not make a complaint.  Just as Senator Mary Ann O'Brien has stated she must do it, I have met people, both at that level and at a much higher level, who have told me they were asked to make a substantial contribution at Christmas.  However, were one to ask them to make a complaint, they would not do it because they know they would get delisted regardless of whether they were a small horticultural grower in north Dublin, a chocolate manufacturer like Lily O'Brien's or perhaps a dairy or beef supplier.  They are intimidated by the sheer power of the retailers because to get delisted from organisations like Dunnes Stores, Tesco or the Musgrave Group, which purchase so much of one's product, is a considerable knock to one's business.  This reverts to the IFA's point, which is that retail regulation is required, as is an ombudsman who can investigate.  I would not be concerned that this might affect Ireland because different levels of legislation exist in different jurisdictions and it actually is the legislation which applies in the individual jurisdictions with which one would be obliged to deal.  My only concern would be that some country like France, which is considering a retail code, might go a bit over the top in nationalistic terms, given that we export 90% of our beef and will be exporting more than 90% of our dairy products.  Consequently, at European level, we must watch that to make sure no trade-distorting legislation is brought into any of this.<\/p><p>  As for the Senator's question on the abolition of the groceries order, the IFA actually had made submissions to the then Department of Agriculture and Food seeking to strengthen it.  At the time when the groceries order was abolished, we were seeking to have more products included in it.  Several of the products the Senator and I both produce were not covered by the groceries order and we were seeking for them to be included.<\/p><p>  In response to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, the lessons from the horsemeat scandal certainly must be learned.  Representatives of the IFA were in Leinster House on the day the Minister appeared before the joint committee and I thought that was a good discussion.  However, we must all learn lessons from that.  Moreover, there must be improved legislation.  We cannot simply state that it was a mess and then put it behind us, as much stronger legislation is required.  We need much greater inspection at secondary processor level.  We need much clearer labelling and it is extremely important that labelling is what it says.  It is unacceptable that one could buy something, be it water, alcohol or anything else, in which there could be product from six different countries.  Clear and transparent labelling is required and this is the time for the Government to act.  There is a view, which was expressed by both Ilse Aigner, the German Minister for Agriculture and St&eacute;phane LE Foll, the French Minister for Agriculture, seeking stronger legislation in this regard.  Consequently, Ireland also should be pushing for a much stricter legislation.  Moreover, to take up a point made by the Senator, if the label says something is Irish, the ingredients should be Irish.  Part of what emerged from this scandal was there was a mix and matching process going on and people were using labelling that clearly was designed to mislead the consumer.  This was in addition to all the other things that went on involving unacceptable practices.  Consequently, a tighter level of regulation is required in this regard.  We must learn from this issue and a level of proper legislation must be brought in.<\/p><p>  As for the Senator's question on a supermarket ombudsman, the IFA believes precisely what the Senator stated, which is that such an ombudsman should be there to represent the consumer, the primary producer and any other third party.  This is because the person who makes a complaint often will be another shop or retailer.  The idea is to put in place an ombudsman that can take complaints independently.  The Senator inquired about the ombudsman in England and the IFA has met its British equivalent, the National Farmers Union, NFU, on this subject.  While it has not been running for long but the NFU is reasonably happy with it.  Its members believe the opportunity to make an anonymous complaint, without being rung by the retailer in question to tell one it is dumping one's vegetables the next day, is extremely important.  Again, in a response that also answers some of the other questions, there must be proper, substantial penalties.  There is no point in having penalties of &euro;100 or &euro;1,000 for an entity with a turnover of &euro;2 billion.  One must have real and meaningful penalties and we also refer to ethics in this regard.  When a product manager's total salary is based on who he or she does along the line, whether he or she does the primary producer or the consumer, his or her salary is based on a bonus based on how much her or she can screw everyone in between.  How can there be ethics when this is the way?  This issue must be dealt with in retail legislation, in that one cannot be paid more for buying from the Senator for nothing and then selling for three times that to the Chairman.  This entire area must be regulated and the payment system in place for individual product managers at present certainly is encouraging them to do everyone along the line.  Moreover, if the penalties are small, they will continue to do this because their salaries are based on bonuses.<\/p><p>  Deputy Deering noted that representatives of the supermarket groups appeared before the joint committee and asked the reason they are so opposed to a code of practice.  As my predecessor from IBEC stated, they spent a few years stating they were against the voluntary code but now that they think there is a chance of a compulsory code, they are against that but seek a voluntary code, because they know they have a lot to hide.  I have never met a retailer anywhere in the world that did not claim no regulation was needed or sought.  The attitude is there is no need whatsoever for it, that it should be got rid of and is an unnecessary cost on the consumer.  However, food still sells at a higher price in Ireland even as the retailers source much of it more cheaply here in Ireland.  It is similar to the point Deputy Deering made in respect of milk.  He gets his price, which, relative to different markets in Europe is lower than some and slightly higher than others, but yet the retailers here sell at a price that enables them to take a hell of a good margin on it.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked some highly in-depth questions to which I will turn in a minute but milk is a sector in which the capacity of retailers to take a huge margin at a time like this shows no respect whatsoever for primary producers.  I refer to the weather and the pressure under which primary producers are operating on foot of the winter that has just passed with the higher costs of meal but yet the retailers pay as little as they can get away with.<\/p><p>  Deputy Pringle queried the limit on own-brand products.  Probably the main reason the IFA gets concerned about own brands is the retailers use it all the time as a way to push down the price.  I do not wish to name brands -  and it does not matter whether the milk is from Connacht Gold, Glanbia or whoever - but the retailers stock it and the consumer gets used to buying it.  However, if it is Tesco's own brand or Dunnes Stores' own brand, they can substitute the morning after and one does not know from where they sourced it.  Essentially, own-brand products give the retailers greater power.  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien has left the room but earlier she referred to how the practices come from the United States from entities such as Walmart and so on.  These are the practices they employ to push down prices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013042300012#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Bryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366728300,"counter":53,"content":"<p>So the focus is on the collection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013042300014#P00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366728300,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I will finish.

We do not collect any levy off boats but we work daily at international markets.  We work for farmers and run a full-time office in Brussels.

We are not involved in anything else, but we put a huge effort into working to represent 124,000 farmers.<\/p><p>  At times, one would be concerned that there is an understanding - and that is a very weak word - between factories.

It is our job, however, to do everything we can to raise the price.  That is why we work hard on live exports and to encourage the maximum amount of cattle to go through the marts.  That is why we are trying to work with the NFU to get cattle into the UK.  Cattle do go from Larne easily but there is EU legislation on transfers between countries.  When one crosses the Border it is, unfortunately, deemed as a different country.  When one crosses from Larne in Northern Ireland to the UK, it is not regarded as a different country.  The legislation that applies to international exports does not apply from Larne to Scotland or England.  However, we have worked hard to reduce the cost of transferring livestock between countries.  A substantial amount of cattle go North but it is deemed as moving to another jurisdiction, so we have to get the regulations reduced to a minimum when that happens.  Over the last two years, an average of 70,000 cattle per annum have gone north of the Border, varying from weanlings, to store cattle and finished cattle.<\/p><p>  As regards shipping policy, a boat must be certified by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to carry livestock.  It is an expensive process.  I explained how we worked to get boats certified for north Africa, including Libya and other areas.  If one wants to haul cattle from Holyhead to Dublin or <i>vice versa<\/i>, one must be certified by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which has very high standards.  I am not giving out about that.  Irish standards for animal transportation are the highest in the world.  That is good because it secures our live export trade and means that cattle will travel in comfort and safety, which is important.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked a frivolous question about whether anyone had threatened us.

We are pushing hard to get a price increase which is way overdue in the liquid milk sector.  In the context of trying to move the matter on, one of the retailers said he was looking for money off somebody before he could do that.  For anyone to say that type of skullduggery does not go on, is incorrect.  There are only two things that motivate people in life - fear and pleasure.  Retailers work on the basis of fear through delisting.  Some element of retailer regulation is absolutely critical to balance the show in the context of processors and primary producers.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about liquid milk.  Own-brand milk has basically decimated the branded products.  The situation is being abused.  One can spend ten years developing a product - including research, development and innovation - but overnight a retailer can decide to get a replica product to undermine that investment.  It is a drive to the bottom because they will get their margin in whatever way they can.  One of the reasons that liquid milk is under so much pressure is that retailers have allowed so much of a differentiation between the own-brand and branded products.  That is a strategic move by retailers, so effectively the percentage of own-brand is increasing all the time.  The margin left for a processor to pay the farmer back is being diminished.  Own-brand is a significant issue in the context of liquid milk, but also concerning other products.  It was scandalous for the Competition Authority to put an organisation like ours to that cost because a couple of people tried to say they were going out of business producing liquid milk.<\/p><p>  I want to answer Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's point about meat factories.  I have been in the IFA for over 20 years and was responsible for its organisational perspective for many years.  Not once did the IFA ever blink, nor will we.  Other than the IFA, I do not see anyone else who has challenged the meat factories.  They blockaded the meat factories day after day.  We are challenging them on price, as one can read in any newspaper, whether it is Henry Burns or James Murphy.  We are fearlessly on the farmers' side and nobody has put more effort into getting live exports to ensure that there is price competition. <\/p><p>  In the last week, both the president and myself had meetings with the NFU to see how we can get live exports into the UK.  In the financial context, it is about 5% to 6% of the IFA's total income.  The money comes from farmers and not a red cent comes from the meat factories.  We pay them a commission to collect it, but it is paid by farmers.  To even suggest that we would be bought, is very disrespectful to this association.<\/p><p>  I wish to make a point about the weather conditions which are very difficult.

It has proven to be a disaster and I blame that law for the collapse of the banks.  They made a god out of competition.  Anybody or anything that stood in the way of competition, as they defined it, was to be steamrolled over.  I have, therefore, never been a great proponent of competition at all costs.  At the end of the day, as we saw in the horsemeat situation, the consumer pays one way or the other.<\/p><p>  I would be interested in finding out the technical information, if the witnesses have it.

We had four livestock trucks travelling on each sailing to Holyhead.  That is not a problem at all.  The question is only whether it is viable.  If the boat is to take livestock, the rules are very different with approximately six times as much space having to be allocated for a livestock truck compared to a container.  There is legislation on airflow, etc.  I presume that is the reason for the issue.  Unless the demand is for a substantial amount of trade, the boats will not do it.  They will have to be certified by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the effect that each sailing meets the space allocation and the trucks are chained down.  There is a significant raft of legislation.  I was involved in it.  I was on a ferry when the animals were being transported and I could not believe the distances that were being demanded.  It was for airflow to ensure that there is no pneumonia among the animals.  There is no legislation preventing it, however.<\/p><p>  There are several reasons for the Northern Ireland issue.  As England and Northern Ireland are in one legislative jurisdiction, a great deal of quota flowed to Northern Ireland.  There was a massive increase in production.  However, they do not have drying plants as we have for powder which means that at certain times they have surplus milk.  They would not have the capacity to dry it all, which means it suits them to put a certain amount in here.  I do not know how they can have done it at the price we have seen on some occasions.  I imagine what they were doing was unloading a surplus.  To do it for the whole year suits them, but they could not supply 100% of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013042300015#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Bryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366729500,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I do not think Senator Pat O'Neill would be too keen on that one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013042300016#R00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366729500,"counter":72,"content":"<p>In respect of the levy, ours is the only democratic farming organisation.

I hope they will address the issues that have been raised by previous witnesses and, primarily, by the Irish Insurance Federation.

I thank members for rearranging their schedule to facilitate our attendance at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform shortly.  OPW has a specific role in the transfer of information to the insurance industry on flood risk and flood defences.  We have no responsibility for oversight or regulation of the insurance industry or to insurance matters generally.<\/p><p>  It may be useful if I briefly outline the role and responsibilities of the OPW in relation to flood risk management.  Following a strategic review of flood risk policy in 2004, the Office of Public Works was assigned the lead co-ordinating role for flood risk management in Ireland.  We deliver services in the following key areas: strategic planning to manage flood risk into the future under the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme in compliance with the EU floods directive and under the Irish coastal protection strategic studies; a programme of capital investment to address existing flood risks to properties and infrastructure through major and minor flood relief projects, in partnership with local authorities; and programmed maintenance of those arterial drainage and urban flood relief schemes completed under the Arterial Drainage Acts. To support these activities we engage in a number of important information gathering exercises, including in particular collection of hydrometric data to improve the estimation of water level flow and to enhance the quality and reliability of flood relief design and mitigation measures.  We also developed awareness programmes among the public and businesses of the risks of flooding and provided information on how to plan, prepare and protect against flood risk.  We also commission research into areas related to flood risk management activities.<\/p><p>  In carrying out its functions the OPW works in close co-operation with other State bodies, principally the local authorities who are the other main players with key responsibilities in relation to flood risk management in the country.  In this context it is important to stress that while the OPW and the local authorities work in partnership in many areas, the local authorities are responsible for distinct areas of work in relation to flood risk such as leading the emergency response to flooding, the urban drainage infrastructure and the maintenance of certain water courses and channels.<\/p><p>  At the core of the OPW's work is the objective of reducing to the greatest extent possible the level of flood risk to people, property, infrastructure and the environment.  At a strategic level it is overseeing the most comprehensive national initiative to systematically identify, assess, document and report on the most significant flood risks throughout the country.  These assessments, known as the CFRAM programme, will generate detailed flood maps showing flood extents and other flood parameters such as depth and velocity.  They will recommend an integrated management plan and prioritised measures to address flood problems in areas of significant risk in each major catchment in the country.  The CFRAM programme will inform the long-term planning of flood risk management measures throughout the country, including structural and constructed flood defences and non-structural measures.  Both the flood maps and the identification and outline design of flood risk management measures under CFRAM will consider a range of potential future scenarios, including the potential impacts of climate change, to ensure capacity for adaptation is built into the flood risk management strategy and measures.  The output from the CFRAM programme in a recent pilot project included the production of 1,100 maps showing flood extents, depths and velocities.  Approximately 250 km of channels were surveyed and more than 275 sq. km. of detailed flood plain modelling was carried out.  This project required the development of nine hydraulic models of the river and its tributaries and the production of various reports, including an inception report, a strategic environmental assessment at scoping level and final report stage, a hydrology report and hydraulic reports.  Ultimately a catchment flood risk management plan was drawn up.  <\/p><p>  In more immediate terms the OPW is addressing flood risk in critical areas through its capital investment programme for both major and minor alleviation works.  Witnesses at the committee's previous meetings made comments which suggest that the OPW is not spending enough on flood relief works.  The figures will show this is not the case.  Under the Government's infrastructure and capital investment medium term Exchequer framework 2012-16, a total of &euro;225 million has been allocated for capital flood relief measures over the five-year period of the framework.  This allocation, when combined with the amount spent by the OPW on flood relief measures since the introduction of the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act 1995 of &euro;320 million, will result in total expenditure of almost &euro;500 million on flood relief up to 2016.  This is a substantial investment by any standard, especially in the current difficult economic environment, and expenditure to date on flood relief works has brought significant benefits to communities and towns throughout the country.  The OPW estimates that over 5,000 properties have benefited from this investment, with the estimated benefit in terms of damage and loss avoided amounting to almost &euro;900 million.  The insurance industry has also benefited from this investment as its large claims payment costs for flooding, which amounted to almost &euro;700 million since 2000, would have been much higher but for the remedial and defence works undertaken by the OPW on behalf of the State and taxpayers.<\/p><p>  Under its major capital works programme, the OPW currently has nine major flood relief schemes at construction stage.  It is expected that a further five schemes will commence construction before the end of 2013, subject to completion of procurement and other preparatory formalities and the availability of funding.  A further 26 schemes are at various stages of design and planning.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013042300003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Smyth","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366723200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I ask spokespersons to limit their remarks to five minutes at the outset and other members to three minutes so everybody gets an opportunity to speak before the OPW officials leave for their next meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013042300004#C00200","speaker":"1087"},{"type":"speech","time":1366723200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I want to deal solely with the Shannon Callows flooding.

Very little effort has been made on the maintenance of the Shannon and its tributaries.  The witnesses said that removing silt and preventing it building up were minor works.

Removing the debris, including tree branches and leaves that builds up in the river, from the Shannon and its tributaries would prevent a serious amount of flooding in the Shannon basin area.  Simple solutions are not being acted upon and I believe the OPW should have senior personnel down there looking at what is happening on the ground.  The reports coming back to the OPW do not tally with the reality on the ground.  I would really appreciate more effort from OPW senior management and the people working on the ground.

We have been calling for good flood defence works since then and I pay tribute to the OPW and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for providing the money last year following our representations.<\/p><p>  My concern is with regard to the insurance aspect.  I fully understand the OPW has a limited role with regard to insurance, but it is in talks with the Irish Insurance Federation.  For the 26 or 27 years after Hurricane Charlie, which was a one in 30 year storm, houses and businesses along the River Dargle had no problem obtaining flood insurance or home insurance.  Flood defence works started along the river last year, and it is only in the past year that the insurance companies have stated to people renewing their flood or house insurance that they will not insure homes along the River Dargle.  This is ludicrous, because there was no problem obtaining such insurance after the hurricane.  During the construction of flood defence works the insurance companies are stating they are not prepared to insure.  They state if Bray Town Council or the OPW can come up with an outline of the work being done it might satisfy them.  I understand the works being done are to deal with one in 100 year diluvial events or one in 200 year tidal events, which gives us greater protection.  One would imagine the insurance companies would state that as this work is being done there will be no problem.  I do not have a problem, but my neighbours and people in Little Bray have told me they have been taking out insurance with the same company for years and suddenly they are being told they need to supply this information.<\/p><p>  I fully understand the OPW has stated it is looking to draw up plans which can be given to the Irish Insurance Federation once schemes are completed.  The work along the River Dargle is in process, and the paperwork has not been done for completed schemes.  The people of Bray are desperate to get something from the OPW to describe the works being carried out and what is intended and to state we have not been flooded since Hurricane Charlie.  The OPW should tell the Irish Insurance Federation it has a responsibility to provide insurance and just cannot stop doing so.  We are very concerned about this.

While the OPW is the lead agency, it does not appear to have sufficient powers to compel people to take action.

It was something that I thought about for a little while before accepting because I wished to be clear in my own mind that I would have the time and energy to ensure that I would be able to deliver in a positive and constructive manner on the strategies.  I believe I can do this.  I also very much welcome the appointment by the Minister of the six other members of the board, all of whom bring a breadth of expertise and experience in film and film production to the table, and I look forward to working with them and with the very experienced executive staff of the board.<\/p><p>  The Irish Film Board was established under the Irish Film Board Act with a dual mandate of assisting and encouraging the making of film in Ireland and assisting and encouraging the development of an industry in Ireland for the making of films.  This mandate was most recently elaborated and expanded on in the Creative Capital report published by the Minister in July 2011 and the implementation for the recommendations in the Creative Capital report is part of the recently published Action Plan for Jobs 2013.<\/p><p>  The core business of the Irish Film Board is the development of indigenous Irish film making and the majority of funding is dedicated to this objective.  The Irish Film Board supports Irish screenwriters, film directors, actors and crew in realising Irish creatively driven films.  Recent examples include: \"The Guard\", directed by John Michael McDonagh and featuring Brendan Gleeson; \"What Richard Did\", directed by Lenny Abrahamson and featuring Jack Rayner; \"Pilgrim Hill\", directed by Gerard Barrett; and the soon to be released animation feature film, \"Song of the Sea\", directed by Tomm Moore and produced by the team that produced the Academy Award nominated \"The Secret of Kells\".  Irish creative talent is the lifeblood of the industry and I will be working with my colleagues on the Irish Film Board, as well as with the executive of the Irish Film Board, in helping to promote that talent both in Ireland and internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013042300010#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bill O'Herlihy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366727100,"counter":236,"content":"<p>That was very impressive.

I am very keen on the regional aspect of his expertise.  Ireland has great potential in the film industry.  Such is my support for the development of this sector that I proposed the setting up of a film commission in County Offaly when I was a county councillor and I persuaded Offaly County Council to do so.  It is known as Film Offaly and is very active.  An offshoot was the organisation of a film festival, the only one in the county and it is an unusual one in that it targets young film makers.  The regional aspect of encouraging film making is very important.  The handy option is to focus activity on counties Wicklow and Dublin, which was the case in the film industry for a long time, mainly because of the availability of Ardmore Studios, but we have so much more to offer across the country.

There was one cinema in Roscommon town, but it has closed down.  What can the Irish Film Board or Mr. O'Herlihy do to make film viewing more accessible?  When I say \"more accessible\", I mean the distributors of films should make it viable for community centres or town halls in remote areas to screen films.  Where I come from, one has to make a two-hour round trip to see a film and the experience is ruined as a result.

The organisation I am involved with managed to access very important PEACE funding to do North-South projects with marginalised young people.  Every summer an assumption is made by parents that young people want to get involved in sports camps but that is not everyone's cup of tea.  We organise projects like \"So You Wanna Make a Movie?\", where we extend the film production experience to people who would not ordinarily do that, giving them access to that sort of opportunity.  Having engaged young people at that level, some of them have gone on to work in the industry, which is a credit to that approach.<\/p><p>  We have a burgeoning film industry at present, much of the credit for which must go to President Higgins and the measures he introduced in the 1990s.  The industry, however, is notoriously difficult to get a foothold in for a variety of reasons.  If we are to continue to succeed on the international scene and to build the indigenous film industry Senator Mac Conghail referred to, we must prioritise young people coming through the industry, whether they be on the creative or technical sides.  Has Mr. O'Herlihy had any chance to consider how the Irish Film Board might go about that critical aspect of the business over the next few years, where it encourages and retains young talent, ensuring we have an indigenous industry for young people coming through the system?<\/p> <p>What is of major importance on the agenda of the Irish Film Board is training.  Training people so that they develop through the industry.  There is a much greater requirement to develop the educational resources for career building and the realities of working in that marketplace.

This statement provides some introductory reactions to the report of the four Presidents of the EU and also the European Commission's blueprint report.  These documents set out an ambitious, staged project for the development of economic and monetary union, EMU.  The vision is a combination of strengthened disciplines to limit adverse spillovers between member states and improved supports to improve stability and enhance convergence.  The Commission's blueprint is the more ambitious document, with a greater focus on necessary crisis resolution tools.  While the documents are very welcome contributions given the magnitude of the growth and employment challenges, there is a concern that they, and especially the four Presidents' report, focus too much on disciplines relative to supports and too much on supply to the neglect of demand.<\/p><p>  On fiscal integration, significant steps have already been taken to improve structures for fiscal discipline with the six pack, fiscal compact and, most recently, the two pack.  With Ireland's debt projected to peak this year at an unsafe 123% of gross domestic product, GDP, we have no choice but to reduce our deficit and debt.  The new disciplines reinforce and make more credible a direction in which we have no choice but to go.  However, the crisis has revealed the fragility of a country's debt sustainability and associated access to borrowing within the monetary union even at lower debt levels.  The new crisis resolution tools, notably the European financial stability facility, EFSF, the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, and the European Central Bank, ECB's, outright monetary transactions, OMT, programme, have been significant steps forward.  These steps have been hesitant, with the early proposals for the design of the ESM undermined by threats of a low trigger for private debt restructuring and official creditor seniority.  While the announcement of OMT has had a significant impact on bond yields, the adequacy of the design has yet to be tested.<\/p><p>  The proposals for a central fiscal capacity and associated stabilisation fund offer the potential for improved shock absorption capacity, especially if the fund has a capacity to borrow.  These proposals are envisioned as a longer-term reform and not as part of the policy arsenal to resolve the current crisis.  However, more and faster action may be needed.  While it is understandable that there is resistance to a risk sharing debt redemption fund, DRF, and eurobills that were included in the Commission's proposals but not in the four Presidents' report, the revealed fragility of creditworthiness within the monetary union suggests the need for bolder action to prevent self-fulfilling runs on sovereign debt in vulnerable countries.<\/p><p>  With regard to banking integration, the crisis revealed deep flaws in national level regulation and supervision of banks and also the potential for vicious feedback loops between banks and sovereigns where banks remain a national responsibility.  The plan for a staged process to a European banking union is thus a welcome development.  The envisioned end point is a US style, least-cost bank resolution process, with clear priority for loss absorption running in the order of equity to junior bonds, to senior bonds and finally to uninsured deposits.  The recent Cyprus experience shows that elements of this model can be brought in on an accelerated basis.  The envisioned system would be backed up by a European resolution fund, funded by risk based levies on banks, a capacity to borrow, possibly from the ESM, and <i>ex post<\/i> risk-based levies to repay such borrowings.  Deposit insurance would remain a national responsibility, although the design of national systems would be harmonised.<\/p><p>  This system offers an improved end point in terms of minimising moral hazard and sovereign risks.  However, with parts of the European banking system still under significant capital and funding stress, care must be taken in the phasing in of the new system so as not to impair further credit availability in the heavily bank-reliant euro area economy.  While strengthening the claims of insured depositors, least-cost resolution will make other creditors more wary of providing funding to banks and more prone to flee at early signs of trouble.  The tougher resolution framework will need to be complemented by a stronger focus on ensuring banks are adequately capitalised, backed up by rigorous stress tests and ESM involvement in ensuring adequate capital levels where necessary.<\/p><p>  On economic integration, in its response to weak growth and high unemployment, the plan envisions efforts to further the development of the Single Market and structural reforms to improve supply-side performance.  There are plans for greater co-ordination of structural reforms where the policy changes have potential spillover effects on other members. One promising element is the convergence and competitiveness instrument,<i><\/i>CCI, whereby member states enter into contractual arrangements for well-defined structural reforms in return for financial support.  Sometimes it appears that European policymakers see the solution to Europe's weak growth as being only on the supply side.  While well-designed structural reforms can bring significant benefits, the process can be difficult and slow, with the impact effects sometimes being negative.  In the case of labour market reforms, a recent review by the International Monetary Fund, IMF, of its policy advice in this area noted: &quot;An important branch of research has focused on the cross-country evidence regarding the effects of specific labor market institutions on the unemployment rate. .. This research has reached two broad conclusions: The devil is in the details (and the details are hard to capture in the rough measures of institutions used in regressions); and the combination of institutions matters very much.&quot;<\/p><p>  With the ECB's single mandate for price stability and the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP, focused on national level policies, tools are lacking for aggregate demand management in the euro area as a whole, even if the flexibility present in the SGP is sometimes under-appreciated.  The co-ordination potential of the European Semester process could be better used to ensure an appropriate aggregate stance of euro area fiscal policy.  This should be focused in particular on stronger countries that retain the so-called fiscal space for more stimulative policies.  Given the depth and nature of the recession, Europe may be poorly served by what at times appears as a single minded supply side focus.  In sum, the proposals in the reports set out an ambitious and necessary agenda for the effective functioning of EMU.  Care must be taken, however, that understandable concerns about moral hazard and structural impediments to growth do not overwhelm the emerging design.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013042300003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366722000,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before the committee today.

European leaders have responded to past failures with a new regime of obligations and surveillance.  This regime is built on a dizzying number of new rules and regulations.

If there is such an alternative through the hard times we see emerging at present, how do we go about pursuing it?<\/p><p>  A multiplicity of currencies within the EU will never work.  As long at that remains there will always be scope for predatory activity in the financial markets, thus enabling people to make a lot of money rapidly with consequences ultimately for the economies concerned.  I have held that view for a long time, although not everybody agrees with me.  They may disagree but I still strongly hold that view.  I believe that it will not work without a single currency that has the full support of all EU member states, including those who aspire to accession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013042300004#C00600","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1366722600,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I would like to welcome Dr. Ahearne and Professor McHale to the committee and thank them for their contributions.

There is quite a lot here.  One theme that came up in a number of members' questions related to the intrusive level of disciplines that have been put in place under the six-pack, the two-pack and so on.  One concern I share with Dr. Ahearne relates to the sheer complexity of the rules that are being put in place.  Even for supposed experts in this area, going through the rules for the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is quite a mindnumbing exercise and, sometimes, trying to figure out how the rules combine together can be extremely difficult.  This goes to the point made by Senator Reilly in terms of political support.<\/p><p>  Thus far, the process of putting in place these various rules has gone reasonably smoothly, including the success of the fiscal treaty in the referendum.  However, many people are simply switched off and have come to the conclusion they cannot really understand the workings of many of these rules.  This creates a lot of risk in respect of the legitimacy of the process.  One issue with which members probably are very concerned is that of democratic accountability, but legitimacy very much depends on public understanding of what is happening and there has been too much unnecessary complexity built in.  A lot more could be done and while I acknowledge this joint committee plays an important role in this process, at European level a great deal more also could be done to explain to people the workings of these various rules and the reason they are so necessary.<\/p><p>  Another theme running through the questions related to political compromises and this goes back to a theme in my statement about this balance between these disciplines, which are necessary, and supports.  In some senses, one could think of supports as being the <i>quid pro quo<\/i> for the disciplines.  This was clearly visible in the context of the fiscal treaty debate, where it was made explicit that access to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, depended on having this fiscal compact.  However, I worry that we will get the disciplines, which in many ways are necessary, but that in the process of political compromise, we may not get the supports which really are required for the successful functioning of economic and monetary union, EMU.  I also noted this in my statement but this is evident in respect of the things that fell out on the way from the Commission's blueprint to the four presidents' report.  There is no mention that I can recall in the aforementioned report of the debt redemption fund or the eurobills, for instance.<\/p><p>  Another theme in the questions pertained to the need for austerity.  What we have seen in this crisis is that in the case of a country within the monetary union with a high level of debt, which in particular is heavily dependent on foreign funding of that debt or on foreign investors to invest in that debt, access to borrowing and basic creditworthiness is incredibly fragile.  This is the reason I stated we really have no choice but to get down to safer levels of debt and deficits.  However, the crisis has shown that we also need effective lenders of last resort within the eurozone or these crises will recur.  This is where the elements that already have been put in place, such as the ESM and the ECB's outright monetary transactions, OMTs, are so important but we must go further.  First, the OMTs must really be shown to be effective and to be really accessible to countries and this is yet to be proven.  However, in the longer term, we probably need to take bolder steps towards moving to something like a debt redemption fund or more in the short term to the eurobill proposals.  This is supposed to be the return for the disciplines and, consequently, we must keep our eye on the process in order that we do not just get the disciplines, and the supports get lost along the way.<\/p><p>  I will close by responding to another theme in the questions which related to the debate on austerity.  It certainly has exploded in the last while as a result of the comments of Professor Mody, the debate about the Reinhart and Rogoff empirical findings, the comments of President Barroso, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, as well as those of President Higgins and so on.  There has been much discussion and it certainly appears as though austerity is being questioned in this trade-off Deputy Durkan mentioned between austerity and economic growth.  However, it is very important to distinguish between two things from the point of view of what it is that we are criticising.  I refer to a national, domestic view in which we must decide what to do in the context of the arrangements that exist, that is, in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact as it is designed, the context of the supports that are there and the conditionality that exists within the programme Ireland is in.  The judgment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has been that because of the vulnerability of our access to borrowing, it is very important that we meet the conditions of the programme.  In a highly uncertain environment, it is important we recognise that because of uncertainties in respect of growth, we may need to have a little bit of a buffer or a margin of safety to ensure we can meet these key targets.  If we hit these targets, we then will be in good standing with official funders and even were we to need another programme, the likelihood is that we would be able to get access to a programme without a restructuring being imposed on Irish debt.  Effectively, the latter would be a default, which I believe would be highly disruptive.<\/p><p>  The fear of such a default could make the whole thing self-fulfilling, because this is what private investors are looking at most.  They are asking whether, if this country needs another programme, it will be forced to default and to the extent we remain in good standing with official funders, it becomes much less likely that such restructuring would be imposed and our chances of getting back into the markets are significantly greater.  Moreover, as the threat of default recedes, it helps confidence to return and interest rates tend to fall right across the economy, including in the banking system, and that supports this process of a restoration of growth.  Consequently, from a national perspective, it is highly important that we stick with the plan to get the deficit down, to meet the targets and to remain in good standing with official funders.  The process we now are seeing unfold with dramatic falls in interest rates is likely to continue and we have a very good chance of being able to return to market funding.<\/p><p>  While this pertains to the domestic side, we can distinguish it from what is happening at the European level and I now am talking about the design of the system itself.  One point I made in the statement, which I believe Dr. Ahearne also underlined, is there is a contractionary bias in European policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013042300005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366723800,"counter":292,"content":"<p>One of the main purposes of banking union is to break the link between banks and the sovereign.  The question asked was how that would happen in practice.  That is where the single resolution mechanism comes into play.  It works in two different ways.  One could ask where the money would come from if the Irish banks required more capital.  I do not know whether they will require more capital.  There is supposed to be a stress test done on the banks.  It would be better for the stress test to happen sooner rather than later.  It seems to have been put off more than once.  If the banks are under-capitalised, we need to know about that.  That is true right across Europe.  It is politically convenient to put off the stress tests because politicians do not like putting money into banks but if the banks are under-capitalised, that will weigh on the amount of credit they give out which will affect economic performance.  The sooner we find out the true state of the European banking system, the better.<\/p><p>  That is one advantage of the single supervisory mechanism.  The European Central Bank has taken over the job and before it begins to supervise banks across Europe, I presume it will do the mother of all stress tests.  At least if I was working for the European Central Bank I would not want to have a situation where in three years time one or more banks fail and then I realise they have failed because of problems that existed before I took on the responsibility.  Let us get it all nice and clean from day one and therefore carry out a very tough stress test.  The European Central Bank will probably carry out a very tough stress test.  Some people fear that but I believe it is positive.  One has to find out the extent of the problem and fix it.<\/p><p>  Having done that, if more capital is needed in Irish banks, the issue is who puts it in.  The place it should come from is a European fund.  We are not talking about failed banks; we are talking about banks that have a future.  We are not talking about plugging massive holes in the balance sheet.  We are talking about giving them enough capital so that they can function as proper banks.  The State has done more than enough recapitalisation of banks and the money should rightly come from Europe, for example, the single resolution mechanism or perhaps some fund linked to it.<\/p><p>  That would be very helpful in breaking the link because when one talks to people involved who hope to lend to this country at low interest rates and to buy Irish bonds, they are not worried about the fiscal situation.  The Government has huge credibility in terms of reducing the fiscal deficit.  The State has it because it has been earned since 2008.  Neither the previous Government nor this one have blinked in terms of doing fiscal consolidation.  They have rightly got on and done the job.  The people who buy Irish bonds do not worry about that.  What they worry about is whether more money is needed for the Irish banks and whether that will add to the country&rsquo;s debt levels.  By and large the people who buy Irish bonds understand fiscal and economic issues inside out but they are less comfortable with the banking stuff.  They are worried that there is a further black hole.  The way to resolve the issue is to say that if more capital is needed, it will not come from the State as that breaks the link.  That is very important.  The big risk in terms of this country going back to the market and staying in it is coming from the banking sector.  That was also true in late 2010.  It was not so much the fiscal issue, it was what the recapitalisation and rescue of the banks would ultimately cost.  The people who buy bonds and lend to the Government could not really get a handle on that.<\/p><p>  A second issue, which is as important, is the legacy issue, that is, getting some fund in Europe to buy shares in the Irish banks and paying a good rate for that, which would allow the State to reduce its debt.  That is also extremely important.  Both of those factors are very important for the economy and the Government should push hard on them.  It is well known that the previous Government did try to have burden sharing with senior bank bondholders in late 2010 and Europe stopped that, and so the State is owed something significant from Europe.  The sort of banking union that is being put in place should have been put in place as the single currency was created.  The Irish can justifiably ask for recapitalisation to be done retrospectively.  That would be an important part in breaking the link. The other point is that at the moment a deposit guarantee system is done nationally and that then links the sovereign to the banks.  If that was done at a European-wide level, again, one would help to break the link.  That is the second component.<\/p><p>  The question was raised about rules, where they are all leading and if they are all necessary.  In part, the fact that there are so many fiscal rules is based on a misunderstanding of what caused the crisis.  If one goes back two years, certainly in Germany and some other countries in Europe, the argument was that the reason we have this euro crisis is because governments were spending too much, that it was a fiscal policy problem.  It has been shown clearly that it was not the problem.  A hangover of that is the huge amount of rules we now have.  It is also partly a German approach.  When I talk to German economists, there seems to be a belief that there is no problem that cannot be solved by more rules.  If rules do not work, they say that one should make them tighter and have more of them.<\/p><p>  On whether the rules are useful, they are in the sense that one could not possibly have a fiscal union or eurobonds, which would be a good idea, without such fiscal rules.  One could not possibly have a case where Italy, for example, could issue eurobonds that would be backed by the German Government but yet it could do whatever it wanted on the fiscal policy side.  Germany is not going to tolerate that nor should it or any other country.  If one is going to have guarantees from all the states, which is what would be entailed with eurobonds, from countries borrowing, then one would have to have very tight rules.  They are not a means in themselves but they are a stepping stone to something else that would be valuable.  What would be valuable in terms of making monetary union work is much closer fiscal integration in terms of eurobonds and shared risk.<\/p><p>  Professor McHale mentioned the United States as a functioning country with monetary union.  If one has a bad shock in the state of Pennsylvania all the unemployment and social welfare benefit is paid by the federal government, so it is a real shock absorber for Pennsylvania that the money is not coming out of the local state finances.  That is the type of shock absorber one needs at European level for the currency to function properly.<\/p><p>  A number of questions were asked about austerity.  The stance at European level is wrong in the sense that the recession is going on for so long and the numbers coming out, in particular from southern Europe, are so bleak in terms of unemployment and growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013042300006#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alan Ahearne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366724400,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I presume Dr. Ahearne does not wish to declare an interest in that regard.

Dr. Ahearne has described the \"dizzy\" number of schemes we have which is what many people feel about the language used about Europe and how we interact with it.  They believe that interface is dizzy and that its rules and schemes are changing.  One thing is invented and does not work and then something else comes along.  This may be an over-simplistic question.  If we did not have the euro would we have the problems we now have, and at such a scale?  That question is for Dr. Ahearne.  This time last year when we were looking at the fiscal compact treaty he spoke in advance of others about the need for a banking union.  How close does he believe we are to that?  <\/p><p>  There is much talk about our having reached the limits of austerity.  The feedback I get from constituents would certainly be that we have.  Do the delegates believe that to be the case?  Dr. Ahearne mentioned that we might not need as big a budgetary adjustment but I wonder how we can even push for the adjustment we still must make.  Is there a case for renegotiation with the troika?  When the troika gives money it comes with so many conditions, oversight and intrusion.  Some of these conditions are very good in terms of structural reforms given that certain matters had gone completely out of kilter.  However, some of it is not so good.  We see Mr. Ashoka, one of the architects of the entire plan, saying that perhaps they got it wrong.  Why did we not impose similar conditions on our banks when we gave them money?  Have we been too lax with our banks?  How have other countries done this?  We have given money to banks for recapitalisation, mortgage debt, etc. but we are not sure if the money went where it was meant to go.  For example, we know some of it was spent on very large pension payouts to failed bankers.  Those questions are for Dr. Ahearne.<\/p><p>  In his paper Professor McHale stated the problem is not only on the supply side.  Perhaps he would explain exactly what he means in that regard.

To continue the theme regarding the causes and limitations of austerity, if financial markets will not lend to a country, or will only lend at a rate which is too expensive for the country, what are the choices open to it?  We need to distinguish between countries which have access to financial markets and countries which do not.  The policy choices available to both types of country are fundamentally and gigantically different.  In the discussion we have on austerity as a policy choice, will the witnesses comment on the choices open to a country which cannot afford to borrow from the financial markets?<\/p><p>  To dwell on the Cypriot experience, it appears to indicate a euro in Cyprus is not worth the same as a euro in Ireland, France or other countries because of the various events that have occurred since.

Senator Healy Eames asked about the focus on the supply side.  A narrative has developed that Europe's problems are supply-side problems because labour, product and capital markets are not growing quickly enough and require structural reforms, which often mean measures such as reducing employment protection and changing unemployment benefit systems.  Certainly, important reforms need to take place in labour and product markets, including completion of the Single Market.  When one examines the economics it is harder to bring about the structural reforms which lead to better performance in terms of growth and employment than much of the rhetoric seems to suggest.  It takes a long time and often the immediate effects are damaging to growth and employment rather than helpful.  Measures need to be taken, but the existence of a magic recipe to turn around European growth is exaggerated.  Examining the recent history of European growth, one sees a big drop during the crisis, and recovery when countries were generally pursuing more stimulative policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013042300008#G00400","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366726200,"counter":302,"content":"<p>We have five minutes for Dr. Ahearne to answer as many questions as he can.

That is just arithmetic.  The country then has to close its budget deficit instantly because nobody would lend.  In the case of Ireland, with a big budget deficit, it would be simply catastrophic and would mean considerably more austerity.  For that reason it is very important to be able to borrow either from financial markets or from a programme.<\/p><p>  We probably have some leeway in the budgetary adjustment in coming years if one thinks about access to financial markets.  The Government might confirm it was going to hit its target of 3% of GDP target by 2015 but from that it would back out the adjustments it needs in the next two years.  If that number was four rather than five, then it would do four and thereby reach the target.  How would financial markets respond?  I do not believe they would respond badly.  Provided that the financial markets view the debt as sustainable and would start to reduce, I believe they might well be relaxed.  In order to ensure they feel relaxed about it, we could give them certainty about the next few years.<\/p><p>  I am somewhat surprised there has not been an update to the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014.  That plan set out what the Government was going to do and was helpful for financial markets.  It shows not just what the debt will be but also the measures the Government will introduce to achieve that.  If that was updated to go out to 2017 at the same time as announcing that we would stick to the 3% target, I do not believe the markets would react negatively.<\/p><p>  Professor McHale is right that there are big risks involved in the coming years.  I am not sure those risks would reduce significantly by, for instance, another &euro;1 billion in budgetary adjustments that are not necessary to reach the 3% target.  There are two big risks.  One is from a possible recapitalisation of the banks which would require more money.  That goes back to what we were discussing today, namely, Europe.  If there is, it is not possible to do ever-increasing amounts of fiscal consolidation to put aside yet more money - that money would need to come from Europe.  That is a risk, but one that cannot really be solved through fiscal consolidation here.  The solution to that must come from Europe.<\/p><p>  It is also true of the other big risk, which is that the euro area will not grow but stay in recession.  That is a big risk for the Irish economy.  I am pretty sure that if the euro area economy was growing robustly now, the Irish economy would be growing robustly.  The euro area staying in recession would be a big problem for the Irish economy and for Ireland's fiscal outturn.  Again, is that something the Irish can do something about?  That seems to be a problem that needs to be solved in Europe through the measures I discussed earlier.  If it is not solved how do we get around that one?  The State now owes more than &euro;40 billion to the EU and presumably there is leeway in terms of concessions.  This is what has been happening.  In recent years interest rates have been reduced and the loans have been pushed out.  These are official concessions that are helping to keep things sustainable.  If they had stuck to the initial rate and not pushed things out, Irish debt might well have been unsustainable by now.  My guess is that if things do not pick up in Europe, they will just do more of that.<\/p><p>  Things have turned 180&deg; since the Deauville agreement, which insisted that private sector lenders to an economy should be subordinate to official lenders.  This meant that if something went wrong with an economy, official lenders should get all the money back, but the private sector - people holding the bonds - would get a haircut.  Since then, that has completely flipped and essentially the private sector lenders are senior to official lenders.  If something is going wrong and the economy is not picking up, the EU - the official sector - is giving the concessions, which makes the private sector position better.  If a troubled borrower has two creditors and one creditor is given concessions, that is good for the other creditor.  That is a major part of the reason for our interest rates having come down.  There is more leeway - in theory &euro;42 billion worth of leeway.  If we do not get a recovery and things in Europe remain bad, I would not be surprised to see even more concessions on that.  If it is a problem in the euro area - in Europe - it has to be solved at a European level.<\/p><p>  There was a question about Cyprus.  The initial plan for Cyprus was very problematic in that it was going to hit depositors with more than &euro;100,000.  The real problem with the second plan is that they have had to put in capital controls.  I mentioned that in my statement.  Two countries have bailed in private creditors in the crisis - Iceland and Cyprus - and in both cases they had to impose capital controls.  That is what it means going into this brave new world with new bank resolution involving bailing in private creditors.  If that is done on a large scale - as may be necessary with some country in the future - it is also necessary to impose capital controls, which are terrible for economic growth.  If banks are recapitalised, the ECB should be willing to lend to them.  It looks like they were not prepared to do that in this case.  Now the lesson seems to be while we will have this resolution involving bailing in, it must be accompanied by capital controls.  In the Irish case the banks' creditors were bailed out, which was very expensive and bad for the sovereign.  In Cyprus they were all bailed in which is also very bad and destructive to the economy.  The lesson from Cyprus is that a country with many bad investments on banks' balance sheets will have a bad outcome.<\/p><p>  There was a question on the troika programme.  The country has been in a programme since 2008 and will be in a programme for some time.  The programme from 2008 was a programme imposed by Government and funded by markets until 2011.  Then it was a programme funded by the official sector.  The country will probably be able to borrow from markets again but will still be in some sort of programme, by which I mean reducing the budget deficits, and restructuring our tax system and economy.  That is all part of our programme.  The reason for fiscal consolidation is not that there is a troika.  It is because we had a very large budget deficit that has to be reduced.  I believe there will be a programme regardless of what happens.<\/p><p>  I was asked how close we are to banking union and the answer is not close enough.  I believe it needs to happen much faster.  It is very difficult to see how the euro area economy will grow unless credit is flowing properly and that will not happen until the banking systems are sorted out at a European level.  The member is absolutely right to point out that the banks have been very slow to deal with the impaired loans.  The Government and the Central Bank have set them targets for the mortgage arrears, which hopefully will force them to up the pace.

I am opposing any time for the Minister to make an opening statement on the Revised Estimates as presented.  The Government, through the Department of the Taoiseach, informed the Opposition parties last week in the D&aacute;il that the 2013 Revised Estimates for public services largely follows the budget day allocations, with the pay deal recommendations by the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, having been programmed into the Department's Estimates.  It might have escaped the Minister's attention but the pay deal recommended by the LRC has been rejected by two thirds of public sector workers who were asked by the Minister to vote on it.  The pay deal no longer exists and it is an affront to all public servants that the Minister should be in here today while calling for a period of reflection.

I cannot believe that the Minister has gone ahead with the Revised Estimates with the LRC proposals in them.  I could understand the Minister coming forward with an overall global figure of what he would like to achieve.  It is ironic that this is coming from the Minister who threatened public servants during the critical voting period with across the board pay cuts.  Now he is coming here with the LRC recommendations.  Why did he ask people to vote if he intended to come in here today with those recommendations in the Estimates?

As has been said workers were invited to ballot on that matter and they have decisively rejected those proposals.  I understand the Government is in reflective mode over the next step, but it is a queer kind of reflection when the Minister goes ahead with the very proposals that have been rejected and hard-wires them into the figures.  This is no way to do business.  It is certainly no way to treat people working in the public service.  It is also no way to treat this Oireachtas.  The Minister clearly needs to identify a plan B.  If, as he claims, he needs to find an additional &euro;300 million then he needs to establish from where that will come.

I would be willing to discuss Estimates which had them taken out of them and would be very much willing to engage in a discussion with the Minister about where that additional saving could be found.  However, we know that the Estimates to come before the committee, if they have Croke Park II baked into them, are incorrect.  Given that the public sector workers voted against Croke Park II, it would be wrong for us to engage with these numbers, which have the Croke Park II proposal baked into them.

It is not &euro;300 million, obviously.  The pay savings are the apportioned savings we would have expected had the Croke Park II proposals impacted on my Department and the agencies under my purview.  In essence, last week I was faced with a decision on whether I should publish the Estimates on the basis of apportioning, as I thought, in a fair way the &euro;300 million of savings that are implied in the budget arithmetic or not publish the Estimates.  They are everybody's Estimates.  Taking Deputy Fleming's logic, we cannot advance on any Estimate in any Department until we have reached a resolution in regard to the &euro;300 million for this year.<\/p><p>  That would be well and good if we had no responsibility.  We could approach it as the Republicans did in America and shut down government.  However, agencies need to be funded and, for example, the shared service, PeoplePoint, needs a Vote this week to ensure it can continue to function.  Ultimately every agency of State - all the ones under my purview - over time will need to have a formal Vote in order to continue in existence.  It is extraordinarily reasonable that we would go through the full Estimate of my Department and all the agencies under my remit.  If and when we have alternative proposals on the savings in pay and pensions, we will come back and have those approved separately.  It is not unusual to have that done.<\/p><p>  I understand that some of the Deputies opposite want to grandstand on the particular issue of the Croke Park II proposal, which is an important issue.  During the negotiation period, the only utterance I heard from Deputy Fleming was that the &euro;300 million was not sufficiently ambitious and that he wanted &euro;350 million taken out of the public pay bill for this year.  I reread his pre-budget submission which detailed how that would be done by the end of March.  If we did not have an agreement by the end of March, he laid out, in fairness, the forced measures in regard to the public service for which he would have legislated, as his party did twice when last in government.<\/p><p>  I am conscious that we are using up time now.  As we will have a debate in plenary session in the D&aacute;il tonight on all these matters, let us park Croke Park II until that forum.  Let us now do our normal business for all the agencies that depend on us.  We should go through line by line the voted moneys required to fund services within my Department and its associated agencies for this year.

However, they cannot stand up as the final agreement because they have been rejected.  If the Minister believes in democracy, he will accept that and come back with a revision of those figures later.  I am saying he should have brought to the committee today the Estimates not including the Croke Park II proposals.  He should have dealt with the rest of his Estimate which was not contentious and had not been rejected by the public servants and, as he said, come back at a later date to discuss that element of the &euro;300 million that affects his Department, as he seems willing to do.

Is this a ruse or is it phase 1 of forcing Croke Park II through even though it has been rejected?  Is this the preamble to unilateral action in respect of legislation?  That is the question that arises.  The Minister sounded the siren bell suggesting that the Government would run out of money and that it had a &euro;300 million gap in its Estimates.  Why would he come before the committee to seek approval for these Estimates, knowing that there are gaps within it?  That does not make any sense.  The politics of this is that the Minister is saying via this committee and other Oireachtas committees to public service workers that they may have rejected the proposal, but the deal - as he calls it - is going ahead anyhow.

I must apportion where I think the money should be got across the system.  I have done that in a reasonable way.  If there is a change in that 2%, I will return to the committee.

We had a very good exchange with Deputy Fleming on this on Question Time last week.  Under the new two-pack arrangement, we will have the budget on 15 October and all Estimates for next year will be expected to be passed before the end of December this year.

It has an important role in this democracy to hold the Government to account and to participate in this.  It is unfortunate that Deputy Fleming has left.

I am committed to public services but he was looking to take more people out rather than provide the necessary public services in hospitals and schools, as well as seeking additional working hours and changes to work practices.  We negotiated at the Labour Relations Commission.

The group comprises a significant number of Votes.  In addition to my Department's Vote and a new Vote for shared services, the group contains the Votes for several offices under the aegis of my Department, including the State Laboratory, the Public Appointments Service, the Valuation Office and the Ombudsman's Office.  It also contains the Votes for superannuation and retired allowances and for the Secret Service.  The Vote for the remaining Office under the aegis of my Department, that of the Office of Public Works, will be taken separately by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.<\/p><p>  Before dealing with the individual Votes in the departmental group I wish to draw the attention of the committee to several general issues.  The first issue is the matter of performance budgeting and D&aacute;il oversight.  In recent years I have revised the format of the Estimates presented to the committee as part of the implementation of performance budgeting.  Under this format the Estimates before the committee and all committees present better information in order that Members, members of the public and decision-makers generally can see at a glance the financial and human resource input costs, the key outputs and the impact factors for each expenditure programme.  This is part of the reform to create a more coherent and integrated planning and performance management framework for public expenditure.  Within this performance budgeting framework the overarching strategic policy for each Department is set out in its statement of strategy, which explains through clear and integrated key objectives or high-level goals the rationale and purpose for each programme area.<\/p><p>  The new Estimates format is designed to expand on this high-level strategic document to provide for each departmental programme a clear presentation of the financial and staffing resources allocated to that area, the main activities undertaken and the key outputs delivered.  The intention is to give committees a clear sense of what exactly public funds are being spent on and what is being achieved with that spending.  Also included in the Estimates document is a section showing the content and impact indicators.  These indicators are intended to give a sense of whether the public service outputs are having a positive impact on citizens and on Irish society in general.  This approach brings a streamlining and clarity to a process that was previously spread across several documents and allows D&aacute;il committees to better understand what public service outputs and impacts are being delivered through the expenditure of public funds.  In addition, my Department will now be working on expanding the expenditure and performance information contained in the Ireland Stat website, which was successfully piloted during the past year.  The content of Ireland Stat will be broadened to capture more information about public services.  It already provides details of performance in areas such as job creation, research and development, road and food safety.  The feedback from our general consultations has been very positive.<\/p><p>  This year's Estimates process continues the important structural reform that is intended to assist the committee in its task of scrutiny and holding the Government to account.  Much progress has been made on this front.  The challenge over the coming period is to bed down this new way of performance monitoring and reporting and, through the expansion of the Ireland Stat website in particular, to make available up-to-date and easily accessible information on what the public service is delivering on the money we are voting and how well it is doing.<\/p><p>  In the context of my broader programme of reform in the area of accountability, performance and D&aacute;il oversight, the committee will be aware that I wrote to the chairs of all the Oireachtas committees in January 2012 to advise them of the new arrangements and the opportunities for greater engagement by public representatives in the Estimates formation process.  In the second half of last year meetings took place between Ministers and the relevant Oireachtas committees concerning the prospective Estimates for 2013, framed in the context of the expenditure ceilings set out in the comprehensive expenditure report 2012-2014.  This was the first time that there was a systematic process of considering future Estimates matters by the Oireachtas in advance of the Government deciding on its expenditure Estimates to present to the D&aacute;il.  The purpose of the exercise was to enable committees to engage with line Ministers and their Departments to exchange views on how the fixed allocations would be apportioned.  We knew about the amount of money allocated and we knew the options in the comprehensive review of expenditure and people may have had their own views.  That was a new and useful departure.<\/p><p>  As the Committee is aware, the hearing in regard to my Department's group of Votes took place last October and I found the exercise useful.  Arrangements are in train to ensure that the process becomes further embedded in the work of the various committees this year.<\/p><p>  Within the overall framework of recent EU fiscal reforms, I have introduced several improvements to Ireland's budgetary architecture since taking office.  These measures are designed to improve the management of public resources and to ensure public funds are used effectively in a transparent manner.  The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill was published late last year and, when enacted, will give legal standing to the existing multi-annual departmental ceilings.  This legislation will anchor other reforms to multi-annual budgeting and will allow for sensible, structural planning and prioritisation within each area of public expenditure, encompassing full public input and parliamentary oversight, while affording Government the flexibility to ensure that the appropriate fiscal stance is taken.<\/p><p>  Naturally, my Department is not simply focused on ensuring that Government meets its public expenditure targets, although these are important; it is keenly aware of the need to achieve value for money in public expenditure as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013042300006#E00500","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366721100,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and we can now go through the-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013042300008#G00100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1366721100,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Will I take the rest as read?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013042300008#G00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1366721100,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Will the Minister do so?

I have had discussions yesterday with Commissioner Hahn regarding the new multi-annual financial framework being discussed in a co-decision model with the European Parliament.  We are anxious to get the Structural Funds agreed so we can implement national policies from 1 January 2014.  We operate through two regional bodies, a south and east structure and a Border, midlands and west structure.  In view of the time slot within which the new round of moneys was predicated, there was a reduction in the amount of money available to the Border-midlands-west and I and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach were very anxious that this would be addressed.  An additional sum of &euro;100 million was provided in the MFF for the Border-midlands-west.  This means that overall, despite a reduction in the amount of money for Structural Funds across the Union, Ireland will have a slight increase.  The moneys that were voted here are to maintain the existing structure.  We will have to look to next year when the new round comes in.  We will debate what new structures should be in place to monitor the next round of Structural Funds after the budget in October.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013042300009#H00100","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1366721700,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Subhead A6, deals with the peace programme Northern Ireland INTERREG.

I have recently engaged in extensive dialogue with members of the British Government about that and I am very glad that there will be a PEACE IV programme.  It is very important in terms of North-South co-operation.  There are still residual issues that need to be addressed in bedding down peace.  We cannot take that for granted.  The programme to date has been hugely successful in terms of bedding down the peace in communities.  One of the initiatives taken by the EU Commissioner for Regional Policy, Johannes Hahn, was to consider a number of projects in Brussels and I made a presentation there.  I was very privileged to be there.  Also in attendance were the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland.

I welcome my colleagues from the Office of Public Works who have joined me for this presentation.<\/p><p>  Before I refer to some of the key elements of the 2013 Estimate I will bring the committee up-to-date, as I did last year, on some of the areas where the OPW is a key driver in the Government's public sector reform agenda.  The public sector, not unlike the OPW, carries out myriad functions and is spread throughout the country.  The OPW has for years performed as a catch-all organisation for a vast array of public service activities.  Flood risk management, property management and maintenance, heritage services and procurement all form key parts of the ambit of our office.  In essence, these are all forms of shared services provided to the wider public service or directly to the public at large.  In this respect the OPW is well-positioned to be one of the central drivers of the reform agenda.<\/p><p>  The Office of Public Works is the lead agency and actively engaged in two main areas of reform set by Government, procurement reform, which is soon to be devolved to the new office of Government procurement, and property asset management, where the Chairman of OPW is the senior responsible owner for this aspect of public service reform.<\/p><p>  The reform of public procurement is a critical element of the Government's public service reform plan.  Procurement of supplies and services accounts for approximately &euro;9 billion of current expenditure by the State per annum.  This represents a significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the public service avails of the maximum value-for-money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.  In 2012, an external review of the central procurement function was commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The report of the review, which was published in September last, found that significant savings could be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model.  Last year on foot of the findings of the report the Government agreed to a range of actions for the reform of the central procurement function, including the appointment of a chief procurement officer, CPO, Mr. Paul Quinn, and the establishment of the office of Government procurement.  This new approach to public procurement will involve: integrating procurement policy, strategy and sourcing in one office; strengthening spend analytics and data management; greater aggregation of purchasing across public bodies to achieve better value-for-money and lower administrative overheads; examining the specifications set out for goods and services; evaluating demand levels to assess how demand and volume can be reduced; and strengthening supplier and category management.<\/p><p>  One concern of this committee in the past was the possible restriction of opportunities to small suppliers under the new arrangements.  The office of Government procurement will continue to engage with the small and medium-sized enterprise sector in this regard and in the past two years several significant steps have been taken to improve SME access to public procurement.  Seminars and workshops have been held and in excess of 4,500 SMEs have been hosted to help demonstrate the procurement process.  The National Procurement Service has established an industry collaborative working group involving major business representative groups and the various public sector groupings.  The working group aims to identify the challenges for SMEs when transacting business with the public service and, most importantly, to come up with practical solutions to these challenges.<\/p><p>  The question of property is a key part of the work of the Office of Public Works.  We are also leading the way with reform in this area.  The number of staff in the public service will fall by approximately 40,000 by the end of next year, 2014, and this creates an opportunity to significantly reduce the cost of office accommodation, which is one of central government's greatest administrative overheads after pay and pensions.  OPW has already made progress in this area and departmental rents have fallen from &euro;130 million to &euro;107 million in the period from 2008 to 2012.  Coupled with further organisational rationalisations, such as shared services and the abolition of agencies, this will continue to facilitate further reductions in the amount of accommodation required by the public service.  As a leader of this area of reform the OPW is taking a whole-of-government perspective on how best to manage public service property to ensure optimal value-for-money is achieved.<\/p><p>  The Chairman of the OPW is finalising a property management plan currently and I hope to be in a position to present it to Government shortly.  One critical element of the plan is to progress the development of a map-based public service property inventory.  This issue has also been raised by this committee in the past.<\/p><p>  In my brief as Minister of State with special responsibility for public service reform I am taking the lead on shared services and Ireland Stat, two crucial areas of public sector reform.  As Deputies are aware, the Government considers the implementation of shared services to be a key enabler to reduce the cost and labour intensity of back-office support functions in the public sector.  Significant progress has been made in establishing a human resources and pensions shared services centre for the Civil Service and the first Departments and offices have recently moved to the new service.  A business case for payroll shared services will be presented to Government shortly and work is under way evaluating the suitability of our financial management and banking functions for shared services.  The publication of the OPW Estimate today shows the maintenance of State accommodation being centralised on the OPW vote.  The rationalisation of this service will produce savings, directly by the OPW prioritising the operation of planned and preventative maintenance and indirectly on staffing in Departments in off-loading their property maintenance responsibilities.<\/p><p>  Ireland Stat is a new whole-of-government performance measurement system, currently in pilot mode, which aims to meet those commitments and to answer the question of how Ireland is doing in a range of areas.  A key commitment in this e-Government area is to ensure that data held by public bodies is made available and easily accessible online for reuse and redistribution.<\/p><p>  The 2013 Estimates process we are engaged in today is yet another example of reform.<\/p> <p>The Government is committed to being transparent, accountable and efficient in the provision and consumption of Government funding.  In addition, this reform will see the budget for 2014 brought forward to October of this year, thereby allowing greater opportunity to consider and plan for the 2014 expenditure commitments.  Before members today, the Office of Public Works, OPW, having been involved in the pilot of this performance budgeting process, is presenting a clear plan for expenditure in 2013 with a summary review of what was achieved in 2012 with the funding provided.  2013 will be a critical year in terms of delivering on OPW objectives, the thrust of which was set out in my appearance before this sub-committee last October.  Given the timing of this appearance, it must be acknowledged that resources allocation for the current year is already well established, with 94% of this year's capital allocation and more than half of the 2014 allocation contractually committed at this stage.  Capital unitary payments for the convention centre in Dublin, flood relief projects and building works to maintain the fabric of buildings and deal with the ongoing office rationalisation programme will absorb the medium-term OPW capital allocation.<\/p><p> On the current side, wage payments for the 1,700 permanent staff, unitary payment commitments and contractual commitments for rent on buildings occupied by Departments account for the most part of the 2013 allocation.  The remaining allocation will be required to fund property maintenance, drainage maintenance and the heritage service programme, which is a critical component in the Government's efforts to revive and develop the tourism sector.<\/p><p> The most significant part in monetary terms of the 2013 allocation is &euro;70 million on the flood risk management programme.  I expect members to welcome the fact that the Government and the OPW have prioritised this area of funding to ensure greater protection is provided to the public.  The capital part of the allocation, which is largely committed for the coming years, will allow for the provision of both major schemes and the continuation of a highly successful scheme of minor protection works through local authorities.  Major schemes to be advanced in 2013 include Waterford, Carlow, Bray, Fermoy, Mallow, Ennis and Clonmel.  Further funding will be provided to local authorities in 2013 to progress minor works schemes in addition to the &euro;21.6 million that has been provided to local authorities since 2009 in respect of 402 approved projects.  The 2013 allocation also will allow for the continuation of the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme of studies.  This important programme involves detailed assessment of the most significant flood risk areas nationally and based on these assessments, the development of a prioritised set of options to manage that risk in the future.<\/p><p> I am pleased to announce the Government has provided the additional investment required to expand on the successful Optimising Power at Work campaign, which now is achieving savings in excess of &euro;4 million per annum across Departments.  The new energy conservation initiative will broaden its scope from such Departments to target initially 500 large buildings from various public sector organisations.  My office will lead a campaign to achieve ambitious saving targets of up to 18% of consumption within three years.  While my office will lead the campaign, the service requirement will be outsourced in the main, thereby providing approximately 25 high-quality employment opportunities for suitably qualified specialists from various disciplines.<\/p><p> I hope I have given a flavour of the commitment the OPW and its staff demonstrate to me on a daily basis while playing their part in reforming public services and have assured the sub-committee that the funding to be approved today will be put to the best possible use in the furtherance of reform objectives.  I obviously will be glad to answer any questions from the Chairman and members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013042300013#M00200","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366724700,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

In my previous capacity as Chair of the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, I note the Minister of State appeared before it on foot of his relationship with the OPW and so on.  I refer to a problem that both this sub-committee and certainly the aforementioned joint committee must consider.  The issue is that the State is spending an incredible amount of money on flood remedial works, flood engineering works, flood improvements and so on.  However, the difficulty is that areas of the country still are geocoded by the insurance industry as flood risks.  Moreover, even after the OPW and the local authorities have carried out works in those areas, there is no recognition by insurance companies that such work has been done.  In effect, some households cannot take out domestic home insurance at present.  It is a problem for them at present and will be a problem in the future for them because such houses cannot be sold.  While I acknowledge this issue does not come directly under the Minister of State's expenditure remit, I would like to see its resolution as an output, in that it should be one of the objectives.  While the Estimates outline the bricks and mortar aspect of what is being done by the OPW, relief for the domestic owners does not appear to be an output therein, but I believe it should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013042300014#N00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1366724700,"counter":483,"content":"<p>The Chairman's suggestion is useful because in this area, the decision to initiate a comprehensive conversation with the Irish Insurance Federation was an initiative of the Office of Public Works.  It is fair to state this is very much part of the work programme within that office.  The Chairman rightly pointed out the substantial investment the State has expended in recent years and I take this opportunity to thank the Government for the capital envelope of expenditure, which effectively is approximately &euro;45 million per annum over a five-year period.  Progress is required from the Irish Insurance Federation.  I am glad to be able to report to members that we have had this conversation with it each month this year.  I am relatively optimistic that we will be able to come to agree on a memorandum of understanding by the summertime.  Moreover, I hope such a memorandum of understanding will do two things.  First, it should agree that the Irish Insurance Federation will accept that in the great majority of cases, the works the OPW has carried out are to the 101-year standard.  That is the first point, namely, where the Government has expended the money, the insurance companies would know the works it has carried out have actually met that standard.  Second, there should be an ongoing dialogue between the Office of Public Works and the insurers on the pipeline of other developments and schemes the OPW intends to bring forward and other schemes.  While the Government cannot give comfort to people in locations where a scheme has not been put in place, where such a scheme has been implemented and the State has expended substantial sums of money, it is only right and proper that the insurance industry would recognise that fact, given the standard this office has brought to bear in its work.  Consequently, I am hopeful and optimistic that such an understanding can be reached.  I believe it will help to give some comfort to people where the OPW has completed schemes in locations such as Clonmel and Fermoy, where all these works have been brought to the exacting standard the OPW has now ensured.  In such cases, it is important, right and only proper that the insurance industry would take note of this and provide insurance accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013042300014#N00300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1366724700,"counter":484,"content":"<p>In response, I certainly acknowledge the role of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, in moving this issue forward because it has been a bugbear that has persisted for a considerable period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013042300014#N00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1366724700,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013042300014#N00500","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1366724700,"counter":486,"content":"<p>As I understand it, the issue is that at times, the insurance industry claims not to know that a significant programme has been carried out in a particular area that previously had been geocoded as a flood risk.

First, we must work out practical issues between the OPW and the insurers in terms of a flow of information.  The Irish Insurance Federation must be confident that the information we give its members is the full picture and that it would disseminate the information to its member companies.  There is, however, a wider issue.  We will be in a better space when we have all signed off on the catchment flood risk assessment and management studies, CFRAMS.  The entire country has been divided up into river basin catchment areas.  There is a more corporate view on flooding maps and all of the issues that surround the potential occurrence of flood risk.  When I first went to the office in Trim two years ago I asked the engineers about the size of the problem.  It was said to me in a direct way that there are 250 hot-spots around the country where at any given time we could have flooding or a major event with significant loss to business and homes.  Putting the CFRAMS in place and signing off on the process following agreement at European level will provide a corporate view.  We are not there yet.  We have to sign off on the process by the end of 2015 and the maps must be in place by the end of this year.  We will all be able to say then that at least we know where the risks are and where the potential work must happen.  It will be important for the insurance industry to know our schemes in the future so that we will be able to continue to roll out the schemes, as long as we have money to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013042300015#O00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1366725300,"counter":489,"content":"<p>The Government is carrying out positive action led by the Minister of State.

The minor works scheme is very important.  We have an open-door policy in the Office of Public Works.  The local authority is the key body which applies to the office to draw down funds, up to a maximum of &euro;500,000, which is a significant sum of money.  Some of the schemes could cost &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 but many of them cost &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000 which are significant amounts of money.<\/p><p>  For example, Carlow County Council, or in the case of Deputy Humphreys, Monaghan County Council, can apply on a 24-7 basis to the Office of Public Works and the information obtained in the application is put through a rigorous cost-benefit analysis.  The criteria covering the scheme are on the website and are available for the public to peruse at any given time.  The system churns out a number, for example, on a spend of &euro;300,000, and tells us whether it provides value for money.  The system is open and transparent.  If the number is good we will then write back to the local authority and tell it to get the work done and we will provide funds.  The system is working well.<\/p><p>  I will provide a note of caution.  I do not wish to dump on local authorities but it can be frustrating when the office provides expenditure for a local authority only to find that at the end of the year the money has not been spent.  I accept there are contractual issues for local authorities but I wish to use the opportunity provided by the committee to get the view out that local authorities must spend the money they are given.  We work in a strong partnership approach with local authorities on a range of issues.  We have offices around the country where we work with them on flooding and hydrological issues.  This is an important scheme and I would encourage local authorities to use the funding provided.<\/p><p>  We have responsibility under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 to look after some schemes but the great majority of schemes are under the control of local authorities or private landowners.  Our key responsibility is under the Arterial Drainage Act and that is where our priority lies, notwithstanding the fact that budgets are always difficult.  The minor works scheme is a very effective means of sorting out little problems.  The key priority is, first, whether someone could die if a flood occurred, second, the number of houses that would be affected, and, third, the number of commercial properties affected.  Farm land is important but I will not pretend that it is as important as someone&rsquo;s house.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013042300015#O00600","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1366725300,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I would like the Minister of State to pass on to the OPW my admiration of the work it does in many areas.

The executive is being abolished and more power and responsibility is being vested in the Minister of the day.

The explanatory memoranda to the Bill state it is &quot;essential the HSE is properly accountable to the Minister for its performance&quot;.

The purpose of section 10(<i>a<\/i>) is to enable the Minister to specify priorities to which the HSE must have regard in preparing its service plan and establish performance targets in respect of those priorities.  This is not done in isolation.  Pending the establishment of the new child and family support agency, the Minister must consult with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in respect of HSE functions that relate to the functions of that Minister.  The Minister must also consult with the HSE.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 2 is concerned with a role for the joint committee where the Minister is determining priorities and setting performance targets.  Priorities and target setting for the HSE seem to me to be matters for the Minister to address in the context of Government policy because the Government sets the policy.  The joint committee has an essential role in exercising democratic oversight, bringing any concerns to the attention of the Minister, and monitoring how Government policies affect people.  Rightly, the Minister can be held to account by the Oireachtas for the performance of the HSE but that is entirely different from having the Oireachtas committee being involved in the formulation of policy, which is a Government prerogative.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 17 is similar in concept to amendment No. 2 in that it proposes a role for the joint committee in regard to amending the HSE service plan.

It is, however, for the committee to inform matters through evaluating policy and acting as a watchdog.<\/p><p>  I am concerned there are also practical difficulties in regard to the amendment given the tight deadline in which the Minister must respond to a service plan submitted by the HSE.

As the directorate is to be the new governing structure of the HSE it is essential that its members come from senior management in the executive.  I should also clarify that it was not the intention that appointed directors be drawn only from current HSE employees.  In other words the intention was that appointed directors be drawn from HSE employees irrespective of when the person may have been appointed to the grade.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 4.<\/p><p>  Deputies will be aware from my amendments that I am no longer proposing that membership of the directorate should be limited only to persons holding the grade of national director.  In this regard amendment No. 5 deals with eligibility for appointments to the directorate.  The Bill currently provides that appointed directors must be HSE employees holding the grade of national director.  However, as I signalled on Second Stage, in light of the approval of some new necessary top management positions covering issues other than service areas I believe that eligibility for membership of the directorate should be widened to give a greater degree of flexibility in determining the ideal composition of the directorate and enable other relevant employees as well as employees in charge of service areas to be part of the governing body of the HSE.  Specifically, the amendment provides that appointed directors must be employees holding the grade of national director or another grade not less than the grade of national director.<\/p><p>  I wish to inform the committee of a potential amendment relating to directorate membership on Report Stage to which I alluded earlier.  Amendment No. 5, which I have just outlined, widens eligibility for membership of the directorate to allow senior employees in addition to national directors to be members of the directorate.  Under the Bill, however, the maximum number of directors of the directorate, including the director general, is seven.  However, under the Health Act 2004 the number of board members was 12.  I am still in favour of a tight ship when it comes to the directors but I believe there is scope for a slight increase in the total number of directorate members.  I believe this will allow relevant service heads and a small number of other key senior employees to form the governing body of the HSE.  Accordingly, and subject to legal advice, I will be bringing an appropriate amendment on Report Stage.  However, I wish to assure the committee that there will be no additional costs associated with this amendment.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 7 is consequential on amendment No. 5.  Amendment No. 14 is to ensure the Minister can appoint an appointed director's second-in-command to act as a temporary member of the directorate during an extended absence, for example, through illness, of the appointed director.  Section 16L(2) currently allows the Minister to appoint a HSE employee to the directorate where, by reason of an extended absence by an appointed director, there is not in the opinion of the Minister a sufficient number of appointed directors of the directorate available to enable the directorate to perform its functions effectively.  However the Bill provides that only employees in the grade of national director or, with the amendment recently discussed, another no-less-senior grade are eligible to serve on the directorate.  Should there be an extended absence of an appointed director, amendment No. 14 will allow another HSE employee to temporarily replace the appointed director on the directorate, the governing body, even though that employee may not be a national director or a person holding an equivalent grade.  This flows from a common sense approach to management and the need to consider practical situations that might arise.  My amendments, if accepted, will have no financial implications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013042300006#E00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1366734600,"counter":571,"content":"<p>Will the Minister elaborate in respect of the numbers he intends to provide for in the amendment on Report Stage?

The Minister is holding absolutely rigidly to the situation that members of the board, the directorate, will be employees of the HSE.  The Minister has widened the scope of possible appointees from the national director role to any other level - this is clear from what he has put forward - but I believe he should take the further step.

These senior managers will collectively be responsible for managing a budget of approximately &euro;13 billion and staff of almost 100,000 people.  They will be expected to achieve significant savings and system reform.  In these circumstances and cognisant of Government policy on public service pay, the posts have been approved at national director level 2, with a salary of &euro;158,296.  That salary level, as with other salary levels in the public service, has been reduced in recent years.<\/p><p>  The remuneration package for the director general must reflect the fact that the position encompasses significant and onerous responsibilities.

The issue of concern here is that we are hamstringing the appointment process in view of the fact that those who can be appointed to this new directorship, the director general and the directors, can come from the existing positions.  The Minister has announced that he intends to table an amendment but that is only in the context of additional directors being appointed, like the chief financial officer or one or two others whom the Minister may wish to appoint.<\/p><p>  The Minister held the same view as me.  He once described the HSE as a dysfunctional and self-serving organisation.  I do not want to make overtly political points but that is the fact of the matter.  By virtue of this legislation the Minister is ensuring that the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 is bypassed and there will not be an open recruitment process whereby people would make an application, present their credentials and the best person would be selected.  This is not casting any aspersions on any individual who is entitled under this proposal to put his or her name forward.  With an issue of such importance and with such a large budget and such significant responsibilities being placed on people, surely there should be an open recruitment process.<\/p><p>  The Minister intends to abolish the HSE in the near future but in the meantime it has an onerous task, with which the Minister has charged it, to present a proper health Estimate every year to carry out the functions and the running of the HSE.  It is completely unacceptable.  I am amazed that more people are not concerned about this.  In the context of this and some of the provisions in section 7 with regard to the removal of directors, this is allowing the Minister extensive and sweeping powers.  It is making people who have very serious decisions to make beholden to the Minister.  To quote one section: &quot;The Minister may issue a direction to the Directorate in relation to the delegation of the Executive's functions to the Director General.&quot;  The Minister, by issuing a direction to the directorate, can bypass it, and the director can make the decision because of delegation of powers.<br \/>The Bill also states: &quot;The Minister may at any time remove an appointed director from office as a member of the Directorate if ... the removal of the person as an appointed director appears to the Minister to be necessary for the Directorate to perform its functions in an effective manner.&quot;  This goes to the heart of issues.  No Minister should have this authority, unless there are serious breaches of ethics and standards, to remove somebody of senior significance.  It is akin to giving the Minister authority to remove the Secretary General of a Department.  It is akin to giving the Minister authority to sack senior officials in the Department of Health.  I have major concerns about this.

These include managing and controlling the business of the HSE.  In these operational aspects of his or her role, the DG is answerable to the directorate as the governing authority for the HSE.  Section 16G(1) provides that in addition to his or her functions as a member of the directorate and as the chairperson of the directorate, the DG shall carry on, manage and control generally the administration and business of the HSE, perform such other functions as may be delegated to him or her by the directorate and perform such functions as may be assigned to him or her under this Act or any other enactment.<\/p><p>  Under section 16G(2), the DG is responsible to the directorate for the performance of his or her CEO type functions, that is, carrying on, managing and controlling generally the administration and business of the HSE, performing such functions as may be delegated to him or her by the directorate and preform such other functions as may be delegated to him or her by the directorate and perform such functions as may be assigned to him or her under this Act or any other enactment.  He or she is also responsible to the directorate for the implementation of its policies.<\/p><p>  However, under section 16G(3), this responsibility to the directorate does not apply to the DG's functions as a member of the directorate and as the chairperson of the directorate.  Legislation generally provides for a deputy to act in the absence of the CEO or when the office of CEO is vacant.  Section 16G(4) currently provides that in the extended absence of the DG or if the office of DG is vacant, the functions of the DG may be performed for such period not exceeding six months by an appointed director, that is, a member of the directorate designated by the Minister.  This came about in part because the Department did not want to give weight to the idea of a standing grade of deputy DG.  However, the HSE has expressed a concern that in any event there should be provision in the Bill for the DG to be able to nominate a stand in even where he or she is absent for only a short period.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 12 deals with the absence of the DG and a vacancy in the office of DG and provides for designation by the DG options and the Minister to address those situations.

The Minister is seeking to delete this but he did not refer to this in his commentary and it is not addressed in the substitute subsection, which states, \"may be performed by such appointed director as may be designated by the Director General from time to time, with the consent of the Minister\".  The DG might not be in a position to do so from time to time.  This is a loose and open provision.  We have had all sorts of time-related concerns in public life in recent years and I thought that was a particular protection that the Minister had presented initially because he was time constraining this provision.

However, on further reflection, there is a need to address absences by the DG that are not extended absences and it is important that even a short absence by the DG should not leave the executive without someone who could clearly and authoritatively exercise the important functions of the DG.  Given this proposed change to cover short absences, from an operational and practical perspective, the DG is better placed to designate someone to act in his or her absence.  However, such designation is subject to the consent of the Minister.  For completeness, when the DG returns to duty, the designated director automatically ceases to perform the functions of the DG.<\/p><p>  In the different scenario of a vacancy in the office of the DG, the amendment provides that the Minister will designate the appointed DG who will act in an interim capacity.  The designation of an appointed director to act as DG in the event of a vacancy is temporary.

The Bill allows a Minister to direct the director general to prepare and submit a service plan if the HSE has failed to submit a service plan in accordance with various provisions of the section.  This is based on a similar provision in the Health Act 2004 with regard to the CEO.  The intention of the 2004 Act was that the CEO would be directed to prepare and submit a service plan only if the HSE had not submitted one in the specified time period and not for other reasons.  This will be clarified by amendment No. 15.  Amendment No. 18 provides that the director general must comply with such a direction.<\/p><p>  With regard to amendment No. 16, section 31(8) of Health Act 2004 provides that within 21 days of receiving the service plan, the Minister must either approve it or issue a direction to amend it.  The Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill amends section 31.  Under the Bill the Minister must, having consulted with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, approve the service plan in the form in which is was submitted, or approve the service plan with such amendments as the Minister, having consulted with the HSE, may determine, or issue a direction to the HSE to amend the plan.  The Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill does not specify a time period within which the Minister must take one of these three steps.  To address this situation, amendment No. 16 provides that the Minister must act within 21 days of receiving the service plan from the HSE.  This time period is in line with current provisions in the 2004 Act.  For completeness, it is intended the requirement for the Minister to consult the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will be repealed in the legislation establishing the proposed child and family support agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013042300011#K00600","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1366737600,"counter":669,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 16:<blockquote><br \/>In page 19, line 36, to delete &quot;Subject to subsection (10)&quot; and substitute the following:&quot;Not later than 21 days after receiving a service plan under this section&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013042300011#K00800","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1366737600,"counter":671,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 17:<blockquote><br \/>In page 19, line 43, after &quot;Executive&quot; to insert the following:&quot;and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children&quot;.<\/blockquote>This is about consulting the committee and giving it a greater role.
