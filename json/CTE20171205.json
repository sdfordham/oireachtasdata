We will have the opportunity to go through the Supplementary Estimate line by line.  Essentially, it deals with salaries, superannuation, school transport and grants.<\/p> <p>  I will make two comments around teachers before we move to the Ministers.  One of the major needs we have at this point relates to substitute teachers.  The Minister should note that the committee has agreed to put this on the agenda for our first meeting after Christmas.  All the correspondence we have received indicates there is a crisis at this point.  The second point relates to equity in teachers' salaries.  That is something those of us in the committee feel strongly about and we have spoken at length about it.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy John Halligan, as well as their officials.  I thank them for attending and assisting our consideration of the Supplementary Estimate.  I thank them very much for the briefing material that was supplied and circulated to the members of the committee.<\/p> <p>  I propose that the following arrangements will apply to the debate.  I am going to invite the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, if he so wishes, to make some brief opening remarks.

Bringing forward the Lansdowne Road agreement has involved an extra cost of &euro;35 million, but that has been balanced by some savings in other areas.

Members will be aware that it is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The purpose of the school transport scheme is to transport to and from school children who reside a distance from their nearest school within available resources.  Children are eligible for school transport if they are attending their nearest school and meet the distance criteria, which is 3.2 km for primary school children and 4.8 km for post-primary children.  The outturn for 2016 was &euro;182 million and the cost of school transport provision in 2017 is &euro;190 million.<\/p> <p>  The key cost drivers for the increased cost of school transport is the increased demand for the transport of children with special needs.  To that end there has been an increase of 4,500 children with special needs availing of school transport services between 2012 and 2017, which is a significant increase.  The unit cost for special needs provision is approximately &euro;7,000 and the escort provision is &euro;9,000, as per the 2011 value for money report.  <\/p> <p>  The support for children with special needs available while on transport has increased from &euro;23 million in 2016 to &euro;25 million in 2017.  The demand for individual services for children increased from 1,032 taxis in 2016 to 1,115 taxis in 2017.  That is a significant cost and it is a complex operation of moving 112,000 children in buses and taxis.  Of course, the objective of the scheme is that every eligible child and every child who has special needs will be brought to their nearest school.  There are problems with those who travel on concession passes and I will take questions on some of the difficulties later on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017120500002#B00300","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1512489600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017120500002#B00400","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1512489600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>May I apologise in advance to the Chair and to the Minister and Minister of State as I will have to leave very shortly?<\/p> <p>  There is one stand-out figure in this particular Estimate, that is the more than doubling of the Estimate for the number of retirees from the teaching profession.

The actual number of retirees is not that different from last year.  There has not been a big surge.  Forecasting in this area is, as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan states, a difficulty.  People have discretion to retire between the ages of 55 years and 70 years.  There has been a difference in forecasting method as between our forecasts and those accepted.  I think the situation is that retirements are a steady feature.  I think 1,114 teachers will retire this year and the number of teacher retirements in the previous year was 1,168.  We do not have the figure broken out by subject, but I am sure I can give the committee the figure for the number of retirements at primary level which is 670 and 444 at secondary level.  The figure has been relatively stable.<\/p> <p>  The overall numbers graduating from initial teacher training is well in excess of those numbers and is well over 3,000.  We have been recruiting in the past couple of years.  I think the figure for recruitment of teachers was 2,900 in September 2017 and 2,400 in the previous September.  We are filling the vacant positions.  It is not the case that we cannot recruit the teachers, but there may be difficulty in the recruitment of teachers with specific subject areas.  We are looking at ways in which we can address those difficulties, particularly in the light of the need to address the tightness of supply of teachers with STEM subjects, foreign languages, home economics and Irish.<\/p><p>We are looking at initiatives in each of those areas to address the need to attract more people who study in those areas to teaching.  That is an issue that we are examining.

Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked about the variation for 2017, the &euro;7 million.  The total provision for the training fund in respect of 2017 was &euro;366 million.  The savings were due to the expenditure in both 2017 and 2016, some of which was reflected in SOLAS accounts.  The &euro;7 million relates to the apprenticeship programme of 2017 where some of the off-the-job provision on existing programmes and the introduction of some new apprenticeships was slower than expected.  The &euro;7 million was due to the recovery of the cash surplus of 2016 from the accounts of the education and training boards and that was declared in 2017.<\/p> <p>  On the apprentices themselves, we have already exceeded the 2017 target for registration of craft apprenticeships, which was way ahead.  We are unlikely to reach our target of 800 new registrations across 15 cumulative schemes in new apprenticeships this year.  To date, nine of the newer programmes are operational.  We are not that far behind.  We have initiated new apprenticeships in insurance practice, industrial electrical engineering, polymer processing technology, manufacturing technology, international financial services associate, international financial services specialist, commis chef and accounting technician, and two further programmes of ICT network engineer and software developer have been developed.<\/p> <p>  In general, from the downturn in apprenticeships during the recession to where we are today, the change is substantial.  The IT apprenticeships, in particular, have been substantially taken up.  Some are slow.

In general, I cannot let the opportunity go without raising the issue, as the Chair has referenced, of equal pay for equal work.  Our young teachers play a vital role.  They are highly skilled, specialised classroom practitioners with significant far-reaching responsibilities for our children on a daily basis.  They are being devalued.  The Minister spoke earlier about the recruitment in certain subjects.  We will continue to shed teachers from urban areas due to extraordinary high rents.  Their jobs simply are not allowing them continue teaching in the schools of their choice where they have permanent jobs.  They are leaving, which is not good for the students.  I would ask the Minister, not for the first time, to commit to the principle of equal pay for equal work and set out a timeframe.  I ask him to make that commitment and set out a timeframe.  It cannot be done overnight but to give respect to these young teachers, I ask him to set out a timeframe for implementation.<\/p> <p>  On the superannuation, the underestimation of those seeking to retire is worrying.  On a breakdown, does the Minister know if teachers retiring early?  As a former teacher, I looked to the more senior members of staff.  They play an extraordinarily important role in guiding a young teacher when he or she joins a staff.  Are they retiring before their time?  If so, has the Minister any idea why they are doing so?

We have also reached a point where the scales at higher levels are now identical.  Substantial progress has been made before the more recent agreement.<\/p> <p>  Under the most recent agreement, a settlement of &euro;900 million to be paid over the next three years was negotiated with the trade unions.  As the committee will be aware, that did not include provision for new entrants.  This was provision to provide increases across the board.<\/p> <p>  However, a process was established to look at the issue of new entrants' pay.  It is, as the Deputy states, a bigger concern for teachers' unions than for many of the other unions.  That process has started and there is full engagement by all of the teachers' unions in it.  While the provision of the &euro;900 million did not make any particular provision for new entrant pay, there is a process in negotiation.  Obviously, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is dealing with those negotiations because the new entrant pay issue applies not only to teachers but right across the public service.  It is not only a question of one Minister or one sector getting some deal.  It has to be negotiated in a way that applies to everyone.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of retirement, there has been a pattern for many years of teachers retiring before the mandatory age of 65.  This is not new.  Some 90% retire before their mandatory retirement age.  The pension scheme had been a feature.  There is a pension scheme where in early retirement there is not an actuarial reduction in the pension one draws and there are attractions in taking early retirement for some teachers.<\/p><p>This is not new.  There is no unusual outflow.  There were 1,114 last year and 1,168 this year.  Last year was higher, with the previous year being in or around 1,000.  The previous again was back up to 1,100.  It is a pretty steady pattern of around 1,100 over a number of years.  That is the pattern.  We do have to get better agreement between ourselves and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the forecasting model.  There is not a consensus on the forecasting model but work will be done to try to achieve that.<\/p><p> On the issue of SNAs, we have recruited about 1,000 in the each of the last years.  We have committed in the recent budget to recruit again around those numbers.  The difference this year is that, unlike previous years, we have provided for it in this year's Estimates for 2018.  As Deputy O'Sullivan will be aware, in previous years Ministers came to Cabinet in June looking for sanction for a newly assessed need.  It was not in the previous year's Estimates.  Now it is in the Estimates.  The advantage is we will be able to signal the allocation earlier in the year because we will not be waiting for Cabinet approval.  It will be better for schools to be able to plan in advance with this new approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017120500002#C01100","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512489600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Bruton, for that.  I am moving on to subhead A9 on school transport.  I refer to school transport for children with special needs to bring them to the place that best suits them.  I am dealing with a situation which I suggest is probably not atypical.  A child with an intellectual disability has been assigned to a particular school but has not been given transport.  There is a bus bringing a neighbouring child with an intellectual disability to the same school.  There are spaces on that bus.  However, there was a cut-off date for when children could access this particular transport.  The parent has to drive the child to the school every day and, essentially, follow the bus.

The difficulty we have all experienced, and that I have experienced since coming into this office, is the criteria laid down for the school transport scheme in legislation.  Every child with special needs can avail of school transport or a payment.  A special payment is made if a bus was not near the area.  he difficulty we have is with concessionaries.  The scheme initially was never set out for concessionaires.  It was set out for eligible children.  I will explain this with an example.  If we had a bus with 20 seats to take 16 people from a particular place to their nearest school, rather than leave the bus with four empty seats, we would fill that bus with concessionaries.  Difficulties then arose.  It became complex in the sense that once that bus had those 20 people - 16 eligible and four concessionaries - if an eligible child needed to use that bus we were obliged to make sure that child got transport on the bus.  The difficulty that has arisen since the school transport scheme was put in place and since we agreed to carry concessionaries is that there has been a dramatic increase in concessionaries from about 2,500 to well over 20,000 at this stage.  Financially, we do not have the wherewithal.  Concessionaries and eligible children increase in number every year.  The number of children with special needs increases every year.<\/p> <p>  We are obliged to carry every eligible child and every child that has special needs within the budget and the criteria laid down.  We are not obliged to carry concessionary children.  I may be wrong, but the three children the Deputy is talking about could be concessionaries.  I will look into the Deputy's case.  That is the difficulty with the scheme.  We are doing 100 million kilometres annually.  It is a complex detailed scheme.  There are 11,000 children with special needs and 4,500 vehicles in use daily.  We run into difficulties.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is the distance and geographical way to a school.  I am not in a position to determine that.  It has to be determined by Bus &Eacute;ireann, which transverses the route.  We allow Bus &Eacute;ireann to do that rather than the Minister or officials from the Department because we are not qualified to do that.  It can be complex and difficult and there can be issues in areas.  What we try to do is to meet every person, Minister and public representative who has an issue.  The officials do their best to meet them.  We have not failed to meet a public representative yet.  I have travelled to different parts of the country to meet public representatives if they cannot travel to me.  I do not like the idea of children not being able to get to school.  We do everything in our power.  The officials, to be fair to them, try to tweak and twist the scheme as much as possible within the legislation and the criteria laid down.  We have difficulties with concessionaries and we will have into the future.  They are not eligible for the school transport scheme.  However, we can talk to the Deputy about his issue.  That is no problem at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017120500002#D01200","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1512489600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017120500002#D01300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1512489600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>The school transport system is very good generally, when it is possible to get it.

A basic lack of common sense seems to surround most of the school transport issues.  The school bus I am referring to is not full so there are other kids who could potentially avail of it.  There is an issue around the nearest school rule.  For example, in Kilkenny city, it is difficult to get a secondary school place.<\/p><p>Therefore, many children, by default, are going outside the city to go to secondary school, and parents are then told they are sending their child outside the catchment area.

I want to make it clear that if a student cannot get to the nearest school and is eligible for school transport, the student is entitled to get to the next closest school.  We attempt to review the scheme every year before the beginning of the school year to determine how many extra children are coming onto the scheme, including the number of concessionaires and special needs children, the number of carers of children with special needs, the number of buses and taxis and so on.

This is very frustrating for schools and many schools have contacted me.  One, a developing school, is delighted to have a brand new premises but it is spending 70% of its capitation on heating the school because, as a developing school, it gets the same funding as a small school in rural Ireland.  The principal found the school was tapping into the money for books for next year to pay for salaries for cleaning and for heating.  Are there any plans to announce the allocation sooner?

From having spoken to a number of principals and boards of management - I am sure everybody has done the same - I understand small grants are being drip fed throughout the year.  From a school planning point of view, it would be much easier if at the end of the school year in June or July every school had a sense of what they would have for the next 12 months.  That would allow them to plan appropriately.  To a certain extent, I include some grants outside of the control of the Department, such as the sports capital grant.

As I understand it, rent paid to another school is met from the normal capitation with which schools are provided.  There is no arrangement whereby schools submit applications for extra funding based on rising rents.  There is a capitation scheme.<\/p> <p>  The minor works grant was, I understand, introduced a number of years ago to avoid individual applications for smaller works, such as replacing windows and so on.  The system was unwieldy and required individual applications.  It was not intended to meet heating needs.  It is for minor capital works and comes from the capital budget.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy McLoughlin, the figure is &euro;5,500 per school, plus &euro;18.50 per pupil.  It is weighted more towards smaller schools.  Every school receives a certain amount.  That has been the traditional position.  The reality is that we are running really hard with our capital budget just to keep up with the population bulge.  Each year we are now providing about 15,000 new school places and 5,000 replacement places.  That has reflected a population bulge going through primary and now secondary schools.  We have had to prioritise that.  The minor works grants and other schemes have tended to involve residual amounts of money.<\/p> <p>  A case can be made for establishing the minor works grant on a more permanent basis.  In terms of the medium-term capital plans, I would strongly argue for that so there is more certainty for schools about what is coming their way.  At this stage it is competing for scarce capital money with new builds.  In anticipation of the level of new build next year, we do not see that the 2018 budget will be able to provide &euro;29 million next year and still meet commitment to building projects which are underway.  We are trying to manage the available resources.<\/p> <p>  The point about prefabs is well made, but the reality is that if we approve a new school for opening under a constrained capital budget we will not build a 16 class school if only one stream is coming in.  There tends to be prefabs for a number of years and the build is then stitched through thereafter.  That is why an extra amount has been allocated. A number of schools have projects in the pipeline and more money is being provided for one reason or another.<\/p> <p>  I can see the point the Chairman is making on the economics of prefabs.  In a capital constrained environment, we have to decide whether we build prefabs at a cost of &euro;11,000 for an 80 sq m construction or build a permanent structure at a cost of &euro;100,000.  We can meet the short-term need more quickly and at about one-ninth of the cost of a permanent structure.  Places are being provided more quickly.  If we need to make sure every child has a place to go to, prefabs are a part of the rational provision of space.  In the longer-term, we would like prefabs to be done away with and. I understand a scheme will start in 2019 to systematically replace prefabs.  That is built into the capital budget to 2021.  There will always be an element of meeting short-term needs with prefabs.  They are relatively cheap to provide, but only have a certain life span.  We are trying to balance needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017120500002#F00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1512489600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

In general, we have to recognise those who are in non-teaching roles and do what we can to support them because many of them are not paid adequately.<\/p> <p>  On the SOLAS grants, I thought we would have been in a situation where the Minister needed more money rather than giving money back to this.  There should be more flexibility to be creative if there is extra money.  For example, this committee spoke to the young people who represented Ireland at the WorldSkills Competition in Abu Dhabi.  They were fantastic and won seven medals between them.  A suggestion I made at that stage was that we should look at promoting these types of apprenticeships and skills, with such things as the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition.  That has raised the bar for young people studying science.  We need to do the same.  I know that SOLAS have a stand at the National Ploughing Championships.  That is nearly the biggest space to be able to encourage and showcase what is happening.  Could money be spent on different things like that rather than just not spending it?  I support the views of my colleague on the question of SUSI grants.  Surely if there is money in the pot it should be used in other ways to promote those who maybe did not get it in the first round?  If there is extra money, it should go back into that.  I appreciate that it would take a lot of time and resources but I think it would be worth doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017120500002#G00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1512489600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I will address apprenticeships first.  In general, we were coming from a poor place with apprenticeships.  I will start with construction, which has been mentioned.  Those would have been known as the basic apprenticeships.  That is not to degrade the job itself but the basic apprenticeships at the time were bricklaying, cabinet-making, carpentry, plastering and so on.  In the boom, we found that many employers, in the rush to build hotels, houses and so on, really did not take on the apprentices that would have been taken on in the 1950s, 1960s and so on and did not implement the same measures to address the need for apprenticeships.  One would often see bricklayers or carpenters being bussed or flown in from other countries.  There is nothing wrong with it and I am not arguing with it.  I am delighted that people can come to work in Ireland.  It did some damage to apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>  I am looking at some of the figures I have here on brick and stonelaying, plumbing, stone masonry and so on.  There has been an increase.  I do not know what the figure was in 2015 or 2014 - I can find it - but we have gone from 4,172 to 5,256 in 2017.  Much of that relates to collaboration with employers, companies and so on, and exploring the necessity of having apprenticeships and pushing forward.  Deputy McLoughlin mentioned commis chef positions.  There are indications that we will need 8,000 chefs if the economy keeps growing as it is expected to grow over the next number of years.  There are complications in chef training.  We all know about them.  I have met some young commis chefs who do not like the job and find the long hours prohibitive along with the money not being great.  It is not everybody's forte to cook so that is a difficulty that we have and there is no question about it.  We are looking into that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned skills.  We have a new skills package that will respond to the national skills shortages.  The priority needs will be identified by the employer.  We have what we call the national skills fora, which operate around the country and engage, consult and collaborate with employers about the skills that are necessary in particular areas.  That has been quite successful.  I mentioned earlier that we would have had very few apprenticeships in the financial sector.  We moved from zero to 27 to 207 this year.  That would have included toolmaking, polymer processing, technology, pipefitting, metal fabrication, manufacturing engineering and so on.  In the financial sector, there are accountancy technicians, insurance practitioners and so on and we have found it to be quite successful because of the introduction of new apprenticeships.  There is a slow uptake of the new type of apprenticeships but we think that the signs for them are good, looking at what has been achieved over the last years.  We hope that Springboard will be part of that.  We all know how Springboard operates and we hope for Springboard to have an additional 1,000 places in it in 2018.  The signs for apprenticeships are good and I have just received the overall total.  Overall, we had 10,185 apprenticeships in 2016.  We are now up to 12,406 in 2017.  It is not a huge increase but it is significant.  I have before me data on all the different apprenticeships in electrical work, engineering, printing paper, motor trades, hospitality and so on.  Perhaps the Deputies might look at the information.  I think it would be interesting.  Overall, apprenticeships are dramatically on the increase, coming from the very bad place we were at.  Could one say that is a dramatic increase?  It was 2,500 from 2016 to 2017.  It is not bad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017120500002#G00300","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1512489600,"counter":77,"content":"<p>It is all right if one looks at the percentages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2017120500002#G00400","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1512489600,"counter":78,"content":"<p>The percentages are pretty good.

There has been a small drop-off in the number of students getting grants.  They are down by about 1,700 compared to last year so there has been a bit of a reduction.<\/p><p>Roughly 22,000 students are on the non-adjacent rate, while 19,000 are on the ordinary rate.

The difficulty is where one has a criterion and the distance is 45 km, if one changes the figure, it will significantly change the cost.  One has to do it as part of a scheme and announce it at the beginning of the year in order that everybody will know where he or she stands.  I cannot change the distance arbitrarily when the scheme is showing some savings because in other areas of the Estimate we do not have a saving.<\/p><p> In October we make our best stab at what the take-up will be of different schemes and fund them on that basis.

Roughly half of all students qualify for some student contribution.  This year the limit is &euro;79,000.

Today, I am accompanied by departmental officials Ms Mary Hurley, Mr. Maurice Coughlan, Ms Nina Murray, Ms Theresa Donohue and Ms Janet Jacobs.  The committee will recall that during November, we discussed a Revised Estimate for my Department that did two things.  First, it took account of the transfer of community functions from my Department to the newly established Department of Rural and Community Development; and second, it reflected the Government decision on the future funding model for Irish Water and made provision for the refund of water charge payments made by domestic customers.  With these changes, the revised budget for my Department in 2017 was set at &euro;1.995 billion.  I am today bringing forward for consideration by the committee a proposal for a Supplementary Estimate that will provide an additional &euro;92 million to fund the local authority housing capital programme and &euro;8 million for the National Regeneration Programme.  This additional &euro;100 million will see the housing budget for my Department increase to &euro;1.4 billion for 2017.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, when attending the committee on 15 November last, I set out the position regarding spending on the Vote in 2017 and indicated how the spend was being kept under close review in my Department as we move towards year-end.  I also indicated that my Department was continuing to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as required, in finalising the position on the Vote for 2017.  It is clear that very significant momentum is now building up on the local authority housing capital programme.  Local authorities are responding to the housing challenges in their areas by accelerating delivery and progress in terms of advancing social housing projects on site is strong.  In line with the targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland, local authorities are now engaged in large-scale construction activity throughout the country, with well over 700 developments advancing through various stages across the country at the end of the second quarter this year.  This increased momentum will follow through into 2018, when there will be a further quantum leap in housing funding and delivery, with the Government making over &euro;1.9 billion available for housing programmes next year.<\/p> <p>  Today we must deal with the impact of this momentum in 2017.  Additional capital funding is now required to meet commitments arising from increased activity, including the costs associated with the accelerated delivery of social housing units; the provision of family hubs and other emergency accommodation for homeless families and those who are sleeping rough; and acquisition opportunities, which are being taken up as they arise and where they represent good value for money and do not adversely impact on local housing markets.  Originally, &euro;264 million in Exchequer funding was provided for local authority construction and acquisition activity in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2017.  Taking into account also &euro;35 million that has been re-allocated from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, LIHAF, &euro;50 million in surplus local property tax receipts and the &euro;92 million now sought in additional Exchequer funding, the total available for the main local authority construction and acquisition programme in 2017 will amount to approximately &euro;440 million.<\/p> <p>  The target for 2017 is to deliver over 21,000 new social housing supports and I am confident we will significantly exceed this target under the various housing delivery programmes.  As we move towards end of year, my Department is working closely with local authorities and approved housing bodies in all aspects of housing delivery and housing outputs for 2017.  Once these have been finalised, I will revert to the committee on activity and final 2017 outputs early in the new year.<\/p> <p>  Supplementary funding of &euro;8 million is also required to ensure continued activity under the National Regeneration Programme this year.  This will support the increased construction activity currently under way in Dublin and Limerick, along with ensuring that the programme of social and economic initiatives central to the regeneration programme also continues to be supported.  Approximately 150 new social houses at least will be delivered this year under the regeneration programme.  With the additional funding now proposed, the total Vote for my Department will amount to &euro;2.095 billion in 2017.  I am, of course, happy to discuss the details of the Supplementary Estimate with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017120500002#B00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1512484200,"counter":99,"content":"<p>With regard to subhead A3, there is a proposed increased to &euro;356 million.

I cannot give the Deputy a final figure because under the heading of acquisition we are trying to deal with some bank-led vacancies.  All of it has not been achieved to date.  Early in January I hope to be able to outline in detail exactly we landed in 2017.  It will mean that when we start 2018 we will know exactly from where we are coming.  In that way, we will be coming from an informed position and Deputies will then be able to judge how realistic our targets for 2018 are and whether we will need to re-balance some of them.  At the end of the year we will be able to see that in almost every category we exceeded our targets for the year.  In some areas we will have exceeded them by a good deal.  At the beginning of next year we might then look to see whether the committee agrees in respect of the additional units to be delivered under certain programmes, whether we should be looking to re-prioritise elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin asked how many units had tenants.  Obviously, that is the responsibility of the local authorities.  In the course of replying to questions in the House on Thursday we will talk about the recent work done on the numbers on social housing lists.  I have given a commitment to Deputies and councillors that I will write to every local authority to inform it of its targets for next year and beyond.  There will be another housing summit in January.  I have already indicated that at the summit I will go through the targets and exactly how they are to be achieved.

I presume repossessions are in there somewhere.  The Minister is saying, however, that by the end of September 1,300 of those were delivered.  Is he saying now that the remainder, the difference between the 4,300 social housing units he told us about earlier this year, and the 1,300 delivered by September will be delivered in the final three months of this year?

Obviously, the &euro;70 million Housing Agency scheme is the principal one.  As of a couple of months ago, the State, in all its forms, was in the process of purchasing only 600 of these 1,800 units, however.  I raised this with the Minister of State, Deputy English, last week during a debate.  Given the rise in homelessness, is the Minister satisfied that 600 units is an appropriate number?  Is there a need for the Department to look at those lists to see if there are other properties, given the additional expenditure we are discussing, to ensure no property is missed or overlooked?<\/p> <p>  These are turnkey, ready-to-go properties from banks, funds, etc.  During the recent debate, the Minister of State, Deputy English, gave an undertaking to examine this.  We had suggested it might be worthwhile bringing this list to the committee and into private session next week in order that we could have a robust discussion about those units, where they are, and why some are not being purchased.  Clearly, not all of them will be purchased, as there will be issues around location, price and quality of build.  However, given the housing crisis, one third of the 1,800 units seems to be low.  The length of time taken to purchase them is also a concern, as many of these were offered by banks last year.  Is the Minister satisfied this process is working speedily and thoroughly enough?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017120500002#E00800","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1512484200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>When we had a housing summit in September, local authority chiefs brought it to my attention about bank-led vacancy, where there was vacant stock in the possession of the banks which they felt they could bring into use for social housing.

Are there other units which could be looked at again and purchased?  My understanding is that the two figures the Minister has just announced represent the upper limit of what has been purchased from that 1,800.

Should the Government issue guidelines on the use of the national anthem?  If so, what matters should be covered or not covered?  Should this include reference to when it is appropriate to play the national anthem, or restrictions around this?  Should there be legislation introduced in respect of the national anthem?  If so, what should this provide for?  Should the national anthem be officially enshrined in legislation?  If so, what versions of the music and words should be used and in what languages?  Should the use of the national anthem be legally restricted through the process of copyright or otherwise?  What should be classed as misuse of the national anthem?  How should this be decided and who should enforce it?  Should the use of the national anthem for commercial purposes, such as for advertising, be restricted?  Would charging money for a recording of the national anthem by an artist be classed as using it for commercial purposes?  What penalties should be put in place if any proposed restrictions are breached and what form should these take?

He will give us a history of the Army's association with the national anthem.  The Army is custodian of our national anthem and has been since the foundation of the State.

His submission is important because it will give us a comprehensive history of the State's involvement with the national anthem.<\/p><p> Joseph Nugent is the chief administrative officer at Garda headquarters but he is here today in his capacity as the former director of the passport service.  He was involved in ensuring that the lyrics of the national anthem have been included in the passport.  His submission outlines how and why the national anthem was chosen to be showcased in the passport as a representative symbol for all Irish men and women.<\/p><p> Conal Kearney is a grandson of Peader Kearney.  He will read into the record an affidavit on the national anthem given by his grandfather in 1926 and outline other key issues around the national anthem.<\/p><p> Councillor Niall Ring is a councillor from Dublin City Council.  He is a grand-nephew of Liam Ring who translated the \"Soldier's Song\" into \"Amhr&aacute;n Na bhFiann\".  Councillor Ring's submission is important as it connects the history of the national anthem with one of the families central to it.<\/p><p> Raymond Daly is an author of historical songbooks.  His submission will outline the importance of legislation and copyright.  He will talk about the need for the Department of Education and Skills to make the teaching of the national anthem part of the primary school curriculum.  He also recommends that sporting organisations should encourage players to learn the words of the national anthem.<\/p><p> I thank all our guests for their attendance.  On 1 January 2013, some 70 years after the death of Peadar Kearney, the national anthem fell out of copyright protection and is therefore no longer protected by the laws of the land.  I introduced the National Anthem (Protection of Copyright and Related Rights) (Amendment) Bill which would ensure, for the first time, that the national anthem would receive official formal legislative recognition and protection.  I also suggested that we carry out this Seanad public consultation process to get the people's views on what should happen with our national anthem.  In the second session, we will hear from students, the Department of Finance and experts in patent and copyright law.<\/p><p> Finally, when this public consultation process is completed I will produce a report and, if necessary, draft legislation, guidelines and protocols for the people's song, our national anthem, \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#A00300","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512468000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir domsa, mar Ard-Mh&eacute;ara Chorca&iacute;, a bheith anseo ar maidin.

He began a programme of visiting all the schools in the city.  Every Lord Mayor since then has continued that programme.  I continued it in September and October last by visiting 85 schools in Cork.<\/p> <p>  I went to school at the North Monastery school in Cork and every morning, at 8.55 a.m., just before school began, the Christian Brothers gathered all the pupils around as the Tricolour was raised.  Every pupil sang \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" before entering their classroom.  Around the flagpole there were 16 rose bushes which were dedicated to the memory of the 16 Irish Volunteers who died on Easter Sunday.  That memory is instilled in me since I went to school in the North Monastery so many years ago.  When I took office as Lord Mayor, I wished to make the connection between the visitation of the schools started by Terence McSweeney and the learning of the national anthem, as occurred at the North Monastery.  I therefore distributed the national anthem, \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\", to every school and asked the principals and teachers of the schools to ensure that the pupils learned the national anthem in advance of my visit to the school.  The response was tremendous.  When I arrived at each school I was greeted by the pupils at the entrance of the school under the Tricolour, and every pupil sang \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" on my arrival.  I thank each of the schools in Cork city for supporting my initiative.<\/p> <p>  It is important in 2017, following the commemorations of 1916, that each of us stands to full attention when singing \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\", whether it is in Croke Park, the Aviva Stadium, Pairc U&iacute; Chaoimh, Pairc U&iacute; Rinn or Thomond Park, regardless of what sporting occasion we are attending.  Not only should we stand to attention, but we should sing the anthem in full.  Players, officials and spectators should sing the national anthem in unison to the end.  It is the song that unites us, as Senator Mark Daly said.  The response I have received is very positive.  It was with great pride I was able to produce and publicise, in conjunction with the chief executive of the education and training board, ETB, Mr. Ted Owens, the bookmark I am holding.  It has now been distributed to each school.  In conjunction with my colleagues in Cork City Council, including Mr. Paul Moynihan, director of corporate affairs, and the ETB we have ensured that the legacy of \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" is solid in each of the schools in Cork city.<\/p><p>It is an ongoing conversation.  It has sparked various discussions and debates about what Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann is.  I welcome that.  When I heard of the public consultation from my colleague, Senator Mark Daly, I was delighted to accept the invitation to be part of the process of the public consultation.<\/p><p> From my experience, I would recommend that we do not have any changes to Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann.  I welcome the guidelines, and thank the Members of the House for the programme they are developing to ensure that the national anthem is held in high esteem as part of the heritage and legacy of our country.  I am delighted to be here this morning to make this presentation as part of this historic moment.

I apologise for the broadcast quality; I am suffering from the remains of a virus.  I ask that the committee be patient.<br\/><br\/>I listened with great interest to Councillor Tony Fitzgerald's account of singing Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann in school.  As an aside, being a member of the Church of Ireland I was not taught the national anthem in primary school in the late 1960s, early 1970s.  When I joined the Scout Association as a young boy I learned it as b&eacute;arla.  There is a nice symmetry to the fact that I appear to be the <i>de facto<\/i>custodian of the official version of the anthem - or should I say unofficial version.  <br\/><br\/>The official adoption by the Irish State of the song entitled &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot; as the national anthem followed a somewhat tortuous route.  I am indebted to Dr. Karol Mullaney-Dignam, whose doctoral thesis, &quot;State, Nation and Music in Independent Ireland, 1922-1951&quot; has provided much detail backed up by primary sources from State archives.  Information has also been provided by an article written by Ms Ruth Sherry, Professor of English at the University of Trondheim in Norway.  <br\/><br\/>The words of &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot; were written either in late 1909 or early 1910.  We know this from the affidavit, already referred to, from Peadar Kearney, dated August 1926.  Peadar Kearney was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, IRB, and an author of many popular songs and verses.  It is understood that the music, written by Patrick Heeney, was written around the same time.  The original text was in English and was first published in Bulmer Hobson's <i>Irish Freedom <\/i>in 1912.  The song was adopted as a marching song by the Irish Volunteers in 1913 and after the Rising became the anthem of the independence movement.  By general account, it was in the internment camps after the Easter Rising that The Soldier's Song became widely used.  The song consequently became strongly associated with the army after the establishment of the Free State<b>.  <\/b><br\/><br\/><b><\/b>During the years following the establishment of the Free State there was no officially adopted national anthem.  Thomas Moore's &quot;Let &Eacute;ireann Remember&quot; was often played on formal occasions abroad, and T.D. Sullivan's &quot;God Save Ireland&quot; was favoured by the Irish Parliamentary Party.  It was the participation of Irish athletes at the 1924 Olympic Games which initially raised the question of a suitable national anthem for the newly independent State.  On the recommendation to W.T. Cosgrave, President of the Executive Council, by Se&aacute;n Lester, director of publicity at the Department of External Affairs, &quot;Let &Eacute;ireann Remember&quot; was played at the 1924 Olympic Games.  In his recommendation, he mentioned &quot;A Nation Once Again&quot; and &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot;, which in his opinion were not suitable for the purpose.  This would indicate that both of these songs were in current usage in the absence of an officially adopted national anthem.<br\/><br\/>The involvement of the Defence Forces School of Music - or the Army School of Music, as it was at the time - was key in this story.  Colonel Wilhelm Fritz Brase, the first director of the Defence Forces School of Music, was appointed by the Irish Government in 1923 to establish a music service for the Irish Army.  The first performance of the newly formed Army No. 1 Band took place in the Theatre Royal, Dublin, in October 1923.  He had arrived in the country in April 1923, so that was quite an achievement.  Four months after the first concert the band performed again in the Theatre Royal in Dublin.  On that occasion, following requests for an encore, the band obliged with the recent composition of Colonel Brase, entitled &quot;Irish March No. 1&quot;.  This medley included songs such as &quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot;, &quot;Who Fears to Speak of '98?&quot; and &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot;.  It is understood that members of the audience, including the Governor General of the Irish Free State, Timothy Healy, and the head of the Executive Council, W.T. Cosgrave, stood up on the playing of &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot; in recognition of the song as an anthem.  <br\/><br\/>Between 1924 and 1926 it appears that the music of &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot; was informally adopted by the Government for use as an anthem.  In 1926 the Government of the Free State was compelled to make a formal decision on the anthem following requests from the United States of America for the supply of printed copies of Ireland's official anthem.  The minutes of an Executive Council meeting on 12 July 1926 indicate that a decision was made to adopt &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot; as the official anthem.  This decision was not formally promulgated at the time but was simply put into effect for official purposes.  In 1926 <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported that when the Governor General visited the Dublin Horse Show &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot; was played.  The version of &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot; played by the Army No. 1 Band was that arranged by Colonel Brase.  The custom was for the song to commence with the verse followed by the refrain, which we recognise today as Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann.  <br\/><br\/>In 1928, Desmond Fitzgerald, Minister for Defence, wrote to the Executive Council, suggesting that some changes be made to the national anthem.  In his memo to the council, dated 19 October 1928, he offered the opinion that it was, &quot;too long to permit of the words being generally known and sung by the people&quot;.  He was correct in that.  Fitzgerald suggested to the Cabinet that the Irish national anthem open with its refrain - that which we are familiar with today - and be published and taught as such.  He added that Colonel Brase could be asked to arrange it for school singing in one, two, three and four voices.  Colonel Brase was tasked with the rearrangement, and the Executive Council approved his version as played by the Army No. 1 Band.  <br\/><br\/>The band was recorded by His Master's Voice, which became the record label HMV, performing a number of pieces in the Theatre Royal in 1931, including the national anthem.  The anthem was recorded in two versions; firstly the long version, commencing with the verse, and secondly the short version, which consisted of the refrain.  That recording of the refrain was used for many years - up to the 1970s or 1980s - by theatres and cinemas at the close of entertainments.  In 1932 it was agreed that the short version of the anthem, as recorded by Colonel Brase by HMV in 1931, should be recognised as the official arrangement played by places of entertainment.  It was also agreed that Colonel Brase would be commissioned to prepare instrumental parts for the short version of the anthem for bands and orchestras in order to secure uniformity in the playing of the anthem throughout the country.  <br\/><br\/>The current arrangement of the national anthem used by Defence Forces bands was made by a former director of the Defence Forces School of Music, Colonel James R. McGee.  Colonel McGee acted as director between 1987 and 1988.  Not only did McGee rearrange the Irish anthem, but he scored many international anthems for modern instrumentation for use by army bands.  These arrangements are still in use today at events such as the Dublin Horse Show and visits of foreign Heads of State.  They are robust and stand up to outdoor usage.  Colonel McGee also scored a number of ceremonial salutes used by the military for full military bands which have not been improved upon and which are still used.  Colonel McGee's rearrangement of the national anthem, if it could be described as a rearrangement, is minimal.  He retained Brase's essential harmonic structure while simplifying much of the high woodwind, which in Brase's version was fast moving and not always effective outdoors.  Band instrumentation had changed over the decades, and Colonel McGee adjusted this accordingly.  Colonels McGee and Brase's arrangements are essentially one and the same, having no material difference from a musicological point of view<br\/><br\/>The music adopted by the Executive Council on 12 July 1926 as the Irish national anthem, as performed by the Army No. 1 Band, remains substantially the same as that performed today.  As Senator Daly has mentioned, I have provided full scores of the Brase and McGee versions for the information of the committee.  I note that one of the objectives of the committee is to decide whether the anthem should be enshrined in the Constitution, like other national symbols such as the harp and the flag.  I am not speaking for the Defence Forces, but I would personally agree with doing that.  It is important to secure it for the State in the future.<\/p><p>I would be happy to advise on the actual musical arrangement to be adopted.  If it is formally adopted, the musical arrangement would have to be determined at the same time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Armstrong","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Armstrong.

It is a real privilege for me to speak on this important issue.  I currently hold the role of chief administrative officer in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but, from 2009 to 2015, I had the privilege of holding the role of director of passport services at the Passport Office.  One of the highlights of my time in that office included the redesign of the Irish passport book, aimed at improving primarily the security features in the book itself but also creating a design that would be reflective of what it means to be Irish in a broad sense.  We looked at themes that would reflect the interest of the population in the State while also recognising the many Irish passport holders around the world.  The Irish passport book incorporates iconic images and symbols representative of the Irish State, including the musical notation of the national anthem, &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;.  On the top left hand page of each page of the book, one can follow the bars of the anthem's chorus, providing a unique design component.  Most importantly, the anthem was selected to be representative of what it means to be Irish.  I have some sample pages, which I am more than happy to leave with the committee secretariat.  The use of the anthem music notation has been the subject of much comment from Irish citizens worldwide.  The anthem strikes a chord with the Irish diaspora, reminding them of their rich sense of Irish roots manifest through the most audible national symbol, &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;.  Its inclusion in the passport design was seen as providing a key recognition by the State of the importance of the anthem to Irishmen and Irishwomen ar fud an domhain.  The feedback on its inclusion has been hugely positive.<br\/><br\/>In using the anthem as one of the persistent features, the design sought to place it as a recurring theme through the Irish passport book itself.  The other features take the holder of an Irish passport on a journey from the Cliffs of Moher to the modern perspective of Dublin city Liffey-side finishing at the back with the Rock of Cashel.  All told, the anthem is a constant element to link the Irish citizen, through his or her passport book, with a fundamental symbol of being Irish.<br\/><br\/>In making the decision to include music notation, there could only be one piece of music which could attract the endorsement of the State .  That could only be &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;<font color=\"#545454\">.  This is an<\/font>iconic piece of music, which brings Irish citizens to their feet and prompts men remove their caps, that is recognised by Irish citizens, one and all, and must be respected and protected.  Respect shown to our anthem by Irish citizens is something we should cherish and protect.  We must ensure that it could never be shown disrespect.  The inclusion of the anthem in the passport book is one element of formal State recognition.  Its protection, I would recommend, should be enshrined in some formal way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joseph Nugent"},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nugent and invite, Mr. Conal Kearney, a grandson of Peadar Kearney, the author of the national anthem, to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#D00400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512468000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for allowing me, a grandson of Peadar Kearney, to speak today on Peadar Kearney, the author of the &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot;, &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;.<font color=\"#545454\">  <\/font>My grandfather was a visionary and revolutionary who fought in Jacob's factory in 1916 under Commandant Thomas MacDonagh.  He was a member of the Supreme Council of the IRB and the Irish Gaelic League.  I have an affidavit he wrote in August 1926, which will be placed on the record, in which he outlined when the wrote the words of &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot;, which was late 1910 and not 1907 as is widely believed.  This is a primary document which can be inspected.  Please allow me, as a grandson of Peadar Kearney, to indulge in my thoughts.<br\/><br\/>Our identity as a nation and as citizens of the Irish State is defined by our history.  &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot;, &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;, links us to our history and therefore our identity.  There are stand-out moments in our distant and recent history that strengthen our bond to &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot;, &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;, when it is played and sung.  It was sung by the volunteers as they marched into the GPO on Easter Monday of 1916 when Pearse proclaimed a free and independent Ireland.  It was played at all gatherings, including sporting occasions, in cinemas and even at dances.  We knew the dance was over when we stood to attention at the end.  We are also reminded of more formal and State occasions when it is played.  My personal proud moment was in Croke Park when it was the venue for the international rugby match between Ireland and England in 2007.  There was a degree of nervousness and anticipation as to how the spectators would react when &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; was played in this hallowed place.  Those spectators stood silent and respectful and when &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot; was played, 82,000 of them sang it loudly and proudly.  It was an electrifying moment.  As the camera panned the faces of the Irish rugby players, tears flowed freely down some of their faces.<br\/><br\/>I am also reminded of the first State visit of the British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, when she bowed and stood in respect in the Garden of Remembrance as &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot; was played, saluting all those who died for the cause of Irish freedom.<br\/><br\/>These were moments when, in my opinion, when we, as a nation, came of age and that enshrine &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot; as part of our identity as proud Irish citizens.  I will read a paragraph from the affidavit signed by my grandfather and written in 1926:<\/p><blockquote>I wrote [The Soldier's Song] early in 1910 or late in 1909.  Working on the words Paddy Heeney (died 1911) composed the melody or music now being played as the National Anthem.  Obviously it was the words and what they stood for that appealed to the rapidly growing mass of people as the national movement developed.  It was a common thing to hear the song sung through the country years before the melody was published and when singers hadn't the slightest idea of the music.<br \/><br \/>In the train of the words the music spread and so became what we all know.  Melody and words were essential to each other.  Separate they would have ceased to exist years ago.<\/blockquote> <p>I believe both the English and Irish versions of &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;, &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot;, must be given the respect, dignity and protection they so rightfully deserves.  I am also reminded of the French title for &quot;<i>La Marseillaise<\/i>&quot;, their national anthem, is &quot;<i>l'Hymne National<\/i>&quot;.  &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;, &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot; is our hymn and must be legally protected for our future generations.<br\/><br\/>I have a manuscript in which my grandfather, in his elegant hand, wrote another verse to &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot; while interned in Ballykinlar internment camp in 1921.  The verse reads:<\/p><blockquote>In valley green, on towering crag,<br \/><br \/>Our fathers fought before us,<br \/><br \/>And conquered 'neath the same old flag<br \/><br \/>That's proudly floating o'er us.<br \/><br \/>We're children of a fighting race,<br \/><br \/>That never yet has known disgrace,<br \/><br \/>And as we march, the foe to face,<br \/><br \/>We'll chant a soldier's song.Signed - Peadar &Oacute; Cearnaigh, Ballykinlar, November 1921.<\/blockquote> <p>Go raibh maith agaibh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conal Kearney"},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I thank Mr Conal Kearney.

Is &uacute;dar m&oacute;r br&oacute;id dom an ceangal at&aacute; agam leis.  Th&aacute;inig an tri&uacute;ir fear at&aacute; bainteach leis &oacute; thuaisceart l&aacute;r na cathrach, an &aacute;it inar rugadh agus t&oacute;gadh mise.

Let me outline the background of Liam Ring or Liam &Oacute; Rinn, as he became known.<\/p><p>He was born and reared in Sackville Gardens in Ballybough in the north inner city, less than 100 m from Croke Park, as Mr. Kearney mentioned so eloquently.  His four brothers, including my grandfather Joseph, Leo, Christopher and Patrick, were members of C company of the second battalion of the Irish Volunteers that took part in the Easter rebellion of 1916 as part of the GPO garrison.  They were all subsequently interned in Frongoch and Liam was also interned at Ballykinler during the War of Independence.  He was with Peadar Kearney in a famous photograph at Ballykinler.<br\/><br\/>Although he left formal education at 14, again in a connection with Peadar Kearney, they both went to St. Joseph's school in Fairview.  He worked for the Gaelic League before becoming a member of staff at the translation department in the Oireachtas.  He was chief translator there at the time of his death in 1943.  In his spare time he was a prolific writer in Irish under the pen name Coinneach.  He won the President's Prize in 1941 and was a translator of major works into Irish.  He was a linguist, speaking ten languages, and an accomplished artist, with his paintings accepted for exhibition in the Royal Hibernian Academy.  His life and work was the subject of Scoil Gheimhridh Cumann Merriman in 1985.<br\/><br\/>Given this background, I point out some of the contextual inaccuracies in the committee's briefing documentation.  The major disappointment is that the role of Liam Ring in translating &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot; to &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot; was not mentioned.  I would argue the role of Peadar Kearney, Patrick Heeney and Liam &Oacute; Rinn should be highlighted equally.  They are a triumvirate of men from the north inner city, all living within 200 yards of one another and responsible for our national anthem.  My constituents in the north inner city and the people of the North Inner City Folklore Project set the example of recognising the triumvirate responsible for the national anthem by erecting a plaque in 2011 to mark the centenary of the death of Patrick Heeney.  It is on the corner of Railway Street and Gardiner Street.  Patrick Heeney died in 1911, although the committee mentions that he received payments in respect of the national anthem.  I do not think he could have or the State did.  Patrick Heeney died penniless in Railway Street.<br\/><br\/>My grand-uncle, Liam Ring, never sought or received payment for his translation work as he did it as a contribution to the fledgling State.  He did not, as some suggest, do the translation as part of his employment, as he started working on the translation while in Frongoch in 1916.  It was mentioned earlier by Senator Daly and Mr. Kearney that &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot; was sung in the GPO.  It was also sung before the evacuation on the Friday evening when all of them stood up.  It is in my family's lore.  Liam Ring's daughter is still alive, but unfortunately she cannot be here because she is ill.  He turned to his brother, Christopher, when they sang and said it should be in Irish.  It was the genesis of &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;.<br\/><br\/>I would like the committee to take into account some specifics mentioned in my submission.  There should be no change to either the Irish or English version.  I have read and heard of proposals to change the wording to lessen the militaristic tone of the anthem, but in deference to those who wrote and translated it, we should not interfere with the work.  Some people have quite mistakenly assumed that the first line of the chorus, &quot;Sinne Fianna F&aacute;il&quot;, was written after the foundation of the Fianna F&aacute;il political party in 1926, and somehow the name of the fledgling party could have influenced Liam &Oacute; Rinn's translation work.  It is absolutely untrue as the first translation was done in 1916 and completed before 1923, well before the foundation of the political party, Fianna F&aacute;il.  This is not just based on family knowledge or lore.  Historian, Professor Ruth Sherry, in her article, entitled The Story of the National Anthem, published in <i>History Ireland <\/i>in 1996, states that Liam &Oacute; Rinn's translation was published in the Army magazine, <i>An t&Oacute;glach<\/i>, on 3 November 1923.  More persuasive and significant is the fact that an almost identical text was printed in the <i>Freeman's Journal<\/i>on 3 April 1923 under Liam &Oacute; Rinn's pen name, Coinneach.  The Government should issue guidelines for the use of the national anthem.  As Senator Daly mentioned, there are guidelines for the use of the flag and harp.  I have an excellent document outlining the protocols and guidelines for the national flag, which was put together by Senator Daly.  Something like that should be put together.<br\/><br\/>Lieutenant Colonel Armstrong and Councillor Fitzgerald mentioned standing to attention for the anthem.  It is galling for me to see people standing ar &aacute;is, or at ease, and not standing to attention for the anthem.  Otherwise they put their arms around one another.  We need to give the anthem the due respect it deserves by informing people.  That is what the committee should bring with its guidelines as to how to stand to attention for the national anthem.<br\/><br\/>I would support the national anthem being enshrined officially in legislation and for it to be formally adopted as such, like the flag and harp.  I urge the committee to recommend that the national anthem be made a compulsory part of the educational curriculum and enshrine this in legislation to ensure its implementation.  I have spoken to many school principals over the past week or so in preparation for today's meeting, and although it seems to be part of the curriculum, this is up to individual principals.  Luckily, there are many principals in the country who ensure it is taught, mainly in sixth class.<br\/><br\/>If the guidelines are agreed and published, they should be in booklet format and distributed to every household in Ireland.  With regard to what the Lord Mayor of Cork has done with schools, the presentation of the national flag and the Proclamation last year for the centenary celebrations was a magnificent success and it allowed schoolchildren appreciate their flag and the Proclamation.  I hope the committee will recommend a similar programme of events for the national anthem.  I acknowledge the excellent initiative of the Lord Mayor of Cork, Councillor Tony Fitzgerald, in doing that in his area.  If I were lucky enough to be elected Lord Mayor of Dublin, I would be on the phone to him, find out how he did it and do the very same in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>I wish the committee well in its deliberations and I thank the Chairman and rapporteur, Senator Daly, for setting this up.  Nuair at&aacute; an coiste ag d&eacute;anamh a chuid machnaimh, t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go nd&iacute;reoidh s&eacute; ar an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann leis an amhr&aacute;s n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta i gcult&uacute;r, stair agus oidhreacht na t&iacute;re.  I hope the committee will be mindful of the important place for the national anthem in the culture, history and heritage of our country.  The last line of &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot; is &quot;Seo libh cana&iacute;dh Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;.  I say &quot;Seo libh, cuimhn&iacute;g&iacute; ar Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nial Ring","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512468000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me today to speak on a subject very close to my heart.  There are two dates that stand out for me with regard to the singing of \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" and my colleagues have mentioned them.  There was the great event of 2007 and the famous Ireland-England game.  On such a powerful occasion, emotions run high, and on that date, \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" found its voice.  Peadar Kearney, Patrick Heeney and Liam &Oacute; Rinn would have been very proud on that day.  On Easter Monday 2016, I stood on Moore Street in Dublin with my family, two girls, on the site where our 1916 leaders surrendered.  After the Proclamation was read, the large crowd, including us, sang \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\".  Again, it was a powerful occasion that brought much emotion and patriotism.  It just felt right.  At the Ireland-England game I have the image of \"The Bull\" Hayes in floods of tears.  I think he was crying for the country that day and \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" hit a note that day.<\/p><p>Unfortunately as a nation, a country and a people we have failed to fully embrace &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;.  Many of us were not taught the words in school.  It depended on the individual teacher.  This probably indicates why &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot; is not known throughout Ireland. <br\/><br\/>In a recent poll reported in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>online 47% of people said they knew the words, 37% knew some and faked the rest, 13% said they did not know the words.  The rest had not heard it sung.  In another poll <i>TheJournal.ie<\/i>asked &quot;Do you think learning the national anthem should be part of the school curriculum?&quot;  A total of 89% said &quot;Yes&quot;, 9% said &quot;No&quot;, and the remainder did not know.  I would like to think that as part of this process the Department of Education and Skills will make the learning of &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot; part of the school curriculum, certainly in primary school.  By the time they leave primary school every child in Ireland would know the words of &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;.  <br\/><br\/>I love to follow Ireland and Offaly, when it is doing well, but it is not doing so well now.  I love to watch sport in general.  &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot; is least respected when sport is shown live on television.  As the camera scans the team at best 50% of them are singing.  It does not look right.  If the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, and the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA, would try to get their players, coaches, staff and management to learn the words of &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot; that would look very good.  There is a great example of this working well in Wales where at the last game of the group stage, all the Welsh players and supporters sang their song.  The same happens in England, Scotland, Italy and Argentina.  When everyone sings the anthem together it works very well.  I hope that could be done here.  <br\/><br\/>It took a trip to Glasgow to inspire me to learn the words of &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;.  At the ground I was intrigued that the Celtic supporters could sing &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot; on the terrace.  On one occasion when we ended up in the pub after the game at the end of the session the band asked for quiet as they sang &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;.  All the Glasgow Irish sang along.  Unfortunately, I did not know the words but that planted the seed and I was committed then to learning the words of &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;.  I have sung it many times since.  <br\/><br\/>In America in 2006 a national anthem project was set up after a decline was shown in the number of people who knew the words of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot;.  Competitions and roadshows went around to the schools to help the pupils learn the words in a fun and enjoyable way.  I call on the Department of Education and Skills to make learning &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot; compulsory in primary schools.  As part of history and music combined, the children should learn the story behind our national anthem and learn the music too.  This could be done using the US national anthem project as a template.  The words should be published and taught in Gaelic and English, recognising that many in Ireland have a heritage of the English language and because the original song was written in English.  The Department should set a timetable such that, for example, by 2025 children leaving primary school would know all the words of &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot; and &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;.  Teachers should be encouraged to teach this to their students in a fun, enjoyable and patriotic way in celebration of our national heritage, history and culture.  I propose that the FAI, the IRFU, the GAA and other national sporting organisations take a lead role in encouraging all their members to learn the words of our anthem.  Managers, players and staff should be made aware that they should lead by example and learn the words of our anthem, especially for live games on TV.  While &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot; is being played all teams should be encouraged not to break away until the national anthem is complete.  Likewise, supporters should be encouraged to sing the anthem fully and not cheer before the last line is sung as has happened in the past.  <br\/><br\/>The IRFU should be encouraged to change its policy of not playing &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot; when the Irish rugby team plays away from home.  &quot;Ireland's Call&quot; is a rugby anthem and when the Irish rugby team plays away from home &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot; should be played also.  I strongly plead with the IRFU to review this decision. <br\/><br\/>Phonetic versions of &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot; should be used to encourage the Irish diaspora and those with Irish ancestry around the world to learn the national anthem.  The chorus of &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot; should be the national anthem of Ireland, inclusive of nationalists living in Northern Ireland and those Irish citizens around the world who use an Irish passport, for example, the Glasgow Irish.  Please recognise that the national anthem belongs to the Irish people not just those of us who live in the Republic of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for giving me the time to speak and I wish it well in its work. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Raymond Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their very interesting and informative presentations.

I thank the witnesses for coming here today.  It has been interesting to learn more about my history.  I was on the board of an Educate Together school that was established in Dublin 8.  My main interest in establishing it was for my children.  A few years later I found that they did not know the national anthem.<\/p><p>I went into the school to teach it to the children, perhaps badly.  I felt passionately that they should have a sense of belonging, pride and respect for the gift of being an Irish citizen.  That was extremely important for me.  They got there.<\/p><p> Cuba is probably not the most popular country to mention.  Other countries have been mentioned.  I was part of a group that went to Cuba in 2011 and we visited hospitals, etc.  We went to see the Bobby Sands memorials and stuff like that.  When we visited schools, we learned that schoolchildren in Cuba are fanatical about their anthem and their flag.  It is instilled in them from an early age.  Obviously, the false news agency would say this is ingrained in them because they are not free.  The point is that they bring their pride in the country with them from childhood right up to adulthood.<\/p><p> I wish to ask the witnesses a few questions.  The first of them is for Ard-Mh&eacute;ara of Cork, Councillor Fitzgerald.  Did any schools refuse to take part in the initiative involving the national anthem and the flags?<\/p><p> Lieutenant Colonel Armstrong mentioned that the national anthem was played at theatres, cinemas and dance halls \"up to the 1970s or 1980s\".  Does he know why this was stopped?  Was it a political measure?  Did it just peter out?  Was there a certain cut-off point?  It stopped all of a sudden.  Some of us can remember it being played.<\/p><p> I did not realise that there is an abstract and beautiful artistic reference to the national anthem in Irish passports until Mr. Nugent pointed it out.  What we are talking about here today is the beauty of the past, the present and - hopefully - our future.  Can Mr. Nugent tell us when this abstract background detail started to be included in passports?  I was not aware until this morning that it is there.<\/p><p> I am proud to meet Mr. Kearney today.  His eloquent speech was absolutely electrifying.  Regardless of the outcome of this public consultation, as legislators we need to respect our anthem and pass it on safely to our children and our children's children.<\/p><p> I welcome Mr. Ring, who is a grandnephew of Liam &Oacute; Rinn.  He set out the fascinating history of the anthem.  I wonder whether he thinks Fianna F&aacute;il was a bit opportunistic in plagiarising its name from the national anthem, but we will not get into that argument.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#F00300","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>We did not even have a go at the Senator over Cuba.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#G00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Will the Chairman give protection to Fianna F&aacute;il?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#G00300","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>The Chair will be equally fair and partial to all.

I congratulate the Lord Mayor of Cork on the great initiative.  He was a North Mon boy.  I was a Christian Brothers boy in my day.  They all come under the Edmund Rice Schools Trust.  I have been on school boards of management for 15 years.  I have spent nine years as chairman of a board.  I think the Lord Mayor's initiative, which got schools involved, was a fantastic one.  Did the initiative focus primarily on primary schools or secondary schools?  Was it his experience that people in secondary schools did not learn the anthem in primary school?  Were people in primary schools more willing to take it up?  I suggest that the earlier one learns it, the better.  My first proper exposure to it was at the end of my first year in secondary school, when I went to the Gaeltacht where the Independent Senator, Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, formerly of Sinn F&eacute;in, grew up and now lives.<\/p> <p>  I am Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on finance in the Seanad.  The protection of our national anthem comes under the remit of the Department of Finance.  I am speaking particularly for that reason.  I am interested anyway, but this has particular relevance to my remit.  If we get something over the line, it will be dealt with in my brief.<\/p> <p>  I will dwell too much on Senator Devine's reference to Cuba.  She made plenty of contributions when Fidel Castro died.  It is interesting to hear about how various countries consider their own anthems.<\/p> <p>  I thank Councillor Ring for what he said about his family's involvement with the national anthem.  It is very important that we have respect for it and, equally, that we bring it into daily usage.  It used to be heard at the end of a nightclub or when RT&Eacute; closed down for the night, which it no longer does in this era of rolling programming.  Maybe it could broadcast it at midnight or 2 a.m.  It would be ideal if it could be broadcast at a time when there might be a bit more exposure to it.  There is nothing more embarrassing for all of us than to see lineups of soccer or rugby players not singing the anthem.

It is, of course, a soldier's song and includes words such as &quot;shelter the despot or the slave&quot; and &quot;mid cannons' roar&quot;, but they are hardly bloodcurdling in the way the French national anthem is.  I have no issue with it.<br\/><br\/>I also have no issue with the fact that the national anthem includes the words &quot;Sinne Fianna F&aacute;il&quot;, while Fianna F&aacute;il is, of course, a political party.  People of different political persuasions may have issues with it, but I am an independent councillor, although I come from a Fianna F&aacute;il background.  I never saw it as an issue and feel people bring it up a little mischievously.  The Deputy for my area, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, has always had an issue with it and wants it to read, &quot;Sinne Laochra F&aacute;il&quot; or &quot;Sinne Laochra Gael&quot;.  According to Mr. Daly, only 40% of people know the words of the national anthem as it is; therefore, changing the wording might cause confusion.<br\/><br\/>It was said the Department of Finance was involved, but the website of the Department of the Taoiseach which I called yesterday states the national anthem, &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot;, was written in 1907 by Peadar Kearney, an uncle of Brendan Behan, and first published in the <i>Irish Freedom<\/i>newspaper in 1912, although it was not widely known until it was sung at the GPO during the Easter Rising of 1916.  It is stated the chorus was formally adopted as the national anthem in 1926.  Despite it being the website of the Department of the Taoiseach, this information is wrong in many ways.  It is not &quot;The Soldier's Song&quot; but &quot;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&quot;.  Mr. Conal Kearney will know when it was written.  The website informs us that the writer was an uncle of Brendan Behan, but what has that got to do with it?  Where is the mention of Liam Ring or Patrick Heeney?  Unfortunately, very few of Patrick Heeney's relatives are alive and he died penniless in the north inner city.  The triumvirate involved in writing the national anthem should be recognised equally.  The Department of the Taoiseach's four-line piece on the national anthem is an absolute disgrace.  I hope the committee will take up this matter with the Department. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nial Ring"},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Perhaps, as a result of today's proceedings, the record might be put straight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#H00400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>The Chairman might get onto the communications unit as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#H00500","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512468000,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Senator Frances Black asked about the words \"Sinne Fianna F&aacute;il\".

Because of that I was not allowed to learn Irish and the only piece I have is the national anthem which we sang every single day, of which I am desperately proud.

As there are a large number of witnesses in this session, I would ask that presenters keep their opening statements as brief as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#M00100","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for being here.  The national anthem, Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann, belongs to everyone and is one of the key symbols of our State.  It is worthy of respect and our consideration today is about its protection and recognition by this State.  When I wrote these words earlier this morning, I noted that it was written by Peadar Kearney in 1907, as that is what appears on the Government website, but through this public consultation process we have learned that it was not composed until 1909 or 1910.  The Irish language version was translated by Liam Ring and the music was composed by Patrick Heeney.  We are deeply honoured and indeed humbled to have descendants of the Kearney and Ring family here with us today in the Gallery.<\/p> <p>  The national anthem has been sung on the most important State occasions.  It was sung last year on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising and was sung in the GPO itself during the Rising.  As Councillor Ring has pointed out, during the singing of the anthem in English, in the GPO on the Friday before the evacuation, the Rings commented that it would be better if it was sung in Irish.  Such is the origin of our national anthem.<\/p> <p>  The national flag, the harp and the anthem are important symbols of the State.  The flag is enshrined in our Constitution in Article 7 where it states that the national flag is a tricolour of green, white and orange.  The national flag is protected by protocol and copyright law.  The harp is protected by a patent which has being placed upon it by the State.  The national anthem does not have any official recognition or protection and the Irish Sign Language version was never was never formally adopted by the State.<\/p> <p>  I thank my fellow Kerryman, Senator Paul Coghlan, for chairing this public consultation process, fellow members of Seanad Public Consultation Committee, Senators Buttimer, Byrne, Conway, Ardagh, Freeman, &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, Devine, Kelleher, and to the other Senators who are here today.  I thank Bridget Doody, the clerk of the Senate Public Consultation Committee, and to Grace Coyle and Aliana Caridad for their work on this over recent months.  We thank all those who made submissions and especially thank all those who have attended today. <\/p> <p>  It is fitting and appropriate that the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is here.  As Minister of State at the Department of Finance he will outline the Department's role in protecting the national anthem.<\/p><p>It is appropriate the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is here today because it was a Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy who asked the Minister for Defence a D&aacute;il question in 1926 about what the national anthem was.  There was doubt about whether it was \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" or \"Let Erin Remember\" because the latter had been sung in the 1924 Olympics as the Irish team's national anthem.  <\/p><p> Professor O'Dell, as an associate professor of Trinity College, will offer us an academic viewpoint on the protection that could be afforded to the national anthem.  The argument offered by Professor O'Dell is that legislation rather than copyright could be utilised.  He has included a draft of a Bill for the national anthem and the presidential salute which details issues such as respect, dignity, liability, performance, advertising and remedies with regard to the national anthem.  It is a very important submission for the understanding of the relevant points of a possible legal protection for the national anthem.<\/p><p> Ms Hazel Tunney is a qualified Irish and European trademark and design attorney with 17 years' experience in her profession.  She will outline the trademark protections for official State emblems and symbols.  Ms Tunney will address the importance of protecting these emblems through trademark, design rights, patent and copyright legislation.  Her submission is important for understanding the relevant legislation on State emblems and symbols that pertains or which could be used for the protection of the national anthem.<\/p><p> Mr. Alain Newstead is a sixth year student at Bishopstown community school and is a proud deaf citizen who uses Irish Sign Language as his native language.  In his submission, he outlined the lack of a sign language interpretation of the national anthem.  The submission is important as it outlines the lack of an enshrined interpretation of the national anthem for all citizens.  Also in attendance is Mr. John Cottrell, a member of the student council and Ms Denise Dowling, a teacher.  We also have Mr. Darren Burke and our interpreters with us.  Students of Eureka national school are here in the Public Gallery and I thank them and their teachers for their attendance.  Ms Alex Martin and Ms Emily-Jo White will give their presentation on behalf of the students.  Their teachers, Mr. Stephen McKee and Ms. Danielle O'Reilly, are here with them today to outline that students take immense pride in the national anthem as a symbol of the State.  Their submissions address the need to enshrine the special status and appropriate use of the national anthem in law and to determine what laws should be put in place on the rules for its commercial use.  Their submissions will address extending the protections we have for the harp and the flag to the national anthem.  Their submissions will detail the protection that should be afforded to the national anthem and how it is important to all citizens of the State regardless of which generation they are.<\/p><p> On 1 January 2013, the 70th anniversary of the death of Peadar Kearney, the national anthem copyright expired and was no longer protected by the laws of the land.  I introduced the National Anthem (Protection of Copyright and Related Rights) (Amendment) Bill, which would give legal recognition to the national anthem for the first time and protect it.  I also suggested that we should carry out the Seanad public consultation process.  I thank the officials from the Department of Finance for their assistance in this regard.  I am honoured to be the co-ordinator of the public consultation process and to get the views of all the citizens of the State on what should be done with regard to the national anthem.<\/p><p> When the public consultation process has concluded, I will be compiling a report and if necessary drafting legislation, protocols or guidelines on the people's song, our national anthem, \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\". <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#M00200","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>It has been a while since I was in these seats.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#N00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is always welcome back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#N00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I will make a number of comments before I make my speech.  People might be interested to know why the Department of Finance is responsible.  In 1933, the Department of Finance paid an awful lot of money to purchase the copyright.  It cost &pound;1,000, which is equivalent to millions of euro today.  At the time, an acre of land traded for about &pound;3 so the price paid was similar to the price of 200 acres to 300 acres of land.  That was in 1933.  In 1965, the copyright was extended and the Department of Finance paid &pound;2,500.  That is why it is the responsibility of the Department of Finance.  When I was writing down the symbol for pounds, I had to stop and think because I had not written one down for so long.<\/p> <p>  I listened in and out of the debate this morning and one of the things that struck me most in Senator Daly's contribution was his remark about the singing of the national anthem and the number of people who sing it with such pride but do not understand the words.  That is the most telling aspect of everything that has been said to date.  While we understand it is something to be proud of, we do not know what we are proud of in terms of the words and the song.  The Deputy Senator Daly mentioned was Osmond Esmonde.  The Esmondes have a longstanding relationship with Ireland.  Members of the family were Deputies in the House for an unbroken period until 1977.  Prior to that they represented Wexford in Westminster and prior to that they represented their constituencies in Grattan's Parliament and parliaments before that.  They came over on a boat from Pembrokeshire with a fellow some people might have heard of - a gentleman by the name of Richard de Clare, who was also called Strongbow.  They were in the first boat from Pembrokeshire with Richard de Clare in 1169.  I know them quite well because their base was in my parish.<\/p> <p>  I want to correct the record.  Osmond Esmonde was elected a Deputy for Cumann na nGaedheal.  However, when the conversation about the anthem arose he was not a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal party.  At that time, he was part of the National Party led by Joseph McGrath.  He did not stand in the first election of 1927 but stood in the second election of 1927 as a member of Cumann na nGaedheal.  That is just a few bits of history.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#N00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>We are here to correct a lot of records today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#N00500","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":237,"content":"<p>That is good.  That is just a few bits and pieces.  The Department of Finance is very proud of its long association with the national anthem, having acted as its unofficial custodian since it purchased the copyright of the music and the English lyrics of \"The Soldier's Song\" on behalf of the State in 1933.  As a modest expression of our pride, Peadar Kearney was one of the figures we chose to honour recently when naming the various conference rooms and corridors off our main offices in Government Buildings.  As such, I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to today's discussion.  I sincerely hope the constructive engagement with the committee and the various stakeholders who have gathered here will result in a useful outcome for all concerned.  To turn to the substance of today's discussion, I hope the written response to the consultative process that my Department has prepared for the committee has proven useful in setting out our position on the matter.<\/p> <p>  I will take this opportunity to highlight elements of our response concerning some of the specific questions raised by the committee in the consultation paper.  The copyright of the music and English lyrics of the national anthem, held by Patrick Heaney and Peadar Kearney, respectively, was purchased by the Department of Finance on behalf of the State in 1933.  Changes to copyright law meant it was purchased again in the same manner in 1965.  In line with domestic and European copyright legislation, the State's claim to the copyright of the music and English lyrics of the national anthem expired on 31 December 2012.  The original intention of purchasing the national anthem was to allow it to be freely played without the collection of royalties.  This has remained the principled position of the Department throughout the period of its custodianship of the copyright.  Upon its expiration on 31 December 2012, the Department felt that considering the anthem was in the public domain, that it was freely available and that fees could not be charged for its use, the original policy intent in purchasing the copyright appeared to have been satisfied, with \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" freely available to be used since 1 January 2013.  This legal status is a common one internationally.  Many countries, including the US, France and the Netherlands, allow their national anthems to reside in the public domain in this manner.  In addition, I do not agree with the attempt to extend copyright of the national anthem to bring it back under the control of my Department.<\/p><p>Any such move would run contrary to both national and European copyright legislation.  Last year, my Department received legal advice from the Attorney General on this issue that indicated that passing legislation to extend the State's copyright over the national anthem would not stand up to legal scrutiny.  As such, the national anthem's current legal status is appropriate in regard to the original intention for the purchase of its copyright by the Department and in accordance with best practice internationally.<\/p><p> To turn to issues concerning the treatment of the anthem, I am fully aware and appreciate the important symbolism attached to it.  It is one of the most important symbols of our State.  It is an internationally recognised means of demonstrating our national pride, whether it is used for official State visits, to inspire sports people or to celebrate the wins of our athletes.  Even its informal use across Ireland and around the globe serves to bring people of Ireland together.  I am concerned, however, that several of the suggestions raised in the consultation document with the admirable purpose of protecting our anthem could, unfortunately, prove to be counterproductive.  Despite the good intentions behind such suggestions, it could be argued that any attempts to restrict the anthem's use or introduce statutory penalties for its misuse could attract unnecessary attention and public ire.  This could result in the anthem being disparaged or demeaned for political reasons or to make a point regarding free speech, particularly in regard to its use for parody or satire.<\/p><p> Given the symbolism attached to the national anthem, I fully understand and sympathise with the concerns of individuals pertaining to its general mistreatment or use in a derisory or disruptive manner.  I believe, however, it is regularly treated with the appropriate respect.  It goes without saying that the vast majority of Irish citizens have the utmost respect for it, while the instances of controversy concerning issues over recent decades have been few and far between.  Since the anthem came out of copyright in 2012, there does not appear to have been any strong evidence of its use in a derogatory fashion, with both the court of public opinion and good sense of the people at large coming together to ensure this is the case.<\/p><p> It would be very difficult to define properly \"inappropriate use of the anthem\".  It would be difficult for such restrictions to be constitutionally valid unless they were solidly justified and infringed as little as possible on freedom of expression rights.  Similarly, I fully understand the desire that the national anthem not be used for commercial purposes.  Given its symbolism and meaning to the Irish State and the majority of the citizens, the desire to prevent such a symbol being used to advance a commercial project or business is understandable, especially if it were to be used in a distasteful fashion.  Of course, this is naturally subjective.  Given my belief that the national anthem should remain within the public domain, I would not be in favour of any restrictions on its commercial use.<\/p><p> I am aware that there have been isolated incidents of its use for advertising purposes in recent years.  Such incidents may indeed recur, but I must state once again my belief that the court of public opinion and general respect of the vast majority of citizens for the national anthem would be sufficient to discourage its use in this manner, especially given the potential for negative public reaction or a backlash against such use.<\/p><p> Defining what would constitute \"commercial use\" or \"advertising purposes\" would be very difficult.  Doing so may have further unintended consequences, such as unduly restricting the use of the anthem in recordings made for charitable purposes.  That is just one example.  Nevertheless, while my issues with attempting to resolve these points in legislation are quite clear, I can certainly see the good intentions behind them.  To this end, were consensus to emerge from the committee's deliberations that additional criteria are required to protect the national anthem, the suggestion that guidelines be prepared and published on its use would appear to be the most balanced approach to take at this juncture.  Setting out the criteria for best practice on the suitable treatment of the national anthem and putting them on a more formal footing through official guidelines could have positive effects on future treatment.  Such guidelines could take a similar form to those issued by the Department of the Taoiseach for the use of the national flag.  They could contain non-binding protocols and suggested treatment for the anthem, with the aim of formally setting out the unofficial social conventions that are currently observed regarding it.  If the text of such guidelines were to be agreed upon through an open process such as this, involving the range of relevant stakeholders this committee has invited to participate today, well-rounded and sensible criteria would emerge.  These could consequently be considered by the Government for adoption as non-binding guidelines for the use of the anthem.  The usefulness of this exercise could be complemented by incorporating an official designation of the Irish and English words and the sheet music of the anthem that can currently be found on the website of the Department of the Taoiseach as the accepted version of the national anthem.<\/p><p> I hope I have outlined my position on the national anthem and by Department's historical relationship with it.  Generally attempting to extend the State's copyright over the national anthem is not legally feasible.  Similarly, drafting legislation to give the anthem specific legal protections is an exercise that would be fraught with unnecessary risk and unintended consequences.  The goodwill of the people by and large ensures our national anthem is treated with the respect it deserves.  All national anthems deserve this as symbols of state.  Drafting guidelines governing best practice for the use of the anthem in a variety of circumstances may help in ensuring this respect is codified, and such a document could be considered by the Government.  Overall, I extend my goodwill to the members of the committee and wish them well in producing a final report.<\/p><p> As somebody who loves the history of our national emblems, I believe it is important we do not go too far on this.  It is important that people be educated and informed about our national symbols and that they be prepared to gain knowledge of what the words of the national anthem actually mean and are not just proud because it is our anthem.  It is important that they understand the symbolism and thought process behind our national anthem.  The anthem was written in 1910 and translated in 1917, and it was subsequently understood to be our national anthem.  The Irish translation became popularised.  People should know and understand it.<\/p><p> I wish to touch on two final aspects.  I am always concerned when people become too proud or attached to symbolism.  It is not good.  Sometimes people become overly nationalistic and fervently so.  That is never good.  There is a space in which one can show respect for the national anthem.  I would like people to be in a space where they are informed and educated about it and know and understand its genesis and history.<\/p><p> Let me refer to the phrase \"Fianna F&aacute;il\" in the first line of the anthem.  My understanding is that this is the original translation.  It should be left as it is and not changed to anything else.  I am taking a very cold, objective view on this.<\/p><p> It is probably the GAA that has brought the national anthem to its current point.  It is sung on All-Ireland day and provincial final days.  Before television, it was heard on radio, played by the Artane Boys Band.  People understand the music.  The lyrics are rarely, if ever, sung on All-Ireland day.  People understood the music before the words.  I would like to push very strongly the view that people should understand the English words as much as the words as Gaeilge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#N00600","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir dom a bheith anseo chun an cheist an-t&aacute;bhachtach seo a phl&eacute;.  I welcome the committee's consideration of the most appropriate way for the State to treat the national anthem and am grateful to the committee for the invitation to attend today.  Preventing inappropriate use of the national anthem is important and encouraging its appropriate use is just as important.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I would like to make two basic points.  First, given that this consideration has arisen in part out of two Bills proposed by the committee's rapporteur, Senator Mark Daly, which proposed to use copyright law to prevent inappropriate use of the national anthem, I have to say emphatically that this is not what copyright law is for.  Second, if the prevention of inappropriate use of the anthem is to be achieved, it should be done on its own terms and with clear definitions, not only as to what constitutes such inappropriate use but also as to how it is to be prevented.<\/p> <p>  On my first point, that of copyright, I entirely agree with the Minister of State.  There should be no change to the copyright status of the national anthem.  The music and words of \"The Soldier's Song\" and the words of \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" are all now out of copyright and are in the public domain, where they should remain.  Attempting to bring them back into copyright or to assert a new copyright in them would be inconsistent with the functions of copyright law and incompatible with European law and the Constitution.  It is for these reasons that I disagreed with the details of Senator Mark Daly's Bills last year.  However, I agree with his larger point, which is being discussed today, about the need to treat the anthem with respect.<\/p> <p>  I did some research on the legal treatment of national anthems in similar jurisdictions and have drafted a Bill to address the kinds of concerns raised by the Senator.  That Bill is the basis of the submission I made to the committee, which I will briefly outline.  The Bill does not propose to use copyright to regulate the use of the national anthem, it simply does so directly.  It sets out the things that ought to be considered.  Section 3 of the Bill defines the national anthem but also acknowledges that all of the versions of the anthem so defined are in the public domain and thus not subject to copyright.  That will not change.  My recommendation therefore entirely agrees with that of the Minister of State so far.<\/p> <p>  As to the Bill I am proposing, I am not entirely wedded to all of the details.  Left to my own devices, I would probably have had fewer provisions but I drafted the Bill to show the kinds of things such legislation does in other countries and might do here.  I submitted it to the committee in the hope that it might be found useful in its deliberations and I am delighted to be here to discuss it.  The Bill begins with the usual boring Short Title, commencement, definitions and so forth.  Sections 3 and 4 define the national anthem and the presidential salute, reflecting both Government decision and common practice.<\/p> <p>  Section 3 defines the national anthem as the chorus of \"The Soldier's Song\", words by Peadar Kearney and music by Patrick Heeney, and that of \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\", words by Liam &Oacute; Rinn.  It provides that these versions should be set out in a schedule.  I should add that, reflecting Senator Mark Daly's success with the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016 and having regard to other submissions the committee has already received and to other witnesses who will be heard in this session, it would not be difficult to add subsections here to provide for the words of the national anthem in Irish sign language as well.<\/p> <p>  Section 5 provides that the national anthem and the presidential salute should be performed and treated with respect and dignity and sets out various ways in which such respect and dignity might be expressed.  The word \"should\" is crucial.  Unlike a mandatory \"shall\", which creates a legal obligation, I agree with the Minister of State that the matter should simply be expressed as a hope or a desire without creating any affirmative duty.  I suggest that persons present at the performance of the anthem or salute should, if practicable, remove headgear and stand at attention throughout the performance, given that is the standard appropriate means of showing respect.  The \"should\" should be noted.  I would add that, if that is not possible, people should otherwise treat the performance with respect and observe it with dignity, even if standing to attention is not possible.<\/p> <p>  Section 6 reinforces that the principles in section 5 are intended only for general guidance and do not give rise to any legal liability, whether criminal or civil.  Again, I agree with the Minister of State that the matter should be non-binding and should not be compulsory.  However, we have had examples of disruption of the national anthem by public disorder.  Where that amounts to an offence provided for in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, the fact that this disorder disrupted the anthem might be taken into account as an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing.<\/p> <p>  It seems that the key issue is that of advertising and commercial activities.  Section 8 is the core of my Bill.  It attempts to define the kinds of advertising and other commercial activities for which not just the chorus but the entirety of \"The Soldier's Song\" and \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" ought not to be used.  Again, it would not be difficult to add subsections to this section to provide for the words in Irish sign language.  The key part is the requirement in section 8(6) that anyone who wishes to make commercial use of either \"The Soldier's Song\" or \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" should seek the prior written consent of the Minister for Finance.  We have already heard from the Minister of State that the Department of Finance had carriage of the matter until the anthem fell out of copyright recently.  The subsection goes on to provide that the consent of the Minister in this respect should not be unreasonably withheld.  The key point is the attempt to define the commercial activities in question.  I suggest regulation of commercial sound recordings, commercial broadcasts, commercial public performances, commercial publications and commercial communications to the public.  I then go on to provide for various non-commercial uses for which the consent of the Minister would not be necessary, such as the charity example which the Minister of State gave.<\/p> <p>  The Bill finishes by providing for remedies, particularly where consent should have been sought but was not or was sought and was refused.  In such circumstances, an advertisement using \"The Soldier's Song\" or \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" must not be published or broadcast.  The publisher or broadcaster must not publish or broadcast it and the Minister could get an injunction to prevent any such publication or broadcast.  Similarly, the Minister could also get an injunction against any other commercial activity for which consent was sought and refused.  If the Minister were to be awarded damages in these actions or if there were fees to be levied for the purposes of consent for the performance, those damages or fees could be distributed under the National Lottery.<\/p> <p>  This is a very important consultation.  I am very grateful for the opportunity to participate.  I am more than happy to take questions and to assist the committee with this work now and in the future.

We specialise in advising on trademarks, design right, patents and, to a much lesser extent, copyright.  Approximately 30 years ago my firm provided advice to the Government with respect to the protection of the harp as one of the national emblems of Ireland.  I have been asked by Senator Mark Daly to provide my observations and suggestions from the perspective of trademark protection and the types of protection enjoyed by the national symbols of the State.  I have considered whether such protections could be extrapolated to encompass, or in any way be considered analogous to, the types of protection which could be considered to protect the national anthem.<\/p> <p>  Irish and international trademark law gives State emblems and flags certain rights and protections.  In Ireland this includes both the flags and national emblems of the nation and also those of other nations.  Ireland has notified the World Intellectual Property Organization, WIPO, of a number of its official national symbols.  These are a variety of different representations of the shamrock and the harp.  The registration of such emblems with WIPO gives them certain protections both domestically and abroad.  Under Irish law any trademark, being a right which gives exclusivity, which consists of or contains any State emblem of Ireland or anything which could be mistaken for such an emblem cannot be registered unless the consent of the Minister is secured.  Any trademark which consists of or contains a representation of the national flag of the State, as defined in the Constitution, cannot be registered if it appears that the use of that trademark would be misleading or grossly offensive.<\/p><p> To summarise, third parties cannot secure trademark rights in anything which includes any State emblem or the national flag, or anything similar to them, unless permission is granted by the Minister and only then if the use of that mark would not be offensive or misleading.  The Trade Marks Act prevents the unauthorised use of Irish national symbols, namely, the harp, the shamrock and the flag, or anything closely resembling them, in connection with any business if it is intended that use in this way would lead to the belief that the person or business was authorised by the State to use these symbols.  The Act empowers the Minister to take injunctive action against any such deceiving use and sets out a variety of fines associated with it.<\/p><p> Ireland is party to the Paris Convention, a 19th century convention for the protection of intellectual property.  Article 6ter of the convention allows for the protection of various emblems and insignia of the member states of the convention and of their flags.  Most member states have notified WIPO of their national emblems and Ireland has notified it of the harp and shamrock.  As a result, any trademark which consists of or contains the flag or notified emblems of any convention country or anything that imitates them cannot be registered as a trademark in this country or any other country without the authorisation of the competent authorities of the country in question.<\/p><p> If a certain sign is identical or similar to a state flag or a protected national emblem and its use is likely to mislead the public or suggest a link with the nation in question where no such link exists, the state in question is entitled to prevent use of the sign by seeking an injunction.  To summarise, unauthorised, misleading or confusing use of certain state emblems or the flag of Ireland and those emblems and flags of other nations can be prevented from achieving registration and use of signs which are identical or similar to a flag or one of these emblems can be prevented if that use is misleading. <\/p><p> National emblems are signs that have symbolic meaning to a country.  A national anthem is a song, usually officially adopted by a country, which acts as an expression of its national identity.  In much the same manner as a national emblem, an anthem exemplifies or identifies a nation.  As the harp and the shamrock represent Ireland, so too does \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\".  There is an argument that the Irish national anthem should be officially adopted, enshrined in legislation and afforded some form of protection similar to the protections granted to other national emblems of the State and the Irish flag.  If the committee is minded to consider adopting some sort of national anthem Bill, my recommendation is that it look to the types of protections afforded to the flag, the harp and the shamrock for guidance.  My initial thoughts are that the main attraction of such a Bill would be to officially adopt and enshrine in legislation what the national anthem is, its musical notation and its various translations.  The beauty of introducing a measure as a result of a consultation such as this is that we could also incorporate different translations such as Irish Sign Language and any other translation that is deemed appropriate.<\/p><p> As the Minister of State and Dr. O'Dell indicated, such a Bill could be non-prescriptive in nature.  It could delineate between acceptable uses of the national anthem and less acceptable or unacceptable uses.  Looking to the types of protections granted to the flag, harp and shamrock could be useful.  The existing protections for the harp, the flag and the shamrock include the requirement, in some circumstances, to seek the consent of the Minister to register them as trademarks, the ability of the State to take action to prevent unauthorised use if it will create serious confusion or suggest links where no such links exist or if its use will be grossly offensive or misleading.<\/p><p> I appreciate that concerns could arise to the effect that such a Bill would be excessively prescriptive and determinative.  However, when we consider matters such as trademark law, much of the wording is subjective and general in nature.  I appreciate that the use of terms such as \"misleading\", \"confusing\" and \"grossly offensive\" can be subjective but the use of such subjective language would ensure the Bill would avoid being excessively prescriptive because of the subjective nature of the words.  Any such Bill could focus on using suggestive words such as \"should\" and \"could\", rather than prescriptive words such as \"must\" or \"shall\".  This would assist in making the Bill less prohibitive and more guiding in nature.<\/p><p> My recommendation is that any proposed Bill, should the committee decide that legislation is the most appropriate way to proceed, incorporate provisions which provide a full, detailed definition of the national anthem and its various translations, contain general non-prescriptive statements that the national anthem should be reproduced, treated and performed with dignity and respect and not in a way which is misleading, confusing or grossly offensive.  It could set out general provisions for seeking permission to use the national anthem in certain circumstances, such as those cited by Dr. O'Dell, in a commercial fashion, while making clear exemptions for non-commercial uses such as for charity, at the end of matches and so forth and, if deemed necessary, to provide for injunctive powers to prevent grossly offensive use or deceptive misuse of the national anthem.<\/p><p> I thank members for inviting me to today's proceedings.

I am profoundly deaf and use Irish Sign Language, ISL, as my first language.  I thank Senators for their invitation to participate in this consultation and giving me an opportunity to present my submission.  As they may be aware, this is my second visit to Leinster House.  Last year, I campaigned with my school and its student council in support of the Bill to recognise Irish Sign Language as an official language.  On that occasion, a letter I wrote was read as part of the debate in the Seanad.  In that letter, I called on the Government to have my first language, Irish Sign Language, officially recognised.  As a deaf person who cannot hear the spoken English language, I felt denied of my human right to have a language.  As a result, the deaf community, including me, is denied access to important information and services in many aspects of daily life.  I know the work on this Bill continues and I trust the Government will recognise my language in the near future.  The deaf community of Ireland wants equal citizenship and we hope that once the Bill becomes law, it will bring positive changes to our lives.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of this consultation is to discuss the national anthem.  I am pleased to be here to have my voice heard as part of this consultation and to present my views on this topic.  Again, we Irish Sign Language users are denied access to participation as equal citizens.  The national anthem was composed in Gaelic and later translated into English, but never into Irish Sign Language.  This needs to be rectified.<\/p> <p>  Recently, at a whole school event, the Lord Mayor of Cork requested everyone present to sing the national anthem.  On that occasion, one of my teachers, Ms Dowling, was interpreting in Irish Sign Language.  Suddenly, she had to refrain from signing while everyone else in the school proceeded to sing their hearts out.  I felt totally lost and excluded.  I knew everyone was singing an important song about my country and I could see the passion in their eyes and body language.  However, I felt even more excluded and frustrated as I could not share the experience with my peers.  For this reason, I call on the Government to provide an official Irish Sign Language version of the national anthem.<\/p> <p>  I am proud to be Irish and my deaf friends in school, who are as patriotic as I am, also feel left out, which is a terrible shame in 2017, when Ireland is supposed to be an inclusive society.  The deaf community in countries such as India, New Zealand and the United States all have their own official anthems in sign language.  Last year, Lady Gaga sang the American national anthem at the Super Bowl and many deaf viewers enjoyed access to the song via Marlee Matlin, an Oscar winning deaf actress who interpreted it.  It is time for Ireland to follow suit and have a sign language version of the national anthem of which all of us can be proud.  I call on members to ensure my voice and the voices of the deaf community are heard.  We are citizens of Ireland and we deserve equality.  We want to fully participate in society and have pride in our country.  I ask members to give us this opportunity by ensuring a standardised Irish Sign Language translation of our national anthem is provided.<\/p> <p>  I am hopeful of a future where Irish Sign Language will be recognised with an ISL interpretation of the national anthem.<\/p><p>I will achieve my dream of being an equal citizen in my own country.  I ask the committee to help me to realise that dream.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alain Newstead","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512468000,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I thank members for giving me the opportunity to speak to them today.  My name is John Cottrell and I am here to represent the student council of Bishopstown community school, Cork.  We fully support the submission by our fellow student, Alain Newstead, to have a standardised Irish Sign Language, ISL, version of the national anthem.  Members of our student council were also in the Seanad last year to support the Bill to recognise Irish Sign Language and we continue to strongly support the Bill to ensure equal citizenship for members of our school community and the deaf community of Ireland.  It is important to us as a student council as we have students and staff members in the school who are deaf or hard of hearing and use ISL as their main language.  Our role as a student council is to give a voice to students in our school community and I am here today to continue our work as an advocate.  As a student council we support the proposal to protect the wording and usage of the national anthem.  It is a national treasure and deserves to be protected.  The anthem is played at very important commemorations and ceremonies as well as sporting events.  As Irish citizens, it provides us with a symbol of our history and identity.<\/p> <p>  Standing in respect and singing the anthem connects Irish people everywhere with their country.  It gives real expression and citizenship to all of us.  Our school community wants to ensure that an ISL interpretation of the national anthem is standardised and provided in order for all deaf and hard of hearing to have equal citizenship and participation.  The national anthem is a part of our heritage and culture.  It is such a huge part of our sporting events both nationally and internationally.  I am a keen sportsman and I have been to and played in GAA finals where both teams and supporters sang \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" before the game.  I am always very proud singing with everyone else.  It allows me to express my pride towards my team, my community and my country.  At such a time I am connected to every other player and supporter present at the match.  It is necessary to have an ISL standardised interpretation of the national anthem in order for Alain and other Irish Sign Language users to share in this experience.<\/p> <p>  It is essential that my fellow students all feel connected to their community and are active members of it.  They should have positive experiences of belonging and participation.  Students and staff who are deaf and hard of hearing are very much equal members of our school community.  I was disappointed to hear how some of my fellow students and teacher felt disconnected from our school community when the national anthem was sung on the recent visit of the Lord Mayor.  Unfortunately, they were not in a position to participate due to the fact that there is no ISL interpretation of \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\".  That is something the student council of Bishopstown community school wishes to change in order to ensure that students from our school, together with the wider deaf community, can fully participate in the national anthem at future events.<\/p> <p>  The student council and the whole school community are very passionate about addressing this issue.  Bishopstown community school strives for each member to be respected and valued for their unique qualities and abilities.  Furthermore, the mission statement of the school clearly states that the school aims to develop the whole school community so that we may be better able to realise to the full our potential as individuals and active members of society.  In order to achieve that vision, one of the aims of the school is to encourage participation and excellence in every aspect of life.  I call on the members here today to support my school in ensuring it achieves that vision by providing equal opportunity of participation in official events and sporting occasions when the national anthem is sung.  They should please ensure that all students and staff members can participate by making provision for a standardised ISL translation of the national anthem.  I thank members for considering the submission and for giving us a voice in this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Cottrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512468000,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I am Denise Dowling and I am deaf.

I also teach ISL to families with children who are deaf or hard of hearing and night classes to the general public.<\/p> <p>  Today, I stand united with Alain and members of the deaf community in Ireland.  I wholeheartedly support Alain's request for an ISL interpretation of the national anthem.  My own personal experience informs my submission today.  At sporting matches, weddings and other events I have attended I often feel embarrassed and ashamed when I do not sing along to the national anthem.  I cannot participate in the national anthem as I do not follow it and cannot hear it well.  I never learned Irish as I was exempt from the subject in school.  I have never learned the words of the national anthem and neither have most of my deaf students.<\/p> <p>  Recently in school when the Lord Mayor requested that the whole school would sing the national anthem, the music teacher gave every class a sheet to rehearse and prepare for the performance during his visit.  As a teacher, I felt very bad in the classroom in front of my deaf and hard of hearing students for not being able to prepare them for this song.  We looked on YouTube and discovered that there is no official Irish Sign Language version of the national anthem.  However, we watched the American national anthem signed in their official language and could not help but feel envious and frustrated that Ireland does not have its own signed version.<\/p> <p>  As a teacher of the deaf, I am always trying to find ways for my students to access and participate fully in the everyday hearing world.  I encourage my students to overcome challenges and I actively promote advocacy.  I do not want my students to be limited in any way by being deaf.  I want them to have full lives and reach their full potential.  It is my job and our joint responsibility to ensure that they can do that.

I will share my time with Alex Martin in making our presentation.  \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" is a crucial and core part of how the State commemorates events and people.  It must be treated with respect, as Senator Mark Daly, stated.<\/p> <p>  My name is Emily-Jo White and I am a transition year student in Eureka secondary school in Kells, County Meath.  I am here today to represent my school community by speaking about why we must look into achieving a special status for one of the key symbols of our country, namely, the national anthem, \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\".  As a teenage girl who plays gaelic football at club and county level, I cannot put into words how much pride I feel inside as we all sing along together to our national anthem on final days and special occasions.  It would be such a shame to see our national anthem used inappropriately or disrespected by others.  From this point, I believe that \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" deserves a special status in law and the respect to not get altered in any way.<\/p> <p>  The harp, Ireland's national emblem, has a special status.<\/p><p>The Irish flag, likewise, has a special status and must be treated at all times with appropriate respect by those who use it.  One might well ask why our national anthem does not have a special status.  It seems obvious that such status should be afforded to \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\".  When it is sung in Irish, its lyrics recall the struggles and hardships that we, the people of Ireland, endured for hundreds of years.  We remember the past generations who fought to attain for our country the respect it deserves.  For these reasons, \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\" should be enshrined in law and not misused for advertising purposes.<\/p><p> In 1916, the people who stood up for the freedom of our country sang this very song while the GPO was burning to the ground.  Why would we not seek to safeguard something so important to the history of our country?  It was afforded immense respect in the past and should enjoy the same respect into the future.  The title translates to \"The Soldier's Song\", which was the original version in English.  Why would we show disrespect to those soldiers by allowing the anthem to be modified?  When we hear it, it unites Irish people all over the world.  If we allow people to use it for their own purposes, it will take away from the sentimental value attached to the anthem and the pride in which we as a country hold it.  I thank Members for their attention.  We will be happy to answer any questions they have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily-Jo White","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512468000,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to address the committee.  I am a transition year student in Eureka secondary school in Kells, County Meath.  I am here today to talk to Members about why our national anthem should be copyrighted.  I will discuss the history of the anthem and its copyright before outlining some of the reasons that we should safeguard it for the future.<\/p> <p>  \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\", also known as The Soldier's Song, was written in 1909 by Peadar Kearney with music by Patrick Heeney.  It was written in English by Mr. Kearney before, in the 1930s, being translated into Irish by Liam &Oacute; Rinn  It was originally used as a marching song by the Irish Volunteer Force and was sung by the rebels in the GPO during the 1916 Rising.  On 12 July 1926, it was adopted by the new Irish Free State as its national anthem.  In 1933, the Department of Finance paid &pound;1,000 to copyright the anthem.  However, due to copyright changes in the 1950s, it was necessary to pay an additional &pound;2,500 in 1965 to maintain the copyright.  Unfortunately, on 31 December 2012, on the 70th anniversary of its author's death, the copyright on the anthem ran out.<\/p> <p>  As Senator Mark Daly has indicated, copyrighting the anthem would protect it from being used in an inappropriate way.  Contrary to views expressed by some, doing so would not deny any capacity to re-imagine the song.  According to Wikipedia, during the previous copyright, most requests for publication were accepted, although several of a purely commercial nature, such as in advertisements, were denied.  That was entirely appropriate.  Not only does the anthem represent our struggle to overcome years of oppression, but it had a key role in the 1916 Rising, which is a crucial event in our history.  I am not sure of the views of other Senators, but I am in complete agreement with Senator Daly that the commercial use of our national anthem is completely inappropriate and makes a mockery of it.  I am in agreement with the Senator, too, that the use of the anthem in advertising for the new Dunnes Stores clothing range by former Kerry footballer, Paul Galvin, is completely out of order and should not be allowed.  Such usage is an affront to what the anthem stands for, which is years of strife and resilience.<\/p> <p>  \"Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann\", like both the harp and the Irish flag, two other important elements of Irish culture and history, should be protected by the State against inappropriate commercial and advertising usage.  We must restore, in the second decade of the 21st century, the protection that was afforded to our national anthem in the 1930s.  I thank Senators for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Alex Martin"},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their interesting submissions.

Dr. Eoin O'Dell made a very clear, concise and impressively knowledgeable case for legislation as opposed to copyright.  It is vital that the anthem be kept in the public domain but that we have safeguards in place to ensure it is respected and not used for commercial purposes.  That is the focus of our concerns.

It was touched on in the earlier session.  For instance, the Department of the Taoiseach recognises the national anthem, but it does not give due recognition to those responsible for providing it, namely, Peadar Kearney, Patrick Heeney and Liam &Oacute; Rinn who translated it.  They are not recognised on the Department of the Taoiseach's official website or the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  While it might appear to be minor, it is a major issue because it relates to recognition.  The position should be corrected immediately across all Government websites.  It could easily be done today.<\/p> <p>  The contributions from the schools were interesting and welcome.  We live in modern Ireland and there should be an Irish Sign Language, ISL, version of the national anthem.  It is wrong that any Irish citizen should feel alienated when the national anthem is played.  Can this issue be addressed?<\/p> <p>  On the copyright issue, after listening to Dr. O'Dell, my preference would be for the national anthem to be enshrined in legislation, as in the case of the American national anthem.  I am not sure why there is a resistance in the Department of Finance to going down that road.  Is there an particular reason we are opting for copyright protection over legislation?  Is there a reason not to take the legislative route to give the national anthem the protection it deserves?  The American flag is recognised as a patriotic custom, as the American national anthem.

During the years in council elections, for example, we have seen the national flag being thrown around the place or draped around people.  That has come to an end.  The Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, should be given credit for bringing back respect for the national flag and how it should be treated.  However, it is easily forgotten.  Look at all of the flags in tatters on flagpoles.  Many were raised to commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Rising but are now in bits.  We are discussing having respect for the national anthem, yet we do not respect the national flag.  I have seen flags on departmental buildings in tatters.  It does not happen in Leinster House.  The military police who raise the national flag every morning and take it down keep it in impeccable condition.  However, some Departments do not respect the national flag.  We must start small and work big.<\/p> <p>  The national anthem should not be just the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills in being part of the curriculum.  It should also be taught in soccer, GAA and rugby clubs, as well as in all other sports organisations.  Former Senator Eamonn Coghlan talks about the pride he felt when the Tricolour was raised when he won the world championship in Helsinki 1983.  That is the pride we should have in our emblems and national anthem.  However, I do not believe it should be confined to the curriculum, it should be taught across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#T00900","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512468000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Section 5 of my Bill would set out what the Minister of State called guidelines.  He referred to the fact that the US national anthem was included in legislation.  It is included as part of guidelines.  My suggestion on what should be done as opposed to what must be done follows the US pattern where standing to attention, saluting the flag and singing the anthem are all stated in terms of what should be done; namely, they are guidelines which it is possible to include in legislation.  The legislation could define the various versions of the national anthem in Irish, English, the music, sign language and so forth.  It could then provide that all of the various versions should be treated with dignity and respect.<\/p> <p>  My Bill also tries to pick up on Senator Mark Daly's point about how some potential commercial uses might be inappropriate.

Senator Daly's first cut was to attempt to use copyright law to do this.  I agree with the Minister of State that that just will not work because it is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  My suggestion is that if it is specified that commercial activities and commercial advertisements should not happen, if what is meant by commercial activity, a commercial advertisement and \"should not happen\" is defined and if these elements are specified in their own terms in the Bill, the matter is dealt with appropriately.  Therefore, the anthem should be defined and it should be stated that it should be treated with respect and that commercial activities concerning the anthem should be regulated.

Regarding the nationalism to which the Minister of State referred, I think we all agree that we need civic nationalism, which is all-inclusive, not the old, exclusive nationalism of the past.  I think Se&aacute;n Lemass spoke about it as a patriotism which he understood to be a combination of love of country, pride in its history, tradition and culture and a determination to add to its prestige and achievements.  What we are considering here is the issue of the protocols and guidelines, on which I think we all agree.  The fact that we are here and hearing different accounts of when the anthem was written and when it was translated tells us we have not quite yet arrived at a proper understanding of the history of our anthem.  However, I am sure we all agree that we have the determination to ensure this is rectified.  I agree that the English-language version and the sign language version need to be taught.<\/p> <p>  Has Dr. O'Dell in his research come across countries in which actions have been taken against groups, organisations or individuals for inappropriate use of the national anthem?  We have been in contact with the Canadian Government, which has adopted a kind of middle ground model whereby it has enshrined the English-language version and the French-language version of the national anthem in their law and then devised protocols separate from the law as to what should and should not happen.  This is a matter of the law of unintended consequences, to which the Minister of State referred.  Regarding the history of sanctions, in Ms Tunney's experience, have actions been taken?  I have seen the Irish flag used to advertise products.  Is there a history of a government sanctioning organisations?  I have seen products labelled \"Ireland's favourite whatever\" with the Irish flag on them that are produced elsewhere.  Would that be a breach of the current emblems and copyright legislation and patent legislation?<\/p> <p>  I thank Alain and the students from Bishopstown for coming before the committee and for their support for the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill, which, it is to be hoped, the Government will pass in the D&aacute;il on 14 December.  This would be a great Christmas present for the 50,000 members of the deaf community, which the justice committee has described as suffering extreme marginalisation.  We are learning here that nothing shows the marginalisation of a community more than when its members' national anthem is not in their own language.  That is one thing we will have to rectify.  Given the fact that Denise, John and Alain have made the argument, we will give them the job of coming up with the sign language version for the nation, if that is not too big a job for them.  As they will have learned from the chaotic history of the Irish national anthem, everyone now has a part to play in ensuring we get it right for once and for all.

We will leave that border issue to another day.  Osmond Esmonde had a role in 1926, 757 years later, in getting the Government to determine that we should not have two national anthems, one played abroad and one played at home.  According to what we have just learned, this was on 12 July, another historic day in Irish history.  Perhaps Alain and Bishopstown Community School would do us the honour of coming up with their draft.  Everything will be a draft from here on, including my report.  I thank Emily-Jo, Alex and Stephen for coming before the committee.  They might send us on the details of where they got the source of 12 July because we are struggling here with the number of different dates we have been given as to what happened and when regarding our national anthem.<\/p><p>The Minister of State might talk to us about the options ahead of us, of which there are three.  There is the <i>status quo<\/i>option, which is to get the timelines and history of the national anthem, as we have done with the national flag.  The protocol section of the Taoiseach's Department has devised, first, the origins and history of the flag and, second, the protocols in this regard.  The flag is enshrined in Article 7 of the Constitution.  This <i>status quo<\/i>option concerns the protocols and guidelines that we could devise and leave at that.  However, this option would entail no legislative or formal recognition of the national anthem in Irish or English, or even the music to it or a sign language version of it.  Then we have Dr. O'Dell's view.  I would like him to answer a number of questions.  Are we trying to fix something that does not need fixing?  Have sanctions been taken in other jurisdictions?  When we asked the Canadian Parliament, it could not find any record of sanctions it has taken since it enshrined its national anthem in legislation.  It had protocols and guidelines but said it could not find records.  When one is looking for something that is not there - in this case, breaches of the Parliament's protocols - it is very hard to find it.  Then we have the middle ground option of Canada, a combination of legislation and protocols.  Our job here as legislators is to ask whether we need the protections.  Unfortunately, the national anthem has already been used for commercial purposes, so that breach has already taken place.  Should it be left to the court of public opinion, or is it the requirement of legislators to prevent such inappropriate use?<\/p><p>I thank all the students present, Bishopstown Community School and our other distinguished guests for being with us today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#U00500","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1512468000,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I ask Senator McFadden to forgive me.

Another matter I want the committee to consider shows the maturity of a nation.  If people wish to disrespect our national anthem, that is freedom of expression, which I support.  I might not agree with them and I might dispute the way in which they act with them very strongly, but we must also respect the right of people to an alternative view.  One thing I remember in the UK, going back to the 1970s - I was only a kid - is the Sex Pistols song \"God Save the Queen\".  People are entitled to an alternative view.  Those of us who do not agree with it will not agree with it.  Something similar is going on in the United States with American footballers disrespecting the national anthem by taking a knee.

I will make three brief points.  I am familiar with the Canadian approach and, in fact, section 3 of my Bill is modelled on the Canadian legislation.<\/p><p>The main example in respect of the suggestions I am making to prevent inappropriate commercial usage is Australia, but South Africa has good provisions too.  Permission is sought because it is required and where it is refused, there does not tend to be inappropriate commercial use.  In Australia the mechanism used in requiring the seeking of permission in advance is copyright law.  Once something is no longer covered by copyright, I assume the matter is dealt with by other similar means.  That prevents most instances of egregious use.  If somebody wants to use Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann for an advertisement on television and is refused permission to do so by the Department, I cannot see an attempt to broadcast the advertisement being made.  I take the Minister of State's point that there have been some bad examples of prosecutions brought for misuse.  China and India are good examples in that regard, but there is nothing in any proposal I have made before the committee that involves a prosecution.  My suggestion on guidelines and protocols in legislation was precisely that things should, not ought to, happen but for which there would be no sanction to avoid the appalling vista to which the Minister of State referred of prosecuting footballers who bend a knee rather stand than stand to attention.  I agree completely with the Minister of State that we should respect freedom of expression, which is why the provisions included in my draft proposals related to dignity and respect are cast only in terms of what should be done and not seen as an obligation.<\/p><p> They are my three points.  Australia is an example of a country in which the procedure in place ensure the most inappropriate uses do not happen.  There are many other bad examples, but I do not think the legislation I have proposed or anybody else is suggesting falls into the category which includes China.  I agree completely that if somebody wants to use the national anthem to make a protest, he or she should be able to do so.  My draft proposals would not prevent that from happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017120500002#U01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eoin O'Dell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512468000,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I will answer Senator Mark Daly's question about whether there have been prosecutions for misleading use or gross misuse of any of the national emblems of Ireland or the national flag.

However, even though the questions were quite rightly disallowed, the fact that the issues were raised by Senator Warfield means the inference remains on the record.

The council has both a statutory and non-statutory framework in place to deal with conflicts of interest that may arise.<\/p> <p>  The Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council's governance framework and the council's staff code of conduct all provide that where a conflict of interest arises, that conflict must be disclosed and the conflicted party shall take no part in the council's deliberations or seek to influence it in the decision-making process.  At all times, whether as a council member or as director of the Arts Council, I adhered fully to these provisions and my statutory obligations.

The ICSA strongly supports the Bill and is anxious to see it implemented.  In particular, it supports the extension of burning and hedge cutting dates on a pilot basis.  We believe being able to control vegetation on hills needs the added flexibility of being able to cut in the month of March.  Likewise, we believe flexibility to cut hedges in the month of August is essential.  We have adopted that view owing to the effects of climate change.  We have experienced ever more difficulties because of prolonged milder but wetter weather conditions, all of which means that we cannot get essential work done because of the current restrictions.<\/p> <p>  Let us not be under any illusion.  It is essential to control vegetation on hilly ground.  It is also essential to ensure hills are not overrun by scrub such as gorse and heather.  It would be ideal to have a programme of rotational burning, which is where the current restrictions cause problems.  If farmers can be reasonably confident that they will get a chance to burn some ground every year, a rotation with restricted burning can work very well.<\/p> <p>  It is important to point out that hill farmers are under pressure to keep land in good agricultural condition.  The review of the land parcel identification system, LPIS, in 2013 showed how vulnerable farmers were in terms of land eligibility.  It is unacceptable that they must pay a penalty for a failure to comply with one set of rules when another set are too rigid and unworkable.  The reality is that burning in the winter months is seldom feasible and short days and weather patterns mean that engaging in such work in the month of February rarely works.  It must be understood the land about which we are talking is unsuitable for topping or the use of other types of mechanical control.  Also, the best outcome for wildlife in the long term is achieved by livestock grazing in an extensive manner.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that there is a code of practice on controlled burning which we fully advocate.  Similarly, we support the allowing of hedge cutting in the month of August.  One must understand hedge cutting is done mainly by contractors who have invested in expensive machinery to do the job as efficiently as possible.  The window of opportunity under the current regime is very narrow.  In practice, we try to get all of the work done in a period of approximately three months from September to early December.  As we have seen this year, for much of the period we have been beset by heavy rainfall and poor ground conditions.<\/p> <p>  Hedge cutting is critical for road safety.  Unlike many countries in Europe, all sorts of vehicle access public roads on which visibility is dependent on having well maintained hedges.  The ICSA believes hedges should be dealt with in the month of August.  This work should not be done along public roads in November or December when daylight hours are short and visibility is often poor.  Driving conditions are often made worse by inclement weather.  For health and safety reasons, having hedge cutting vehicles on the roads at this time of year is far from best practice.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we ensure landowners can trim hedges regularly in order to maintain them as an effective barrier for livestock.  The rural environment protection, REP, scheme helped to transform the landscape of the countryside as it provided the impetus for many farmers to renovate hedges that had been neglected for many years.  Many new hedgerows have since been planted under the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  As part of GLAS, 7,500 farmers have planted 1,200 km of new hedgerows, while a further 3,300 km have been rejuvenated by coppicing and hedge laying.  This demonstrates that farmers are keen to maintain diverse landscapes on which relatively small fields are divided by hedges in contrast to the huge open plains in other countries.  We must be sensible.  No farmer wants to have a hedge that is out of control and full of holes.  Farmers who make a huge effort and financial investment in planting or rejuvenating hedges make a commitment to having a diverse landscape that is wildlife friendly.  If we make the maintenance of hedges too challenging by imposing unduly harsh limitations on hedge cutting, we will have created a perverse disincentive to engage in more hedgerow planting and we will have a more bland open countryside only fenced by wire.  If we at least get roadside hedge cutting out of the way in the month of August, it will be easier to have internal hedges cut in the months of September and October.<\/p> <p>  We must have regard for health and safety as we continuously hear about the trauma caused by farm accidents.  It is beyond debate that farmers and contractors are under too much pressure to get the work done in too short a timeframe.  Operators who rush to get it done before the weather breaks are much more likely to make mistakes and be involved in accidents.  As I mentioned, trying to access a public road is lethal if there is no or poor visibility.  Neatly trimmed hedges are a critical piece of infrastructure when it comes to road safety.<\/p> <p>  I am not one for dismissing the environmental lobby.  Farmers are to the forefront in ensuring good environmental management.  However, we believe the concerns expressed about bird life are overstated.  We also believe that unless we have viable farmers, there will not be good environmental management.  We strongly commend the Bill to the committee.  It is a pilot project, but it is the way to go.  The legislation has been a long time in gestation and it is now time to put it into practice.  If there is credible evidence that the change has caused trends to worsen, the Minister can change the provision in the future.  However, we must be pragmatic about the problems that impact severely on farmers and road users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Kent"},{"type":"speech","time":1512471600,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Leanfaimid ar aghaidh leis an Hedge Laying Association of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#E00300","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512471600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I represent the Hedge Laying Association of Ireland, HLAI.  I thank the Chairman and committee members for the invitation to present our case on the potential changes to the Wildlife Act as proposed in the Heritage Bill 2016.  The HLAI is a voluntary group, the principal aim of which is to encourage and facilitate the conservation, protection and appropriate management of hedgerows.  My submission relates primarily to sections 7(2) and 8 of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>The Heritage Bill amends the Wildlife Act, the principal purpose of which is to conserve wildlife.  In that context, the biodiversity and nature of this country are under threat.  Some 28% of breeding bird species are in decline, with many pollinator species at risk.  Some 31% of habitats are in decline, with less than one third of hedgerows surveyed in county hedgerow surveys considered to be in favourable condition.  The proposers and supporters of the Bill do not even suggest the proposed changes will improve the level of wildlife protection.  There is nothing positive in the Bill for the protection of hedgerows and the wildlife that depends on them.  On the contrary, the level of wildlife protection will be diminished.  Cutting a hedgerow in the period from March to August impinges negatively on its overall value to wildlife.  Any suggestion a hedge can be cut without impacting on wildlife is not credible.  It is simply a question of the degree and nature of the impact.  <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The HLAI fully recognises that in both Irish and European law matters of public health and safety are the over-riding public interest and take precedence over wildlife conservation.  Having said that, we must acknowledge that a negative impact on wildlife is an inescapable consequence.  Morally and legally, we are obliged to limit the consequences to no more than what is absolutely necessary.  The birds directive provides a framework for the safeguarding of wild birds within the context of public health and safety.  We contend that the structure of the Heritage Bill does not adequately reflect these provisions.<br\/><br\/>In examining the Bill we need to be conscious not only of the spirit and intent but also the letter of the law.  We believe the Bill is internally inconsistent.  Section 7(2) grants a partial regulated exemption from the provisions of section 40 of the Wildlife Act for a trial period of two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Foulkes"},{"type":"speech","time":1512471600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#E00500","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512471600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Section 8 grants a permanent and complete unregulated exemption for essentially the same purpose, which is very confusing.  The proposed changes are inconsistent with the provisions of European Law that protect wild birds which permit the granting of a derogation but limit action to what is strictly necessary and which must enable the Commission to supervise them.  Section 7(2) does not refer specifically to safety, even though that has been much stated as the intention.  Section 8, the provisions of which will not be subject to oversight or monitoring, blurs the lines of the closed period and is not subject to the two-year pilot period.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister's working group stated it would be important to engage with the European Commission on the proposed changes, but no formal consultation has taken place.  Section 70 of the Roads Act provides for dealing with safety issues caused by vegetation along public roads.  The Wildlife Act is just a subset of its provisions.  If the section 70 mechanism does not work - it is clear from the debate that there are failings - will a proper exercise be carried out to determine how and where there is failure?  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has not evaluated the extent, scale or causes of road safety issues due to roadside vegetation.  We firmly believe that if one does not diagnose the problem, one is unlikely to find the cure. <\/p> <p>  Tipperary County Council has an ongoing project which is relevant to this matter.  I have acquired, under access to information on the environment, AIE, regulations, completed questionnaires completed by 27 roads engineers on the project.<\/p><p>An evaluation of the responses points to much wider issues than those dealt with in the Bill.  The proposed changes permit but do not compel landowners to cut hedges.  Roads engineers whom we have consulted indicate that the main problem presented by roadside hedgerows is not landowners who want to cut their hedges and cannot do so but by landowners who should cut their hedges and do not do so.  If a hedge presents a safety issue and the landowner chooses not to act, the Bill will be of no assistance.<\/p><p> We must view roadside hedgerows as assets to be managed, not problems to be dealt with.  We fully agree that roadside vegetation creates some road safety problems.  However, it also offers some road safety benefits, as was acknowledged by 80% of the roads engineers who responded to the survey.<\/p><p> The Roads Act gives the National Roads Authority the power to serve notice on a landowner to preserve trees, hedges and shrubs on his or her land to ensure road safety.  Dealing with safety issues is about the assessment of risk.  We cannot avoid risk.  Irrespective of roadside vegetation, there are risks involved in travelling on public roads.  Risk is a subjective evaluation and there is no formula for calculating it.  Under the Roads Act, the ultimate authority in assessing risk is, as the name suggests, the National Roads Authority which is in the best position to make an objective assessment of safety issues.  <\/p><p> We have concerns about the scientific validity of the proposed two-year pilot scheme.  The first working group submission to the Minister acknowledged the lack of scientific data to underpin the changes and stated significant time and resources would be required over a number of years to put them in place.  Issues with definitions, references and the language used in section 40 of the Wildlife Act have not been addressed in the Bill and they lead to issues with interpretation of the law.<\/p><p> While the HLAI recognises the intent of sections 7(2) and 8, we consider that the Bill needs to be restructured to provide for the legally required safeguards that give the maximum degree of protection for wildlife within the scope of dealing with public health and safety issues.  The HLAI does not consider that any of the justifications presented for cutting hedges during the closed period, other than public health and safety, would be valid in an Act intended to conserve wildlife.  If farming systems cannot operate without the need to impinge on wildlife during the breeding and rearing season, any claim that they are sustainable becomes highly questionable.<\/p><p> Section 40 of the Wildlife Act is part of Ireland's general system of protection for wild birds under the birds directive.  However, a number of the key exemptions from section 40 are not consistent with the directive.  I can elaborate on these exemptions, if necessary.  To align the Wildlife Act with the birds directive significant amendments will be required.  I wonder whether it would be better to remove sections 7 and 8 from the Bill, with a view to having a comprehensive revision of section 40 of the Wildlife Act.  <\/p><p> The HLAI is not comfortable opposing the farming organisations on the Bill as we view farmers as strong allies in our work.  The farmer is caught between a rock and a hard place, but we cannot allow nature to be collateral damage.  We need to address wider issues.  Interaction is required between stakeholders and the relevant Departments and a proper and full review of section 70 of the Roads Act is needed to examine all of the issues that affect road safety.  <\/p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Swan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Foulkes","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512471600,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Until I retired five years ago, I worked as the deputy regional manager in the north eastern region of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  My duties included the implementation and enforcement of the Wildlife Acts and the birds and habitats directives in counties Kildare, Laois, Offaly, Dublin, Meath and Louth.  I was familiar with section 40 of the Wildlife Act and prepared many case files for prosecutions.  They were primarily hedge cutting cases detected by conservation rangers.  Hedge cutting cases were not pursued if it was deemed that public health and safety issues were involved.  In most cases, the roadside hedges were being cut solely for aesthetic purposes.<\/p> <p>  I recently heard the then Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphries, state on a radio interview that the proposed change would only involve one year's growth.  This would offer little protection to nesting birds as most bird nests are found within or just inside one year's growth.  The introduction of section 8 is worrying from an enforcement point of view as it gives discretion to landowners or occupiers to decide on public health and safety issues in respect of road hedges in the bird nesting season.  It does not provide for any ministerial oversight and there is no obligation on landowners to justify their actions, as is the case with local authority roads engineers. <\/p> <p>  The proposal to allow the burning of vegetation in the month March is anathema to all conservationists because leverets will be born in March, mallards will have young, grouse will have established breeding territories, hen harriers will be returning to their upland breeding territories and curlews will be returning to their breeding territories.  Burning more land vegetation can have catastrophic consequences for these species.  With hedge cutting in the month of August, this measure will not be compatible with our obligations under Article 5 of the birds directive.  It is not possible to make regulations allowing the burning of vegetation in the month of March and cutting hedges in the month of August which could ensure protection of fauna or flora, particularly birds in their period of breeding and rearing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Val Swan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512471600,"counter":309,"content":"<p>BirdWatch Ireland is grateful to the Cathaoirleach and members for giving it the opportunity to give evidence to the joint committee on the potential impacts of the proposed legislative changes contained in the Heritage Bill.  I will speak first, after which my colleague, Mr. Alex Copeland, will make a contribution.<\/p> <p>  BirdWatch Ireland is the largest independent nature conservation organisation in Ireland.  Established in 1968, we have more than 15,000 members and supporters and a local network of 30 branches nationwide.  We are member supported and science based.  The primary objective of the organisation is research and the protection of wild birds and their habitats in Ireland through the efforts of our staff, members and volunteers alike.  We have branches or staff in every county, working locally and nationally to address conservation issues and protect birds and other biodiversity.  We work with a range of rural stakeholders, including State agencies, farmer representative bodies, local community groups and other environmental organisations.  Many of our staff and supporters live in rural areas and care passionately about the landscape and the protection of wildlife.<\/p> <p>  When the consultation exercise on section 40 of the Wildlife Act was launched in late 2014, BirdWatch Ireland welcomed the emphasis placed in the public consultation texts on the protection of biodiversity, particularly the statements \"that any changes must be in line with Ireland's obligations to protect and enhance our habitats, birds and other species and not to increase the threat to them\" and that \"this will be an overriding consideration in any proposals for change\".  Unfortunately, these statements appear to have been misleading, at best, with little evidence of biodiversity protection forming the basis of consideration of the proposed changes in the Heritage Bill.<\/p> <p>  In this submission BirdWatch Ireland seeks to address a number of issues that have arisen through the consultation on section 40 of the Wildlife Act and in the subsequent proposals contained in the Heritage Bill.  The provisions included in the Bill about which we are most concerned are sections 7 and 8 which will allow roadside hedge cutting in the month of August and the burning of vegetation on hills and mountains in the month of March.  We will present scientific evidence which demonstrates the need to retain the existing dates for the closed seasons in the Wildlife Act.  We call on all stakeholders who are concerned about the legislation, including farm organisations and hedge cutting contractors, to discuss the issues and agree on solutions that would be in compliance with the law. <\/p> <p>  With regard to the legal requirement on the State to protect its wild bird populations, the existing dates set for the burning of vegetation and the cutting of hedgerows are the six months starting from 1 September to the last day of February.  These dates were set in 1976 and amended in 2000 by the Oireachtas to provide for the protection of birds at their most vulnerable time, namely, during the breeding and rearing season.  Under European Union law, specifically the birds directive, and Irish law, specifically the Birds and Natural Habitats Regulations 2011, all wild birds are protected.  Article 5 of the birds directive requires member states to establish a general system for the protection of wild birds.  This law also prohibits the deliberate destruction of or damage to bird nests and eggs and prohibits the deliberate significant disturbance of birds, particularly during the period of breeding and rearing.  Article 8 of the directive states member states shall prohibit the use of all large-scale or non-selective means which result in the killing or capture of birds or are capable of causing the local disappearance of a species.<\/p><p>Article 9 allows for a derogation from these terms only for specific reasons including public health and safety, but strict tests must be passed first and alternative options must also be exhausted.<\/p><p> Sections 7 and 8 of the Heritage Bill propose to change the dates set as the period of protection for wild birds to carry out breeding and rearing of chicks in both upland and hedgerow habitats.  This undermines the system of protection for birds in Ireland and is in breach of the birds directive.<\/p><p> It is our view therefore that the proposed changes to the Wildlife Act contained in the Heritage Bill should be discarded and a forum established with those stakeholders to set out a path to both protect our wild birds, ensure farming continues in the uplands and ensure road safety concerns are met.  Yesterday the Commissioner, Phil Hogan, spoke at the FoodWise 2025 conference in Croke Park and warned Ireland of its failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Burning in the uplands is destructive to our upland peatland habitats.  We need to address these concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512471600,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I will present some information on the science and the data on dates for bird nesting seasons.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Bird nesting dates are established through observing bird breeding activity.  Ireland does not have its own monitoring scheme for this purpose and therefore we rely on data from the UK and specifically from the British Trust for Ornithology&rsquo;s Nest Record Scheme, NRS.  Although this scheme includes Ireland, less than 1% of records within that database relate to Irish records.  We presented data in our submission to the Minister in the Public Consultation on the Review of Section 40 of the Wildlife Act.  The data used are from records from the period 2000 to 2009, and contain approximately 35,000 to 45,000 records per annum.  It is worth stressing that this waw the only scientific data provided as part of the consultation.<br\/><br\/>The Heritage Bill makes no distinction about the burning of vegetation for land management which is primarily a consideration in upland habitats.  That said, other valuable lowland habitats, particularly scrub, may also be subject to burning being used as a management tool.  BirdWatch Ireland wishes to again emphasise the need for better engagement between stakeholders in the uplands in regard to optimal land management strategies.  This could include drafting upland management plans on a site-by-site basis, as well as streamlining legislative requirements for undertaking vegetation management in sensitive and internationally important habitats and landscapes.  <br\/><br\/>A background to the ecology of our upland birds is included in BirdWatch Ireland's written submission.  Although few of our upland birds have eggs laid in March, it is important to note that so-called &quot;first egg dates&quot; do not represent the start of the nesting season since before birds begin laying eggs they set out territories, they have to find a mate and nests have to be constructed.  Studies in Scotland suggest that territory establishment for curlew takes between 40 and 60 days in advance of egg laying.  The curlew, which starts to nest in mid-April would need the territories to be available in late February or early March. <br\/><br\/>This data underline the importance of protecting nesting habitat for upland species from late February or early March.  Burning during the March period may displace curlew and other priority species from their territories, and with few alternative habitats available to them, risk complete failure of nesting during that particular year.  The reason for flagging curlew in particular is because it is not only red listed in Ireland but on the global red list of species threatened with extinction.<br\/><br\/>Some of the policy drivers for the burning of vegetation have been mentioned.  There is clearly a conflict between the need to manage and control vegetation, such as old heather and encroaching scrub, to maintain land for agriculture, and the value that these habitats offer wildlife.  In many cases, as acknowledged by the statement from the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, this management is often undertaken for land to maintain land eligibility for EU-funded schemes.  That is an issue for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy through the methods available to it.<br\/><br\/>Yesterday, in a statement, the Minister said that there would be a consultation on the next CAP starting in the new year.  That might be a better time to discuss the opportunities for land eligibility.  Where land is being cleared to open it up for agriculture rather than for farming subsidies, the removal of the encroaching scrub would be required.  From the perspective of trying to carry out controlled burns, research in the UK has demonstrated that management fires should be set in winter or early spring before the soils start to warm up.  The later in spring or summer that burning takes place the drier and more flammable vegetation will be.  If the objective is to carry out a limited controlled burn then having highly flammable vegetation is not helpful.  The chances of causing wildfires substantially increase in spring and summer during dry periods.  This also increases deep soil heating and the catastrophic burning of peat becomes more likely to occur.  Legalising burning of vegetation in March will substantially increase the likelihood that wildfires will continue to occur.  In 2017, according to the Forest Service, 432 illegal fires occurred in our uplands and hills in May.  How will legalising burning in March stop these fires in May?  In Northern Ireland, where there is a later burning date, there are still issues with wild fires.  Allowing burning in March does not address the issue.  <br\/><br\/>On land management, Teagasc observes that the wild fires and burning of vegetation is not good for farming.  Burning in March would promote the growth of the very scrub species which burning is supposed to control.  Bracken, which is deep rooted can survive fire and will spread after a fire.  Gorse regenerates prolifically from a seedbank after a fire and ideally, should be kept under control by grazing.  In the case of heather, burning should be controlled, irregular and in patches.  Burning is only recommended when followed with sustainable levels of livestock grazing <br\/><br\/>The Forestry Service&rsquo;s own Forestry Standards Manual also states that &quot;[T]he burning of gorse will not give long-term control, and may actually contribute to the further development of the species following burning and subsequent planting.  Attempts at burning large areas of gorse may easily give rise to wildfire conditions and damage to land, habitats and other resources.  Ideally, gorse should be treated by flailing&quot;.  In regard to upland management, regarding heather research in Scotland states that &ldquo;Regeneration was more prolific after burning in autumn than in spring, contrary to the traditionally held belief&rdquo;.  From both an environmental, farming and a health and safety perspective, the best time to burn is between September and November.  Burning is also no substitute for sustainable grazing with traditional, upland cattle and sheep breeds.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly discuss hedge cutting.  Hedgerows are widely accepted as one of the most biodiversity-rich habitats in an intensively-farmed landscape.  They are essential habitats in a range of ecosystems, and provide valuable services to agricultural activities, such as habitats for pollinators and the predators of pest species, prevention of soil erosion and interception of water flows, and they sequester carbon.  They are a quintessential feature of Irish rural landscapes, providing shelter to stock and crops, as well as nesting and feeding opportunities for many farmland birds.  Appropriate management benefits biodiversity, farmers and road users.<br\/><br\/>With regard to data presented in common and widespread hedgerow species and their nesting season, the yellowhammer, the species with the latest fledging dates, is worthy of special mention.  It is red-listed due to both short and long-term population declines and has also experienced a substantial range contraction over recent years.  In 2017, using funding from the Heritage Council, BirdWatch Ireland undertook recording of yellowhammer breeding activity using local volunteers in two sample counties, Kildare and Meath.  The results show that in Ireland yellowhammers are nesting throughout August.  The current legislation permits hedges to be cut from 1 September, at which time data suggests that some 5% of yellowhammers may still have chicks in the nest.  In yellowhammer areas, which could be defined on a county-by-county basis &ndash; we have very good regional data for the occurrence of yellowhammer in Ireland - hedgerow cutting should not be permitted until at least mid-September when nesting for this red-listed species has finished.  Allowing the cutting of hedgerows in August could be devastating for this particular red-listed bird.<br\/><br\/>Throughout the debate on changing section 40 of the Wildlife Act, and the proposals contained within the Heritage Bill, BirdWatch Ireland and other environmental bodies have always advocated that cutting in the closed season should continue to be permitted for health and safety.  However, it has to be accepted that the Wildlife Act is not about road safety, which is covered by other legislation.  There is an issue with landowners who should cut their hedgerows but do not, and this legislation will not compel them to do so.  Furthermore, we have sought to improve legislation for this to happen.  Indeed, the Heritage Bill makes the current exemption of cutting hedgerows in the closed season more uncertain which, in turn, could make roads more dangerous.  The management of roadside hedgerows has to be considered on a case-by-case basis.  By specifying within the Heritage Bill that cutting can take place in August leaves uncertainty about cutting hedges in other months particularly May, June and July when cutting of certain hedges may be required.  The existing exceptions for hedge cutting for health and safety already contained in the Wildlife Act allow cutting throughout the closed season, and it is important that this can continue.  The process through which this can be facilitated needs to be improved, but the Wildlife Act is not the mechanism for this.<\/p><p>However, this pilot applies to all 26 counties and can be renewed, on approval, on a three-yearly basis. <\/p><p> No methodology for a study of the impact of the changes has been produced and there is no mechanism specified for the collection of data or comparison of results or even clarity on what is to be established by this pilot.  Furthermore, despite the consultation on section 40 being concluded in January 2015, no baseline data on likely impacts of the proposed changes have been collected, despite the passage of three bird breeding seasons.<\/p><p> The Heritage Bill proposes changing the dates now, with collection of data to see if there are any impacts over the two year pilot period.  If the globally red-listed Curlew have been wiped out from the uplands after the completion of this pilot, or Yellowhammer populations have collapsed further in our lowland hedgerow landscapes, what then? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alex Copland","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512471600,"counter":313,"content":"<p>We thank the committee for its invitation to discuss part two of the Bill, which deals with the canals and the Barrow navigation.<br\/><br\/>The Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, IWAI, is a voluntary body with 23 branches across the island of Ireland representing over 3,000 waterways enthusiasts.

It is viewed as disproportionate and heavy handed legislation that will enable similarly onerous by-laws.  An important aspect here is to understand that the canals and Barrow navigation are different from other Irish waterways in two key areas.  Unlike the other navigations, there are no private mooring provisions or service providers on the canals.  Waterways Ireland are a monopoly.  Secondly, the canals are not wide open expanses of water offering easy and multiple navigation options.  They are effectively linear waterways with issues and challenges such as low water levels, weed issues, obstructions underwater, manually operated locks, etc.  Larger boats, including the traditional vessels the canals were built for, can have to travel for over a day to find an area wide enough to turn around in.  Thus, travel on the canals tend to involve lengthy tours of duty, so to speak, rather than short cruises from a home-base marina.  This travel is typically done on weekends and over a period of weeks and months.  The green and silver route promoted by IWAI Dublin demonstrates this very well, promoting travel through Dublin via the Royal and Grand Canal and the Barrow and River Shannon, although this struggles due to the fact that a bridge that blocks the canal navigation in Dublin is only raised a couple of times each year.  The proposals in the Heritage Bill are not compatible with current boating practices on the canals.  They more reflective of boating practices on open waterways.  <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Why do boaters travel the canals?  The Royal and Grand canals and Barrow navigation waterways are a magnificent marriage of nature with early engineering feats.  They link the north, south, east and west of all the navigations across Ireland, including the Shannon, the Erne, the Liffey, the Suir and the Nore, all accessible by boat through the canals and Barrow.  They have the potential to attract domestic and international boating visitors who will relish the tranquil opportunity of slow tourism, cruising at walking pace as people move faster than the canal boats on the system, while experiencing the associated industrial heritage, wooded valleys, peat lands, small villages and towns that have interdependence with the canals and our capital city.  There is also unfortunately the adventure in between where boaters at some locations can be targeted by antisocial behaviour or delayed for hours trying to remove obstructions from the canal or from the propellers on the boat.  It&rsquo;s not all plain sailing. <br\/><br\/>The main IWAI areas of concern relate to the new complicated licensing, rather than the simple permitting system that has operated for decades, which is customer friendly, easy to use and understand and fit for purpose; adequate provisions so that boats of dimensions for which the canals were built to accommodate are protected and can continue to use the canals into the future; appropriate charging structures that match the provision of services available; the fixed payment notices and fines with no independent appeal mechanism other than the courts that will discourage use of the canals and are not in place on any other inland waterways; the proposed provision and powers of authorised officers; and the legislation that will facilitate the introduction of a complete different set of rules, charges, regulations and fines that are not in place on the adjoining waterways.  The result will be that canals users will simply move to these waterways which will be a further blow to an already fragile future of navigations on the canals.<br\/><br\/>In 2012, Waterways Ireland, the navigation authority, who have no corporate governance structure, attempted to introduce new by-laws without any public pre-consultation.  The IWAI and over 2,000 individuals from waterway communities and international waterways organisations responded within the 21 day consultation period expressing huge concerns.  One of these concerns identified by the IWAI was that the proposed by-laws lacked legal authority.  This was subsequently accepted by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, based on advice of the Attorney General.  Subsequently the canal aspect of this Heritage Bill was introduced in January 2016, again without any pre-consultations or any notice to the IWAI or canal communities.  At high levels meetings between Waterways Ireland and the IWAI it has been made clear that Waterways Ireland wish to immediately reintroduce the proposed 2012 by-laws and increase charges to the maximum level to attract private marina operators onto the canal.  This approach of putting the cart before the horse will finish the canals, as due to their linear nature they do not represent an attractive private investment opportunity compared to other, more expansive waterways.  Why try to enforce excessive charges and licence agreements on only one group of customers for use of a struggling piece of infrastructure, rather than improve the service, improve the product, restore confidence in the product, increase the boats using it and entice private investment that way?<br\/><br\/>We have included in our submission a copy of the proposed Waterways Ireland annual canal permit licence agreement.  This runs to nine pages, requires four different signatures, witnesses and seals of office and is we believe an onerous and disproportionate burden on our citizens at a time when the political agenda is all about administrative burden reduction.  This should remain a simple permit that is the equivalent of a road tax certificate.  Instead it is a complex legal document which will require boat owners to seek legal advice.  Licenses are not in place on any other waterway, nor in use in private marinas or local authority marinas where annual mooring is provided.  The IWAI is not against contributing to the canals financially.  We have, over the past two years, sought to engage with Waterways Ireland regarding new permitting and charges in advance of any updating of by-laws.  The IWAI offered agreement to a new increased pricing structure proposed by Waterways Ireland if it was based on a simple permitting system without complex licences.  Our offer was rejected and we were told the matter was exhausted.  We still await a reply as to what protection and advantages the new and highly legalistic licence system gives Waterways Ireland compared to the traditional, user-friendly permit system where one agrees to abide by published terms and conditions.  Regardless of the size of any increase in charges to boaters, the income received by Waterways Ireland from these license charges will be very, very small compared to its annual budget.  It will represent 0.25% of its income. <br\/><br\/>The canals and Barrow navigation are an important part of our social infrastructure, just like Phoenix Park, other national parks or St. Stephen's Green.  None of these are expected to pay their way.  Citizens and visitors avail of them freely, as do all recreational users of the canals, except for boaters.  Of the over two dozen different user groups on the canals only the social boaters are being targeted with complicated licensing agreements and charges.  The IWAI accepts that there are issues arising in less than a handful of places primarily due to location, and these do need addressing.  The three navigations in question total 336 km.  The length of waterway affected by the few areas with concerns is a couple of kilometres; less than 1%.  It is important that legislation for by-laws that will be detrimental to 99% are not introduced to address issues arising in less than 1% of the waterways.  The legislation should enable by-laws to vary from location to location on the canals.<\/p><p>Some may view aspects of Part 2 of the Bill on their own as reasonable but they impose a significant burden and risk collectively with no evidence presented as to what risk analysis has been done in relation to these proposals or why only one user group is being targeted for payment.<\/p><p> The canal built initially for boats have many different users today.  The proposed greenways alongside will be great but a key attraction of the canals is the boats that use them, both modern and heritage canal boats and barges.  They act as a magnet to visitors who love to walk alongside and admire them and chat to the crews.  Irish boaters, local communities and visitors have helped to keep these navigations active and open.  It is time now to expose and develop them for national and international tourism with appropriate promotion, management and community engagement.  They can be a vibrant recreational resource for the 21st century linking slow tourism with invaluable industrial, archaeological and environmental legacies.  They can be a world-class branded waterways route, similar to the lakes of Killarney, the Norfolk Broads, the Four Counties Ring in England and the lakes of Canada. <\/p><p> Some 61 different amendments were tabled on the Heritage Bill 2016 [Seanad] during the Committee Stage debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann by numerous party and Independent Senators.  This committee has an ideal opportunity for new partnership politics to be demonstrated by proposing an amendment for the withdrawal of the Part 2, the section of the Bill entitled Canals. from the Bill to facilitate the introduction of a fit for purpose, dedicated canal Act with proper pre legislative consultation.  Over regulation and higher charges are not the answer to developing these waterways.  They deserve proper legislation that will put user requirements, local communities and tourism at the centre of the regulations.<\/p><p> It would ironic if this Heritage Bill, rather than protecting the future of the Grand and Royal canals and Barrow navigation enables legislation for by-laws that end up creating waterways with no boats on them. The IWAI thank members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512471600,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I might start off with a few questions.  It seems that in the past 40 years that enormous damage has been done to the wildlife of this State in that a large number of species have been reduced in range and in number and there have been significant changes to the natural habitat of those species.  It seems also during that period that major difficulties have arisen in farming.  Farmers are becoming a rare species in the State also.  There are only half the number of farmers now that there was 100 years ago.  Cattle farmers are earning on average &euro;12,500 a year, which is an incredibly low figure.  It also seems that this Bill does not necessarily go anywhere in alleviating some of those difficulties and solving some of the problems that have been mentioned.<\/p> <p>  We had people in with us last week who mentioned that there was only one official application for a licence for controlled burning in the whole State, while 70 other fires were lit, not necessarily by farmers in the State.  It seems that the Bill we are arguing about is irrelevant to the real lives of many people within the country, both farmers and conservationists.  Much more has to be done in working that.  It has been mentioned that rotational burning could be useful for farmers and I would like the conservationists to answer a question on whether rotational burning could be done in a manner which will achieve conservation objectives and the needs of the farmers.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the hedges, one of the issues is the broadening of the time span in which hedges can be cut.  I live in a small lane in the countryside and half the hedges have not been cut at this stage.  There does not seem to be a pressure coming from the farmers on the ground to have the hedges cut in the general sense as it is nearly January before some of them are cutting their hedges.<\/p> <p>  Do members and witnesses find it striking that the Road Safety Authority did not have an input in the Bill and that the Minister did not meet with Road Safety Authority, which is the body tasked with road safety in the State and yet it did not have a role in identifying a solution to some of the road safety issues there?  We have a mechanism to deal with hedges as they affect visibility on the roads, not just during the window of opportunity but at any time of the year.  If there is a problem with road safety surely the logic would be to make the section 70 provision far more useful and easy to access in situations where the hedges have an impact on road safety.<\/p> <p>  I thank the IWAI for their contribution on the canals and waterways because there were practical amendment that we can consider to arrive at some of the solutions that the IWAI mentioned.  It seems onerous that the people who are key to the canals are being forced into a rigmarole of making an application.  Do the witnesses think that Waterways Ireland plays a positive role in the management of the canals?  I am from Navan and the Navan-Drogheda Canal is not under Waterways Ireland, would it be useful to have that type of canal brought under the remit of Waterways Ireland?  Would it get more funding and would it be fixed?  I will ask Dr. Copeland from BirdWatch Ireland to address some of those questions<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#J00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512471600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>On the question of rotational burning, it can have benefits for wildlife.

In fact it is fair to say that Irish farmers are streets ahead of their colleagues in many European countries.  One can see that if one travels throughout other countries.  We have a much more intricate pattern, a mosaic of hedgerows which is far in excess of what one would see in some of the other European countries.  If we want this commitment of farmers to having more hedgerows rather than less, hedgerows have to work for farmers as well.  That is why we are fully supportive of the laying of hedgerows.  It is great work but it is time consuming and hard and it is expensive if one has to pay somebody to do it because it takes a while.  In addition, once it has been done the hedge will have to be maintained.<\/p><p>Farmers do not cut all their hedges every year.  There is no one asking for that.  In fact, it is much better to cut on a rotational basis, perhaps once every three years or so.  Many hedges do not get cut every year but that is good practice.<\/p><p> My association has much common ground with BirdWatch Ireland.  Information on what happens in Britain, for example, is not strictly comparable with what happens here.  The weather patterns are not strictly the same.  The rainfall patterns in the west of Ireland are different from those in Leinster and, by extension, much different from those in Yorkshire and elsewhere in the United Kingdom.

If we can get some of the hedge-cutting done in August, it will reduce the pressure on contractors.  Most of the work is done by contractors.  Cutting in August would make it more straightforward to get the work done in a timely fashion.  Most of the contractors have several different contracting operations.  If they take off the hedge-cutting machine in order to spread slurry, typically after 15 January, that is the end of hedge-cutting for them.  Getting the work done is very much dependent on the availability of contractors.  Farmers do not do the work on their own.  This is about trying to ensure contractors have a reasonable period in which to do the work that needs to be done in any given county.

Some of the responses from the road engineers are interesting.  With regard to availability and difficulties in getting landowners to fulfil duties, the availability of machinery and competent operators was not an issue for road engineers.  Let us consider the argument that we need to cut roadside hedges in August so machinery will be available to get into the fields in September and onwards.  There are periods from September to February when the ground is not trafficable.  Surely that is the time when the machinery operators should be out on the roads cutting.

What was said yesterday by Commissioner Hogan at the Food Wise Conference is really significant because there is an increasing realisation that Irish agriculture and environmental interests will have to come together and that the future funding of Irish agriculture will require a lower-emissions, biodiversity-rich form of land and water management that will require a complete transformation of our whole land use strategy.  It will result in considerable potential for Irish farming if the protection of biodiversity is taken into account.  We have to get the contractors to work around the birds' timetable; we cannot talk to the yellowhammer and ask it to change its fledging time.  This is an important philosophical and material issue.  Should contractors bend to nature or should nature get chopped off?

The curlew breeding population in Ireland is approximately 120 pairs.  Thousands come to Ireland for the winter, as it is much milder here so the population from the UK and Scandinavia migrate down to Ireland to spend the winter here.  The breeding population is what we are particularly concerned about in Ireland.  There has been a decline in the last 25 years of 86%.  In terms of range contraction, nearly three quarters of the range has gone.  The main drivers for curlew are the drainage of agricultural land and the fragmentation of its habitat.  The curlew is a species that likes damp, peaty, rushy pasture and uplands.  Curlews avoid areas of trees.  They like open moorland and landscapes.  Afforestation and fragmentation of habitats are huge issues.<\/p> <p>  The yellowhammer is still probably quite numerous.  I estimate the population to be between approximately 25,000 and 30,000 pairs in Ireland.  Compared to the curlew that is very common but yellowhammers have declined by 90% in the past 25 years.  Their range contraction has also been enormous.  Yellowhammers are still common and widespread but they are not as common and widespread as they were.  Forty years ago they would have been in every townland and parish in Ireland.  Now they are concentrated very much in the south east which is the tillage and cereal growing area on which they are dependent.  They are seed-eating birds and they are found in cereal growing areas.  They nest in hedgerows.  They are particularly vulnerable to agricultural management and intensification.  The reason for their decline in range has simply been the loss of small-scale tillage, particularly in the west where 40 years ago nearly all the farms would have had an acre of oats or potatoes to feed a cow or pony but that is no longer the case.  As a result we have seen them contract into the core area where one still has commercial cereal growing.  I do not think we will ever see a return of yellowhammers to the whole of the country but we need to try to hold on to what we have, where we have it.  The population is still declining significantly even in the south-east stronghold.  The population is declining even when hedge cutting in August is not allowed so my worry is that if one allows hedge cutting during August, one could absolutely decimate the population.  It is already on the red list and is declining.  We should be taking action to help protect and conserve it and not put it at more risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#L00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alex Copland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512471600,"counter":336,"content":"<p>In an overall philosophical way we agree that there is a need for a Common Agricultural Policy which creates balance between environmental and agricultural interests.  That said, farmers have to be able to make a living as well.  We would like to see farmers being able to benefit from renewable energy opportunities.  This country has been very slow to help farmers to do that.  Moreover, Europe also needs to have a coherent renewable energy policy.  Unfortunately, it has been characterised by flip-flopping on policy and not knowing where it stands, for example, on biofuels.  In Ireland, for example, the renewable electricity support scheme should support farmers to benefit from, for example, rooftop solar panels.  We see there is potential in anaerobic digestion to create a win-win scenario in terms of water quality, emissions from slurry spreading and providing an economic benefit to farmers for the production of renewable heat and electricity.  A lot of things could be done.<\/p> <p>  We need to get the balance right between dairy, livestock production and tillage.  It is fair to say that the decline of some bird species can be linked with the poor performance of tillage in recent years and the fact that a lot of the regions where we traditionally had tillage have declined significantly.  We have lost about 17% of the tillage area.  That is part of the issue.  If we want to have the right mix we need to have a balance between the sectors but we need to work on the basis that farmers can only play their part in environmental benefits if they are making money out of farming and agriculture.  If farmers cannot make a living then one will not have the environmental benefits provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Punch"},{"type":"speech","time":1512471600,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I fully support Mr. Punch's proposal on renewable energy.

We heard today about the potential loss of peatland uplands from burning and the loss of biodiversity from same.  There may also be an effect on run-off water and flood management.  In terms of CAP reform, we want to pay farmers for those services but how can we do that when at the same time we are introducing legislation that is anathema to biodiversity protection as well as carbon storage?  We agree with what has been said about renewable energy but the payments from a new CAP system which will begin early next year must be based on an approach taken arm-in-arm with BirdWatch Ireland and the natural heritage bodies in order for us to be able to get the payment farmers should be getting for the services they render.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#L00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1512471600,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Would anyone like to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#L00400","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512471600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>We agree.

There are opportunities now with the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy to address some of the contradictions which exist and have been spoken about.  There have been contradictions in respect of one set of regulations pressing towards making sure that land is in an agriculturally fit state and the other set of regulations rightly looking to preserve biodiversity.  I hope that within the Common Agricultural Policy we will now have that space.  It seems there is potential for it to be more responsive to ensure we can address those contradictions.  However, targets are going to be set and the fines will be more rigorous and higher and Ireland will face significant liabilities if we do not address our climate targets and potentially even sooner than that if we do not address our biodiversity targets.  While Ireland has a wonderful network of hedgerows, which was spoken about by the ICSFA and others, we do not have a large reserve of forest such as other countries might have.  When we talk about our carbon sinks we argue in the CAP negotiations about our hedgerows as our natural reserved areas.  That is what we have.  It is a unique asset but it is also the case that this country might not have assets which other countries have going into the CAP negotiations.  The hedgerows will play a key role in those talks.<\/p> <p>  I wish to focus on one issue.  I do not intend to speak for long as I am conscious other committee members wish to speak.<\/p><p>I want to refer to one important issue around section 70 and perhaps it could be addressed.  The issue about which I am particularly concerned is that the Bill, following the end of the debate on it in the Seanad, introduced a very unusual provision, which suggests that landowners would directly interpret section 70 of the Act, whereas previously it would have been interpreted pursuant to section 70 with respect to the decisions in terms of road safety.  It is my understanding that it would be more normal and appropriate, as was previously the case, that notices under section 70 would be served by local authorities.  We have sought, and I would encourage those in the D&aacute;il to do so, to widen section 70 in order that more people would be able to ask the local authority to issue them.  I  would be happy for any of the witnesses to answer my question in this respect.  Mr. Foulkes spoke about section 70.  If we have people interpreting road safety individually and we have heard that 63% of landowners do not feel able to interpret it, we are opening up potentially further problems in terms of where liability lies.  If a hedgerow is a cause of concern for road safety, would this provision potentially diminish the power of the local authority to get that hedgerow cut?  Could we be facing increasing dangers on the roads?  If there are accidents caused either by the presence or lack of presence of hedge-cutting and, for example, low winter sun is a concern, where will the liability lie?  I would mention those new concerns.  It would be beneficial if we were to close that loophole which opened up at the end of the debate on the Bill in the Seanad,  While we may discuss other aspects in great detail, that particular loophole concerning where the decision-making in respect of road safety lies is a very important one.<\/p><p> One of the witnesses was correct in what he said in that it is strange that we are talking about one-year growth because rotational cutting would surely be better practice.  Perhaps that is an issue to be raised with the Minister.  With regard to alternatives, it was cited under the birds directive that all alternatives should be sought.  There have been alternative schemes in Clare and elsewhere that have been examined.  I refer to other ways of addressing the concerns of landowners and concerns regarding the environment.  <\/p><p> My last point relates to a concern about a pilot scheme.  If we have self-interpretation of road safety and hedge-cutting, which does not need to be reported and is not in any way charted by local authorities, it is hard to see how we could have a pilot scheme because we are almost having two processes happening at once - a complete change in how section 70 operates without having a debate on that and the other provisions that have been put forward in the Bill.  The witnesses might address the question of a pilot scheme and if it is plausible in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#L00600","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512471600,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Foulkes like to take the first question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#M00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512471600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Regarding the liability question, it is beyond my ability to answer that.  That will be a matter for the courts but it is certainly a question that needs to be asked and it is also a question, with respect to the changes in this Bill, that has not been asked up to this point.  In terms of alternatives, as the Senator said, Clare County Council has a community hedge-cutting scheme.  Such a scheme is due to be introduced in County Cork.  There is one in County Leitrim and I am working with Leitrim county Council in connection with it.  I believe Roscommon and Mayo are considering introducing one.  The basic emphasis of those alternatives is to do what the overall alternative is.  If we manage as much of the hedgerows as we can during the appropriate six months, the open season for cutting, that reduces the need for cutting during the closed period.  It does not eliminate it entirely because there could be a need to cut vegetative growth again during the summer months in certain circumstances particularly on narrow rural roads.  Those alternatives to try to get the necessary work done at the appropriate time will mitigate against the need for cutting during the closed period where it can be damaging.<\/p> <p>  In terms of a pilot scheme, I totally agree with the Senator.  It is very confusing as to whether we are regulating to do something in the month of August.  There seems to be a general provision created by section 8.  My personal view is that if section 8 was amended to allow a landowner to know that they were clear to cut under notice served by a local authority under section 70, that would clear up any of the issues.  It would show that a landowner was not acting on their own decision-making.  They would be acting on the basis of a decision made by a roads authority engineer.  That would go some way to clarifying the liability aspect.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Foulkes"},{"type":"speech","time":1512471600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I wish to add a sentence directed to the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSFA and BirthWatch Ireland.

As a Deputy, I represent a rural constituency in south-west Cork.  A witness from the Hedge Laying Association of Ireland said that it cares passionately about the wildlife.  I am a farmer and I also care passionately about the wildlife.  I grew up on a family farm.  I worked with my aunt on a daily basis and she used to leave the doors and the windows open so that the birds could come in and feed.  We should remember that the hills were still being burned at that time and the birds used to come in.  They were alive and able to come in.  I am engaged in organic farming, therefore, I am coming at this issue from an environmental perspective.  There are two words missing from all the discussion that has taken place last week and this week.  They are the words \"common sense\", which are two very important words.<\/p> <p>  The average income for ordinary farmers has dropped and they find it very difficult to manage.  Of all the organisations represented here, I must pay tribute to the ICSFA.  Everybody will say I am doing that because I am a farmer but that is not the reason and I have proof of that.  The small farmers in particular in west Cork, Kerry and parts of the west were severely fined for having gorse on their land.  Some farmers are facing fines of anything from &euro;5,000 up to &euro;25,000.  We got some help from the IFA and ICSFA stood strong behind us.  I mean no disrespect to any of the other witnesses present but none of their organisations ever stood behind us and that was the time to stand behind us.  We had public meetings throughout the west.  I attended them on different nights.  We are bringing a case against the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to put the matter straight and to protect farmers and the wildlife.  There is nothing nicer than having some gorse on one's land, but the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has fined farmers for having it on their land and has put the gun to their heads.  I was at those meetings most nights and Mr. Seamus Sherlock, seated behind Mr. Eddie Punch, can prove that.  Whether it was in Mayo, Kerry, or west Cork, we had to raise money to take a case to protect the environment.  I never saw any of the other representatives here at a public meeting shouting or roaring or giving us some support.<\/p><p>It would have been great at the time to have received some support.

It is about burning gorse on the land.  It has forced farmers in some cases to try controlled burning, but they cannot do controlled burning if the season is not there to do it.  Calendar farming does not work.  Anyone who tells farmers they can do this or that at certain times is no farmer and simply does not understand.  Calendar farming does not work.  We would like to think that it could, but we have a wet climate.  Unfortunately, now there is illegal burning and out-of-control burning.  As I said at the meeting last week, I met representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, ICMSA and others last week.  I remember leaving the office and the last words I said were that they would be the cause of an inferno in this country and that rural Ireland would be put on fire.  That is what happened last year.  There was extraordinary loss to wildlife and so much more.  No one was listening.  We got little support at the time.  We are bringing a case which is to be heard in the courts.  We were fighting for the protection of wildlife at the time and we needed help.<\/p> <p>  There are two types of hedge cutting or verge cutting or whatever one wishes to call it.  There is roadside verge cutting and there is farm verge cutting.  The two should be separated because we are talking about the need to verge-cut on health and safety grounds.  That is ridiculous.<\/p> <p>  Verge-cutting should take place in June or July.  This Bill does not go nearly far enough.  The people of rural Ireland want their verges cut once per year.  It is done on the roadside for safety.  We should forget about saying that people can cut around a bad bend.  It is continuous.  It is a matter of roads meeting each other and people trying to sieve their way through.  It is damaging cars.  Rented cars are being taken back scratched and torn.  People are losing deposits because of these things.  Holiday makers who come here say it is crazy and that the roads are closed.  I took a call in Goleen, where I live, from a man in Limerick.  He said he could barely get to his home place in July when he came back on holidays.  He asked our community to cut the verges.  We could not do that because we were not allowed.  I had little or no answer for him because it was a continuous road.  We got a grant aid from the local authority, Cork County Council, recently.  There are many good environmentalists in my community council, but when the forms were put on the table those people grabbed them.  The verges were cut because we were nearly meeting each other on the road.<\/p> <p>  There may be an argument for such a proposal inside the farm, but no one should be talking about health and safety on the road side, because all narrow roads in rural Ireland need to have their verges cut.  The local authority cut them 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  Council workers cut them with scythes.  They kept them nice and clean.  Once a year at least every roadway got cut back.<\/p> <p>  The funny thing is that I never hear anything from the representative groups about motorways.  The verges are being cut there all the time.  I travel to and from Dublin.  The silence is deafening from the action groups.  That should be stopped.  There is no bother cutting the verges on the motorway from Cork to Dublin on a weekly basis throughout the summer.  We can see three or four tractors in different sections cutting away.  We often hear that there is one law for the rich and one for the poor.  That is certainly the way it works in this country.  They can cut them where it suits, but they will not cut them where it is needed.<\/p> <p>  The Inland Waterway Association of Ireland put a strong case.  The issue of clearing rivers is brought up often.  The issue is linked with the remarks of the representatives of the Inland Waterway Association of Ireland.  There are serious issues.  People need to clean their rivers to stop their homes from being flooded.  That is being prevented for various reasons.  I have a place in Ballylickey in west Cork, where six houses get flooded on a regular basis.  Home owners are terrified if there is a flood on the way.  The river was cleaned in 1966 but it has not been cleaned since.  Until about five years ago it was not a problem, but it has become a major problem now.  We cannot put a machine in there because there is a pearl mussel in the water.  The pearl mussel is taking precedence over the family homes where young people and elderly people are terrified.  The local authority was throwing sandbags during the last storm.  People rang me on the Sunday evening to say there would be flooding on the Monday and they were terrified in their homes.  The two words missing from all this are \"common sense\".  Ms Duggan said everyone should be sitting around the table and I think she is right.  That is something to be done down the road.  We stand very much on our own in rural Ireland.  I proved that with the case of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine issuing fines to farmers and pushing us to the limit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#N00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1512471600,"counter":360,"content":"<p>We have five people left who want to come in with questions.

It is important to focus on that because I suggested that this consultation take place before the Bill came in.  It will probably be the last round.  Obviously, if we make amendments they will have to go back to the Seanad.  This will be the last full out-of-face look at the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I am keen to deal with the burning issue first.  The burning issue is different from the hedge cutting in that the technology for burning hills has been there since the earth was created and since uplands came about.  It is interesting to note that &Oacute; Raifteiri's poem about Eanach Dh&uacute;in refers to \"Loscadh sl&eacute;ibhe agus scalladh cl&eacute;ibhe ar an &aacute;it ar &eacute;agadar\".  That is exactly burning of the hills.  It is the same term as the term we used to report what happened last summer.  This has been happening, naturally in some cases and on purpose in others, and has been a hill management technique for a long time.  What we know is that even though it has been happening, the birds survived until recent times.  In fact, the big decline happened in recent times.  Farmers doing this in a controlled fashion are in line with sustainable ecology.<\/p> <p>  I remember when destocking took place.  We warned that the hills would get woody.  That would bring all the problems all the deputations alluded to, but that have nothing to do with this Bill, that is, illegal burning, accidental or deliberate, in April, May and June - in the dry seasons.  The places became too woody and the least thing could set them off.  When they are set off, as we saw last year, it can cover acres of land.<\/p> <p>  The question we have to consider when looking at this Bill is whether controlled burning in March would cause far less damage and reduce the risk more significantly than stopping burning altogether.  Any talk of burning most of our hills in January or February is a non-starter because of the weather.  They should be allowed go up of their own accord or otherwise but not by the landowner later on when the seasons get dry.  They become dry at that stage.  That could be caused by as simple a thing as someone leaving a bottle behind on a mountain and the sun getting to it and setting it off like a tinder box.<\/p> <p>  In looking at the provision, I will be considering where the best management tool lies.  It is relevant not only for the use of land but also in terms of the ecology, the environment and the natural habitats.  I am told where I live that the biggest threat to the curlew, the crotach gl&oacute;rach that Pearse referred to in his poem, is a little mammal called the mink which is in the wild.<\/p><p>Perhaps we need a programme to deal with mink.  This is a particular problem on islands and lakes where mink swim in areas where foxes cannot.The big difference is that we know what was sustainable in the past.  If we could return to that, the issue would be dealt with.<br\/><br\/>The original proposal in the Bill was to allow hedge cutting in August on every side of a field.  Fianna F&aacute;il took that on board at that stage.  Farming organisations lobbied us to go back on part of that and we will listen to every side of the argument.  We thought that was unnecessary and was in the interests of contractors rather than wildlife.  We said cutting should be limited to roadsides.  In most cases section 70 of the Wildlife Act is not practical.  The most interesting contribution today came from Mr. Swan who said that in a former day job, discretion was used when farmers cut 100 yards in each direction having left fields in which they were cutting silage.  There is no question that that involved breaking the law because no local authority sanctioned the practice, but prosecutions did not happen.  I like his honesty because that is happening throughout the country.  People think that rural roads allow two cars to pass, but many are like a railway line with one track on which only one car at a time can travel.  The reality is that people cut back the bushes on such roads in June, July and August.  If they did not do so, the danger would be overwhelming.  Allowing such activity in August is reasonable.<br\/><br\/>I would love to see scientific evidence that nature is so stupid that it keeps reproducing in vulnerable parts of roadside hedges and birds keep building nests.  The birds in my area use man-made objects to nest under roofs and eaves.  They seem to be savvy about what to do and not to do.  I am not convinced that they are always nesting in roadside hedges.  I am not an expert.  A lot of nature seems to adapt fairly quickly.  I wish to make clear that these are the issues we will be considering.  We restricted the Bill hugely.<br\/><br\/>I have prepared an amendment to delete section 8 because it is not what I believe in.  I promised to do so on Second Stage.  I want to test whether my reading of the Bill is the correct or incorrect reading.  I understand that if section 8 was not in the Bill, the particular section would not be operable during the relevant month.  All it does is return things to the <i>status quo<\/i>.  I understand it allows section 70 cutting to take place on the order of a local authority, but does not change in any way the requirement for a local authority to permit a person to do the cutting.  Rather, it allows a local authority to give permission.  As I said, we will test that on Committee Stage.  The Minister will be here.  If I am satisfied that the Chairman is right and she is wrong, we will delete the section or amend it on Report Stage.

I want to talk about roadside hedge cutting.  Many people in rural Ireland, including me, believe that roadside hedges should be cut all year round for the safety of road users.  There is no problem with restrictions inside ditches.  The countryside is available for birds.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, birds are not so foolish as to make their nests on the roadside where the winds and lorries would blow their feathers off.<\/p> <p>  At the current time, no local authority does anything until 1 September in respect of road hedges.  It takes them two or three weeks, or the entire month of September, to send out letters to landowners and nothing happens.  By the time farmers receive letters, growth has stopped.  In other words, no hedge is cut as it grows in the summertime.  It is unfair that people who are walking and cycling and those operating school buses and transporting lorry loads of hay and products to farmers are being prevented from travelling.  The mirrors on lorries and buses are being broken at a cost of &euro;1,200 for each one.  School buses are refusing to do school runs because of what is happening.  The roads are very narrow and there is room for only one vehicle.  As Deputy Collins said, they are being scratched, torn and destroyed, which is not fair.<\/p> <p>  Will people be asked to stay in the middle of roads because of an insect or something else?  All we are asking for is fair play for the people who are using our public roads.  They are entitled to that, and I make no apologies for that to anyone here for asking that roadside hedges be cut all year around.  It is only fair play.  We will support the birds, bees and everything else.  We must remind people that ground nesting birds are being affected by grey crows, magpies, mink, badgers, pine martens and rats.  There is no discussion about doing anything about them.  Who is taking pheasant eggs?  They are being taken by other vermin.  Nothing is being done about that.  We have been told that time is scarce.  How can landowners cut hedges when they are not allowed to do so between February and September?  We are asking for another month, but people are not agreeing to that.  I ask that roadside hedges be cut all year around because that is what we are entitled to.<\/p> <p>  Why does the burning season in Northern Ireland not expire until 15 April?  We are in the same country.  Later burning provides a better chance for ground recovery.<\/p><p>We cannot burn it any earlier because of weather conditions.  If the green grass is allowed to grow up towards the end of March and early April, the fire will be ever so light.  The grass will grow and it will be there when it is needed in May and early June.  If one burns earlier, the fire goes too strong and the grass does not recover until much later, when the grass is not needed as much by the sheep and cattle because they will be down in the lowlands where there is plenty of grass at that time.  Then it must be burnt again the following year because the growth will be too strong.  When it goes too strong, the cattle or sheep will not eat it.  There is only one way of getting rid of it.  A lawnmower cannot be used because the ground is too rough and it cannot be cut with a forage harvester.  A few years back the farmers were told they had to destock because the ground was being overgrazed.  They were paid premiums to destock and, as a result, farmers in the uplands do not have as much stock now as they had.  If the powers that be and the environmentalists left the farmers alone, they would be the best custodians of the land because they now how to mind and preserve it.  They hand it from farmer to son as they have been doing for centuries.<\/p><p> Mr. Copeland said it might be all right to burn the uplands if it was for farming but not if it was only for payments.  I regret that he said that because the payments farmers get in the post are not gifts.  They are compensation for the payments they should be getting for their produce.  No farmer anywhere wants anything for nothing.  I know most of them on my side of the country and they work hard for what they get.  However, if the price being paid for their produce is reduced because of European regulations, they are entitled to those payments.  They are compensation, they are not gifts.  I want to remind everyone present who is not a farmer of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#O00400","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512471600,"counter":367,"content":"<p>We will have no time for answers to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#P00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1512471600,"counter":368,"content":"<p>What the farmers get is compensation and we make no apologies for saying that.

I want to put on the record that when we talk about the uplands and the hedgerows, we are not just talking about birds.  We are talking about a range of species.  We have the pollinators.  We have spoken with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation about the importance of the hedgerows for pollination and about the services pollinators provide to the farming community.  In addition to pollinators, hedgerows are important for bats.  That is something which has not been discussed.

Will Mr. Copeland confirm whether this Bill will decimate these species?  I am thinking of my children.

I compliment the three Deputies on their common-sense approach to tackling the issue.  Each of those men is from a rural area and is familiar with what is happening in rural Ireland on the hills and the mountains, along the by-ways and all the rest.

Just because the date is fixed, every hedge cutter in the country will not go out and work those few weeks extra.

A stand-alone canals Bill would allow time for stakeholder consultation.  It would allow time for engagement with the communities along the canals and with those who use the canals to see where the potential lies for developing the canals.  Some of those communities, especially in rural areas, have been hard hit economically.  We could not afford to build these canals now and we cannot afford to lose them through poor legislation and by-laws either.<\/p> <p>  It is appropriate that a canals Bill such as that would look at the needs of the requirements in respect of bigger cities, towns, villages and residential areas.  There is no one-size-fits-all recommendation.

We do the best we can to inflate it and bring the tyre pressure back up to a performance level.  This is what is needed with the canals.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel with a whole new set of legislation and bye-laws, especially with regard to licensing agreements.  For something that should be as simple as taxing a car, a person has to fill out a nine page document, get four signatures, two witnesses and a seal of office.  It is crazy.

I reiterate that where vegetation needs to be cut back to maintain access and health and safety on the roads, we are not opposed to that or objecting to that in any way, shape or form.  It is already allowed in the Wildlife (Amendment) Act.  We have said that by having a provision in the Heritage Bill to allow it happen in August means there is no clarity at the moment.

Yes, we could lose the curlew completely.  If we have declining species and we are not doing something for it, then it is a risk.  We do need to address the issues and take all reasonable steps to tackle the issues.  There are a huge number of issues that are now impacting on the curlew.<\/p><p>They include predation, destocking and habitat damage but there are many other issues in the area of forestry development in the uplands and the draining of agricultural land.  There is a huge number of issues affecting them, so we must use every resource at our disposal to try to protect them to make sure they continue.  Yellowhammers are not quite there yet but they are on the red list and are doing very badly.  The last species to become extinct in Ireland was the corn bunting, which is very closely related to the yellowhammer.  Extinction can and does happen.<\/p><p> There is no baseline against which to compare.  Three years of bird nesting seasons have come and gone since the start of this consultation and data have not yet been collected, despite requests.  We collected some with funding from the Heritage Council this year, but it was only a very small amount of data in a couple of counties.  We need to have a good system of data collection on which to base the policy rather than to bring in legislation and then see what happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017120500002#Q05400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alex Copland","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512471600,"counter":437,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Catherine Martin's question about how this legislation complies with the birds directive and whether the Attorney General had been informed, we understand from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, that there was some communication between the Department and the Attorney General.
