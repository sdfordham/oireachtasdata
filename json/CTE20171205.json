Today, I am accompanied by departmental officials Ms Mary Hurley, Mr. Maurice Coughlan, Ms Nina Murray, Ms Theresa Donohue and Ms Janet Jacobs.  The committee will recall that during November, we discussed a Revised Estimate for my Department that did two things.  First, it took account of the transfer of community functions from my Department to the newly established Department of Rural and Community Development; and second, it reflected the Government decision on the future funding model for Irish Water and made provision for the refund of water charge payments made by domestic customers.  With these changes, the revised budget for my Department in 2017 was set at &euro;1.995 billion.  I am today bringing forward for consideration by the committee a proposal for a Supplementary Estimate that will provide an additional &euro;92 million to fund the local authority housing capital programme and &euro;8 million for the National Regeneration Programme.  This additional &euro;100 million will see the housing budget for my Department increase to &euro;1.4 billion for 2017.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, when attending the committee on 15 November last, I set out the position regarding spending on the Vote in 2017 and indicated how the spend was being kept under close review in my Department as we move towards year-end.  I also indicated that my Department was continuing to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as required, in finalising the position on the Vote for 2017.  It is clear that very significant momentum is now building up on the local authority housing capital programme.  Local authorities are responding to the housing challenges in their areas by accelerating delivery and progress in terms of advancing social housing projects on site is strong.  In line with the targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland, local authorities are now engaged in large-scale construction activity throughout the country, with well over 700 developments advancing through various stages across the country at the end of the second quarter this year.  This increased momentum will follow through into 2018, when there will be a further quantum leap in housing funding and delivery, with the Government making over &euro;1.9 billion available for housing programmes next year.<\/p> <p>  Today we must deal with the impact of this momentum in 2017.  Additional capital funding is now required to meet commitments arising from increased activity, including the costs associated with the accelerated delivery of social housing units; the provision of family hubs and other emergency accommodation for homeless families and those who are sleeping rough; and acquisition opportunities, which are being taken up as they arise and where they represent good value for money and do not adversely impact on local housing markets.  Originally, &euro;264 million in Exchequer funding was provided for local authority construction and acquisition activity in my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2017.  Taking into account also &euro;35 million that has been re-allocated from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, LIHAF, &euro;50 million in surplus local property tax receipts and the &euro;92 million now sought in additional Exchequer funding, the total available for the main local authority construction and acquisition programme in 2017 will amount to approximately &euro;440 million.<\/p> <p>  The target for 2017 is to deliver over 21,000 new social housing supports and I am confident we will significantly exceed this target under the various housing delivery programmes.  As we move towards end of year, my Department is working closely with local authorities and approved housing bodies in all aspects of housing delivery and housing outputs for 2017.  Once these have been finalised, I will revert to the committee on activity and final 2017 outputs early in the new year.<\/p> <p>  Supplementary funding of &euro;8 million is also required to ensure continued activity under the National Regeneration Programme this year.  This will support the increased construction activity currently under way in Dublin and Limerick, along with ensuring that the programme of social and economic initiatives central to the regeneration programme also continues to be supported.  Approximately 150 new social houses at least will be delivered this year under the regeneration programme.  With the additional funding now proposed, the total Vote for my Department will amount to &euro;2.095 billion in 2017.  I am, of course, happy to discuss the details of the Supplementary Estimate with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017120500002#B00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1512484200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>With regard to subhead A3, there is a proposed increased to &euro;356 million.

First, I acknowledge that it is welcome to have the additional funding from central government in the Supplementary Estimate and that we are able to put it to productive use.  Other Supplementary Estimates for other Departments cover pay issues, whereas through this Supplementary Estimate we are putting money into building, acquisitions, regeneration and the provision of emergency accommodation and family hubs.  It is good that we are able to do so.  It represents increased activity in the sector, something for which we have been pushing in the past year or more.<\/p> <p>  The additional &euro;92 million is in subhead A3 and the allocation will deliver a number of additional units.  Our target for the year under the heading of build and acquisition was 3,600 units.  We will exceed that figure.  The money will go mainly towards acquisitions.  I cannot give the Deputy a final figure because under the heading of acquisition we are trying to deal with some bank-led vacancies.  All of it has not been achieved to date.  Early in January I hope to be able to outline in detail exactly we landed in 2017.  It will mean that when we start 2018 we will know exactly from where we are coming.  In that way, we will be coming from an informed position and Deputies will then be able to judge how realistic our targets for 2018 are and whether we will need to re-balance some of them.  At the end of the year we will be able to see that in almost every category we exceeded our targets for the year.  In some areas we will have exceeded them by a good deal.  At the beginning of next year we might then look to see whether the committee agrees in respect of the additional units to be delivered under certain programmes, whether we should be looking to re-prioritise elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin asked how many units had tenants.  Obviously, that is the responsibility of the local authorities.  In the course of replying to questions in the House on Thursday we will talk about the recent work done on the numbers on social housing lists.  I have given a commitment to Deputies and councillors that I will write to every local authority to inform it of its targets for next year and beyond.  There will be another housing summit in January.  I have already indicated that at the summit I will go through the targets and exactly how they are to be achieved.  Every time I meet representatives of a local authority we discuss the time it takes to allocate tenants.  It is an important issue.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin asked from where the money had come.  It was allocated from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Therefore, there would have been an underspend elsewhere.  It was a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to allocate, as he did across the various Departments with Supplementary Estimates this year.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin referred to the table included in the briefing material provided.  It is not yet possible for me to give him a clear number for acquisitions.  I realise we are approaching the end of the year, but some things are still happening that are relevant in terms of what we are going to do.  What I would like to do as early as possible next year is provide the committee with the details what was achieved.  I intend to set that information against each spending target in the table.  We will then have a definite idea, rather than speculating now.<\/p> <p>  I am unsure whether I have all the other questions asked written down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2017120500002#C00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1512484200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I asked about repossessions which are referred to in the third column of the table.

In replies to parliamentary questions earlier this year he told me and others that construction would account for 2,284 units in 2017, refurbishment and voids would amount to 766 &ndash; which has now increased to 1,400 &ndash; acquisitions would be 1,250.
