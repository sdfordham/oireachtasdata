I am joined by Mr. Thomas Cooney and by Mr. Thomas Ryan, our environmental secretary.  As the Chairman is aware, the agrifood sector is Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous productive sector, exporting food, drink and forest products worth over &euro;13.5 billion in 2017 and providing employment to more than 300,000 people directly and indirectly.  It has been a key driver in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and is the backbone of economic activity across rural Ireland.  Last month I spoke with the elected officers of the IFA at the association&rsquo;s annual general meeting in the Irish Farm Centre and I referred to 2018 as being a defining year for farming.  Never before have such major challenges as Brexit, the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, budget, Mercosur and climate change converged on farm families in a single year.  Today while we turn our attention to climate change, I know that members of this committee are well aware of the impact of the other challenges, the most pressing of which is Mercosur.  It is unacceptable to IFA and the thousands of livestock farmers who we represent to see the clear contradiction at EU level.  EU Commissioner for Trade, Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m, continues to push for a Mercosur deal with Brazil and other countries, while choosing to ignore the rampant deforestation and associated carbon losses in the Mercosur region, in order to export less sustainable beef to Europe.  This is all taking place while the European Union's Commissioners responsible for agriculture, the environment and climate demand that EU farmers do more to address the climate challenge.<\/p><p>Even more worrying is the talk of the EU being prepared to concede extra market access for beef to Mercosur countries in order to reach agreement, about which we learned in recent days.  We simply cannot have a deal which sells out Ireland&rsquo;s vital national asset, the Irish suckler cow sector.  No deal is better than a bad deal.  These trade talks really highlight the need for joined-up thinking at European and international levels when it comes to trade and climate policy.<\/p><p> However, European and international leaders speak with one voice when it comes to agriculture&rsquo;s response to the climate change.  For example, paragraph 2.14 of the European Union's agreed pre-Paris position states that when deciding on climate plans, regard should be had to the multiple objectives of the agriculture sector as food, fuel and energy producers, as well as the environmental enhancement and lower climate mitigation potential of the sector.  Article 2 of the international Paris Agreement reiterates the European position and reaffirms that food production must not be threatened when addressing the climate challenge.  <\/p><p> This policy position is important in an Irish context because at a time of increasing international population, changing dietary habits and demand for protein foods, such as dairy and beef continuing to grow, research completed by the European Commission&rsquo;s science and knowledge service, the joint research centre, confirms that Ireland has an emission efficient model of food production.  Ireland&rsquo;s dairy farmers have the lowest carbon footprint in the EU for milk production and our beef farmers are in the top five.  This is not surprising given our natural grass-based model of food production and our temperate climate, with 90% of our agricultural lands being carbon sequestering grasslands.  Therefore, the ask on Ireland&rsquo;s agrifood sector must be considered in the context of our sustainable model of food production and the need to ensure that sustainable food production is not compromised, as set out at EU and international level.  These sustainability facts, as set out in the joint research council&rsquo;s research, are welcomed, however, they provide no room for complacency.  We need to build on our delivery to date.  Since the established base year of 1990, agriculture's greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by 3.5%, while our national emissions have increased by 10.4%, driven mainly by the transport sector, where emissions have increased by 139%.<\/p><p> Key policy measures are assisting this.  For example, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is targeting European funding through the Common Agriculture Policy to areas that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the sector.  Almost 90% of the measures in Ireland&rsquo;s rural development programme have climate reducing elements.  These measures include the green low carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which promotes the retention of soil carbon stocks through the encouragement of climate friendly agricultural practices such as minimum tillage, green-cover establishment and low-emission manure spreading techniques.  The GLAS programme is oversubscribed, with a high level of farmer interest in participating.  I strongly encourage the Government to reopen the scheme and allow for maximum participation.  Other programmes include the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, and the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, which assist farmers to reduce emissions and increase productive efficiency.<\/p><p> In addition, Ireland is the only country in the world that monitors, measures and manages carbon from farm to fork.  Some 90% of beef exports are now in an audit and carbon foot print programme; 100% of our milk production is entering into a carbon auditing cycle; and over 137,000 carbon assessments have been completed on farms to date as part of Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green sustainability programme.  In IFA, we are leading a voluntary initiative called Smart Farming with the Environmental Protection Agency, which aims to address the dual challenges of improving farm incomes while reducing the environmental impact.  In 2017, the average cost savings identified by participating farmers was &euro;8,700 with average emissions reductions of 10%.<\/p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s future climate policy refers to an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, which does not compromise the capacity for sustainable food production.  This approach requires careful consideration.  It was first proposed by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, in 2012, without any regulatory impact assessment.  NESC itself readily acknowledged at the time that a technical or scientific silver-bullet does not exist to decarbonise the sector.  Teagasc&rsquo;s subsequent report, which looked at carbon neutrality as a horizon point for Irish agriculture, clearly stated that carbon-neutrality, even as a horizon point, is an ambitious target that cannot be achieved over any short time period.  However, the same report acknowledges the role of carbon sequestration and fossil fuel displacement to reduce the impact of agriculture and land use on greenhouse gas emissions.  This is where farmers can do more.  <\/p><p> Under the Renewable Energy Directive, Ireland has a mandatory target to produce at least 16% of all  energy consumed by 2020 from renewable sources.  This is being met by 40% from renewable electricity, 12% from renewable heat and 10% from the renewable transport sector.  Agencies, such as the Institute of International and European Affairs, estimate that Ireland is likely to be hit with a compliance bill of up to &euro;610 million by 2020 for breaching its current targets.<\/p><p> IFA believes that this money should instead be diverted into a climate activation programme, focused on policy measures, including the reopening of the GLAS scheme which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 65,000 tonnes each year and the announcement of a farm-based and community electricity tariff for renewable projects, with a specific export tariff for roof mounted projects.  This should be used over time to displace electricity production from gas, which accounts for 35% of greenhouse gasses emitted when generating electricity.  The funding for this could come from a ring-fencing of 20% of the current electricity tax, called the public service obligation levy, which is paid by homeowners across the country and currently goes to large scale multinational energy corporations.  I mention the scaling up of on-farm emission reduction programmes identified in the national mitigation plan, such as smart farming, Origin Green and the carbon navigator, and the development of a national network of producer organisations to support the mobilisation of the private forest resource.<\/p><p> It is national policy to increase forest cover from the current 11% to 18% by 2050.  In 2017, the planting programme was the lowest in over 60 years with fewer than 5,500 ha of new forest established, 25% below the 7,400 ha target in the forestry programme.  Last year we launched a plan to revitalise the farm forestry sector, which sought the reintroduction of the farmer premium differential to optimise the benefit to the rural economy.  We also proposed that farmers would be properly compensated for loss of premium and future timber earnings on lands they are obligated to set aside for environmental enhancement and that restrictions on planting productive marginal would be removed.<\/p><p> In 2016 the Council on Forest Research and Development, COFORD, identified nearly 180,000 ha of productive marginal land that has the productive capacity to grow commercial timber, which is outside of environmental designation and that is excluded from the scheme.  Over the period 2021 to 2030, afforestation since 1990 will remove an estimated net 4.5 million tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere per annum.  Forest sinks must be included as part of the measurement of emission reductions in the agriculture sector.  Currently, carbon credits from carbon sinks are not attributed to agriculture.  Ireland has the highest level of carbon sequestering permanent pastures in Europe, which when combined with the opportunity to expand the forestry cover can promote a substantial national carbon sink.  CO2 emission reductions achieved through natural carbon sinks, such as forests and permanent pastures, must be included in the overall measurement of the contribution of the agriculture sector to emission reductions.<\/p><p> The bioeconomy offers huge opportunities to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels while still achieving economic growth, however a sustainable and profitable farming sector is required to underpin the investment and innovation required to successfully deliver a strategy for the bioeconomy.<\/p><p>However, a sustainable and profitable farming sector is required to underpin the necessary investment and innovation to successfully deliver a strategy for the bio-economy.<\/p><p> Farmers will not invest in energy crops until they have confidence that a viable market exists for their product.  We welcomed the recent announcement that a renewable heat support scheme would be introduced this year.  It is vital that the scheme is properly funded and embedded in the local economy, to optimise the economic benefits by creating a new revenue stream for farmers and valuable new job and business opportunities in rural areas, where job opportunities are limited.<\/p><p> On renewable electricity, Ireland needs a better mix of energy sources.  Ireland can no longer rely on big wind exclusively.  This flawed policy has divided communities, created a concerning impact on the landscape and led to a transfer of millions of euro from Ireland&rsquo;s citizens to large multinationals each year through the public service obligation, PSO, levy.  There are alternatives.  The cost of other technologies continues to decrease.  Solar energy is now the cheapest form of renewable energy after onshore wind power.  Ireland&rsquo;s late-mover status in solar provides an opportunity to learn from others and develop a role in this industry for farmers, landowners and communities.<\/p><p> Ongoing delays and lack of certainty regarding grid access and prices are having a negative effect on farmers&rsquo; involvement.  The IFA has sought to progress policy in this area, making submissions to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the design of a new renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, and to the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, on grid access policy.<\/p><p> If Ireland is to develop a citizen-centred renewable policy, as envisaged in the energy White Paper, the Government must act on its own recommendations.  These include community feasibility grants, provision of loans, ring fencing grid access and the use of trusted intermediaries for community projects.  The proposal for a tariff premium for wind energy production up to 6 MW must also be extended to other technologies, including solar energy.<\/p><p> The IFA is concerned by proposals to rely exclusively on an auction-based pricing model.  For community, roof-top and farmer-led projects, the IFA supports a feed-in tariff model.  This gives certainty and security of revenue, which is important for farmer-led projects as they are stand-alone and individually financed.<\/p><p> Grid access is one of the most important consents in any renewable project, and is vital for farm scale or community projects to proceed.  Regarding the proposed policy measures put forward by the CRU in their recent consultation, the IFA supports the discontinuation of grid relocation, an increase in the capacity process and the requirement for planning permissions to be in place before grid access is granted.<\/p><p> The day of speculative trading of the grid, which developers have secured from farmers for less than &euro;1,000, must be brought to an end.  It must be replaced with a grid access policy which leaves no room for the speculator, but instead supports farmers and communities across the country to develop their own energy solutions.<\/p><p> Community renewable projects have been a goal of the Government since the White Paper was published.  Since then we have seen large developers, foreign equity funds, pension funds and venture capital firms sign up large areas of Irish farmland.  What we have not seen is clear Government policy to deliver on the ambition of the energy White Paper.<\/p><p> We call for greater clarity on crowdfunding legislation and platforms, to allow communities to finance community projects; the introduction of the necessary financial, taxation and pension instruments that would allow farmers and communities the opportunity to invest and benefit from the wealth created; clarity on grid access policy, grid which is affordable and defined and allows farmer-led and community projects to move forward with their projects; and the introduction of green bonds, low cost loans and feed-in tariffs, which would give farm families and households a fair and even chance to compete in the renewable energy production.<\/p><p> More than 25,000 acres of farm land are currently locked down in some form of a solar contract.  This should not just be a conduit for profitability for foreign equity pension or vulture funds.  It should be a means for creating opportunity and wealth for farm families right across the country.  It really is time to make good on the promises of citizen and farmer involvement in the next phase of renewable energy roll-out.<\/p><p> EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan spoke in December at a conference in Dublin organised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The Commissioner said, &ldquo;Ireland needs to wake up, and fast, to the reality that we are part of a European Union that has assumed the role of global leader in the climate challenge.&rdquo;  Within the agrifood sector, the IFA believes that the measures in this presentation around biomass, the bio-economy, farm-scale, roof-top and community-based renewable projects provide real and tangible ways to deliver on both our renewable and climate targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018021300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518541200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his kind opening remarks.  I would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  I am joined by our general secretary, Mr. John Enright.  We will address the committee on climate change issues related to agriculture.  During my term as president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, this will be one of the biggest challenges for our industry and our members.  Obviously the Mercosur deal and Brexit provide their own challenges, and income volatility is an ongoing challenge.<\/p> <p>  Not that many years ago, faced with the abolition of quotas, we set out an ambition in Food Harvest 2020 to increase production by 50%.  We have virtually delivered that by 2017.  We then progressed to the Foodwise 2025 targets.  They include: an ambition to increase the value of agrifood exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; to increase the value-added by 70% to &euro;13 billion; to increase the value of primary production by 65%; and to create 23,000 jobs in the indigenous agrifood industry, spread across every community and parish in the country.  This ambition is realistic when a 50% increase in the global population is anticipated between 2013 and 2050.  No more land is becoming available for agricultural production.  With the demand represented by roads, housing and forestry, land is a dwindling resource.<\/p> <p>  The issue is climate change.  That is the challenge we are here to discuss.  As I am the second horse out of the gallops, Mr. Healy has already covered a lot of the ground.  The reality is that we have the best dairy production in Europe from a climate perspective.  As Mr. Healy said, our beef industry is the fifth best within Europe.  As such, we are in a good place to sell Irish agriculture in the context of global climate concerns.<\/p> <p>  The challenge arises from the fact that we export 90% of our output.  A lot of our footprint is generated in feeding other populations around the globe.  The way those emissions calculations are calculated and distributed needs to be assessed.  I refer in particular to the distribution of that carbon footprint.  Why put a squeeze on the diary industry in the most efficient place in Europe for dairy production, only to move production to somewhere that is less efficient than the Irish dairy farmer?  Globally, we all live under the one bubble from an environmental point of view.  That has to be borne in mind.  Regardless of facts and figures, any suggestion that we produce in a less efficient manner raises serious questions.<\/p> <p>  Farmers have invested a lot in climate conditions.  There have been almost 12,000 applications to the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, for low-emission slurry spreading.  That is one of the areas where there can be a climate benefit for commercial farming.  Farmers have become very aware of minimising nitrogen surpluses and nitrogen losses.  I refer to greater utilisation of clover.  Mr. Healy mentioned mini-tilled cultivation and better manure and slurry storage facilities.  During the last six months, when returns from dairy produce increased, right across the rural construction industry there was a drive by agriculture to put facilities in place to improve farm working conditions and protect the environment.<\/p><p>Farmers have invested significant sums of money in the economic breeding index, EBI, from a dairy perspective, to increase efficiency and capability around the production of the quantities of milk solids that are needed and others in more challenging terrain have planted forestry to the betterment of the environment.  From a renewable energy perspective, we believe there should be greater emphasis on farm families.  The network is in place but grid connection needs to be practical and affordable.  In terms of renewable energy generation, the installation of solar panels on the roofs of sheds would be to the benefit of the environment and also to the farm families that are trying to remain in farming and make a viable income in rural Ireland.  There would be no additional visual impact, environmentally, because the infrastructure already exists.  <\/p><p> Another challenge in terms of the climatic footprint is distribution and this will need to be assessed to a greater extent.  We are equipped to produce food for the global market but the environmental challenges around distribution need to be addressed.  I referred earlier to the need for greater use of farm sheds in respect of renewable energy generation.  The bio-economy needs to be driven through farm-scale incentivisation and also incentivisation from a tax perspective.  <\/p><p> In regard to the environmental schemes, I agree with Mr. Healy that the GLAS scheme needs to be opened up to the commercial farmer.  Only 10% of our soil is at the optimum pH level.  Time and again we have made submissions seeking that the use of lime be covered under the GLAS schemes.  In the past, GLAS has been very restrictive on the commercial farmer.  If it was a requirement of GLAS that a farmer increase the pH level of the soil so there would be greater and more efficient utilisation of the chemical fertiliser that would be spread and this, in turn, would benefit our water courses in a very short timeframe.  It would also provide a bang for the buck for the farmer.  <\/p><p> There is no denying that there are challenges presenting in terms of climate change but there will also be benefits for rural economies and rural farm families.  As president of the ICMSA I have a responsibility, as have all elected people, to ensure that commercial farming is in a position to continue when climate change is put to bed.  We need to sell ourselves well.  The key issue going forward will be the footprint in terms of distribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018021300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McCormack","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518541200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCormack for his opening remarks and I now invite Mr. Martin Keane to make the opening statement on behalf of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018021300002#H00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518541200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to share with it the views of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, on the issue of climate change with particular reference to agriculture.  In the first instance, it is important to recognise that there are three pillars of sustainability: economic, social and environmental.  All three are interwoven and without equal emphasis on each pillar we will not have sustainable employment, sustainable communities or sustainable natural resources.  The foundation of the agriculture industry is the family farm model, and together with co-operative ownership, it fundamentally underlines our sustainability credentials.  The dairy sector and the broader agrifood sector are facing unprecedented challenges.  These include: extreme market volatility; CAP reform and how it will be funded, because the continuation of a well-funded CAP is essential; the availability of skilled labour; and the consequences of Brexit.  In addition, environmental sustainability is a key strategic challenge for the industry.  At dairy processing level, we have made significant investments in green technologies, state of the art processing equipment and lean manufacturing to drive energy efficiencies.  The dairy sector was an early adaptor of combined heat and power and it is committed to continuous improvements in energy usage, water usage and waste management.<\/p> <p>  On 24 January, ICOS published a report on climate change following work undertaken by a working group, including personnel from the environment and farm services teams in dairy processing co-operatives.  The ICOS report entitled Positive Steps Towards a Low Carbon Future for the Irish Dairy Sector forms the basis of our submission to this committee and looks at actions and recommendations for dairy farmers and the wider industry supporting farmers.  I apologise if there is any overlap with previous speakers but as we are 99.99% the same gene pool there is bound to be some. <\/p> <p>  Our core recommendation is that the effective and widespread sharing of solutions that generate efficiencies at farm level and benefits to the environment is the biggest challenge to be addressed.  There are a range of technical and cost-effective mitigation options that ICOS believes should be incorporated into a structured knowledge sharing programme on climate change mitigation.  These include: measures around grassland management; the inclusion of clover in swards; manure management; nutrient management planning; improved EBI; sexed semen; reducing the age at first calving; nutrition; animal health and energy efficiency on farms.  <\/p> <p>  The report also points out that the farming community can positively address the issue of climate change with appropriate support.  For example, individual farmers and groups of farmers working through co-operatives can further mitigate against climate change through the uptake of agro-forestry using native trees and renewable energy technologies such as biogas from anaerobic digestion and solar panels on farm buildings.  Ultimately, agriculture systems throughout the world will have to provide extra food to feed a growing population, which is expected to exceed 11 billion by the end of this century.  We must produce more food, while conserving available land, water and energy resources.  For this reason, the recommendation of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly in November 2017 to impose a carbon tax on Irish agriculture is deeply flawed.  This proposal, if implemented, would damage the competitiveness of Irish agrifood exports and benefit the environment little.  In reality, it would be counterproductive and there would be a possibility of carbon leakage.  Furthermore, the continuation of a well-resourced and strong CAP budget post 2020, which supports active farmers is absolutely essential.  Expenditure cuts to the CAP budget will have a detrimental impact on the ability of the agricultural sector to adopt climate change mitigation measures.  <\/p> <p>  It is important to acknowledge that the European Commission&rsquo;s joint research centre has independently assessed Irish dairy as the most carbon efficient in Europe, with our beef sector also performing way above the EU average.  Furthermore, the sustainable dairy assurance scheme, SDAS, has enabled Ireland to position itself as a partner of choice globally for sustainably produced and quality assured milk and dairy products.  Our co-ops have invested significant resources in making SDAS a real success.  Farmers, too, have recognised that as an industry we are only as strong as our weakest link and understand the strong emphasis international customers are placing on sustainability and quality assurance.  The inclusion of the carbon navigator tool makes SDAS unique.  It provides the average carbon figure for production on the farm and also indicates where the greatest potential saving can be made in both carbon emissions but also very importantly in financial savings.  In doing so, it has mainstreamed the message that carbon efficiency goes hand in hand with economic efficiency.<\/p><p> Dairy co-ops have also developed several joint programmes with Teagasc to provide technical support and advice for farmers in order to enable them to develop their farm businesses sustainably and profitably.  The recent establishment of Dairy Sustainability Ireland and the sustainability support and advisory programme to address water quality challenges is a further demonstration of our commitment to achieving environmental sustainability.<\/p><p> The dairy sector exports to a multiple of Ireland's national population a highly nutritious food source recognised as the most carbon efficient in Europe.  This is because Ireland's temperate climate is perfect for growing grass, with a long grazing season.  This enables superior animal welfare conditions on Irish farms.  Globally, 80% of milk is produced in confinement-based production systems in contrast to Ireland where cows are on grass for up to 300 days a year.<\/p><p> Ours is an industry that strives for excellence across a range of parameters, be it milk quality, grassland management, breeding or sustainability.  We can play our part in addressing climate change by continuing to improve on what we do well.  We recognise that the dairy industry has a responsibility to develop in the post-quota era in a manner that protects the environment.  As an industry, we fully adhere to the principles of sustainable intensification.<\/p><p> With those few introductory remarks, I look forward to the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018021300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518541200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keane.

Macra na Feirme believes many of the targets within the plans can be met by focusing resources and supports in order to achieve greater efficiency at farm level, resulting in a win-win for both farmers and the environment.<\/p> <p>  The multifunctional role and multiplier effect of farming mean that, with food production and as the Environmental Protection Agency stated in 2016, farmers and farming can provide valuable ecosystem services for society such as safe and clean water, the regulation of nutrient cycles, the control of disease, crop pollination and enhancement of biodiversity, as well as cultural, spiritual and recreational benefits.<\/p> <p>  Farmers are the custodians of the countryside - in essence, the real environmentalists.  While the historic Paris Agreement recognises the effort to limit global temperature increases to less than 2o and pursue a target of 1.5o, it must be achieved in a manner that will not threaten food production and, thus, the sustainability of farmers.  Vitally, when discussing the contribution agriculture makes to total Irish greenhouse gas emissions, it should be remembered that Ireland has a very small cohort of industrial contributors of emissions compared with the rest of Europe, therefore disproportionately exaggerating agriculture's output.<\/p> <p>  Numerous issues have been identified by Macra na Feirme.  Unfortunately, farmers have often viewed the greenhouse gas reduction policies in various EU and national strategies as a threat.  In their view, emission reduction targets were set without taking into account the technical capacity of the sector to reduce emissions.  It, therefore, appeared that emission reductions could only be achieved by reducing their farming activity, which would impact negatively on their livelihoods.  This type of messaging is incorrect and needs to be stopped.  The farm advisory service, the knowledge transfer scheme, the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, and so on have all helped to encourage farmers in a positive way and benefited emission reduction levels.  Education, training and innovative industry projects have also played a significant role.  Under Skillsnet, for example, Macra na Feirme runs a successful young beef farmer sustainability programme that focuses on many of the farm practices that contribute positively to addressing climate change.<\/p> <p>  Solutions have been identified for the climate change issues affecting the sector.  Irish agriculture is exploring and developing proactive approaches to decreasing climate change impacts.  They include feeding strategies that maximise the efficiency of grass-based systems such as the extension of grazing and the inclusion of clover; ICT in agriculture to aid the development of sustainable intensification; improvements to animal health and welfare; and sustainable land management that contributes to climate change mitigation and the sustainable management of soil and forest carbon sinks.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Common Agricultural Policy, Macra na Feirme favours a move towards a combination of results-based and management-based payments as part of an environmental and climate measure.  Results-based payments have many benefits, including directly linking payments with outcomes, reaching more specific goals and creating a common goal between farmers and environmentalists or conservationists.  It would be beneficial if future CAP measures were to focus more on outcomes than being input driven and thus rewarded productive and lower greenhouse gas-intensive farms.<\/p> <p>  The BDGP is an example of a measure that is directly targeted at the climate emissions of beef farms.  Its objective is to lower the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions by improving the quality and efficiency of the national beef herd by aiming to achieve a 4.5% greater carbon efficiency level per animal by 2020.  The BDGP not only improves the environmental sustainability of beef production, it also brings economic benefits directly to the farmer.<\/p> <p>  Another example is the carbon navigator tool which helps to reduce carbon emissions per unit of output.  To date, three Bord Bia quality assurance schemes have incorporated sustainability criteria, each of which has received accreditation from the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, and aids with the quality and accuracy of the information inputted, which gives a better picture of greenhouse gas emissions at farm level.<\/p> <p>  Knowledge transfer has a significant role to play in peer to peer learning among farmers as regards how to achieve win-win solutions in terms of farm efficiency and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  Within the dairy knowledge transfer programme, a focus on animal health and management, profitability and financial management, grassland management plans, CellCheck farmer workshops, the carbon navigator and a breeding plan are beneficial in achieving greenhouse gas reductions on farms.  When farmers achieve improvements under these elements, it means that their production becomes more carbon efficient.  The carbon navigator is a key tool in informing farmers of their performance and indicating changes that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lead to improved outcomes.<\/p> <p>  Another example is the low-emissions slurry spreading scheme under TAMS, which is an important measure in seeking to reduce ammonia emissions directly.  The tillage capital investment scheme will also contribute to reducing emissions, as it supports innovative technologies such as GPS to improve the accuracy of fertiliser spreaders and steering controls.<\/p> <p>  Schemes should aim to improve grass growth and utilisation potential nationally, given that only 10% of farms have optimum pH, phosphorus and potash levels in soils and only 50% of farms are reaching their grass growth potential.  Macra na Feirme proposes a grazing infrastructure scheme under TAMS to aid farmers in utilising more grass.  All of these schemes would only further benefit from Ireland becoming a climate change mitigation leader.<\/p> <p>  Supporting and resourcing the provision of anaerobic digestion in a strategic manner need further consideration.  Using agricultural products such as slurry and silage, both grass and maize, can produce biogas in a renewable capacity, with the added benefit of producing good quality fertiliser from the digestate in a lower carbon producing manner.  The products going into the anaerobic digestion chambers should originate from animal waste, with supplementation by energy crops, when required.<\/p> <p>  External to the farm gate, Macra na Feirme encourages further research into the manufacturing process of fertilisers associated with nitrous oxide emissions in an effort to yield more innovative products such as protected urea which has been shown to decrease nitrous oxide emissions compared with more mainstream fertilisers that improve nutrient efficiency.<\/p><p> Young farmers are the new environmentalists who are ready to take on the challenge of climate change through innovations and farm initiatives that benefit both farmers and the climate change agenda.  Research has shown that both methane and nitrous oxide emissions can be reduced through a range of targeted innovations such as soil and grassland management, animal genetics, breeding and technology.  Continued support of these practical initiatives through policy and financial instruments such as the CAP and the national budget is paramount for our large industry to prosper and add value to farmers and the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018021300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thomas Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518541200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duffy and the other delegates for their very informative presentations.

I apologise in advance as I will have to leave a little early.  This discussion is timely.  A number of the delegates were also before the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment recently to discuss the same topic.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that climate change and our carbon footprint will be key considerations of agriculture policy in the future and that we have to be particularly proactive about them.  At the same time, we must allow the agriculture sector to grow and meet the targets set.  The delegates have touched on the key policy objectives and initiatives that they believe will be necessary to aid the achievement of our objectives and ensure agriculture will be able to contribute more in energy generation, in particular.<\/p> <p>  The international objectives can be quite blunt in the way they are imposed, as a number of delegates indicated.  Ireland's is very much a carbon-friendly agriculture sector.  Internationally, it is results-based in terms of how carbon-friendly are different types of production.  We do not want to have a scenario where Irish agriculture has to cut down production, while other countries do not and could potentially increase it.  We are unique because the agriculture sector here plays such a big part in the economy and also creates such a high proportion of our emissions, at around 30%.  Only in New Zealand does agriculture contribute a higher proportion of overall emissions.  From the delegates' engagement with their international counterparts, do they believe we can make more progress in gaining better recognition of the position of Irish agriculture in global production?  Might we, therefore, be allowed to continue to maintain that potential?  Might we receive credit for being able to increase our production, given the fact that the sector here is particularly carbon-friendly and, therefore, able to contribute to the overall reduction of the carbon footprint?<\/p> <p>  On the role of forestry, it was outlined how we were not meeting our targets and that we were a long way from doing so.  We would have to move from 11% forest cover to 18% in 2050.  In particular, I highlight the resistance in some counties where forestry is happening on a larger scale.  There is a difficulty in that it is too heavy in some areas and perhaps not being taken up as much in others.  Are there particular initiatives the delegates believe could be taken to try to speak to this and ensure farmers will embrace forestry alongside their other farming enterprises?<\/p> <p>  On the potential to improve our grassland model of production and try to ensure it will be efficient, a couple of speakers mentioned that just 10% of our soil is at the optimum pH level.  What initiatives could be taken promptly to address that issue and, in so doing, make agricultural production a lot more carbon efficient?  What do the delegates believe we could do to ensure farmers will make quick progress?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018021300002#K00300","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1518541200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>We have heard four very strong presentations.

He made a really strong point about Mercosur.  We are being asked - arguably rightly so - by a European Commissioner to address our responsibilities to reduce greenhouse gases and carbon emissions.  At the same time, however, another European Commissioner is negotiating with countries and a region that clearly are not meeting these standards.  We are asking farmers on this island and elsewhere in Europe to step up and meet standards that the other countries are not being asked to meet.

We are very formal here; we have to say Mr. This and Mr. That, but I would prefer to say Joe.  It is about the excellent point he made about the White Paper on energy.  He outlined a number of issues in respect of the crowd-funding legislation.  I really appreciated his focus on local communities and farmers availing of access to funding for renewables.  One of the issues for me when I look at wind farms throughout the country is that there are a lot of industry insiders and people who made a fortune from the new buzz that was renewable energy and wind farms.  Communities could have benefited from them.  If local communities could have seen a financial return from the investment in wind farms, we would not see anything near the level of opposition we see.  That was a really strong point and I would like to hear more about the IFA's engagement with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, in that regard.<\/p> <p>  My final question is for Pat from the ICMSA.  It was an excellent presentation in which a really strong point was made about how we exported 90% of our beef.  Whenever we look at the level of greenhouse gases or carbon emissions, surely we should spread that information to consumer countries.  It was a logical point.  Has the ICMSA had any engagement with Ministers in Ireland or anyone at European level to discuss this proposition and, if so, what responses were given?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018021300002#K00900","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1518541200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives of the farming organisations. This is one of the most critical issues facing us.  We talk about the CAP and Mercosur.  It was really brought home to me when I was part of a delegation from the joint committee to Brussels in early December to discuss the new Common Agricultureal Policy and Mercosur when there was also talk about Brexit.<\/p><p>The delegation met the Agriculture Commissioner, Members of the European Parliament and some representatives of the farming organisations.  I was struck by the fact that farming organisations had made only 7% of the submissions in the consultation process on one element of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The majority of submissions had been made by what I would describe as the green lobby.<\/p><p> No one can dispute the points made by the delegates.  Everything a farmer does to qualify for a payment is interwoven with environmental considerations, requirements, rules and laws.  The message from the green lobby on the CAP is the same as the one we heard from the Citizens' Assembly, namely, that there is a problem with farming.  The joint committee has debated this issue with officials from the Department who deal with climate change and representatives of Bord Bia.  When I asked them whether they had been invited to make a submission to the Citizens' Assembly, I was told that they had not.  The Citizens' Assembly was not given a fair picture.  A number of the farming organisations issued statements in response to the proposal that a carbon tax be imposed on farming.  It should be borne in mind that there are generations of people who are divorced from the countryside.  That farmers must have their finger on the pulse is lost on them.  Farmers have to understand the environment and their animals.  They must also use technology and work in the most efficient way possible to try to make some money.  Farmers in my local area tell me that their only income is the farm payment because they do not make anything from farming. <\/p><p> One of Ireland's selling points is its grassland which allows grazing for 300 days each year.  That is not the case County Mayo, especially in the past year.  As the delegates will be aware, the north and the north west are experiencing problems with fodder supplies.<\/p><p> Mr. McCormack referred to a shift in the way we accounted.  This is a critical issue because we are told that the new Common Agriculture Policy will impose more environmental requirements on farmers and that this will generate costs.  Urban dwellers need to understand farmers.  Perhaps the organisations might need to improve their communications.  We heard a former President state people should not eat meat.  These messages grow legs.  While I understand we all have the same ambition in respect of the Paris Agreement, a farmer who is doing his or her best may disengage if he or she hears a constant barrage of bad press about farmers and sees the finger of blame being pointed at farming.  Farmers do a great deal of good work, as the delegates described, and this aspect of the debate should be pushed forward in the general media, as opposed to media that are focused on farming issues.<\/p><p> As has been pointed out, transport is a bigger offender than farming producing in carbon emissions.  None of the members of the Citizens' Assembly volunteered to switch to an electric car, which people can do easily.  Bearing in mind that these lobbies create their own momentum, I am concerned that farmers will not get a fair deal under the new CAP.  <\/p><p> What is the expected uptake among farmers of the renewable heat support scheme?  How have members of the farming organisations responded to the new scheme?<\/p><p> On forestry, one of the members of this committee repeatedly cites complaints from local people in County Leitrim about the masses of forestry being planted where people once lived.  Obviously, these forests could not have been planted if people had not left the area.  Rural depopulation is a problem.  How can we add value to forestry and develop the biomass industry in the regions?  In my local area, for example, Coillte exports the vast majority of its timber, which was loaded onto trains to Waterford.  As a result, the local area does not derive any added value from local forestry.  Spin-off jobs and investment could be created in the local economy.  We must find a way to pull people together, create economies of scale and secure fair prices for farmers who become involved in forestry or growing biomass crops.  What can the co-operative movement do in that regard?<\/p><p> Previous speakers referred to the White Paper on energy and micro-generation, which is a very good idea.  Mr. Healy referred to getting involved in what he described as \"big wind\".  There is nothing wrong with wind energy companies.  The challenge is to produce community benefits from the money and technological know-how of the big companies.  It does not matter what tariffs are available if local communities do not have the wherewithal and the money to become involved in renewable energy projects.  These projects require people to take a gamble and are not necessarily a cash cow, although those who speculate on renewable energy projects tend to make money.  Communities must be brought along and big wind and solar energy projects must be more integrated into communities.<\/p><p> Many of those who try to get involved in micro-generation experience great difficulty in obtaining import-export meters from the ESB.  Have the organisations raised this matter with it?  Apart from incentives and support for those who decide to install a small wind turbine or engage in other forms of micro-generation, this appears to be an issue that has not been addressed.  Must micro-generated electricity be supplied to the grid?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018021300002#K01000","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518541200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the four organisations for their excellent presentations.  My former colleague, Mr. McCormack, spoke about putting climate change to bed.  I do not believe we will ever put it to bed.  While we can meet the challenges it presents, we will face climate change challenges for as long as we are around.<\/p> <p>  My conclusion, having listened to the four presentations, is that we can find solutions to the climate change challenges facing the country.  Mercosur and Brexit are out of our control, but we can do many things that will put us in an advantageous position in dealing with climate change.<\/p> <p>  Great emphasis was placed on the efficiency of Ireland's dairy sector.  We are the best in the business in producing milk in a sustainable manner.  None of the delegates addressed the sustainability of steer beef production from the perspective of climate change.  Ireland has a steer producing beef sector.  How sustainable is our method of producing beef?<\/p> <p>  Most of the delegates referred to forestry.<\/p><p>There are a number of things that can be done.  To plant 20 ha of unenclosed land one has to have 80 ha of enclosed land to match it.  There is a lack of logic in this as there is a lot of land lying idle that could be a carbon sink for us.  There is a blanket ban on forestry in designated areas, such as hen harrier areas, which also shows a lack of logic as there are opportunities to improve sustainability in this regard.<br\/><br\/>What role can Bord na M&oacute;na play in the future of biomass?  It has vast tracts of land lying idle and not making any contribution to our carbon footprint challenge.  What can be done in this respect?  We see digesters on European farms and there is much more advanced technology in European farmyards that we have.  The headline in the farming section of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>deals with slurry spreading but we have ways to overcome it.  We have to look at what Europe and even Northern Ireland are doing but we can do a lot ourselves to put ourselves on a higher plane than the rest of Europe.<br\/><br\/>We have renegotiated our derogation and it is imperative for our dairy industry that we hold onto it.  It is the one challenge the dairy industry will have, going forward, and it could become the new quota for us.  The quality assurance scheme is going to be tied in to food sustainability and it is a good progression as it will strengthen our case for any future derogations.<br\/><br\/>I would like to explore the issues of grid availability and a price tariff.  We can talk about alternative energy production, such as solar energy and wind farms, but the backlog for access to the grid is a huge challenge.  If we are serious about alternative energy use, we have to have certainty on the price of energy in order that we know it will be economical to get it from alternative sources.  The vast majority of waste and the vast majority of energy crops can be used in the production of alternative energy, whether it be for gas, electricity or heating, the last of which is probably the most economical.  We are behind the rest of Europe in this area and all four presentations hinted at that.  There has to be a far greater focus on this.<br\/><br\/>We also have to focus on the farmers who have spent huge amounts of money on slurry storage and this comes back to municipal districts and county councils.  We have a lot of population centres which still have no wastewater treatment plants and there is no point in one side doing everything it can to improve our position when municipal authorities fall down on water quality as this hampers our arguments for derogations.<br\/><br\/>A lot of things have to be put in place but the presentations show that we have the ammunition to show that we can be more sustainable food producers than most of the rest of Europe.  What are witnesses' views on steer beef production and how sustainable that can be?  None of the presentations addressed this.  How are we going to get around our problems with unenclosed land?  What about ash dieback?  Land is lying idle which could be planted to meet our targets.  A lot of other countries have more to fear from climate change than we have.  We have made a lot of progress and, with a few commonsense decisions, we could turn climate change to our advantage.  Mr. Healy spoke about Mercosur but if the Commission was serious about climate change it would look at the issue of importing beef from South America.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018021300002#L00200","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518541200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>A lot of investment was put into the storage of slurry and now, perhaps because of climate change, the land is too wet to spread it and it is overflowing.  This has been an issue for a long time and will be an issue into the future.  If we continue getting the wet summers we have seen, with rain at the beginning of August and not stopping until after Christmas, we will not be able to keep storing slurry so there has to be some other method.  We see biogas anaerobic digestion plants in many countries.  Could they be part of a solution, with the agreement of the communities living near to where they are proposed?<\/p> <p>  There is a peat-burning station in Lanesborough and the ambition is to turn it into a biomass station and to import biomass from America for this purpose.  That seems to be a flawed way of looking to the future.  Surely we should be trying to do it some other way.  Farmers are not going to start to grow biomass unless they know there is a market that pays them well for it.  What are the witnesses' views on that?<\/p> <p>  On the question of afforestation, we have a lot of forestry in our part of the world, mainly Sitka spruce trees growing very fast on poorish land.  This does things as regards carbon that are fine but it has a detrimental effect on communities and society.  In most parts of Leitrim we have vast monocultural afforestation with one mass-produced type of tree which requires minimal related labour activity.  It has a devastating effect on everything that happens in the community.  Are there any alternatives?  We have to be realistic as we will not be able to stop people doing what they want to do with their own land.  If there are grants which promote this type of afforestation, that is the way people are going to go.  Are there any other solutions, rather than promote a crop which is just left there for 40 years before anybody has to come back to cut it?  There is no need for a human being to even look at these trees so is there anything which requires a bit of work, so that people can stay in the vicinity and communities can prosper from it?  Foreign companies often are getting the benefit from this ultimately.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill raised the big issue of how our beef was being produced and the number of bovines we have.  We are a country that produces a lot of high-quality beef and a lot of milk and we do it very sustainably.  Is there going to be pressure on us in the future to cut back?  Will there be pressures to find alternatives?  There are various schemes in place, such as the beef data genomics scheme, but will European directives put any pressure on us in this area?  Is that the direction in which this is going?<\/p><p>It is very scary when we think about it.  We could be in a position in maybe not so many years to come when people will say they used to produce beef in Ireland and trees in Latin America but now they produce beef in Latin America and trees in Ireland.

As the Deputies might be aware, we had quite a strong representation on forestry that led us to produce an afforestation policy, as distinct from a forestry policy.  The loudest voices were probably from Leitrim but very quickly we discovered this was an issue spreading across all counties, including counties we had not expected.  I remember reading in the <i>Farmers' Journal<\/i>that the highest rate of afforestation last year was in Meath, which would not necessarily have been expected.  Coming down to it, the issues people were having were not with farmers afforesting some of their land.  It was not farmers taking parts of their land that were unproductive and making them more productive through afforestation.  The representation to us was from young farmers who were feeling they were being pushed out of the land market by external forces, and in some cases with international companies purchasing land.  In some cases it was national companies or people outside the community coming in to purchase land and driving up the price of what we would consider to be middling to marginal land.  This was generally the lower quality land but, importantly, would still be quite productive agricultural land.  Trouble was caused for people trying to get into the land market in the first place.<br\/><br\/>From that, Macra suggested that grant aid should be based on a land assessment of the crop beforehand.  This would mean that for less productive land, going towards marginal land, there would be incentives but land that was highly productive in an agricultural sense would not.  In areas with predominantly marginal land, farmers might see land that would be ideal grazing ground going under trees while they were stuck trying to improve very poor ground.  We also believe there should have been incentives particularly aimed towards farmers, as opposed to landowners, and the controlling of foreign investment into land, which was driving land speculation.<br\/><br\/>Such actions are key to increasing the afforestation rate.  As long as people view afforestation as a threat, as they commonly do in Leitrim, they will not consider it for any of their property.  Macra views as a solution a large number of farmers taking a percentage of their farm and turning it into a carbon-positive activity, particularly native forestry, as opposed to Sitka spruce, which affects soil and drainage.<br\/><br\/>The other matter we can address directly is biogas and slurry storage.  The question was asked as to whether there is an alternative to getting into the grid for energy production.  After several field trips and research, we saw that co-production is key to the farmers in Northern Ireland.  This involves the production of biogas that could enter the gas network while also producing energy.  To highlight the underinvestment in Ireland, there are approximately 4,500 on-farm anaerobic digester, AD, plants in Germany.  According to the <i>Engineers Journal<\/i>, Ireland has one of the lowest pay-in tariffs for electricity produced by anaerobic digestion at 13 cent to 15 cent per kW.  In countries with that level of tariff, there is essentially no investment in AD.  Macra recommends that AD plants should be encouraged by increasing the pay-in tariff.  This goes back to the question of an auction-type system versus a feed-in tariff.  We see nothing but benefits in reducing methane associated with manure management and in reducing the slurry that must be produced, because digestate is lower.  This makes it a more productive fertiliser and helps to offset some of our fossil fuel emissions.<br\/><br\/>The other question relates to the utilisation of grass and the nature of our beef production.  These are two separate matters and relate to how we can improve pH and phosphorous and potassium levels.  This comes back to the question of a grazing infrastructure scheme under the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS.  There is no faster way to get farmers to recognise how valuable grass is to them and improve soil and productive growing conditions than by getting them out to start herds grazing grass.  If a farmer cannot allow grazing until the first day in May, he or she will not focus on grass as much as sheds and slurry storage.  Macra proposes that certain investments, such as farm roadways, water and fencing - fairly minor elements that could see easy and ready investment under TAMS - would be far more beneficial than investing in sheds and buildings.  It would mean farmers could get out 20, 30 or 40 days sooner and have the infrastructure on the farms to avoid damage to the soil.  That would increase the productivity of the grassland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018021300002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thomas Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518541200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I apologise to my colleague, Mr. Farrell, for failing to introduce him earlier.  He is the agri-executive with the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society.  There was some very interesting commentary and I do not disagree with much of it.  The international objectives can be very crude and have blanket approval.  That is why we must demonstrate quite clearly that the carbon footprint of food production should be measured against units of production.  It is about how much of an impact we are making per unit of production, relative to the rest of the world.  The European Union has acknowledged that our production methodology is such that we are probably 40% more efficient than average across Europe with milk and we are rated very highly with beef as well, where we are probably in fourth or fifth place per unit of production.  The point was very well made about the proportionality of the agricultural impact in Ireland because of the absence of other industry.  Agricultural activity as a result leaves a huge footprint on the Irish landscape but we might have an eighth of the impact of the UK agricultural footprint on its emissions.  This comes down to its industrial and transport sectors etc. having such a big impact.  We must concentrate our energy on demonstrating how we should be measured per unit of production rather than the proportionality of our impact overall.<\/p> <p>  The question was asked as to how to demonstrate on the international stage that Ireland can be seen as a place of destiny for food production and a partner of choice.  We are clearly doing that on a daily basis.  We export to approximately 160 countries and they demonstrate through action that they recognise the provenance, sustainability and quality assurance of the Irish product as second to none.  The customers are selling the product and message for us in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Members mentioned colleagues in the agricultural community in Europe in forums such as Copa-Cogeca very much align their thinking on the likes of the challenge of Mercosur.  Some people would sing the benefits of having a new market opened, with agriculture as one portion.  We know that getting licences for exports and meeting veterinary responsibilities etc. could take years.  Somebody might dress it up as an opportunity for one sector but it is a major disadvantage for another.  It will be a detrimental move from the perspective of those countries that produce food, especially with respect to provenance, traceability and other standards that we should and have to live up to.<\/p><p>Our customers dictate that they need safety, quality, etc.  Our view is that anyone who has access to that market, and to those precious customers, should live up to the same standards of production and quality that we do. <\/p><p> Deputy Cahill mentioned the role of bio-digesters in Europe.  It has been observed that the current indoor systems are more factory farming type operations, which facilitated the advancement of the technology.  We must learn from that.  Due to the family farm structure here, and rural Ireland in particular, and the depth that it goes into rural communities, the co-operatives must play a function and role in some collaborative endeavour to develop the sector.  The size of farms in this country probably dictate that it is probably uneconomic to use such technology on a single unit basis.  That situation is to our advantage because, as we have said, the family farm methodology here is a strength.  We need to find a mechanism that will bring a number of family farms together, under some type of co-operative structure, and have an anaerobic digester in common usage in an area.  A lot of work needs to be done in this sector and we must learn from the mistakes made by other people.  <\/p><p> In terms of derogation and the water framework, the Deputy is on the money and I agree with him that it is essential that we continue.  The dairy Ireland forum has been established and is comprised of all of the major players in the industry, including the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, farm organisations, the farming industry, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The aim is to have their representatives meet in the one room and they share the one objective to improve and do better at what we are doing.  There is a big job of work to be done.  The initial engagement with the farming community has to be positive and be a collaborative approach.  First, we must identify the challenging areas and then find a solution rather than simply try to find a culprit.  <\/p><p> I concur with what Deputy said about the municipal authorities.  There is a huge amount of discharge that is not up to international standards and, therefore, a lot of money is required to improve the situation.  We also have citizens in rural Ireland who have septic tanks.  People would be very mistaken if they thought the problem was confined to agricultural activities.  It is a matter for society too.  The initial engagement is critical.  I welcome the approach that has been taken.<\/p><p> In terms of the governance structure and how to bring the various agencies together, such as the co-operatives, Teagasc, the EPA and local authorities, the way that body of people is facilitated and managed will be critical.  We must ensure that the message delivered and approach adopted is consistent.  The initiative is a very good start and is one that we must encourage.  ICOS needs to be at the core of decision-making process to ensure that it works.  The demonstration of a successful collaborative approach was the success of the sustainable dairy assurance scheme, SDAS.  Earlier, it was mentioned, that almost all of the beef and dairy products that are produced here are quality assured to a very high standard.<\/p><p> With the permission of the Chairman, I ask my colleague, Mr. Farrell, to talk about afforestation and some of the blockages to that industry.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018021300002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518541200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>That is no problem.

Forestry can be promoted in many areas, in particular the use of native trees.  For example, commercial livestock and dairy farmers can be encouraged to increase their forestry.  The replanting obligation was also identified in our report as a particular blockage in terms of farming communities and their willingness to engage in forestry.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue mentioned that the current policy is a blunt instrument.  Emissions here are 19.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which equates to 32% of the national economy emissions.

We need a substantial knowledge transfer programme to ensure that these people move into the area of cattle breeding, etc.  and get the most profitable breed crosses that will convert into protein.  Such work will be challenging.  We are not here to sound the death knell of the Irish beef sector.  The sector makes a huge financial contribution to the local economy and provides huge employment in rural towns where employment is fairly scarce.  The quality of our beef products is recognised worldwide so we must ensure that we become efficient.  This country is at the very top end of European efficiency in terms of emissions per kilo of beef produced.  We could convince ourselves that we are not great but the fact is that we are very near the top of Europe in terms of performance.  The metric applied is per unit of production, which must be at the centre of what we do.  In terms of the beef genomic programme, a huge emphasis must be placed on knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer in order to bring the bottom quartile or third up to the top quartile performance, which is extremely profitable.

Deputy McConalogue is absent but earlier he mentioned the carbon footprint, that the international objectives are very blunt and that Ireland is vulnerable due to having 30% emissions.<\/p><p>The first point he made was that Irish agriculture had made more progress than it gets credit for.  Mr. Martin Keane said we sell into 160 countries, which is a credit in itself to this little island off the coast of Europe.  It shows the confidence that is out there in Irish agricultural produce.  He also asked about improving grassland pH.  In a nutshell, it should be a specific measure in a reopened GLAS to bring up the 10% statistic.  Obviously, a specific measure would mean a direct payment for spreading lime.  Ultimately, that is what will deliver efficient fertiliser use which will benefit the wider environment.<\/p><p> Senator Mac Lochlainn highlighted the double standard in the Mercosur deal in environmental terms.  We export 90% of our produce from the island and the big issue is that policy change has not been accepted.  There is a disconnect between climate and food production.  It was noted by Senator Mulherin that in terms of the footprint we have here, we suffer a great deal from a climatic perspective because we are an exporting nation.  It should be driven in some way towards the consumers of the products and the countries in which they reside.  Obviously, the SDAS scheme was alluded to by numerous speakers.  Origin Green is a great image for us.<\/p><p> As regards the environment, I would say to Deputy Cahill that I would not be so foolish as to think it would be put to bed and sleep forever.  Certainly, sleeping giants can be easier to deal with.  From an environmental point of view, we will hopefully bring it under control and make it commercially viable for farmers to go about their business in an environmental way.  The Deputy mentioned beef production.  We said at the outset that we were first in Europe in dairy production, that is No. 1 of 28.  We lie in fifth place for beef production.  In excess of 50% of beef is produced from the dairy herd.  Mr. Farrell of ICOS mentioned just there that sexed semen may be something that could be used positively going forward.  If the science delivers in comparison to conventional semen, there may be greater than 50% beef production from the dairy herd and significantly more.  Obviously, the dairy herd is growing.  The best kept secret in this country's beef industry is that the environmental footprint from the dairy herd is half of that of the suckler herd.  As dairy beef production increases, we may see our place in Europe improve from fifth.<\/p><p> Certainly, I agree with Mr. Keane as to local authorities.  Everyone needs to play a part right across rural Ireland if we are to see a significant improvement.  Investments must be made by local authorities in waste water treatment systems which are up to specification.  There is no point in farmers building an industry across rural Ireland if everyone does not play their part.  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. John Enright, to discuss biomass and forestry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018021300002#O00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McCormack","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518541200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I have a couple of points on forestry and what Deputy Cahill said.  There are vast areas of this country we cannot plant, whether it is because of environmental designations or whatever.  The Deputy mentioned hen harrier areas.  A hen harrier threat response plan was supposed to be published looking at all these issues, including forestry plantations, but it has not happened.  There are a lot of farmers in those areas who want to plant their land but they cannot do so.  Certainly, it is an issue which needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  As to biomass, we must look at recent history, which has not been good for farmers.  Farmers who got involved in miscanthus had a very bad experience.  They were badly let down to be fair to them.  If we are to encourage biomass production going forward, we will have to look at what happened with miscanthus.  Farmers will have to get better guarantees that if they go into this enterprise, commitments will be delivered.<\/p> <p>  I have two points on biogas and solar power.  Mr. Cooney mentioned the feed-in tariff.  These projects will have to be made economically viable for people who get involved in them.  Commitments must be made to those who get involved in those projects.  We are concerned that there will be a focus on industrial scale projects as opposed to farm-based ones.  We have visited farms in different parts of Europe where we have seen bio-digesters and solar panels on farm sheds operating very successfully where farmers have been incentivised.  That is what we favour in Ireland as opposed to industrial scale projects.  Public policy will have to move in that direction.  Not only would it have a climate change benefit, it would also have a rural development benefit.  It is much better to have ten farmers with solar panels on their roofs than one major industrial project in terms of buy-back for rural communities.  A lot of our members are involved in renewables and the big blockage we have seen involves grid connections, which must be addressed.  There are delays in getting grid connections and it costs money.  There is a concern that the cost of grid connections will increase further.  If we are to promote these projects, the grid connection blockage will have to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018021300002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Enright"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518541200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I will share the response to the substantive issues with Mr. Cooney.  I refer to Deputy McConalogue's contribution.  The EU pre-Paris position and the international Paris Agreement refer, while highlighting the need to meet the challenge of climate change, to the fact that we must keep the multiple roles of agriculture very much to the forefront.  Those multiple roles include food, fuel and energy production as well as the climate enhancement and climate mitigation potential of the sector.  The Paris Agreement reiterates that European position and reaffirms that food production must not be threatened when addressing the climate challenge.  Some five or six years ago, France and Italy proposed a carbon border tax as part of trade talks to penalise countries we trade with which are not as efficient as we are.  That might have to be revisited.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue asked about improving the grassland model.  Our smart-farming initiative comes in here.  We saw it as a win-win situation as the average profit for the farms which took part in the initiative increased by &euro;8,700 while their emissions were reduced by an average of 10% across the board.  Soil sampling has a huge role to play as does the allocation of lime and so on.<\/p> <p>  Senator Mac Lochlainn referred to Mercosur.  I have mentioned a few times the frustration we feel when we hear European politicians talk about climate change and the fact that Irish and European farmers need to wake up fast.  We are wide awake to the challenges but what frustrates us is that a lot of the same European Commissioners are very anxious to push forward a trade deal with Mercosur countries, including Brazil, which produces 80 kg of CO2 to produce 1 kg of beef.  The average across Europe is 19 kg of CO2 to produce 1 kg of beef.  My colleague, Mr. Keane, referred to the number of kilogrammes of CO2 required to produce a kilogramme of food.  There is a clear double standard there.<\/p><p>In Brazil we see large tracts of land on which there has been deforestation and that are being created to increase its output of beef.  <\/p><p> Senator Michelle Mulherin referred to the Citizens' Assembly and the mention of a second carbon tax.

The first carbon tax has not worked.  We have seen a carbon increase across the country in spite of it.  It is important to highlight the fact that since 1990 our agricultural output has increased by 40%, while our CO2 emissions have fallen by 3.5%.  We need to see the Common Agricultural Policy continue and not turn into a common environment policy.  The environment will play a part in that regard, but it can only be a part.  We can never lose sight of what the CAP was introduced for - the production of an adequate amount of high quality food at affordable prices and that is what it has done.  When it was introduced in the 1960s, 30% of average household income was being spent on food.  Today in Ireland the figure is less than 10%, while across Europe it is somewhere between 10% and 12%.<\/p> <p>  Forestry also came up as an issue.  We included it in our document that we launched at the ploughing championships.  It is safe to say that in Deputy Martin Kenny's part of the country there would be a very negative attitude to forestry.  I have mentioned that we are at a figure of 11% and want to get it to 18%.  In County Leitrim - the Deputy will correct me if I am wrong - they are already at a figure of 26%.  They see that they are being priced out of the market if they want to buy some land to increase their farm size.  Farmers no longer view forestry as a safe investment.  Last year the level of planting fell to 5,500 ha, 25% down on the really modest figure of 7,400 ha that was the target.  It is the lowest figure in 60 years.  We have listed five points that we think would help forestry: removing the restrictions on planting productive marginal land; the reintroduction of the farmer forest premium differential; compensating farmers for all lands they are obligated to set aside for environmental enhancements; reducing the red tape under the forest road scheme; and the provision of funding to establish a national network of forest producer groups.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Jackie Cahill mentioned climate change.  I have already said we can embrace it and that we are in a good position to do so.  We have proved that we are the most efficient producers of dairy products in Europe from a carbon footprint point of view.  We are in the top five - there is really not much between the top five - in beef production.  The Deputy's question was about the sustainability of steer production.  I come back to the multiple roles of suckler cow and steer production in parts of the country that are not really suitable for tillage or dairy farming.  The multiple roles involve keeping rural Ireland alive in terms of the money being spent there.  Professor Alan Renwick's analysis a number of years ago showed that every euro given in support given to those sectors gave rise to a multiplier of 4.28 in the local economy.  We need to do this.  That is why we are driving on in our lobbying campaign to have a figure of &euro;200 per cow which would create that multiplier at local level.  We need to use technology, research and genetic improvements to bring the bottom and middle thirds in the sector up to the efficiency level of the top one third.  <\/p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. Cooney, will cover some of the other areas mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018021300002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518541200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn asked about the White Paper on energy.

We need to create a market for it.  The Government may need to introduce a mandatory use obligation in public buildings - a requirement to use indigenously produced materials for biomass.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator also mentioned microgeneration.  The reality is that public policy has not taken it seriously.  There is a great opportunity to engage in microgeneration, in the first instance, to offset our energy use in homes and on farms.  It can also be done by combining battery storage with microgeneration.  However, we need supports.  We will need a refit and possibly grants for battery storage also  That, in turn, will reduce our overall emissions and consumption of energy.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny asked if anaerobic digestion would be of benefit.  Mr. Keane touched on it also.  Anaerobic digestion, combined with separation, would help to reduce the amount of waste that would have to be spread on land.  It is wrong, however, to call it waste as it is a valuable nutrient.  The problem is getting it.  Again, we need incentives in that regard.  As Mr. Keane said, there is an also opportunity to engage in community-based activity, but there is a need for incentives, grant aid and tariff supports.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Jackie Cahill spoke about grid availability.  At this stage all of our submissions to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities in Ireland, CRU, have been made and it now needs to deliver on its proposals.  We need to discontinue grid trading by developers and provide for grid preference for farm-scale and community projects.  That ties in with what I said previously.  We also have to ensure planning permission is in place before granting grid access.  <\/p> <p>  On the other questions about the beef sector and all the rest, almost 90% of the measures included in the current rural development plan are carbon reducing measures.

We saw one national paper refer sometime last year to the suckler cow as akin to a weapon of mass destruction.  When we have this kind of hysteria, it is more difficult to sell the message.  Agriculture has a very good message.  How often have members seen any of the mainstream media highlight the fact that we are the most efficient producer of dairy product in Europe?

In addition, certain biased sectors or organisations talk about the 33% of emissions in Ireland for which agriculture is responsible.  It has been mentioned already that climate change is not just an Irish issue but a global issue, yet those who proclaim to be experts in the field of climate change talk about reducing the dairy herd or suckler cow numbers.

This is a very narrow focus and a very narrow way of looking at things.  The reality, and this is a challenge for all of us, is that a scientific argument is fine for scientists and those who have an understanding of the industry or the activity involved but science will very rarely win a debate when it is challenged by sentiment, and sentiment is very hard to change because there is nothing substantial behind it other than a belief.

The Chairman is absolutely right that we have a big challenge out there to communicate.  All of us have a job of work to do to communicate what it is we do.  Very few people understand that over the past four or five years, we have increased our agricultural exports by 35% or 36%, we have reduced our dependency on the UK market, and Ireland Inc. has come from a position of nearly 60% of exports going into the European and UK market to, I believe, below 50% in 2017.  We are doing a huge job of work on the international stage with international customers to make known the provenance and excellence of what we do here, yet on our doorstep there is that lack of understanding, which is a challenge for us to address.  I do not have the answer right here and now, but we will certainly have to be way more proactive in trying to deepen the broader community's understanding of what it is agricultural and food production does.  All of us in the room, including my colleague behind me, Mr. Healy, and Mr. McCormack, have emphasised the multifactorial effect that agriculture has right across society and the community.  It is not just about food production, but also about the rural sustainability of villages and towns, the employment that is there and the mitigation of some of the migration of people from rural areas into centres of population and all the problems that come with that.  We have a message to get across that it is not just about food production, but about many other things.  It is about the economic sustainability of rural Ireland and the social sustainability of its fabric.  That disconnect and lack of understanding is there.  Sometimes one would fail to understand why people would not connect the reality of jobs in local areas and rural communities to the reasons Mary and Johnny have to go to New York.  There is a very tight connection between that rural activity and economic activity and food production and the availability of sustainable social and economic activity and employment for people in rural areas.

The first is on the public's side.  Senator Mulherin is completely right that there is a body out there that sees agriculture as nothing but negative, but it can be further broken down, in my experience, into two separate cohorts.  Among the first cohort, these views are born of ignorance; it is a simple disconnect from the awareness of agriculture.  These people are generally quite educated about the environmental impacts but unaware of why we have those impacts.  They do not understand the principles of agriculture.  We would not expect them to any more than we might expect someone to have experience of rocket science.  Agriculture is completely outside of their day-to-day lives.  We can make a connection with these people and explain things to them.  They can understand our message and are the kind of people with whom, external to the country, things like Origin Green have really succeeded in connecting.  Then there is the cohort of people who are driven by ideology.  These people cannot be connected with and there is no point in trying to do so.

We must focus on messaging and perhaps it is time we had an internal Origin Green.  Great efforts are being made, by Agri Aware and others, to reconnect.  We are very lucky because the degree of separation is much lower than in the UK or the US and we can connect with people by speaking to them about their uncle, grand uncle or grand aunt who lived down the country and had cattle.  Messaging has improved but it is very important to explain to farmers what their exact emissions are and how they can reduce them.  We need to put numbers on it, like the carbon navigator has done, and set targets for farmers to reduce their emissions further.  This must involve meeting the carbon footprint of soya milk, which is at 0.8 kg per kg and 20% off what Ireland is producing, which is 1 kg per kilogramme.  This is higher than the level of what the top 20% of dairy farmers are producing, at 0.65 or 0.67.<\/p><p> We need to educate farmers about getting to this level.

The protection of children online is an extremely important matter.  One might argue, as we do, that the challenges, threats and dangers presented by the Internet, social media and wider cyberspace to our children and young teenagers necessitate that they are given our utmost careful attention.  It is important that this problem space is not considered in separate Government silos, for example, the Departments of Education and Skills, Health, Justice and Equality and Communications, Climate Action and Environment, since in terms of the child's or young person's experience of technology each has a very important contribution to make.<\/p> <p>  A key concept underpinning the security of our children and young teenagers online is age appropriate interaction with technology and, more specifically, age appropriate interaction with the Internet.  The Digital Childhood report of 2017 highlights that the Internet was conceived as an environment for adult users and no design concessions were made for children.<\/p><p>The utopian vision of the Internet was that all users would be equal.  If all users are equal, then a child user is treated the same as an adult user and this is why, arguably, the Internet, by default, is not fit for children.  The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, COPPA, passed in the United States has been one of the sole mechanisms to define restrictions on the collection and processing of personal data from children under the age of 13 years, unless verifiable consent has been granted by a parent or guardian.  It is because of COPPA that many social media platforms require that their users are at least 13 years old.  However, it has not been vigorously enforced in a regulatory context and studies consistently provide evidence of underage usage of mainstream social media platforms.  We believe that robust age verification online is one of the most critical requirements to deliver on child and youth security in cyber contexts .<br\/><br\/>The forthcoming European general data protection regulation, GDPR, which comes into effect on 25 May 2018, will formalise age protective measures online.  The EU has set the digital age of consent at 16 years but permits each state to decide a national age of consent that can be as low as 13 years.  For clarification, the digital age of consent is not about when a child can access the Internet, it is merely the age at which a child can consent to a profiling of their personal data and that is it.  It is not about access, it is just the age at which a child can say he or she is happy to be profiled by a social media company or by a game.  Notably, Ireland has opted for 13, the lowest age of digital consent allowed under the GDPR.  The Data Protection Bill 2018, which enshrines an Irish digital age of consent of 13, was submitted to the Seanad on 8 February 2018 and is currently under consideration.<br\/><br\/>On launching the Bill, the Minister for Justice and Equality stated:<\/p><blockquote>The Government considers that a digital age of consent of 13 years represents an appropriate balancing of children's rights, namely, a child's right to participation in the online environment and a child's right to safety and protection, rights that are enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Provision is made for that in section 29.<\/blockquote><p>It is important to point out that section 29, or rather Article 29, does not actually say this.  We are not criticising the Minister at all - this is actually a widely held belief - but the convention does not say that.  This claim has been made by a number of respondents to the Department of Justice and Equality's consultation on the digital age of consent, which was held in 2016.<br\/><br\/>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified in 1989 and came into effect in 1990, thereby pre-dating the Internet, online services and social media.  The assertion that &ldquo;a child&rsquo;s right to participation in the online environment ... rights that are enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child&rdquo; is not quite an accurate statement.  If one wishes to bring this convention into play, attention should be given to Article 17, which states &ldquo;States Parties recognize the important function performed by the mass media and shall ensure that the child has access to information and material from a diversity of national and international sources, especially those aimed at the promotion of his or her social, spiritual and moral well-being and physical and mental health.&rdquo;  That is an access issue that is not what the age of consent is all about.  Article 19 states &ldquo;States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.&rdquo;  Probably most importantly, Article 27 states &ldquo;States Parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development.&rdquo;  It also states &ldquo;The parent(s) or others responsible for the child have the primary responsibility to secure, within their abilities and financial capacities, the conditions of living necessary for the child's development.&rdquo;  The important point here is that parents should have authority over when and when not a young child can give consent.  Notably, Article 1 takes a very age-protective stance regarding the definition of a child, stating that for the purposes of the convention, a child is defined as someone below the age of eighteen years.  We will outline in the remainder of our submission, which Dr. Mary Aiken will present to the committee, some of the many reasons Ireland, by setting the digital age of consent at 13 years, is not honouring the spirit of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in terms of the risks to a child's security, well-being, physical and mental health.  The digital age of consent is intended to provide robust protection for children from those who might seek to target and commercially exploit them.  In our opinion, the digital age of consent will also have protective merit in terms of the psychological and social well-being of the child, which in turn will help to deliver on child safety and security.  <br\/><br\/>It is therefore very important, before we move on to Dr. Aiken's contribution, to understand that the digital age of consent is simply about the age at which a child can enter into a contract with a social media company; it is not about access to the Internet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018021300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Barry O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518528600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>The Children and Parents: Media Use and Attitudes Report for 2017 produced by OFCOM in the UK highlights that more younger children are going online.  I am not going to read out all of the statistics, people can look at them afterwards, but I will just highlight one or two.  At present, 53% of three to four year olds are now online, 1% of three to four year olds have their own smartphone and if one looks at an older age group, 83% of 12 to 15 year olds have their own smartphone, 99% go online for more than 21 hours a week and 74% have a social media profile.  It is significant that such a large percentage of young people have a social media profile despite COPPA.  This represents a major cybersecurity challenge that must be addressed whereby children under the age of 13 have social media profiles.  Evidence is mounting about the harmful effects of social networking sites on the well-being of children including sleeplessness, obesity, compulsive use and vulnerability to advertising.  Sleep deprivation increases the likelihood that teens will suffer a myriad of negative consequences, including an inability to concentrate, poor grades, anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation.<\/p> <p>  The statistics are worrying as rates of anxiety and depression in young people have increased by 70% over the past 25 years.   Young people say four of the five most used social media platforms make their feelings of anxiety worse.  A report by the Royal Society for Public Health report states \"the platforms that are supposed to help young people connect with each other may actually be fuelling a mental health crisis&rdquo;.  Insomnia is on the rise and one in five young people say they wake up during the night to check messages on social media.  They are three times more likely to feel constantly tired at school.  Nine in ten teenage girls say they are unhappy with their body and there has been a surge in teenage girls being hospitalised for eating disorders.  According to the HSE, the number has almost doubled over ten years.  Arguably these increases are linked to the use of social media, along with the availability of such sites as &ldquo;pro-ana&rdquo; or&ldquo;pro-mia&rdquo; websites, which encourage and glamorise anorexia and bulimia.  These sites also influence vulnerable, self-conscious teens.  Notably, the negative impact of these sites, along with the availability of harmful and age-inappropriate online content such as violent, aggressive or gory content involving cruelty, abuse of animals and killings, adult pornography, extremism and radicalisation was highlighted in the Irish Internet content governance advisory group report, to which I was a party.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of sexting among young people in Europe.  The exchange of explicit images presents a significant security risk rendering young people vulnerable to cyberbullying and to sextortion.  In 2017 my group at Europol reported that sextortion and webcam blackmailing has skyrocketed in the past few years.  It was noted that victims as young as seven years old are being targeted online.  This is a whole new cohort of people who have an economic interest in the child, rather than a sexually deviant interest in the child.<\/p> <p>  Instant messaging apps are problematic in terms of cyberbullying since they can act as rapid vehicles for circulating bullying messages and spreading images.  The National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre at Dublin City University found that new apps and social media platforms are targeting children as young as nine years of age.  Children can be reluctant to tell their parents about the bullying because they are worried that their Internet access will be taken away.  Victims of bullying are more likely to experience low academic performance, depression, anxiety, self-harm, feelings of loneliness and changes in sleeping and eating patterns, which is extremely worrying in the context of the overall health and well-being of our children.  Teachers are front-line witnesses to these problems.  Teachers in the UK have reported a significant increase in children as young as four years suffering panic attacks, eating disorders, anxiety and depression.  Schools are struggling to access support to deal with the surge in the number of children and young people suffering from mental health issues.  The general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, NASUWT, Chris Keates, has warned of growing concern among teachers about a gap in the availability of experts and counselling to help children with mental health needs.  A recent survey by the Irish Primary Principals Network reported that a quarter of its members reported a spike in anxiety levels in their schools.  The Growing Up in Ireland study of 2016 found that 10% of 17 to 18 year olds reported that they had been diagnosed with depression, anxiety or both by a medical professional; 17% of 17 to 18 year olds - these are Irish children - admitted to engaging in self-harm behaviour.<\/p><p> Setting an appropriate digital age of consent is a complex issue.  The decision must be informed by the impact that technology has on the cyber-cognitive and sociological development of children so that we avoid placing them in positions where they neither have the digital skills, nor the understanding of the consequences of sharing their data or aspects of their personal lives.  Children need guidance from their parents in this regard.<\/p><p> When it comes to technology and children, the digital age of consent is both a security issue, which is of particular interest to the committee, and a child protection issue.  An arbitrary statement that every child at 13 is capable of consenting to the terms and conditions of online service providers is problematic given the potential risks that they face.  For example, companies can collect, record and share a children's home and school address, their location, date of birth, photos, phone number, likes and dislikes, who they know, and the content of their conversations, including direct messages sent privately.  Not only does that present a security risk to the individual child but, by association, it also presents a risk to the family.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding a young person's right to freedom of speech and to access information, the requirement for verifiable parental or guardian consent for those under the digital age of consent seems entirely appropriate and responsible.  The point is that parents and guardians know their child best, and they are the primary custodians of their security and welfare.  They are best placed to evaluate properly when it is appropriate to grant consent on behalf of their child.  It is only they who can judge appropriately and assess an individual child's level of maturity, understanding and judgment in an online context.<\/p><p> An optimum digital age of consent for Ireland can be informed by best practice in other countries.  Notably, liberal EU leaders in child safety and protection online, countries such as Germany, France and the Netherlands, have chosen 16 years as their digital age of consent.  The UK will be enacting an amendment to its data protection law to impose a stricter code of practice for protecting children's privacy online focusing on provisions for 13 to 17 year olds who are above the digital age of consent but still children.  The proposed UK amendment has several features designed to deliver on cybersecurity, for example, ensuring high privacy settings are switched on by default, not revealing GPS locations, and preventing data from being widely shared.  Additionally, the proposed amendment allows for the well-being of the young person, for example, by giving children time off from endless notifications during school and sleep hours and by requiring commercially driven content presented to children to be clearly identified.<\/p><p> The Irish digital age of consent must be informed by the Law Reform Commission's 2011 report, Report on Children and the Law: Medical Treatment.  I sat on the Law Reform Commission's group.  The report recommended that when it came to persons under 16, there should not be a presumption of capacity to consent.  The 2011 report involved the application of a \"mature minor\" test , which has been applied in a number of states, sometimes in case law and sometimes in legislation, to a wide variety of legal areas involving decision-making capacity of children and young persons.<\/p><p> It is also worth noting that Article 42A of the Constitution , inserted by the children's rights referendum, also recognises the concept of a \"mature minor\" test.  While Article 42A might not directly apply to the age of consent for the purposes of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, the fact that the Constitution now includes a \"mature minor\" test is worth noting.<\/p><p> The Garda has stated that it has no substantial difficulty with the digital age of consent being set at 16.  Let us remember that the Garda will deal on the front line with the consequences and fallout of problems in this area involving minors.  It was recently reported that Assistant Commissioner Pat Leahy has criticised the Government for \"not serving our children well\" with unregulated access to social media websites where they could become victims of online paedophiles.  The number of suspected incidents of online child abuse referred to the Metropolitan Police in the UK has increased by 700% since 2014.  Reports to the current UK independent inquiry into child sexual abuse estimate that 10% of adults take part in \"online sexualised conversations\" with children and teenagers aged under 18, as many as 4% of adults have engaged with images of child sexual abuse on the Internet, and 11 to 14 year olds are most at risk from online abuse.<\/p><p> Given the substantial risks to the safety, security and well-being of children and young people online, Ireland needs to put in place a policy framework and an associated educational programme that ensures children are sufficiently aware and responsible to understand and exercise their digital rights by the time they reach the digital age of consent.  In the absence of a rigorous basis for any specific age at this point, a prudent approach would be to set the digital age of consent in Ireland at 16.  We would both like to say, for the record, that we unequivocally oppose the Government's current position to set the digital age of consent in Ireland at 13 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018021300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Aiken","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518528600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I will wrap up.  We have a number of recommendations.  We are happy to speak to each of those in detail if the committee wishes.  Experts, policymakers and stakeholders should come together to agree on a national framework to address Irish children's well-being, safety and security online.  There are a variety of aspects to that which are important and we are happy to discuss them.<br\/><br\/>The Government must hold social media companies accountable for underage usage of their platforms.  Despite what one hears in the media that this is not practical, it is eminently practical.  One also often hears that children drink alcohol underage but that is a problem we have, by and large, solved.  There are very specific things we could be doing.<br\/><br\/>There is a need to stop conflating a child's right to access information online with the digital age of consent which specifically relates to the age at which a child can sign legal agreements with online service providers who gather, profile, sell, and commercialise personal data.  We both agree that this conflation has mis-stepped the entire debate on the digital age of consent in Ireland because people think it is about access when it is not.  Six lines in the general data protection regulation talk about entering legal agreements.<br\/><br\/>The Government must formalise the role, office, and statutory powers of the digital safety commissioner, which we strongly welcome.  One specific task that could be assigned to this office is the development of a robust system for age verification online.  Self-verification does not work.  A child simply saying he or she is 13 or 16 is not adequate.  One does not enter bars on the basis that one says one is 22 if one is not.  Ireland could lead in the area of online age verification.  We believe that robust age verification online is one of the most critical requirements to deliver on child and youth security in cyber contexts.<br\/><br\/>We must develop robust policies and safeguards to ensure that children are delivered content that is age-appropriate and that careful consideration is given to limiting or eliminating advertising to them online.  In tandem to setting an appropriate digital age of consent, consideration must be given to making the Internet and social media safer for children specifically, as well as educating children and parents on Internet safely.  That is clearly something that can be picked up by the office of the digital safety commissioner.<br\/><br\/>The report of the Internet content governance advisory group should be revisited.

Obviously, children at that age do not have ID.  They may have birth certificates or perhaps school ID cards, but that is the extent of it.  How do we go about this verification process in a practical way?<\/p> <p>  My final question concerns the sexualisation of children at a very young age.  We see young girls under the age of ten in particular sending images of themselves that look quite provocative, for want of a better word.  Then there are young boys and young men viewing images that are not age-appropriate, which has an impact on how they view women.  I would be interested to hear how we might tackle this.

We, as academics, are only raising these issues now.  We do not have the longitudinal studies that show this definitively to be what we call causation according to scientific testing.  However, it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that if an eight year old boy is looking at hardcore pornography, by the time he is 18 he will be damaged as a result of exposure to that content.  Coming back to relationships, the Internet is effectively a lean medium.  While texting and the connectivity involved in it seem spectacular in that there are so many connections, as humans we are hardwired to read facial expressions.  That is how we evolve and socialise with one another.  I have been inundated with calls from school principals since this whole debate started informing me of reports coming back from employers of transition year students placed in workplaces to the effect that these kids have impoverished social skills and very poor eye contact and, as the Deputy said, cannot make phone calls, book anything or gather information.  This is one of the reasons France has banned phones in primary and secondary schools, not only because of the addictive nature of the device but also because the kids were not socialising at breaks.  They were sitting with their devices in linear huddles rather than actually talking to one another and they were not reading emotions well.  This was also leading to cyberbullying problems because they were not able to tell by reading someone's facial expressions that he or she was getting upset.  The second point raised relates to exercise.  We have an increasing problem with obesity in young people.  The kids were sitting with the devices and not moving around at lunchtime or break-time.  This is something to consider.  We are certainly considering it at school level.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's point about the hyper-sexualisation of children is very valid.  As a cyber-behavioural scientist, I am very concerned about the impact of this on young people.  Again, we are seeing reports of young people presenting in clinical environments with chronic sexual dysfunction as a result of being exposed to hardcore content.  I put it to the committee that no one will take responsibility for a child being exposed to extreme content - for example, adult hardcore pornography - but whether one is the device manufacturer, the Internet service provider or the entity that generated or hosted the content, basically, when a child is exposed to this extreme content, one is collectively involved in the abuse of the child.  I think it is only a matter of time before State agencies such as Tusla will have to become involved with children who have been exposed to extreme hardcore content online.  For the record, paedophiles expose children to such material to desensitise them in order to groom them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018021300002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Aiken"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518528600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>The question of verification is really important.  How does one know that the person online is a ten year old, a 12 year old or a 17 year old?  We must develop technologies that make age verification practical.  Self-verification does not work.  We could consider a variety of options.  For example, one possibility is that at the purchase time of a device - in other words, when one buys a smartphone in one's local store - the age of the person using that phone is declared.  This needs to be done on the basis of a form of ID.  An important point I wish to make here is that many parents are buying devices for their children and one could infer that in some sense they are responsible for the content on those devices.  I ask the committee to imagine a situation in a school in which boys are sending very personal photographs of themselves of an adult nature - let us put it that way - to their female classmates.

It is in parents' interests that there are technologies that address this.  As for other age verification technology we could build, one could imagine solutions based on artificial intelligence, AI, which, based on the manner in which the user interacts with the device, estimate his or her age and ask for confirmation.  Another technology could use some notion of a digital certificate that a parent can grant to a child to protect his or her anonymity if that is important to them.  That certificate could be uploaded to a platform to prove that the user has permission.  The certificate could come from, say, the office of the Digital Safety Commissioner.  There are many solutions.  One will hear people on the web who hold the view that anonymity is key, but this attitude tends to come from the first amendment to the US constitution and the idea that people have the right to free speech and so on.  However, I think if one asks most parents and most kids, anonymity is not important to them and they are prepared to engage with technologies if there is a benefit.

Where the child is below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.<\/blockquote><p>The next line simply states member states can lower the age to 13 years.

Nobody disputes its importance provided the content is age appropriate, but that not what the digital age of consent is all about.  For example, it does not apply if no personal data are being shared.  Therefore, when someone goes online to do one's homework, his or her personal data are not being shared and one is not being profiled.  If advertising is not presented to a person while he or she is online, one is not being profiled.  When someone browses Wikipedia or visits the many websites that allow a person to play games, he or she is not being profiled.

I had to do so because the world had changed suddenly.<\/p><p> If one thinks about classical child development, we have Piaget's stages of cognitive development.  Parents are told that, by the age of one year, their child should be standing up, by four, saying a sentence and so on.  We do not have the equivalent for stages of cybercognitive development.  For argument's sake, what is the best age to give a child a smartphone?  There are no protocols or recommendations at a statutory level or from the Department of Education and Skills which state that expert consensus agrees on what age a child should interact with technology.  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that one should not give a device or any screen time to a child under the age of 18 months, yet nobody knows that.  One positive outcome would be to bring an expert group together to go through all the information and data we have to date to see if we could formulate stages of cybercognitive development that could inform and advise teachers and parents.<\/p><p> I know there are many lobbies, people talking about banning smartphones and much drama in the media about this.  A ban is something else.  As scientists, we would be much more in favour of protocols.  If, for example, the recommendation is that a child under the age of 14, which is a protective band, is not mature enough to deal with what he or she is exposed to on a smartphone, then, effectively when little Johnny is given a smartphone at seven for his First Communion present, other parents can say that is not fair because it is creating peer pressure.

This is why we, as a society, need to sit back and figure out what we want our schools to be doing and how we want parents to behave with each other.  If there is a cohort of parents who give smartphones to their kids at certain ages, we should be frowning upon that because it is putting pressure on other families to buy these devices and start putting their kids online.

Imagine it as playing a slot machine and every so often one wins.  The problem with kids is that it becomes a feedback loop.  The phones are designed to be addictive.

We are focusing on kids but we have to think about adults' use of devices.  Children look to adults in the context of how they use their devices.  We must focus on how that influences children's behaviour.

That puts us in a difficult position.  I chaired a committee which dealt with an issue on which some people disagreed.  I fear that this issue has been decided, but I hope certain individuals can look at the legislative implications on Committee Stage.  It is a children's issue.

We cannot say it enough.  A little like the issue of childhood obesity, we have to come at it from the top, the side and the bottom.  It is one area in which children are far ahead of us.  It is a little like drug enhanced performance in sport.  Those involved are ahead of us all the time.  It is comparable to those who seek to partake in illegal activity in sport.  It is constantly developing.  The advertisers, marketers and all those involved are constantly trying to see how they can benefit financially in all areas and children are a huge target group.<\/p> <p>  The delegates touched on the banning issue.

My feeling is, having put some stuff on social media in recent weeks, that parents believe they need a helping hand.

I worked in the sector before but with the amount of information that has come at us today, I am still trying to process what was said earlier.  If I am still trying to process it, we can imagine what a parent might be going through in watching this.  It all leads back to education.  If a person knows and understands the issue, he or she can combat it.  If somebody does not know the warning signs, he or she will be hurt.  That is down to a lack of education.  If there are to be recommendations from this committee, they will be about how we educate people on this.  It may have to go before the education committee as well.  The matter is evolving and we need underlying education to be able to have the wherewithal and be able to think outside the box in watching for the warning signs.  It is an imperative.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned protocols and I assume for particular age groups there would be protocols or a methodology or best practice to follow for the ages of 12, 13, 14 and 15.

That might be a recommendation.<\/p> <p>  We might be using the wrong vocabulary in saying the age of \"digital consent\".  Given the comments from the witnesses, it should be the age of \"data consent\".  It might make more sense.  It is confusing and straight away people might ask if they can access the Internet.  I would say data consent rather than digital consent.  There is also the question of social media companies controlling self-esteem; that means an algorithm controls self-esteem, based on commercially driven ideas.  Again, this goes back to education.  We must tell our kids at 13, 14 and 15 that certain things happen on social media as people, including children and parents, do not know about it.

We have to sort out the age verification issue carefully, as Deputy Chambers said.  We cannot even throw a loop around the issue and figure out how to address it because it is multifaceted.

There is no developmental reason an age should be 13 or 16.  There is, however, a legal reason.  The law has to focus on a point, on the 16th birthday or the 13th birthday.  In psychology we never say that by the age of 13 all children are mature enough to do X, Y or Z.  We always talk about age bands.  When we make a recommendation we make the age band slightly older to allow for the fact that children develop at different stages.  If we say that the digital age of consent should be 16, then we are talking about protecting 13, 14 and 15 year olds while fully acknowledging that some 13 year olds might be more mature and their parents might say \"Great, go on Facebook and do what you want\".  Some parents, however, might be a little worried about a child having Instagram and various images where the child may be fussing about his or her looks and have self-esteem issues.  Parents may feel they should withhold that particular platform or may feel that the child is okay on one platform and not on another.  Why would we take that power from parents?  From the perspective of liability, why does the State want the responsibility of now being responsible for everything that 13, 14 and 15 year olds do online because the State has chosen to make the legislation this way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018021300002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Aiken"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518528600,"counter":212,"content":"<p>The State is proposing to enact legislation that is going to make one single exception to consent law in Ireland; the only thing a person can consent to at 13 years of age is to have his or her data profiled on a social media platform.

Deputy Neville has highlighted the fact that it is deficient.  I do not believe that deficiency is a failure but, as a parent and as a legislator, I believe that the basic principle behind all of this is that we are woefully ill-equipped to deal with the ongoing issues of online security, bullying and everything else associated with the matter.  This applies to adults and to the current generation coming through.<\/p><p>Last week a young lady, I believe she is 16 or 17 years old, was sitting in the same seat as Dr. Aiken is sitting in now.  I asked her about the possible ban.  I was not aware that she had studied in France but she chimed in and told the committee that she had spent three months there and she had a very interesting insight into the ban on phones for young students there.  Senator Noone touched on the issue earlier and Dr. Aiken has referred to it also; bans are crude instruments that invariably do not work.  The bans will not capture everybody and usually the individuals who find a way around it are often the ones who require the most assistance.<\/p><p>I do not want to be pernickety about these things but as he is a member of the Garda I wish to make a correction; it is appropriate to say that Assistant Commissioner Pat Leahy did not criticise Government policy.  He lamented the fact that there was a deficiency in legislation with regard to a particular case.  He did not, as stated in the<i>Irish Mirror<\/i>, slam the Government.  I would never rely upon it for a quote.  That is a personal observation.  I am of the view there is a massive deficiency in criminal law and criminal justice around the grooming of children.  This has also been referenced a number of times by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon and by the Law Reform Commission.  Some of these deficiencies have been highlighted to the committee already and the witnesses' contribution to the debate today has been excellent in that regard.  I thank the witnesses for that.  From my perspective, however, and to go back to the educational aspect, a figure of some 80% of parents did not have a clue what their teenagers or their younger children were up to online.  This is a societal failing and a failing of our education system.  It was suggested that there be mandatory requirements for programmes to be introduced to third level training for teachers at primary, second and probably even third level where first and second year students are still in their teens and exposed to the sort of environment the witnesses have described over the past 90 minutes.  Dr. Aiken and Professor O'Sullivan will most likely agree that this is a very important part of the solution.  I will not call it the antidote because it is a sticking plaster in terms of what we have to face in the future around criminal acts and the deficiencies as mentioned.<\/p><p>Reference was made to distorted images and how image distortion can have a major effect on self-esteem.  The geolocation aspect, however, is quite insidious.  There are a number of apps that do this, Snapchat being one which is probably the most high profile.  I am sure there have been examples the witnesses have studied and come across in their own fields where individuals will have used their geolocation.  How significant a threat is this from a predatorial perspective and from a psychoanalytical aspect with regard to determining where an individual is located and preying on the person based on the geography?  I acknowledge it is not just an issue in this State because I am aware that both of the witnesses' studies have extended well beyond the Republic of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018021300002#L00800","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518528600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>That is a great question.  When a digital image is taken there is metadata embedded in the image.  Crack tools are available online where a person can crack the image to release the metadata.  This will include the GPS co-ordinates of the image.  A child could take a photo and embedded in that image is the location.  The metadata will also contain the date.  This date is important because it tells the predator that the child who looks like a seven or eight year old in the image is still that age and, therefore, it is not an old image and the child falls within the predator's preference range.  Predators are also profilers; they look at location, the date and the time of day.  If a child is taking explicit images of himself or herself it may be at the time the child is unsupervised and this might give a window of opportunity for somebody to call to the house and actually to the door, to try to engage with the child.  We are haemorrhaging data through these platforms.  Whatever about adults being aware of our digital exhaustion, a child who is seven, eight, nine or ten years old is not aware of the consequences of their activities.  This is why we have to adopt a protective stance.  If we could get children to the age of 15, which is what we are trying to do with the digital age of consent, in an environment where they had maximum levels of parental involvement and protection then I believe we would be doing a great job.  It is our hope that Ireland could lead in this area.  As scientists we are more than happy to work on age verification methodologies and protocols to create an entire use case for how this might actually happen.  Ireland could lead the world in this area.  We are a small market and we have the tech companies here.  I do not know any tech company that wants to be involved in something where a child suffers harm.  Recently the Apple shareholders wrote to the company to say they were worried about this issue.  There will be liabilities down the line because of how children have been harmed by their use of certain social media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018021300002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Aiken"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518528600,"counter":216,"content":"<p>There are other examples about geotagging I have come across recently.

Last December, I launched the new framework for development and innovation in the public service, Our Public Service 2020.  There has been much progress since the first reform programme was started in 2011, in areas including procurement, shared services and Civil Service renewal, and public service reform continues to play a key role in our development.  A recent report by the Institute of Public Administration includes many positive findings.  For example, our public administration comes first in the EU28 for being the most professional and least politicised and we comes sixth in the EU28 for the quality of public administration.  These results are very encouraging and provide a strong foundation for the next phase of reform set out in Our Public Service 2020.<\/p><p>How does this reform framework differ from what has gone before?  There is a greater emphasis on the outcomes of reforms and improving the linkages between reform and expenditure.  There is also a stronger emphasis on innovation and on working collaboratively and working better across all of Government.  There is also a strengthened model of governance, including a public service leadership board, and emphasis on the importance of digital delivery and data in achieving greater efficiency.  These are all important themes and I will return to each of them in turn.<\/p><p>The framework itself is built on three pillars.  These are delivering for our public, which includes, for example, the continued development of digital services under the public service ICT strategy to deliver improved public services, innovating for our future to support and encourage new thinking and developing our people and organisations to improve strategic human resource management to ensure the right mix of skills and tools are there to support public servants.  In addition to reflecting the lessons from previous reform initiatives, these pillars were developed following an intense period of engagement with the public and public servants themselves as, ultimately, it is they who will be responsible for putting the actions in this framework into practice.<\/p><p>How we will ensure we are measuring our efforts and the impact they are having on the public and the country is a key question that was on our minds when designing the strategy document.  We listened to the advice of the OECD on outcomes and we are moving the focus of reform to achieving outcomes, in line with its advice and best practice internationally.  The approach we have taken is first to identify six high level outcomes, which we are aiming to achieve in the public service in the long run.  These outcomes include increased customer satisfaction, increased public trust, greater use of digital tools, better Government effectiveness, quality of public services and greater employee engagement.  We are going to make better use of evidence and evaluation in how we assess the performance of the framework.  This will help us to be more effective and efficient and to achieve our overall goal of delivering better outcomes for the public.  Our vision for the future of the public service is one that is anchored in outcomes for our people and our country.  With this goal in mind, the Department recently established a reform evaluation unit to focus on monitoring and evaluating the outcomes of reform as well as creating greater links between expenditure and reform.<\/p><p>One element of Our Public Service 2020 that I would like to highlight is the need to foster a culture of innovation across the public service.  A great example of this is Service RePublic, Ireland&rsquo;s first public service design centre, which is a collaboration between Cork County Council and Cork Institute of Technology.  Our public service has always been innovative in responding to issues that face our citizens.  We want to build on that wealth of existing experience but also to draw out new innovations by creating a network of innovators across the public service to connect the right people.  Globally, innovation in the public sector is becoming increasingly important as a means of meeting new challenges.  It is my view that if we act in an innovative way we can develop different solutions that are both cost effective and citizen-centred.  Public service organisations need new ways of thinking, new ways of interacting with citizens, and new ways of gathering and using data to keep up with a rapidly changing <i>status quo<\/i>.  Our Public Service 2020 will be key in achieving this.  Looking to the future, we are going to work with stakeholders nationally and internationally to establish a bespoke strategy to better embed innovation in the Irish public service.<\/p><p>It is sometimes easy to forget how the public service plays a role in many aspects of our everyday lives.  This is why improving them remains so important.  We compare very well internationally in digital services, but moving more services online is a goal of Our Public Service 2020.  This will be achieved under the ICT strategy.  We also recognise that not all services should be digital and that not everyone can easily access digital services.  This leads me to an important point, which is that we need to be better at listening to the public and understanding their needs to be able to deliver real and targeted service improvements.  To do this we need to communicate more simply with the public.  A good example for others to follow is HSELive, a new health information service launched in September. <\/p><p>To really make change happen we need to work together.  We need to be able to respond to challenges.  The local community and development committees, for example, provide for collaborative and co-ordinated responses to local issues throughout the country.  This strategy aims to deepen this collaboration.  This is something that will have an effect on the success of many of our shared strategies, which Our Public Service 2020 sits alongside.<\/p><p>There are huge opportunities to do more with data.  As the committee may be aware, we are already leaders in the area of open data.  Recently, we achieved first place in the European Commission&rsquo;s open data maturity assessment for 2017.  This is a great result, but we need to encourage all public bodies to open up their data.  Open data creates opportunities to exploit data in new and innovative ways, especially as more data becomes available.  It also helps us to achieve greater transparency and accountability in Government.  We want to make better use of data.  This will support better decision-making and improve services and access to services.<\/p><p>I suggest all of this because we all take great pride in the work done by our public servants.  Their continuous development is very important for the delivery of the strategy.  To oversee all of this, we have developed and will launch a public service leadership board.  This will include Secretary General or CEO participation from across the Civil Service and a broad range of public service organisations.  I see this as being a really important forum for moving forward on public service reform.<\/p><p>I will now give the committee an update on legislation and where we stand on various matters.  The committee will recall that we are trying to progress the Public Sector Standards Bill and the data sharing and governance Bill.  Committee Stage of the Public Sector Standards Bill took place in April 2017 and the briefing requested by the committee was provided.  The Bill aims to significantly enhance the existing framework for identifying, disclosing and managing conflicts of interest and minimising corruption risks, to achieve a shift towards a more risk-based system of compliance.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan, is taking the Bill forward and he has had meetings with Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and local government representative groups on the issue.  In light of the public interest in implementing the Mahon tribunal recommendations, and the central role of this Bill, I ask that the Committee Stage of this Bill be completed promptly.<\/p><p> The data sharing and governance Bill is another priority.  We need to deliver more digital services and we need to ensure that public bodies share data in a manner that complies with the enhanced data protection regime under the forthcoming general data protection regulation.  The purpose of the Bill will be to promote and encourage data sharing between public bodies by providing a statutory framework for data sharing for legitimate and clearly specified purposes that are compliant with data protection law.  We also need to improve the protection of individual privacy rights by setting new governance standards for data sharing by public bodies.  Work is well advanced on drafting the Bill and I expect it to be published in the first quarter of this year.  I would appreciate the committee's support on that Bill.<\/p><p> In addition, real progress has been made in several areas of different legislation such as the open data initiative, freedom of information legislation, the introduction of the lobbying register and the system for the making of protected disclosures.  My Department provides support and guidance to assist the implementation of these measures.<\/p><p> The context in which we provide public services is becoming increasingly complex and challenging.  It is very important that we support better collaboration, innovation and joined-up approaches across the public service.  We have designed Our Public Service 2020 with this to the forefront of our minds.  Ireland has come a long way and we have seen a great change in our economy but the world is continuing to change and is doing so fast.  Today&rsquo;s uncertain and unpredictable global environment poses many challenges, but also opportunities, for Ireland.  This strategy will help our public service to be better able to prepare for this.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to make this presentation and I look forward to any questions and comments from the Chairman and the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018021300002#C00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518531000,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018021300002#D00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1518531000,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his team.  I apologise in advance as I must leave at some stage to go to a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.<\/p> <p>  I join with the Minister in paying tribute to the public service in all its guises.  I believe there have been huge changes in recent times under very difficult conditions.  Senator Conway-Walsh and I have seen at first hand the manner in which the service responded to the tragedy this time last year at Blacksod and the search operations for the Irish Coast Guard helicopter, R116.  The cross-collaboration between many different agencies made a very difficult situation a lot easier for the families.  That group was acknowledged this weekend at the Mayo awards but there has been huge improvement right across the service in very difficult situations.<\/p> <p>  I will now tease through a number of the issues within this document.  The Minister suffers from his party's tendency to be choosey in what he does and does not remember pre-2011.  There was considerable public service reform under way pre-2011 also.  The Minister speaks of developing our people and organisations as one of the three pillars.  How can we develop people and organisations when currently there are different pay rates for people within the public service who are doing the same job?  The Public Service Pay Commission is engaged in a process of addressing pay equality.  It is the one issue that is affecting morale and cohesion within the public service.  There needs to be a greater sense of urgency about the matter.<\/p> <p>  On human resource, HR, practices within the public service, action No. 12 in Our Public Service 2020 is to \"Embed strategic human resource management in the public service\".  Is the Minister happy that HR management is best practice within the public service currently and is most relevant to working lives and those who seek to work in the service in 2018 as opposed to another time?  Leaving the pay issues aside, have we a service with HR practices that are more responsive to people who may wish to take career breaks or travel breaks and so on?  How many vacancies exist within the public service at present and is there an area that gives concern to the Minister with regard to an inability to fill vacancies?<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to innovation a lot in his speech, but the reality is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is also the lead Department for procurement.  Innovation is irrelevant to people if they cannot access broadband.  Many of the public services that are offered, especially those such as Revenue's online service, are inaccessible if a person does not have broadband.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is pushing everybody towards online applications but a farmer working in agriculture is more than likely to not have broadband.  A dog's dinner has been made of the procurement process around broadband.  As the lead Department for procurement, does the Minister think it is appropriate that there is only one bidder for such a major project?  How will the Minister marry the ambition for innovation within the public service and public service users' inability to access those services online?<\/p> <p>  On the issues of bullying and harassment within the public service, I have recently submitted a series of parliamentary questions.  There are quite a number of claims in some Departments and very few in other Departments.  Is the Minister confident in the consistency of application of bullying and harassment policies in all levels of the Civil Service and the public service?  Is the Minister confident that the skills are there at line management level to manage this?  Given recent publicity around all sorts of allegations, does the Minister have any plans to change policies or refresh policies within the services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018021300002#D00300","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1518531000,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Calleary.

The first question was about differential pay rates.  The Deputy is aware that we have a process under way now principally between the teaching unions, the Department of Education and Skills and my Department on this matter.  Due to the agreement achieved between the Department of Education and Skills, my Department, the Teachers Union of Ireland and the Irish National Teachers Organisation, the current starting salary for a teacher is approximately &euro;34,500.  I am aware that on pay curves, there are outstanding matters between the teachers' unions and the two Departments I have mentioned, including my own.  Under the terms of the public service stability agreement, we are meeting those unions to see if there is a way of moving the matter forward.  Because he has as much experience of these matters as do I, the Deputy knows that one cannot move forward an issue around pay rates in one part of the public service and pretend that every other part of the public service will not expect the same change to happen for them.  While this issue is principally crystallised around teachers at present, any change we make in new entrants' pay rates or in salary curves will then be immediately required and demanded by every other part of our public service and Civil Service.  This is one of the challenges we have to work through in dealing with this matter.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was on the current HR practice within the Department.  It is my sense that we are making progress with it.  In the two years I have been involved in this work I have seen the accelerated professionalisation of the HR role within individual Departments.  We also have a chief HR officer located within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who works across the board with all of his or her counterparts in every other Department.  The progress we are making around mentoring and the mobility of roles has been enabled by the gradual upskilling of HR departments.  We have further work to do.  From engaging with the Public Appointments Service and the Public Service Pay Commission I am aware that one of the skill sets most in demand across our entire economy currently is for people who work in HR.  It is increasingly seen as being a very valuable part of any organisation, be it in the public or private sectors.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about vacancies in the public service.  I will come back to him with any information we have across the totality of the public service.  I do not have that information with me today.<\/p><p>My experience from dealing with this issue is that more of our difficulties tend to accumulate at the retention end than they sometimes do at the recruitment end.  The retention difficulties we have tend to vary by grade and part of the country.  I will ensure we come back to the Deputy if we have any vacancy data to share.<\/p><p> On the Deputy's fourth question on innovation and broadband, the changes that have now happened with the number of participants in the broadband process are a consequence of many occurrences, one which has been that we have had a very demanding and rigorous process.  I am very confident that while we have one participant, the final decision on a business case and the management of risk between the State and a participant will protect the interests of our taxpayers, while also recognising the fact that broadband is seen in virtually the same way as any utility.  People look at it in the same way they look at electricity or water and expect to have much the same connectivity as cities and other areas with a high level of broadband.<\/p><p> On bullying and harassment, the Deputy is right and we have shared the information in reply to parliamentary questions already.  As to whether I believe there are any outliers as to how HR practice has been implemented, I do not.  From attending dignity-at-work initiatives and from engaging in the seminars that led to the publication of our public service 2020 plan, I got a real sense that dignity at work and looking after employees is being taken as seriously as one would expect.  As is the case with any workplace, the moment one assumes one is doing a great job in this area, one takes a step back.  Anybody who is subject to any form of harassment, whether it is bullying or sexual harassment, is already in a vulnerable place in the workforce.  As employers, we must always challenge ourselves to see whether we are reaching out to them well enough.  As such, while I believe we are doing what the Deputy would want us to do, we are never complacent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018021300002#D00400","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518531000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>As all members have offered, I ask the committee to be conscious of the time.

There were some 95 heads of the Bill and there are 162 sections.  The Minister has known all along about the May deadline.  As such, why is this now being pushed through at such a rate and without people having sufficient time to scrutinise it?  I am afraid that public servants will be left to deal with all of this.  Even experts around the Bill have said it is not right and that there is a lot more to be done.  There is a bizarre set of exemptions and exclusions from the processing of special categories of personal data.  They have said the Bill is unworkable.  I am afraid that we are giving the public service unworkable legislation and expecting it to work with that.  I am also concerned with the level of privatisation within the public service and what that implies for the amount of personal information foreign private companies will have on people.

Any information that has been shared or stored, regardless of whether it is by an international company, is subject to Irish law regarding how that information is looked after.

For instance, the waiting period for the processing of applications for Garda e-vetting has reduced from five months to 80% of them being processed in fewer than five days.  The service has been streamlined and there are fewer steps involved.  The initiative around SOLAS and the education and training boards about centralising the availability of courses has been positive.  There is the potential to improve services in other areas but the implementation process is lacking somewhat.  An issue has arisen in our constituency offices concerning the submission of applications for medical card renewals online.  Some people are not familiar with using that system.  Also, the uploading of additional information can only be done if one has access to a scanner and can scan the documents, which is creating some difficulty for people and it is also creating delays.  Many more people are coming into our constituency offices asking us to submit their documentation, which is fine, but there are other people who may not do that and may be falling between the cracks.<\/p> <p>  We have also experienced some difficulty with the system introduced for the choice-based letting scheme.  It is a good scheme and offers much more transparency to people in terms of the bid for a particular house.  The difficulty relates to people who do not have access to that type of technology.  The local authorities are providing space within their own offices for people to go in and bid but we find many people are not using it because they are not familiar with the system and the supports in place.  We have also found that some people do not have the necessary literacy skills to access the programme.  There are positives with the changes but there are also potential pitfalls.  The Minister spoke about listening to people and I wonder how that process works.  How is he getting feedback on all these processes to see which ones are working very well and which ones have the potential to work very well but need some tweaking?  Will he comment on that aspect?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018021300002#F00300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1518531000,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I agree with what the Deputy said.  It was good of him to acknowledge the fact that we have managed in recent years to make better use of digital technology in the number of different ways we provide public services.

From my experience of representing a constituency that relies a great deal on the services the Deputy referenced, I am aware we need to make sure we do not get to a point where digital exclusion would overlay all the other forms of exclusion people experience.   I do not want to see that happen.  As to how we will address that, I made reference to the fact that we are convening a public service leadership forum.  The Civil Service group we have comprises representatives of Departments very much involved in running the day to day business of government such as what happens in Cabinet, how we deal with the implementation of the programme for Government and so on.  However, the public service leadership group will consist of representatives of Departments and local authorities and senior leadership in the HSE and in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I would like to use a body like that one to share best practice on where we are doing well digitally and where we are not doing well and basically to make sure different parts of Government talk to each other about this.

On the Public Sector Standards Bill, I understand Deputy Dara Calleary has been working very well with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, on it.  I want to put on record some of the discussions we have had here with both the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, who felt the initial reporting requirements under the legislation were very onerous for people who are basically on part-time salaries.  The Minister will know about this as he deals with councillors in his area, across the country and in his party all the time.  It is very onerous for people who are effectively one-person operations dealing with all their own emails to be  regarded as the equivalent of Cabinet Ministers in terms of the reporting requirements and what they can do and cannot do.  Many people serving on local authorities might happen to be an auctioneer, chartered engineer, surveyor or planner and that could very much heavily impinge.  They should be transparent and upfront and should not be in any way abusing anything they are doing, but sometimes there may be unintended consequences.  One of the requirements is that one must disclose all one's cash balances.  If one has shares in a business that is related to what one is doing or if one owns land in one's local authority area, that is relevant, but I am not sure a person's cash balance in a bank, whether it be &euro;50, &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000, is relevant to their decision making.  Revenue has access to do that anyway, therefore, I am not sure why everyone has to report all their cash balances to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  That requirement may have been removed but I would have a concern about it.<\/p><p>With regard to data sharing, the public services card is a very good card.  Many people I know use it and use it very happily.  It has a huge amount of merit but perhaps the way it was rolled out and its implementation led people to be a bit more suspicious about data sharing than they otherwise might have been.  We need to be careful when we are trying to bring people with us and I mean that right across the political spectrum.  Most of us embrace technology as much as we can and as far as we are able to.  I think the Minister might have been Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport when the Leap card was introduced.  Things like the Leap card have been great.  Revenue Online is excellent while Passport Online is very good but, equally, there are other elements of technology that frighten people in terms of how they are being monitored and tracked and we need to allay their fears as best we can.  It is not about bullying people.  There may have been a better way of approaching it than suggesting that a person cannot have something if they do not do something.  <\/p><p> I am supportive of the digital agenda and technology but, as Deputy Calleary and the Minister said, we need to look at broadband as if it was running water or electricity.  I remember being the chair of the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly, which was under the Minister's remit.  Certainly the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was in charge of regional assemblies at one stage.  There were 53 councillors in the room from Fingal to Clare and further south.  Half of the room said nothing because they had broadband while the other half had no broadband.  They were driving up to hotels or coffee shops where they could get free Wi-Fi to pay a bill or download their emails.  If we are asking people to embrace technology, we must give them the tools to actually harness that technology.  <\/p><p> In respect of public sector reform, the public sector is obviously much bigger than the Civil Service and we acknowledge that.  I speak as somebody who has been chairman of a school board for nine years and a member of school boards for 15 years in south Dublin, an area with which the Minister would not be very familiar.  There is a crisis in staff recruitment but there is also a crisis in staff retention, particularly in Dublin.  I am sure the Minister is aware of it in his own constituency.  If somebody who gets a job in Dublin all of a sudden realises that the same job is available down home in Limerick, Offaly, Longford or somewhere else where property prices are much more affordable, they will be gone.  It is even more difficult to retain staff such as qualified teachers in Dublin than anywhere else in the country because of property prices, regardless of whether they involve rent or trying to get a mortgage.  I am not suggesting a London weighting concept but we do need to look at the fact that a primary school teacher in a rural area and a primary school teacher in south Dublin are getting the same money but their disposable income at the end of the week or month is hugely different.  That needs to be acknowledged.  <\/p><p> Equally, while Luas is not a public service in one way, it is effectively a public piece of infrastructure being run by a company under contract to the State.  The Minister knows that the Luas is not working the way it used to work.  It is massively under pressure.  I know people who were trying to get on in Dundrum who are now going out as far as Sandyford to cross the tracks and come back in.  I know of one person who sat and watched six trams go past and eventually got on the seventh one where it was like a train in Japan with people were stuffing passengers in.  It is important that we acknowledge good public sector reform but, equally, we need to make sure we have the capacity to deal with things.  People are willing to embrace public transport.  It is there and it is excellent but at peak times and even at off-peak times at the moment, it is not delivering the way it used to deliver and we need to acknowledge that in this module.  <\/p><p> We also need to look at service delivery.  Restaurants, coffee shops and cinemas will open when people want to be there.  Perhaps local authorities should stay open one evening a week to allow people who are at work to access services.  Recycling centres are open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day but they are not open past 4 p.m. so people at work might get to them at the weekend if they are lucky.  We need to embrace those kind of concepts as well in terms of offering a quality of service to people.  <\/p><p> I know our planning system is not the Minister's responsibility but, ultimately, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, he is looking at the entire public service.  There are excellent planners and excellent people who are trying to work with very outdated and unwieldy legislation.  If we are trying to deliver houses and pieces of infrastructure, we need to look at our planning system and make it easier for people to apply or object but we need to expedite the decision-making process far more quickly regardless of the outcome.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018021300002#F00700","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518531000,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I will put the Senator's points into different groups.  With regard to his concerns about the obligations the legislation will impose on local authority members, I know the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, met a number of Senators about the matter and has also met the local authority representative bodies.  He is listening to what they have said and we are going to see whether there is any way we can meet the needs that have been identified.  With regard to what I want to see happen in local government and in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, we need a composition of people working in our political system that reflects our economy.  We need people in local authority chambers who pay rates and we need people in the D&aacute;il and Seanad who have worked in the private sector.  If we get the balance wrong, particularly at local authority level, between the requirements people must meet and the time available to them to do it, it will be a further impediment to attracting new kinds of people into political life.  I heard of one local authority chamber recently, which I will not name in case I get the exact data wrong, of which it was said that one only member was a ratepayer.  That is a real concern for me.  We need to have a mixture of people in public life.<\/p> <p>  I hear what the Senator is saying about the public services card and as it has moved into heightened public awareness, I am certainly aware that we need to respond to those kind of concerns very visibly because the entire purpose of having this card is to get ourselves to a point soon where someone will only have to give their information to the State once and will then be able to access a set of different public services all at the same time.  People will really value that when it happens.  With regard to how we rolled it out, I guess if we had tried to roll it out in a different way, probably three million of them would not be in circulation now.  The card was rolled out in a way that up to last summer, was quite orderly and of which people were supportive.  Since then, I certainly acknowledge that we must respond very publicly to the different issues that have been raised because I want to see those cards become an accepted part of how people access public services just like Leap cards, which have been a great innovation.  <\/p> <p>  I touched on broadband when I responded to Deputy Calleary.  With regard to teachers, Senator Horkan is right to say that we will not be able to bring in a form of allowance for people on the basis of where they work.  We are carrying out work with the Public Service Pay Commission with regard to recruitment and retention in our health service.  It will be interesting to see what data that yields in terms of dealing with the point raised by the Senator because if it was to apply to teachers, it would also be pretty likely to apply to people working in our public services in health.  <\/p> <p>  Being able to get the Luas is quite a novel and recent experience for me because it has now arrived in my part of Dublin.  I know that during the next while, we will need to provide longer Luas carriages and more carriages.  It is the benefit and consequence of more than 2 million people being back in work but on the other hand, we do not want people standing for an entire 30-minute journey given our investment in Luas; we clearly want it to be a better experience for people and I am aware of that.  <\/p> <p>  On the point the Senator made about local authorities, this is something I want to look at under the public service stability agreement now that the agreement has been ratified.  Our local authorities should be open for one night per week.  People should be able to go into them.  I know from talking to local councillors that one of the many reasons someone cannot be a local councillor while keeping a job is because all of the meetings happen during the day.  I remember how when I was a member of a local authority, and I had a very supportive employer, it still got to the point where I had to take holidays to go to meetings.  I could not have had a more supportive employer.  I am of the view that not only for people who rely on public services but also members, we should be able to get to a point where the offices are open for use by members one night per week.  In the parts of Dublin with which I am most familiar, the recycling centres are now open on a Saturday morning and the use of them has increased exponentially.  People just need one opportunity during the week.<\/p><p>If it cannot be night time, then a weekend slot should be available to be able access a service like that.

Some of that change has been forced on the organisations involved.  Accordingly, I agree with some of what the Minister said.  However, there is a significant amount with which I simply cannot agree.  For example, the Minister spoke about public services anchored in outcomes for our people.  If one looks at the outcomes for our people, I have to point the Minister to procurement, a debate which has gone on here for as long as I have been a Member of the House.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues regarding procurement is the ongoing complaint that small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, find themselves at a disadvantage because of the procurement process.  Even in the construction of houses, when companies go through the tendering process, they will point out there are few construction companies which can point to a turnover of &euro;8 million, &euro;2 million or &euro;10 million over the past several years because they were simply not in business.  In turn, this excludes many smaller companies.<\/p> <p>  This morning I discovered that Kilkenny County Council gave out a large contract to a contractor.  However, the contractor is paying a main subcontractor but all of the subcontractors to that main subcontractor are not being paid.  We will witness a significant amount of money being lost to the SMEs in that area.  I know we will never get to a perfect position but that is far from satisfactory.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the impact of what we do in the House on the people we represent, one need only look at the tracker mortgage issue.  Last week, we had to take the unusual step of writing to the Minister regarding Permanent TSB because of the manner in which it conducted itself at a committee meeting and the way in which it is treating its customers.  It was not my decision but one made by all members.  Permanent TSB is a State-owned bank in which this type of behaviour is ongoing and we are having little satisfaction with it.<\/p> <p>  The other issue relative to that is that vulture funds are now purchasing large blocks of commercial and residential properties.  The individuals involved have absolutely no protection.  The Minister might point to the protection that travels with the loan from the originating bank and so forth.  However, it does not happen that way.  Again, there was cross-party commentary that it is just shocking to see how the vulture funds are behaving.<\/p><p>What I was hoping in terms of reform - members probably share this - is that in some way the vulture funds and their representatives that are regulated entities would be forced by legislation to come before committees of this House, especially this committee, because of the fact that they are ruining the lives of people and giving them no chance whatsoever, having themselves got the opportunity to rebuild their balance sheets because the taxpayer forked out &euro;64 billion or some such amount in supports.  My question on this part is whether the Minister will bring sufficient pressure to bear on the banks in which we have ownership to ensure they do not sell to vulture funds and that where loans are owned by vulture funds at least the regulated entities would be forced to come before the committee of this House?  We have a report in draft form which we are sending to the Business Committee because we want all of this debated in the House and we are making arrangements for that to happen.  It is a cross-party initiative to bring some sort of fair play into a market where people are blackguarded left, right and centre and they are looking to us for the answers.<\/p><p> Recently we passed legislation on water charges.  I understand the agreement was that the Comptroller and Auditor General would hereafter audit Irish Water.  Will we see such legislation come before us shortly?<\/p><p> A report was available on community banking.  The committee is setting out to bring about a meeting of stakeholders here, including the Sparkassen bank from Germany.  We will visit that organisation in due course.  We want to know when the report will be available and what the Government's view is on the report.<\/p><p> The Minister mentioned the Top Level Appointments Commission, TLAC, and the other group in terms of overseeing the ongoing improvements.  Is there any way he can tilt the balance in favour of independent oversight so that one gets people who are independent of Departments to look at matters?  Too often in this House I have seen organisations examine themselves.  They look internally so one does not get a clear, independent view.  The time has come within the Civil Service and the public service to have such oversight.<\/p><p> In terms of the provision of services directly to the people we represent, we cannot stand over what is happening in the Garda and the HSE.  Every time we ask about financial matters, in particular in those organisations, we are told that there are so many reporting systems rather than just one that they find it difficult to know what is happening.<\/p><p> We all saw on television the report that monitored maternity units in hospitals over five or ten years ago, yet it has taken us a significant amount of time to come to the point of publicly acknowledging it but not having a plan to deal with it.  That reflects badly on the management of our systems.  We have management within the HSE, the Prison Service and the Courts Service causing enormous pain for the people we represent.  Those areas should be prioritised.<\/p><p> Finally, I wish to touch on the question of bullying within the Civil Service and the public service and protected disclosures.  It is appalling how whistleblowers are treated within their organisations.  I am not talking specifically about Maurice McCabe.  I know many others.  I know people within the education sector that are out on sick leave because they could not take any more, having made a protected disclosure.  They are not offered the type of protection to which they are entitled under the legislation.  When a protected disclosure is examined it is examined internally, so it could be the case that the very same people that have inflicted the bullying and harassment on an individual forced to make a protected disclosure examines it.  As a result, the person is out of work and feels further isolated and vulnerable.  The nurses and garda&iacute; that are on the front line are amazing people.  They are the Band-Aid that keep the organisations together and there seems to be little or no reform that the relevant Ministers can press through the system of governance down to that level which would give them greater protection in their workplace and a greater ease in carrying out the amazing work that they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018021300002#H01500","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518531000,"counter":320,"content":"<p>On procurement, first, I believe anybody who wins a contract through the public procurement process should do so according to terms and conditions that enable people who work for them, either directly or indirectly, to be paid, and to be paid in accordance with the law in terms of the minimum wage and protecting people in the workplace.  For any contract that is awarded on that basis I would expect that the people who do the work would get paid for it.<\/p> <p>  Across the period since we have tracked the savings that we have made in procurement, which is for the four years up to the end of 2016, we have made savings of approximately &euro;300 million.  You are right to say, Chairman, that it has resulted in individual companies having to be part of consortia to win tenders.  But, for example, if in relation to construction we are trying to lower the price of housing, then it does mean that we will be asking companies to come together to pool their expertise and work together in order to try to achieve pricing that ultimately might make those homes more affordable.<\/p> <p>  On banking, as you know, Chairman, I do not have the ability to intervene, legally, into whether any bank decides to sell a loan book or not.  I will have to check the legal status of requiring private companies to come before the Oireachtas.  I hope that anybody who is invited to come before an Oireachtas committee would do so but I am not sure what the legal foundations are to allow that to be an invitation one cannot turn down, apart from the relationship that exists between the Committee of Public Accounts and public bodies.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General, I am not aware if legal change is required to allow that office to oversee the work of Irish Water.

Benefacts is a not-for-profit organisation established in 2014.  Its objective is to transform the transparency of Ireland&rsquo;s not-for-profit sector.  I am the chairman of the board and have been for approximately one year.  The board has five other non-executive directors.  All the board members serve in a voluntary capacity.  The board comprises people with high levels of expertise in the work of non-profit organisations and in public communications, financial reporting, law and philanthropy.  Benefacts has a professional staff of 15 reporting to the managing director, Ms Patricia Quinn, who is here with me and will talk to the committee about our work in much more detail.<\/p> <p>  Benefacts came into being thanks to the vision of Ms Quinn, as founder, but also thanks to a funding partnership between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Atlantic Philanthropies and The Ireland Funds.

We are both very happy to have a discussion and answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018021300002#K01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518531000,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Benefacts is best known to the general public for its free, searchable website, which has listings for every non-profit organisation that is registered with a national authority, be it the Companies Registration Office, CRO, Revenue, the Department of Education and Skills, the Registrar of Friendly, Industrial and Provident Societies, the Charities Regulatory Authority or others.<\/p> <p>  We follow international precedents in defining non-profits as those organisations that are not part of Government or the private sector.  This includes charities, of course, but also tens of thousands of other non-profits as well.  Like any other member of the public, we access the data on these entities from the datasets made available by regulators or registrars.  We are able to do this thanks to the open data regulations which the Minister spoke to the committee about a few minutes ago and which have been so energetically promoted in Ireland in recent years.  This means that as long as there is no particular reason for data held by public authorities to be kept private, it should be made public and in a highly accessible way.<\/p> <p>  We clean the data which we source from these different public regulatory bodies and add value in a number of ways.  In the first instance we clean the data and match up the different numbers and identities, trading names and regulatory features of all non-profits so that they are merged into a single file.  We socialise the data, meaning we make it much more readily accessible than would otherwise be the case.  For example, a member of the public has to pay the CRO an administrative fee each time he or she wants to access company records.  We digitise it, which involves a large manual effort, because we extract governance and financial data from paper files, including the financial statements of more than 9,000 companies, unions, friendly societies and political parties.  This makes the data much more readily accessible than would otherwise be the case.  We augment the data with address information where we can find it, including Eircodes, but also the address of an organisation on the Internet or its URL.  We classify it using a classification standard with 54 sub-categories, which makes the data more easily understood for people interested in those particular sub-sectors.<\/p><p>This categorisation is derived from an international standard which is also used by the UN and EUROSTAT.  <br\/><br\/>We assign a unique identifier to every organisation.  This is very much in keeping with best current thinking in statistical planning, because it means that organisations can be recognised using this single number even if they have a variety of names or identities, or if they use names in both Irish and English.  Having one number keyed against all of its other numbers or identifiers means that stakeholders, whether funders, volunteers, beneficiaries or policy maker, have a clear line of sight and are able to validate an organisation&rsquo;s identity for the first time.  <br\/><br\/>Finally, the value that we add is to publish the information freely in a variety of formats and platforms.  The most basic dataset for 20,000 non-profit organisations appears on the Government&rsquo;s open data portal, <i>data.gov.ie.  <\/i>We publish it in machine-readable form and it is updated daily.  This means that information about the body of non-profit organisations which make up civil society organisations in Ireland is accessible by people all over the world.  Indeed, it is used by people from outside Ireland as well as from within.  We also publish a free public website, , where thousands of people access the data on these organisations every month, for a variety of purposes.  This data includes, for the first time, a source where anybody can go to find information about the sources of grant income or fee income from Government.  People can now go to a free site and discover what the balance or mix of funding from various sources is.  This is information that is already in the public domain but is not readily accessible.  <br\/><br\/>There are other users of our data and our information and web services.  Last year we built the online register of charities for the Charities Regulatory Authority, which can be viewed on its website, and we have facilitated the regulator in making the accounts of incorporated charities available to the public, which was not possible previously.  We provide a quarterly data feed to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which it draws on in making Ireland&rsquo;s statutory returns to EUROSTAT.  We provided a large body of data to support a research project by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, as well as extensive data files and supports to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Charities Regulatory Authority to assist them in their statutory functions.  Already this year we have provided various data files on request to a major charity, an employee giving scheme in a large commercial organisation, a charities representative organisation and to the Housing Agency.  We have also commenced work on data research projects with the Departments of Justice and Equality and The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We are in discussions with other Departments as well.<br\/><br\/>The Minister mentioned that he had launched our first annual sector analysis report last year, and I am very pleased that he has agreed to launch our second report in April.  This is a kind of annual rendering of account for the entire sector, and gives the public an idea of the form and structure of civil society organisations in this country, and the scope of their contribution to our society.  Our report describes the scale of turnover, which amounts to almost &euro;11 billion, employment in the sector, amounting to 150,000 people, the extent of Government funding, amounting to &euro;5.3 billion or about 8% of current Exchequer spending, the pattern of higher remuneration in the sector, which is very significantly lower than that enjoyed by people working in other sectors, contrary to popular opinion on the subject, and the profile of philanthropic support, which we know very little about in this country.  <br\/><br\/>I want to talk briefly about the power of full population data, because most of the information that has been gathered until now about the work of this sector comes from survey information, in other words partial, occasional surveys which are undertaken from time to time, which are expensive and which tend not to be comparable with each other.  By gathering data year on year and promoting better disclosure habits on the part of non-profit organisations and public bodies alike, and continually seeking new sources of public data, we are building an unprecedented knowledge infrastructure to support research and policy making and decision making within this sector.  <br\/><br\/>Last year, with the active co-operation of a range of partners, including more than 70 participants in the HSE alone, we piloted a new service for decision makers called Benefacts Analytics.  This prototype service provides detailed governance, compliance and risk analysis information structured in bespoke portfolios and derived from the audited financial statements of almost 10,000 non-profit organisations.  It allows registered users to see a body of sensitive information &ndash; which of course is already accessible, one by one, in paper format &ndash; presented in a digital format that allows non-specialists to interpret comparative and historical trend data, and helps them to identify lead indicators of certain kinds of financial or governance risk.  It has many other benefits as well.<br\/><br\/>In the future we plan to roll out Benefacts Analytics in partnership with public and philanthropic partners.  We believe it has the potential not just to reduce uncertainty and risk, but ultimately to help streamline non-profit organisations' engagement with their Government funders.  Our contention is that the cost of doing business with Government, in terms of duplication of administrative effort alone, is one of the biggest avoidable overheads for the sector.  <br\/><br\/>We are very excited about the potential for local data derived from the published registers of public participation networks to augment the database of Irish non-profit organisations we have created.  Potentially, the input of additional data about local societies, clubs and associations might double the size of the database to 40,000 organisations, or perhaps more.  This year we intend to incorporate the financial records of unincorporated charities, including many religious bodies, as soon as legal obstacles have been resolved by the Charities Regulatory Authority.  We are planning to add a much smaller group of civil society organisations, namely political parties, to the dataset, with the co-operation of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and the Standards in Public Office Commission, which last year made this set of financial statements publicly available for the first time.  We plan to release a new edition of the website, <i>benefacts.ie<\/i>, in the summer, responding to user feedback and helping many more people to exploit the benefits of an evidence base to support decisions about, and understanding of, Ireland&rsquo;s civil society organisations.  <br\/><br\/>I thank the committee, and we welcome any questions members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018021300002#K01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518531000,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I know from some of today's media coverage that Benefacts has raised the fact that charities are not publishing their financial information in full.  The Companies Act 2014 made it possible for charities to produce abridged accounts, and it is true that most of them do that instead of publish full accounts.  This approach may be encouraged by accountants, and if charities legally do not have to publish full accounts is it the case that accountants are advising them to publish abridged accounts?  It is difficult to imagine that any organisation would go against the advice of its accountants.  Can the witnesses address that issue?  The Charities Regulatory Authority is currently developing a financial reporting standard for charities, and we are aware that it will more than likely require all charities which are subject to audit to produce and publish non-abridged accounts.  Is it the case that, while these financial reporting standards do not currently apply to the unincorporated charities, there is a provision contained within the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013 which would close that loophole?  I would appreciate the witnesses' viewpoint on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018021300002#L00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518531000,"counter":341,"content":"<p>The Senator is correct to say that the provisions of the Companies Act 2014 changed the terms under which companies limited by guarantee previously were obliged to publish their financial statements in full.  This was because they were deemed to be public companies under the old Companies Act.  That changed, and as the Senator said, the companies, charities and non-profit organisations were being advised that, for the first time, they were free to avail of the same reporting thresholds as private companies.  Many have chosen to do so.<\/p><p>The last time we checked, this month, the number was 1,362 charities.  That is in the order of 40% of registered charities.  Let us consider the profile of these organisations.  Many of them are smaller charities.  Nonetheless, they have chosen to withhold information from the public, even though many of them are organisations which receive public funding.<br\/><br\/>There is an irony for all of these organisations.  I will come to the question of the Charities Regulator.  The provisions of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's circular that govern the way in which the Government requires grant recipients to account for funds are highly specific on what should be included in the financial statements.  The organisations have borne the expense of having an audit prepared.  That is unavoidable as it provides all of the information one would expect to see in a full set of audited financial statements.  That is what goes to the members of the company and it is for them to decide whether to file an abridged set with the Companies Registration Office.  My understanding is that if only one member of the company disagrees, the accounts have to be submitted to the Companies Registration Office in full.  However, if there is unanimity on the abridged accounts being filed in public, that is what happens.<br\/><br\/>Benefacts is like any member of the public.  We have no power, other than the power of influence.  That is why we seek to encourage charities and non-profit organisations to adopt the highest standards of disclosure in their own self-interests.<br\/><br\/>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh is correct to say the Charities Act, as it stands, exempts charities that are companies from filing financial statements with the Charities Regulator which has amending regulation in hand to change that situation.  It is surely anomalous that charities are allowed to withhold this information without breaking the law.  I emphasise that no one is suggesting they are doing anything that is not entirely legal, but the abridgement does not save them any money.  A full audit has to be prepared and the abridgement happens <i>post hoc<\/i>.  Our understanding anecdotally is that because of the requirements on public funders to get this information to charities, frequently charities file abridged accounts with the Companies Registration Office, which is where members of the public can read them, but file the full set with their funders, as they are required to under the provisions of the circular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018021300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518531000,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I will not ask any more questions for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018021300002#M00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1518531000,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I was listening to the commentary.

It is remarkable that sometimes people would say there are too many charities in Ireland.  By international comparative standards, when one looks at international statistical comparisons, the number of volunteer organisations that we account for is very low.  This is because other European countries typically account for the small associations and clubs and the organisations that provide all kinds of immeasurable benefits to people in local communities; what used to be called social capital.  These are not actually counted statistically when we think about the way we organise our life in Ireland.  This is one of the things Benefacts hopes to contribute; to provide a single extensive database that provides a better understanding for people making decisions about where to live, about how to educate their children, about recreational matters and about where they want to put their voluntary effort and their money.  There are many ways in which life is organised, which are encaptured and engrossed in the work of volunteer organisations that are not well understood.  At the minimum this is what we would set out to do.  Obviously there are transactional services we can provide and we have spoken about some of these today but I would not want to let the opportunity pass without saying that it is not all about the cost of these organisations or the funding that is provided to them.  It is about the changes they make to the quality of our lives and the quality of our society.

I am pleased to present to the committee for its consideration the draft Sectoral Employment Order (Mechanical Engineering Building Services Contracting Sector) 2018.  The draft ministerial order is being made under section 17 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015.  The intention is that the order will confirm the rates of pay, pension and sick pay entitlements for plumbers, pipe fitters and welders working in the mechanical engineering building services contracting sector.  <\/p> <p>  In January 2017, the TEEU and Unite trade union asked the Labour Court to examine the terms and conditions of plumbers, pipe fitters and welders, including supervisory grades and apprentices, engaged in the mechanical engineering building services contract sector.  The Labour Court advertised its intention to undertake the examination of the request and invited submissions from interested parties.  Four submissions were received from the Mechanical Engineering and Building Services Contractors' Association, TEEU, Unite and the trustees of the construction workers pension scheme.  All submissions were forwarded to be attached to the application before the Labour Court.  Subsequently, the Labour Court convened a hearing on the matter on 9 October 2017 and the parties made written submissions and were invited to make formal oral submissions.  <\/p> <p>  The Labour Court adjourned the hearing to facilitate the receipt of further submissions from the parties on matters that arose during the course of the hearing.  The Labour Court received a further joint submission from TEEU and from Unite and a further submission from the Mechanical Engineering and Building Services Contractors' Association.  The hearing was reconvened on 13 November 2017.<\/p> <p>  Following this, and being satisfied that making a recommendation would promote harmonious relations between workers and assist in the avoidance of industrial unrest in the mechanical engineering and building services contracting sector, the Labour Court submitted a recommendation to me on 20 December 2017.  I considered the recommendation in line with the terms of the 2015 Act and notified the Labour Court on 25 January that I was accepting the recommendation.  In making this recommendation the Labour Court must consider the factors set out in section 16(2) of the Act.  This includes the potential impact of the making of an order on levels of employment and unemployment in the identified economic sector, the potential impact on competitiveness in the economic sector concerned and that the sectoral employment order would be binding on all workers and employers in the economic sector concerned.<\/p> <p>  The 2015 Act requires the Minister within six weeks of receipt of the Labour Court recommendation to accept or reject the recommendation or to make an order to give legal effect to the terms of the recommendation.

A further increase of 2.5% will come into play on 1 March.  We must remember at all times that these rates were agreed between both parties.

The stated aims of the proposed directive are to ensure that national competition authorities have effective investigation, decision-making and enforcement tools, are able to impose effective deterrent fines, have a well-designed leniency programme in place which facilitates applying for leniency in multiple jurisdictions, and have sufficient resources to and can enforce the EU competition rules independently.  Empowering national competition authorities to be more effective enforcers will benefit all consumers and companies by boosting effective competition enforcement which is an essential building block for the creation of an open, competitive and innovative Internal Market.<\/p> <p>  The Department supports the overall aims of the proposal.  In the invitation to brief the committee, three specific issues were raised and I propose to deal with each of these in turn as they appeared in that invitation.  On the issue of the legislative changes that will be needed to give effect to the proposal, this will either be achieved by way of a statutory instrument under the European Communities Act 1972, as amended, or through primary legislation.  In this context, the nature of the final agreed text will be an important consideration as to which legislative avenue to pursue and the Department will be guided in this regard by the legal advice of the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  Some of the elements in the proposal are already catered for in current Irish legislation.  Therefore, it is likely that any legislative changes will focus on those elements not currently covered in Irish law.  These elements include allowing the imposition of fines on undertakings and associations of undertakings which have breached competition law, and providing for the establishment of a leniency programme and associated provisions allowing for immunity from fines for whistleblowers or a reduction in fines for those not qualifying for immunity.  The proposal also seeks to provide for co-operation between national administrative competition authorities.  This will give a legal standing on what already exists informally through the operation of the European Competition Network, and this will also be an element that needs to be expressly transposed into Irish law.<\/p> <p>  It should be noted that in giving effect to Regulation 1 of 2003 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 - now 101 - and 82  - now 102 - of the treaty, Ireland has designated the Courts Service, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Commission for Communications Regulation and the Director of Public Prosecutions as national competition authorities.  The negotiations on the directive have added to the original definitions for national competition authority and competition authority to include definitions for national administrative competition authority and national judicial competition authority to clarify which authority is being referred to in a given Article.  Following clarifications of the proposal at discussions at EU Council working group and Presidency amendments to the proposal, no constitutional issues appear to arise.  The situation surrounding administrative fines, Article 12, and requests for the enforcement of  decisions imposing fines and period penalty payments, Article 25, have been clarified.  This will be kept under review as the discussions develop, especially as new amendments to the proposal may emerge.<\/p> <p>  On the developments in the proposal to date, the proposal has been discussed at EU Council working group level over ten days up to the end of January 2018.  Ireland has been represented by officials from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, particularly Ms Reilly and Mr. Smith and, when available, officials from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission have also attended.<\/p><p>These discussions focused on further clarifications of the proposal, as well as explorations by the Presidency of possible amendments to the text in order to address member states' positions.  A revised Presidency compromise document was discussed at the Council working group meeting on 5 and 6 February.  Member states have proposed amendments to most articles and these are still being debated at the Council working group.  There are also consequent amendments to related recitals, which for the most part are seeking to clarify the intent of the text in the body of the directive.<\/p><p> As I indicated earlier, the proposal has now evolved to distinguish between national administrative and national judicial competition authorities.  Attempts are being made to align the proposal, where appropriate, with the damages actions directive and with the soft law measures set out in the European competition network, ECN, model leniency programme.  There are also amendments that give national administrative competition authorities the power to summons for interview, along with more prescribed details on the co-operation activities of national administrative competition authorities.  There is a proposal to insert a new article to cover the general principles governing requests for notification and for the enforcement of decisions imposing fines or penalty payments.  We are happy to go through these in more detail if the committee wishes.<\/p><p> No final compromise text has emerged to date on any of the articles and all member states are maintaining a general scrutiny reservation on the proposal. The incumbent Bulgarian Presidency is not currently scheduling any discussion on this issue at ministerial competitiveness Council in the first half of 2018.  It is understood that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, ECON, of the European Parliament will vote on adoption of its draft report on 27 February 2018.  A draft opinion was adopted unanimously at a meeting of the European Parliament&rsquo;s Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, IMCO, on 21 November 2017.<\/p><p> We would be happy to answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018021300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Grace","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518537600,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Grace and invite Ms Goggin to make her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018021300002#J00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518537600,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak about the proposal for a directive to empower competition authorities to be more effective enforcers.  I am joined by Patrick Kenny, who is a member of the CCPC, and &Uacute;na Butler, our director of legal services.  The CCPC&rsquo;s vision is for open and competitive markets in which consumers are protected and businesses actively compete.  To that end, we are currently active across a large number of sectors.  We have investigations ongoing in the motor insurance and ticketing sectors.  We are also carrying out studies in the waste and car finance sectors and a public consultation into contracts for long-term residential care for older people.<\/p> <p>  The proposed directive aims to ensure that national competition authorities have the appropriate tools to enforce EU competition law in a harmonised manner.  The CCPC needs to have the right enforcement tools to perform its statutory duties.  It is within this context that the CCPC strongly supports the proposed directive.  We are supporting our parent Department, where appropriate, as the text of the directive is considered by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. <\/p> <p>  Consumers and businesses benefit from competition through greater choice, lower prices and better quality goods and services.  Open and dynamic markets in which there are strong incentives to be more efficient and innovative help drive competitiveness and assist the country as a whole.  When competition laws are broken, not only do consumers suffer but so do other businesses that have lost out due to illegal practices.  Breaches of competition law can limit the ability of businesses to sell their products or services.  Such breaches can also increase the cost of doing business or restrict businesses from entering a new market. <\/p> <p>  Our role is to investigate potential criminal and non-criminal breaches of competition law across all sectors of the economy.  To date, we have investigated and challenged criminal breaches of the law in several sectors including cartels in home heating oil and the motor sector.  Last year, we secured Ireland&rsquo;s first bid-rigging conviction in contracts relating to commercial flooring.  We have worked well with our parent Department over the years to ensure that our powers and resources in this area are sufficient.  We also investigate other types of breaches of competition law such as information sharing including price signalling, restrictive agreements and abuse of dominance cases.  It is in this area that we believe our current powers limit our ability to detect, deter and take effective enforcement action.<\/p> <p>  At present, Ireland is one of a very small number of European countries that will only allow for a company to be fined if a court finds that there has been a criminal breach of competition law.  We use all of our powers and resources to investigate anti-competitive practices.  However, in contrast to our European counterparts, we are currently prevented from securing significant enforcement outcomes for non-criminal breaches.  If an investigation does not reach a criminal standard, at present the most the CCPC can achieve through the courts is to seek commitments from a business that it will cease the practice and obtain an injunction against it carrying out the same action again.  Financial sanctions cannot be imposed.  This, in our view, is not an effective deterrent to practices that harm consumers, businesses and taxpayers.  The proposed directive requires member states to ensure that non-criminal fines can be imposed for breaches of EU competition law.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is also the only country in the EU that cannot introduce a leniency programme.  This is a vital mechanism in the detection of competition law breaches, as it allows competition authorities to offer immunity or reductions in fines if a business comes forward with evidence of a breach of competition law.  The proposed directive also requires leniency programmes in all member states.  We very much welcome that.<\/p> <p>  From experience, we know that our enforcement powers need to provide a meaningful deterrent and that the threat of enforcement must be real and must go beyond reputational damage.  This directive presents an opportunity not only to bring Ireland&rsquo;s enforcement regime in line with the rest of Europe, but also to bring the CCPC in line with other Irish regulators, many of which have fining powers including appropriate appeal mechanisms.  Having the ability to impose financial penalties would enable us to deter, detect and investigate more white-collar breaches.  The CCPC is very strongly supportive of the proposed directive as it would ultimately mean that we can more effectively deliver our core objective of protecting Irish consumers and businesses, thereby ensuring that Ireland is a more open, attractive and competitive place to do business.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for inviting us to attend.  We are happy to take any questions and explain further our rationale for supporting the directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018021300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin"},{"type":"speech","time":1518537600,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I thank both witnesses for their presentations and for the time they put into preparing them.

I indicated in my statement that we do support the overall aims.  One of the issues at the outset, when this proposal came out, was that it was not clear how it would operate in practice.  The amendments since then to define \"national administrative competition authority\" and \"national judicial competition authority\" has clarified many of the issues.  The Commission itself admitted that it knew what it wanted to put down but that what appeared on paper might not have been a proper representation of that.  We are happy enough with how matters have moved on since then and we can support the clarifications.  Most of the issues we have had to date have been matters of clarification and trying to work out how the provisions would operate in practice.<\/p> <p>  For example, on the leniency programme, as my colleague, Ms Goggin, said, we do not have one in Ireland.  In many ways, we will be starting with a blank page.  Some other member states have problems because they have variants of leniency programmes and will have to adapt them.  We are in an enviable position in that light.  However, we want clarification of how it will actually work.  While it is easy, from a legalese point of view, to describe it and how it will work in the text of a directive, our colleagues in the CCPC would have to operate the leniency programme and their front-line experience would bring another perspective to what needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  Most of our interventions and interest so far have been on clarifications.

One of the issues that must be borne in mind is that, depending on how the final text is worded, we may have to revisit the wording within the current legislation to make sure that we are meeting the requirements.  The CCPC has the power to do that already.  Many of the issues in this proposal are already covered by Irish legislation.<\/p> <p>  For the information of the committee, one of the desiderata of the EU Commission in bringing forward the proposal is to try to stabilise and provide certainty to many of the competition authorities in some member states where there may be less overt statutory certainty regarding independence.  Some states which have recently acceded to the EU may have a different legal structure regarding their competition authorities compared to older member states.  For example, the independence of the CCPC is enshrined in Irish legislation.  In some member states independence is not enshrined, and the Commission is trying to ensure that those countries act to enshrine it.  There is something for everybody in the audience, if I may use Gay Byrne's phrase.  Every side will be able to take something from this proposal that is missing from their current armoury.  We have legislation available in some areas, while in other areas we will have to legislate.  The legislation we bring in, whether via statutory instruments or primary legislation, will fill those gaps.  Alternatively we can revisit the wording we have in existing legislation to make sure it is totally and utterly consistent.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018021300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Grace"},{"type":"speech","time":1518537600,"counter":573,"content":"<p>The powers to investigate will be strengthened.

It was the flooring cartel case that I mentioned earlier.  We had 41 witnesses lined up.  We had taken over 200 investigative actions; the investigation took around two years.  Taking a criminal case is already a very substantial enterprise.  We are looking at an alternative civil route where the burden of proof is on the basis of the balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt.  We believe the investigations themselves would not necessarily become more onerous.

People realise that this is a serious situation and that they need to have a compliance programme in place.

Many more investigations could be carried out more quickly.  I do not want to jump the gun on the Department because budgeting will ultimately be for it to decide upon, but we have spoken to our counterparts in small member states, for example in The Netherlands and Lithuania, and they do not foresee that this requires a huge increase in resources.  They are not talking about a doubling of resources but perhaps a small number of additional staff.  Similarly, other enforcement agencies such as ComReg, the Central Bank and the Broadcasting Authority have the power to impose fines at the moment.  They carry out investigations themselves and they observe due process, which of course we would have to do, and afford all appropriate rights to the defence.  They are able to do it in a way that is not massively onerous in terms of resources.

I am accompanied today by Mr. John Ward who has worked as a unit driver on a number of productions for more than 20 years, Mr. Thomas O'Meilly, who has worked as a facility driver for more than ten years and Mr. Liam Neville who has more than 20 years experience as a driver.  GMB is a general union operating in the UK and Ireland with more than 700,000 members in public and private sectors and in a variety of workplaces and environments.<br\/><br\/>GMB became involved with the film industry around two years ago.  Our membership is just below 300 and is mainly drawn from the construction, props and driving crews.<br\/><br\/>From the outset of our engagement with the workforce we became aware of issues of serious concern to any trade unionist.  These included bullying and harassment, mistreatment of workers, breaches of health and safety and unsafe working practices, which includes the length of the working day and week.  No one has a permanent contract, many have worked in the industry in excess of 20 years yet still have no provision to acquired rights or even a pension.<br\/><br\/>It became obvious that those who spoke out for their rights or the rights of their fellow workers were prejudicing their future employment and today we have representatives present who are not employed because they stood up for those entitlements.  We have numerous members who should today be working on sets, who have worked on previous jobs for many years without any disciplinary action or criticism of their working ethics or performance, not working because they have raised concerns or asked for their due entitlements.  <br\/><br\/>The precarious nature of the employment leaves open the path to the culture of &quot;keep your head down, do not object and do what you are told&quot;.  Your current job and future employment seems to be based solely on whether your face fits rather than your past employment record.  To challenge the <i>status quo <\/i>has led GMB activists and members among others effectively to being blackballed on current productions.  These members have asked for no more than respect for their limited rights, such as holiday pay, overtime pay or the correct rate for the job or they have raised genuine concerns on the treatment of workers.<br\/><br\/>Continuity of employment is an issue which can and must be resolved to secure the successful future of the industry and the rights of the crew members.  The use of the special purpose vehicle, SPV subsidiary company circumvents the production company's responsibility and relationship with those employed by it.  Gaps within production time should be considered as lay off periods and subject to normal legislation for continuity of employment, future employment rights or redundancy.  This is an industry which receives millions of euro annually in loans and grants and very generous section 481 incentives to create quality employment, yet we see no evidence of quality employment on the ground.<br\/><br\/>Heads of department are PAYE employees and often oversee the recruitment process of their relevant department.  We have seen this job given to a person who is also a contractor, supplying goods, services and manpower.  This has led to under employment of regular crew, reduction in the negotiated rates for the job and what can only be deemed as a massive conflict of interest where this person is effectively awarding contracts to themselves.  The subject of how and who will be employed is clearly open to abuse.<br\/><br\/>All employees and workers are committed to working at least a 55 hour week.  The Organisation of Working Time Act stipulates that an employer shall not permit an employee to work, in each period of seven days, more than an average of 48 hours, that is say an average of 48 hours calculated over a period that does not exceed four months.  Part 11 of the Act further stipulates the daily rest period.  An employee shall be entitled to a rest period of not less than 11 consecutive hours in each period of 24 hours during which he or she works for his or her employer.  This legislation is in place to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of those working.  GMB do not believe that the practice of working for periods in excess of the 48 hour week is healthy or safe, particularly for those employed to drive either heavy goods vehicles or passengers or for those engaged in manual labour or in control of machinery.  Drivers are regularly expected to work in excess of 12 hour days, breaching both mainstays of the legislation.  The fact that productions may last less than the maximum average of four months cannot form part of the argument that it is okay and necessary to work these hours and cannot be used when productions run beyond the four month period as seen on productions such as &quot;Vikings&quot;.  It is reasonable for the average to be calculated over the duration or intended duration of the production.<\/p><p>While this may prove difficult in certain circumstances, the calculation of the 11-hour rest period is simple and yet often ignored.  My colleagues here with me today have been employed as drivers and have first-hand experience of this on a regular basis.  The production managers, transport captains and heads of departments would have clear insight into the length of the working day planned ahead and would know that they are forcing people to work beyond the safe legal limit and without adequate rest periods.  Drivers raising objections and concerns are told they will not be re-employed or they will be let go if they refuse to work the hours.<\/p><p> In addition to the Organisation of Working Time Act, the RSA guidelines on the Road Transport Working Time Directive are also being breached.  This poses a major health and safety risk, not only to the drivers and their passengers but to other road users.  We accept that productions require a degree of flexibility and the need to maximise the working day, but there is no need to have one person working excessive hours when this work could effectively be split amongst more crew and lead to further job creation.  This is particularly relevant in the types of crews that we represent.<\/p><p> The presentation includes copies of the contracts that would be issued to prospective workers which, in addition to compelling them to a 55-hour week, commit them to exclusivity, etc.  Failure to agree to these terms would exclude someone from employment.  It also clearly demonstrates that the person taking up that position is under the control of another person who directs him as to how, when and where the work is carried out; receives a fixed hourly, weekly or monthly wage; cannot sub-contract the work; works set hours or a given number of hours per week; and receives expenses payments to cover subsistence and-or travel expenses.  All of these points are met by the individual and would clearly define him or her as an employee, yet many are operating as self-assessed or, indeed, self-employed, and this runs contrary to the Revenue guidelines.<\/p><p> GMB welcomes and supports employers who are investing in their workforce through proper training.  We welcome the practice of introducing trainees to the workplace where those trainees are valued, have recognised training pathways and prospective employment within the company.  We do not accept that the current practice of employing trainees within the film industry to simply meet the demands of the section 481 incentive is either satisfactory or appropriate.  In other jurisdictions, training within the sector is highly rewarding and leads to the proper skilling of the individual, offering him or her the potential to work in the industry and hence add to the secure future of the sector.  The industry currently cannot even track the progress of trainees or substantiate the type and quality of any supposed training.  It appears purely a mechanism to meet the requirements of section 481 and provide a cheaper source of labour on set.  We have experience of members who have been employed as trainees having had ten years or more experience within the industry in their particular field.  In one example, an individual had previously worked as a qualified props master for a number of years but when a new production - for a producer the individual had worked with - started up, the individual was advised that the only job available for the individual would be at a trainee rate.<\/p><p> The funding has created many problems within the industry.  We welcome the ongoing investment in the industry but we want to see the sector grow and prosper.  We call for serious consideration to be given to the reform of how funding is made going forward.  This reform must seek to eradicate abuse and waste of taxpayers' moneys.  At a minimum, proper scrutiny must take place to ensure that funded projects create clearly defined quality jobs and this must be rigorously monitored.<\/p><p> GMB has fought an uphill battle for the past few years trying to secure proper rights and working conditions for our members in the film industry.  We are committed to building and strengthening jobs in this sector but not at the expense of workers' rights.  Reform is needed and worker participation is paramount to ensure that the voices of those who have helped build the reputation of strong, talented and dedicated crews in Ireland and the Irish Film industry are heard.  There must be proper and ongoing dialogue with elected representatives from within the workforce - people with first-hand experience of the industry and its problems who can assist in reforming the industry for the better.  It is also essential that proper worker participation is secured on the Irish Film Board to represent workers.  While we have concentrated today on the many things that are wrong within the industry, we must ensure that proper recognition is paid to the many dedicated crew members who have contributed to date to make the sector a success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018021300002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Denise Walker","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518519600,"counter":600,"content":"<p>As nobody else from GMB is seeking to make a presentation, I call on John Arkins to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018021300002#E00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518519600,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Hopefully, the Chairman and members will have had an opportunity to read the submission we furnished to the committee on 31 January 2018.<\/p> <p>  My name is John Arkins.  I am general secretary of the Irish Film Workers Association.  I am accompanied by my colleague, John Purdy.  The association represents all grades of workers of the film industry, the majority being of the set craft grade.  In this summary of our position, we will address some of the key aspects of the previous presentations by the Irish Film Board, Screen Producers Ireland and SIPTU which are also dealt with in our submission.<\/p> <p>  The issues break down into three key categories &ndash; funding, employment and training.  On funding under section 481, the legislation follows at Appendix 3, page 150, of our substantive submission.  The committee will note that an authorisation shall not be given by the Minister under section 481(2) of the Act of 1997, that is, the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, in relation to a film unless: (a) the film is within a category of film set out in Schedule 2, and (b) the Minister is satisfied that the film will either or both: (i) act as an effective stimulus to film making in the State through amongst other things the provision of quality employment and training opportunities, and (ii) be of importance to the promotion, development, enhancement of the national culture including where applicable the Irish language.  Film making in Ireland, we would suggest, never meets the requirements of either subparagraphs (i) or (ii) of the Act.<\/p> <p>  SIPTU in its submission to the committee described employment in the film industry as \"precarious\".  The union further put forward a view that freelance contracts are favoured by some workers.  A union official went on to suggest that this issue could be addressed by engagement with the parent company.  It is our understanding that those on freelance contracts are not covered by the legislation and do not meet the definition of \"worker\" under any of the various pieces of employment legislation.  We believe it is an absurd proposition from the largest trade union in Ireland to engage in dialogue with the producer company which is the recipient of section 481 funding in respect of \"precarious\" employment or outsourcing key functions.<\/p> <p>  We, film workers, are engaged on fixed-purpose contracts.  This atypical working arrangement was recognised by the European social partners and resulted in major reform with the introduction of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003.  To put it in context, some 15 years after the introduction of the legislation, SIPTU is proposing to allow producer companies abdicate their responsibilities to both employment legislation and section 481 funding notwithstanding that SIPTU, in the first instance, by way of collective agreements, provided the mechanism to the producer companies to continue the abusive use of fixed-term contracts with what is known as a 50\/50 nomination system, that is, the union proposes a member for a job and management proposes the next member.  Apart from the constitutional issues which arise, there is a belief that we, as workers, were taxed by the union to go to work.<\/p> <p>  It has long been recognised that precarious or atypical employment undermines the stability and continuity of employment which is central to the funding legislation and, indeed, actively conspires against the effective functioning of the industry.<\/p> <p>  It was also most disappointing to hear Screen Producers Ireland confirm to the committee what it has been telling us for some time, that is, that its members do not employ anybody, yet they seek to engage with SIPTU to conclude collective agreements.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Collins of Screen Producers Ireland also informed the committee that producer companies are custodians of section 481.  The effect of being a custodian means that they are guardians and overseers of how the money is spent.  We would suggest they are doing a very bad job, as there is no return on the investment for the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Collins, speaking as a member of Screen Producers Ireland and as spokesperson for the producer company members, put forward an argument as to why they could not have crew.<\/p><p>He used an analogy that if he hired a director of photography who did not want to use his camera technician, then his technician would have no work and that would give the technician an unrealistic expectation.  The reality is that producer companies should have a crew and the director of photography should be directly employed as it is a grade that only has an application in the film industry.  It seems that Screen Producers Ireland seriously believe that this kind of glib comment is helpful to their members.  We respectfully suggest that when one is in a hole, one should stop digging.<\/p><p> Another issue was the submission to the committee, again by the union, in respect of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  The Act provides a maximum working week of 48 hours.  The averaging period is four months, 16 weeks, not 17, as stated by the union.  Producer companies are aware that if the duration of the production is less than the averaging periods, then the working week cannot in any circumstances exceed 48 hours.  There are no exemptions from the legislation for the film industry.  That this was acknowledged by the union came as a total shock to us as workers given that the union yet again provided the mechanism to the producer companies to breach the Act by way of a collective agreement.  This agreement is forced on workers by way of an appendix to our contracts. <\/p><p> Senior union officials have unfortunately overlooked the organisation of working time consolidated legislation which provides that if a collective agreement were to take workers outside of the legislation, it could only be concluded between a worker and his or her employer, the statutory consequences of opting out having been explained in plain language.  The legislation requires that such an agreement cannot be negotiated by representative bodies.  This should be obvious to both the union and Screen Producers Ireland as the provisions of employment legislation are individual rights of entitlement.<\/p><p> We know the union is familiar with this piece of legislation and we know it is familiar with the case law as set down by the European Court of Justice.  We know this because we have told it in correspondence on numerous occasions and we were ignored.  Senior officials did point out that workers who are in breach of the legislation could be penalised if they go to work on another production, which is correct, but neglected to say that the net effect of this breach is that workers may be prevented from taking another job and neither could they avail of unemployment assistance because they could not be available for work.<\/p><p> How are workers supposed to live if the union&rsquo;s collective agreement renders them unable to work?  It is truly shocking that a most senior official ignored their own role in this injustice by implementing the collective agreement that provides for a 50 hour, up to a 66 hour, week before overtime.  To further compound this injustice, this official has just entered into another such agreement with Troy Studios in Limerick again in the full knowledge that it is a breach of legislation.  There is no reason that film production cannot abide by the legislation and organise the work over 48 hours.<\/p><p> Our submission to the committee sets out the reality of the issues facing trainees.  The CEO and chairperson of the Irish Film Board along with the union acknowledged that there were issues with trainees and training, but nothing has been done to address these issues.  Our submission deals with the Crowe Horwath report.  We do not believe it complied with its terms of reference and feel it is not capable of being implemented.  There was another major report which was referred to by the CEO of the Irish Film Board going back as far as 1995, the STATCOM report, which proposed the registering and certification of trainees.  To date, none of its recommendations are in place.<\/p><p> Screen Training Ireland is, in our view, a major drain on the taxpayer and should be returned to SOLAS from where it came.<\/p><p>What is the value to taxpayers of throwing more money at Screen Training Ireland which has no QQI accreditation, does not engage with trainees, in an industry which determines its own training needs and which has fundamentally failed to implement the key recommendations of previous training reports?  Screen Training Ireland held an open day in Troy Studios in Limerick two years ago and promised jobs in the film industry yet there were no employers recruiting workers because there are no jobs.  The production which is now under way in Troy Studios has at least 80% of the crew having been brought in from New Zealand and the UK.  Irish crew must go down as local crew, even though they are not local.  Workers are brought here from abroad even though there are experienced film workers and trainees sitting at home.  Who is responsible for carrying out the labour market needs test which is required when hiring non-EEA workers?  Was such a test carried out? <\/p><p> In order to determine training needs or to devise training courses, two essential ingredients are fundamental to the process without which the process is irrelevant, namely an employer, an employee.  Section 10 of the fixed-term work legislation places an obligation on employers to provide access to training, so here we have two pieces of legislation placing obligations on employers under section 481 and the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003.  Therefore, the question arises as to what useful purpose can be served in granting Screen Training Ireland extra resources other than to give the impression that there is a career in film, when we know to our cost there is no such thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018021300002#F00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Arkins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518519600,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Arkins.  I will begin the questions myself.  Several groups have come before the committee on this sector.  It is an important sector for many reasons, economically, in the provision of work and because of the way in which it allows our country to tell its own story.  If we do not do that, there is a danger that we could become a cultural satellite of other, larger countries.<\/p> <p>  I have been examining this issue in the last six months.  There seem to be significant structural problems within the sector regarding how workers are treated.  This is the first time this committee has had before it non-actors working in the sector, people working in the clerical and other grades.  It is important to facilitate this.  <\/p> <p>  It is also important because the State gives considerable money to the sector, whether through loans or tax breaks.  Most sectors in Ireland will say that precarious working conditions tend towards the abuse of the rights of workers.  If there is an equal balance between worker and employer, one is likely to get fair treatment of the employee, but where there is a major imbalance, through precarious work, it leads to major difficulties.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask the witnesses their opinions on some ideas that I have had.  I think there should be a need for a member of the craft sectors to have a representative on the Irish Film Board, which is not now the case, and they should be nominated by the Minister so they can help steer future development.  The Irish Film Board can initiate an Irish film forum where all stakeholders can participate.  I have asked for this to happen and, to be fair, the Irish Film Board has said it would be interested in it.  What are the witnesses' views on this?<\/p> <p>  Bogus self-employment was raised.  Views differ on the prevalence of bogus self-employment in the sector.  There is a view that there is a need for some level of self-employment to allow flexibility and some people choose it themselves.  How prevalent do witnesses think is bogus self-employment in the sector?<\/p><p>Is it a case that 20% of people in sector are forced into bogus self-employment, or is it far more widespread than that?  We often hear there is good employment legislation in the State and regulatory bodies such as the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to oversee it.  Obviously, that is difficult to use if one is in a precarious working environment.  Are there examples of it being used where it has successfully underlined the concerns that witnesses have, or is it the case that it is nearly impossible to use those sectors?  The witnesses might address those four questions, whichever of them would like to choose one of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018021300002#H00200","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518519600,"counter":606,"content":"<p>On the Chairman's question on whether the mechanism of the WRC operates for this industry, during the past two years since the Irish Film Workers Association was formed as a registered trade union, we have taken cases to the WRC on a number of issues.

We believe the mechanism can work, and we will be back to the court this month again dealing with a case involving a beneficiary of section 481 funding who has said he is not the employer.

Where we have indicated in the D&aacute;il or got word about particular building sites on which people are being misclassified as self-employed, raids on those sites by the Scope section or Revenue have quite easily ascertained whether or not people were legitimately self-employed or whether they should in fact have been categorised as PAYE employees.

Every five years, a report is prepared by vested interest groups, usually at the time of a change of Government.  Now we have the Crowe Horwath report.  This is how they come to these figures.  This is what lay people need to hear, before deciding what they think .<\/p> <p>  The report claimed that crew are employed on a 38-hour week, and work 232 days per year.  It found that the 38-hour week average is derived from a 39-hour week average for manual workers and a 37-hour week for clerical professionals and technical workers.  The 232-day working year is derived as follows.  From 365 days, 104 are subtracted for weekends; a further nine for public holidays; 20 days are then subtracted for average annual leave.  This leaves 232 days. <\/p> <p>  We and our colleagues work for up to 70 or 80 hours a week.  That has been reported as a 38-hour week.  All of the hours worked have been counted.  That is how they arrive at an figure of 17,000 people in full-time jobs, working 1,365 hours a year.  They calculate the hours, not the people.  One can do that all one likes, but that is the reality.  Those were the findings of the Creative Capiral report from 2010.  That is their contention, not ours.<\/p> <p>  The report did avert to industrial relations issues, and following its publication the then Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, appointed a man named Mr. Peter Cassells to investigate industrial relations in Irish film.  He would not take the job, and it was given to a lovely man by the name of Mr. Finbarr Flood, whom I was privileged to meet.  He started his working life as a 14-year-old boy at the Guinness brewery.  Over his working career, he ended up becoming the managing director of the company.  He was also the chair of the Labour Court.  Mr. Flood said he could understand that after 27 years working in the industry, I am still humping timber.  The man on my right is still humping timber.  There is no career path, because no one takes responsibility.  No one has to.<\/p> <p>  That is how they came up with the figures, and that is how they come up with the figures today.

We cannot be treated any less favourably than full-time workers, but we have been excluded from our workplace by agreements.  The employers do not hire get union members; they get conscripts.

People have worked as stage hands since the 1700s, we have done it in this industry for 30 years in my own case, 37 and 42 years.  We cannot work for an employer that we have worked for in the past.  We have been excluded because we will not be part of a deception that we live locally.  No film crew lives locally.  Film crews come from all over the world.  We have people from New Zealand doing jobs that we have done.  We have been excluded; we have an agreement being brought in with an entity that cannot have such an agreement.  We have a crazy situation where people are being forced to accept a job as local crew.  If one does not, the person does not get the job.  Who are they trying to deceive?  Production companies come in here for three things - facilities, tax incentives and crew.  We have given five reports to the Government and four of these reports - from New York to New Zealand - have referred 50 times to access to a professional crew.  The Irish report, which was done by our industry, has a single line reference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018021300002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Arkins"},{"type":"speech","time":1518519600,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I would like to thank you all.

We are not part of the negotiations of any agreement.  That is a big issue for us because we are a small group of vulnerable people who are being treated badly every day.
