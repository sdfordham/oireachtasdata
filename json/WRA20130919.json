In accordance with this a prioritised programme of standardised training courses and complementary training modules is now being provided nationwide. Further specific courses have also been introduced to support the implementation of the Staff Supervision Policy 2013.<\/p><p>  Social workers are also assisted in their work by team leaders, principal social workers and other levels of management. There is also a range of guidance available to social workers, most recently the very comprehensive HSE Child Protection and Welfare Practice Handbook.<\/p><p>  An induction process involving full briefing and introduction of new staff under the supervision of line management has been introduced within the HSE. As well as the ongoing filling of replacement posts some 270 additional social worker posts have been filled as part of the implementation plan in response to the recommendations of the Ryan Report. <\/p><p>  In addition, the Health and Social Care Professionals Act, 2005 provided for the establishment of a Social Workers Registration Board, which was appointed in 2010.

Corporal punishment in schools is banned, and regulations for creches, foster care and residential settings address the use of appropriate discipline. Corporal punishment in the home, while not specifically outlawed, is governed by the provisions of section 246 of the Children Act, 2001. Section 246 makes it an offence to assault, ill-treat, neglect, abandon or expose a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child's health or seriously affect his or her wellbeing. A limited defence of reasonable chastisement exists in common law for parents and persons acting in loco parentis, but successful high profile prosecutions have been taken by the State under section 246 where parents are deemed to have used excessive or unreasonable force in disciplining children. <\/p><p>  My Department is reviewing the complex policy, legal and constitutional issues involved and is also currently engaged with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's Office to respond formally to the European Committee of Social Rights of the Council of Europe (CoE) in respect of matters raised through the committee around the banning of corporal punishment in all settings. The Government has been invited to make a submission to the Committee on the merit of the complaint and it is my intention to do so. In responding, the submission will allude to the significant progress which continues to be made in relation to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to protect the rights of children, including the proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to children&rsquo;s rights, the enactment of a suite of relevant DCYA and Justice legislation, and progress in relation to fundamental reform of the child protection services, the establishment of the Child and Family Agency, and drafting legislation in relation to putting Children First on a statutory basis. I will be keeping my Cabinet colleagues fully updated in this matter and will be discussing with them the full range of policy options available.<\/p><p>  There is a balance to be found between supporting parents in effective parenting, in particular, in use of non-violent forms of discipline, and the use of criminal law to impose criminal sanctions on parents who do not adhere to best practice in parenting. It is important to note that the general development of norms within Ireland and positive support and encouragement to parents has brought about a situation where physical punishment is increasingly avoided.  <\/p><p>  Recent research from the longitudinal study of children in Ireland shows that the great majority of parents do not use smacking as a form of discipline. The most frequently used method of discipline was &quot;discussing \/ explaining why the behaviour was wrong and this discipline strategy was used by almost ninety percent of mothers (88%).

I have received a large volume of representations on behalf of the applicants involved and I and my officials have actively been trying to assist those affected. <\/p><p>Following queries I initiated through diplomatic channels the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation has confirmed to the Irish Embassy that new legislation came into force on 3rd July 2013 which requires a child to be on the national adoption database for twelve months before that child is deemed eligible for intercountry adoption and may be placed on an international adoption database. The previous period was eight months. I understand the purpose of the amendment is to extend the period during which possibilities for domestic adoption are considered.<\/p><p>The Adoption Act, 2010, provides for adoptions from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention on adoption and from countries where there is a bilateral agreement in place. During the drafting of the Act a considered and detailed transitional process to deal with the change from previous legislation to the new Act was put in place. The transitional measure contained in Section 63 of the Adoption Act, 2010, allows applicants with a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt who had commenced the adoption process at the time of the commencement of the Act to continue with that adoption, from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country. Such applicants were thus afforded an additional three year period to complete these particular adoptions from non-Hague countries, and must complete the process by the 31st October 2013. The issue that has arisen is that the changes introduced by the Russian authorities mean that a small number of Irish applicants will not be able to conclude their adoption of a Russian child by the 31<sup>st<\/sup> October 2013.  <\/p><p>In an effort to assist I have been using diplomatic channels to seek solutions for the applicants involved. These diplomatic channels have been used to fully outline the difficult situation these applicants have been put in following the change in Russian procedures and to explore possible solutions. The Irish Ambassador to Russia met with the Deputy Foreign Minister Titov in Moscow on 10th September 2013 and outlined the position and noted our desire for a degree of flexibility in relation to the implementation of the changes recently introduced, which has affected a small number of Irish applicants who were at an advanced stage in the adoption process. <\/p><p>I have also recently met with the Embassy Attach&eacute; from the Russian Embassy to Dublin who was representing the Russian Ambassador to highlight the current difficulties the sudden change in Russian legislation has created. This meeting was positive and the Attach&eacute; indicated that officials from the Ministry of Education in Moscow are aware of the issues and are examining them closely.   <\/p><p>Amongst the representations I have received is a proposal to amend the Adoption Act, 2010 to address this situation. As the Act is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Adoption Act, 2010 must be carefully examined.  Issues also arise in confining any such amendment to the cases immediately affected by the recent changes in Russia.  Nevertheless, these legislative issues are receiving consideration by my Department in parallel with the ongoing engagement with the Russian authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900047#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Child Care Education Issues","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900047#WRA01050"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[38840\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900047#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the progress made to date in her plans to introduce a second early childhood care and education year for children with a learning disability; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1186","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[38601\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900047#WRA01150","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the progress made to date on her plans to introduce a second early childhood care and education year; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[38841\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900047#WRA01162","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the progress made to date on her plans to introduce a second early childhood care and education year; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":19,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 29 and 38 together. <\/p><p>  The current free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education - ECCE programme - was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children before commencing primary school.  Almost every pre-school service in the State (more than 4,300) is participating with over 68,000 children, or 94% of the eligible age cohort, availing of free pre-school programme in the 2012\/2013 school year.   <\/p><p>  In line with the Programme for Government, I succeeded in maintaining the universality of the free pre-school year, including securing an additional funding requirement of &euro;9.8m in 2012 to address increased demand due to an increase in births since 2009.<\/p><p>  The programme includes a number of additional provisions which take account of children with special needs.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  Application for these exemptions must be made prior to the child commencing the programme.  In addition, to improve the services available to children with special needs, my Department is working with the Office of Disability and Mental Health in the Department of Health, to examine how supports to facilitate the inclusion of children with special needs in mainstream pre-school settings can be improved.<\/p><p>  As I have outlined in response to an earlier question, My Department and I, along with key stakeholders including the HSE, are currently progressing an 8-point Pre-School Quality Agenda. The action being implement are designed to ensure the highest standards of care for children in pre-school and to ensure that parents and practitioners can have confidence in the regulation of the sector. I further believe that this Agenda must be implemented; and higher standard of quality ensured, in order to provide the key building blocks for any further extensive of universal childcare provision, including any proposal to introduce a second free pre-school year, which as I have indicated on numerous occasions is my ultimate objective.<\/p><p>  There is an increasing body of Irish and International evidence which quantify the benefits of early year&rsquo;s interventions in terms of improving children&rsquo;s outcomes and in delivering significant economic and societal return to the state. I this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes as well as proving significantly beneficial to children with special needs. In addition a second pre-school year would represent &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 worth of free childcare to parents and likely generate 4,000-5,000 new positions, albeit mostly part-time. The benefits of introducing a second year were further referred to in the OECD reports on Ireland published last week.<\/p><p>  However, the introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, with the additional cost broadly in line with the cost of the current one year provision, which is &euro;175 million.  This funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is currently operating.  However I would hope that this proposal is one which Government could continue to work towards as our public finances recover.<\/p><p>  Finally, I have this week received the Report and recommendations of the Expert Advisory Group which I established to advice my Department and I on the preparation of Ireland first-ever Early Years Strategy. Longer term objectives for early years care and education, including extension of universal early years provision, supports for children with specific needs and ongoing improvements in quality will be further addressed in this Strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900047#WRA01175","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childhood Obesity","counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900047#WRA01200"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[38770\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900047#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her Departments intentions towards a national cross-sectoral strategy for the establishment of a childhood obesity prevention and intervention service; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":22,"content":"<p>Overweight and obesity are a public health priority, the primary remit for which lies with the Minister for Health who has established a Special Action Group on Obesity whom he meets with regularly to progress the obesity prevention agenda.

In addition, my Department has been actively driving a  comprehensive<b><\/b>Pre-School Quality Agenda. <\/p><p>  I have outlined to the Dail on several occasions, and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee, eight key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency.

The qualification requirement for Pre-School Leaders will be increased to Level 6 requirement in childcare\/early education.  In addition, all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be made subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  These requirements will apply to new services from September 2014 and to existing services from September 2015.  My Department is currently examining measures to support training for childcare staff in line with the increased qualification requirements.  <\/p><p>Pre-school services are governed by the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006 as provided in the Child Care Act 1991.  Inspections are carried out under the regulations by the Pre-School Inspectorate, to monitor compliance and ensure the health, safety and welfare of children and the promotion of their development.     As I have outlined in recent weeks, a number of steps are being taken to improve the current inspection system, including the introduction of National Quality Standards for pre-school services later this year as part of the inspection process.<\/p><p>In addition, my Department is working with the Pre-School Inspectorate to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach as to how inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance as opposed to minor breaches and full compliance.    My Department has also reviewed the penalties currently in place for breach of regulations with a view to increasing their range and severity.  I will be bringing draft legislative amendments in relation to this to Government very shortly and I expect these to be brought before the Houses during the current session.  Since July of this year, existing inspection reports are being published on-line by the Pre-School Inspectorate and all new inspection reports will also be published on-line on their completion.  <\/p><p>  A registration system has been introduced on an administrative basis for new pre-school services and is expected to be placed on a statutory basis in 2014.  This allows the Pre-School Inspectorate to determine whether a service is compliant in terms of suitability and service design before it will be permitted to operate.  This  is a further welcome development in the wider programme of work to secure and support the quality of pre school services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900047#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[38839\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900047#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the steps she will take to address the availability and affordability of regulated childcare services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1184","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to developing early childhood care and education as resources allow, and the Government has made a very significant commitment to maintaining the childcare support programmes implemented by my Department - the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme and the new After-school Childcare programme which is being fully rolled out from this month.  <\/p><p>It is recognised that intensive and targeted early childhood services have the potential to significantly enhance the life chances of many children.  There is significant international evidence of the benefits for children's outcomes of the provision of quality education and childcare in the earliest years.  Investment in early childhood care and education benefits not only the individual child but also the future development of the wider economy.  I am also aware of the important economic contribution that childcare services provide through direct employment of staff in service delivery and through support for labour participation on the part of working parents. <\/p><p>The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or on low or relatively modest incomes. For the purpose of the CCS programme, disadvantage and qualifying income are determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.   Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, parents with middle incomes may also benefit from subvention.  <\/p><p>The CETS<b><\/b>programme provides &euro;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services in both the community and commercial sectors for qualifying trainees and students.

The Hague principles of subsidiarity, support for birth families, free and informed consent for birth parents, and international adoption as a resource for the permanent care of children, are a means for improving standards in intercountry adoption and mitigating against some of the risks inherent in intercountry adoption. <\/p><p>There are two existing legislative commitments in the Adoption Area.  The first is to provide, in a more effective and appropriate way, for the adoption of children o f marriage. The <i>Adoption (Amendment) Bill<\/i> were made published Children's Referendum and will be introduced as soon as  proceedings and processes relevant to the Referendum are concluded. <\/p><p>The second piece of adoption legislation which is being prepared is the  <i>Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.   <\/i>These issues are currently being examined within my Department and within the Office of the Attorney General. It is  my intention is to bring the Heads of Bill before Government at the earliest possible date to seek approval to refer this legislation to the Oireachtas Health and Children Committee for discussion.  <\/p><p>The Adoption Act 2010 has been in operation for nearly three years now.  Since taking office I have made improvements to the operation of the scheme, without the need to amend legislation following consultation with the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the Health Service Executive. In particular I have streamlined the assessment process for those seeking to transfer from declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt which are due to expire before the 31st of October 2013. Furthermore I have moved to address the issue of the sustainability, and funding, of accredited bodies. In this matter interim funding has been provided to specific bodies and I am seeking agreement from these agencies on a pathway to securing a sustainable model for accredited bodies in the future. <\/p><p>Since the implementation of the Act, as is often the case with complex legislation, issues have arisen in relation to the operation of the Act.   There are  also more general policy questions around the nature of our adoption regime, with for example some seeing the development of options for an open adoption regime domestically as worthy of consideration. In the circumstances I think it is timely to consider a review of adoption.  Given the range and complexity of the issues this will require scoping and preliminary examination after which decisions will be made on the extent and time scale for the review. I do not know at this stage if proposals for legislative change will emerge from this review or the nature of such proposals.  Based upon the many domestic and international legal aspects to adoption the issue of further legislative development will certainly be considered.    This review will inform future operational and legislative considerations regarding the Adoption Act 2010. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900047#WRA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[38605\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900047#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will initiate a public inquiry into the Sacred Heart Mother and Baby Homes and the manner in which adoptions were handled in here since its inception.","asker":"1015","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":35,"content":"<p>The Adoption Act of 1952, as subsequently amended, provided a legal basis for adoption in Ireland and for the establishment of the Adoption Board thereby bringing order to what had been the adhoc arrangements which had previously existed in lieu of formal adoption procedures. That Act was replaced most recently by the Adoption Act 2010 which also established the Adoption Authority of Ireland. All adoptions in Ireland since 1952 have been underpined by a legislative basis. <\/p><p>  While my Department's remit in this area relates to adoptions carried out under the relevant legislation I am aware that there have been concerns about informal adoptions or illegal registrations some of which are associated with some mother and baby homes. The issue in Ireland of illegal adoptions very much relates to illegal registrations, i.e. children who were given at birth to other individuals who registered these children as their own and who are now unable to access personal records and information.  I have met with individuals who have found themselves in these circumstance and I acknowledge and empathise with the dilemma that these individuals are addressing. <\/p><p>  Efforts have been made by the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the HSE, within their legal remit,  to facilitate the investigations that these individuals are undertaking in endeavouring to establish medical and\/or identifying information about themselves.  <\/p><p>In consultation with the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the Health Service Executive, my Department is examining legislative and administrative options in relation to accessing records which may exist. I am also examining provisions in this regard in the forthcoming Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.

The areas I have identified are:<\/p><p>- Increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in pre-school services to a minimum standard at FETAC Level 5<\/p><p>- Improving the quality and curricular supports for pre-school services when implementing the Siolta Framework and Aistear Curriculum <\/p><p>- Implementing the new National Pre-School Standards<\/p><p>- Introducing a registration system for all pre-school services <\/p><p>- Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust<\/p><p>- Publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible<\/p><p>- Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance<\/p><p>- Increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance.<\/p><p>My Department and I are working on a comprehensive Pre-School Quality Agenda. This includes the introduction of   National Quality Standards, which will be implemented later this year. These Standards contain a section on Organisation and Management which includes the following criteria:<\/p><p>- All  staff commence induction training in relation to all the policies and procedures of the service during their first week of employment<\/p><p>- Each staff member receives regular supervision and support in relation to all areas of their work<\/p><p>- The on-going training needs of staff are identified, addressed and provided for on a regular basis.<\/p><p>  I have highlighted in previous replies to D&aacute;il questions the responsibilities that the Child Care Regulations impose on pre-school managers in ensuring that suitable and competent staff are employed and that they are effectively supervised and monitored in order to ensure that the highest quality of care is provided to children attending the service.    The introduction of a more robust inspection regime will enforce the requirement for providers to place quality at the centre of the services they provide. <\/p><p>  Pre-school services are governed by the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006 as provided in the Child Care Act 1991. Under the Regulations the Health Service Executive has responsibility for the inspection of services and the enforcement of the regulations. Inspection is carried out to monitor compliance with the Regulations thereby ensuring the health, safety and welfare of children and the promotion of their development.   <\/p><p>A number of steps are being taken to improve the current inspection system.  These include the introduction of National Quality Standards for pre-school services later this year as part of the inspection process.  In addition, my Department is working with the Pre-School Inspectorate to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach as to how inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance as opposed to minor breaches and full compliance.    My Department is also undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (Pre-school) Regulations, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution. <\/p><p>  I can confirm that, in the case of the three pre-school services featured in RTE's Primetime programme of 28 May 2013, complaints management and inspection review visits have taken place in each case.  In relation to the publication of pre-school service inspection reports, the HSE has begun the process of publishing retrospective reports on-line, and this process will continue over the coming weeks and months.  All new inspection reports from 1st July will be published on-line on completion.  The publication of these reports is being hosted by Pobal, and the reports are available on the Pobal website.<\/p><p>A new registration system has been introduced this month and new services wishing to open will be required to register with the HSE.  The HSE will determine whether the childcare service is compliant in terms of suitability and service design <i>before<\/i>   the service will be permitted to operate.  Following commencement of the service, actual care and welfare practices will be inspected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900047#WRA02475","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900047#WRA02750"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[38728\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900047#WRA02800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent of the reduction in working hours of child care staff in residential care homes due to cuts in funding.","asker":"1005","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":43,"content":"<p>When a child cannot live with his or her parents either on a short or long-term basis, the HSE will, in the first instance, seek a suitable relative or person known to the child to provide relative care.

","asker":"1020","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":71,"content":"<p>There are currently 3 children detention schools in the State: Trinity House, Oberstown Boys and Oberstown Girls schools. All are located on the same campus at Oberstown, near Lusk, Co. Dublin. These schools currently accommodate girls under 18 years of age on admission and boys under 17 years on admission whose detention is ordered by the Courts on remand or on conviction for criminal offences.  The Deputy will be aware that a construction project is to commence shortly in Oberstown to expand the capacity of the campus, to enable responsibility for detention of all young people under 18 years of age to be assigned to Oberstown in 2014.<\/p><p>  There has been a substantial increase in demand for male bed spaces on the Oberstown campus in 2013 compared to 2012.  This has been primarily but not exclusively driven by an increase in the number of boys aged 16 years old on admission detained in Oberstown.  As a result, there is a shortage of male bed spaces available in Oberstown at present.  While the trend in court outcomes for children requires further research, I am conscious that a number of measures are required to address the short term difficulties that have arisen in this area.<\/p><p>  Firstly, by agreement with staff, an independent review of the campus roster for care staff is to get under way shortly which will include the issues of the number of staff absences resulting from sickness, assaults and injuries, adequacy of staffing levels as well as the implementation of the Haddington Road Agreement.  This process will commence before the end of September and will be completed as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  My Department has also identified an ongoing trend of children exiting the HSE secure residential system and being remanded in custody to the Oberstown campus.  Both the Irish Youth Justice Service and HSE Child and Family Services are to further analyse this trend to establish if in certain cases the needs of the children concerned would be more appropriately addressed by way of community based services.<\/p><p>  I have authorised a reorganisation of staffing and services on the campus which will result in 4 additional male bed places in Oberstown Boys School before the end of this month, subject to legal advice.  This will include moving the location of Oberstown Girls School from its current location to a unit currently occupied by Oberstown Boys School, reducing the number of bed spaces for girls from 8 to 6 and increasing the number of male detention spaces in Oberstown Boys School from 20 to 24.<\/p><p>  My Department is also progressing plans for recruitment of staff to enable the reopening of an 8 bed unit for males in Trinity House School which is currently not available for use due to staffing issues.  A tender is to issue shortly for a pilot project to bring in between 10 &ndash; 20 residential care worker staff on an agency basis.  The intention is to run this project for a test period of up to 6 months, starting in October.  In addition, the first batch of new care staff due to arrive in early 2014 as part of the expansion of the campus for 17 year old males are, in the first instance, to be assigned to the existing children detention schools in order to ensure the required cover to open all detention beds that are currently certified for use.<\/p><p>  I have previously provided information in relation to absconds which took place from Oberstown Boys School in June of this year. The 3 boys in question were subsequently apprehended by the Gardai and returned to Oberstown.  I am advised that there has been a full review of security by the Director of Oberstown Boys School to prevent a recurrence of this incident.  While it can never be guaranteed that such incidents will be prevented, I am aware that there is a long history of a high level of security in Oberstown as well as excellent co-operation and communication with the local community.  The issue of security will remain an ongoing matter for review by the Board of management and the Irish Youth Justice Service.  I also note that there will be enhanced security on the campus as a result of the Oberstown capital project, which will include a new cordon barrier and fence as well as an expansion in CCTV coverage on the campus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900048#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p><i>Question No. 29 answered with Question No. 11.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900048#WRB01600","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Inspections","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900049#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[38722\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900049#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her Department or agencies under her remit have had any contact with the Ombudsman for Children following the \"Prime Time\" investigation into cr&egrave;ches; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

In so far as the HSE provides domestic violence services to victims, responsibility currently falls within the remit of the Department of Health and the HSE.  Children, as individuals, do not require the services of domestic violence shelters; they accompany the parent who requires these on occasion. Unaccompanied children make use of alternative services, under the Child Care Act 1991, and would not be placed in a domestic violence shelter.  The issue of domestic violence and associated services are included in the Bill providing for the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency (CFA) given the close relationship between domestic violence and child protection issues. In this regard, the task force report on the establishment of the CFA noted the need for a robust co-ordinating mechanism to continue the appropriate multi-organisational approach.<\/p><p>  Ireland has no law or statute at present which specifically permits corporal punishment in the home setting.  However, Section 246 of the Children Act 2001 provides very clear legal deterrents to the use of excessive physical discipline within the home setting or otherwise, as follows:<\/p><p>Section   <i>246.--(1) 'It shall be an offence for any person who has the custody, charge or care of a child wilfully to assault, ill-treat, neglect, abandon or expose the child, or cause or procure or allow the child to be assaulted, ill-treated, neglected, abandoned or exposed, in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child's health or seriously to affect his or her well-being.'<\/i><\/p><p>In relation to corporal punishment within the home, a limited defence of <i>'reasonable chastisement'<\/i>   exists in common law, but successful high profile prosecutions have been taken by the State under section 246 where parents are deemed to have used excessive or unreasonable force in disciplining children.<\/p><p>  My Department is currently engaged with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's Office to respond formally to the European Committee of Social Rights of the Council of Europe (CoE) in respect of matters raised through the committee around the banning of corporal punishment in all settings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900049#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Provision","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900049#WRC01200"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[38714\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900049#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her response to a survey carried out by the Ombudsman for Children which indicated that 72% of Irish people believe that the State could do more to support children&rsquo;s rights; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":86,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Ombudsman for Children is an independent officer of the State and accounts for her statutory functions to the Oireachtas.

This primarily relates to governance matters, most notably the funding of the Ombudsman for Children's Office through the Vote of my Department.<\/p><p>  The Ombudsman for Children performs a very valuable ongoing role in advancing the rights and welfare of children in Ireland since her appointment to that role in 2003. In addition to her complaints and investigation functions, the Ombudsman for Children makes valuable ongoing contributions to Oireachtas Committees, provides advices to Government on legislation, policy and practices and raises public awareness of issues impacting on the lives of children and families.  I am also aware that the Ombudsman for Children's Office is constantly engaging with all relevant Government Departments about children's rights through their complaints and investigations, legislative, participation and education functions.<\/p><p>  I am in agreement with Ms. Logan that the absence of clearer protection for children's rights in the Constitution has had an adverse effect on children across a wide range of areas and that the State could do more to support Children's Rights.

Corporal punishment in schools is banned, and regulations for creches, foster care and residential settings address the use of appropriate discipline. Corporal punishment in the home, while not specifically outlawed, is governed by the provisions of section 246 of the Children Act, 2001. Section 246 makes it an offence to assault, ill-treat, neglect, abandon or expose a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child's health or seriously affect his or her wellbeing. A limited defence of reasonable chastisement exists in common law for parents and persons acting in loco parentis, but successful high profile prosecutions have been taken by the State under section 246 where parents are deemed to have used excessive or unreasonable force in disciplining children. <\/p><p>  My Department is reviewing the complex policy, legal and constitutional issues involved and is also currently engaged with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's Office to respond formally to the European Committee of Social Rights of the Council of Europe (CoE) in respect of matters raised through the committee around the banning of corporal punishment in all settings. The Government has been invited to make a submission to the Committee on the merit of the complaint and it is my intention to do so. In responding, the submission will allude to the significant progress which continues to be made in relation to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to protect the rights of children, including the proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to children&rsquo;s rights, the enactment of a suite of relevant DCYA and Justice legislation, and progress in relation to fundamental reform of the child protection services, the establishment of the Child and Family Agency, and drafting legislation in relation to putting Children First on a statutory basis. I will be keeping my Cabinet colleagues fully updated in this matter and will be discussing with them the full range of policy options available.<\/p><p>  There is a balance to be found between supporting parents in effective parenting, in particular, in use of non-violent forms of discipline, and the use of criminal law to impose criminal sanctions on parents who do not adhere to best practice in parenting. It is important to note that the general development of norms within Ireland and positive support and encouragement to parents has brought about a situation where physical punishment is increasingly avoided.  <\/p><p>  Recent research from the longitudinal study of children in Ireland shows that the great majority of parents do not use smacking as a form of discipline. The most frequently used method of discipline was &quot;discussing \/ explaining why the behaviour was wrong and this discipline strategy was used by almost ninety percent of mothers (88%).  Less than one percent (0.5%) of mothers reporting smacking their children &quot;regularly or always&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900050#WRD00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Workers Recruitment","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900050#WRD00650"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[38842\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900050#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the steps being taken to address the shortfall of social workers within the Child and Family Support Agency; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>I want to acknowledge the challenges facing our child welfare and protection services and the pressures facing social work teams around the country.

This compares to employees in respect of whom a combined 14.75% rate, under full-rate PRSI Class A, is paid giving entitlement to the full range of social insurance benefits including jobseeker's benefit.<\/p><p>  Any person of working age who does not qualify for jobseeker's benefit may claim means tested jobseeker's allowance. Subject to means and other qualifying conditions, self-employed persons may claim jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or there is reduced demand for their services. Typically over 80% of jobseeker's allowance claims from self-employed persons have been awarded over recent years. <\/p><p>  Previously self-employed persons in receipt of jobseeker's allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people. <\/p><p>  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.<\/p><p>  Some employment services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department's employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status. Unemployed persons, including the previously self-employed, not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through F&Aacute;S training, but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 4.25%).  <\/p><p>  Self-employed workers may also access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p><p>  On 6 September 2013 I published the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare Group's report on the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons so as to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit. <\/p><p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that Class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work because of a long-term illness or incapacity through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for Class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  This is in line with the estimated level of contributions needed to provide access for the self-employed to Invalidity Pension contained in the 2010 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund. <\/p><p>  In the course of the Group's deliberations, the Group identified a range of issues associated with the subject of social insurance for the self-employed that should be addressed and have made a number of recommendations in this regard.  These include, among others, the means assessment for self-employed income in terms of accessing jobseeker's allowance payments, credited PRSI contributions, self-employed access to activation and training schemes and the role that information campaigns might play in addressing information deficits, particularly with regard to entitlements to jobseeker's allowance.<\/p><p>  The question as to whether the present arrangements regarding social insurance for the self-employed are appropriate has increased in prominence over recent years.  I welcome the Group's finding that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  The recommendation concerning long-term sickness or injuries is an important contribution to the policy debate regarding the range of benefits the self-employed might access through their social insurance contributions.  In this regard, the 2010 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, published last year, determined that the self-employed are obtaining better value for the level of their current social insurance contributions than employees (the Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contributions needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%).  This finding was noted by the Advisory Group in its recommendations.  Consequently, the recommendations of the Advisory Group require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the 2010 Actuarial Review relating to the level of contributions levied on Class S contributors and the current shortfall in this regard.<\/p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will now carefully reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900058#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Non-Contributory) Eligibility","counter":279,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900058#WRM01150"},{"type":"question","counter":280,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[38952\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900058#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a person is entitled to switch from a contributory pension to a higher rate on the non-contributory pension; her views on whether it is fair that this pay difference exist; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The local government funding model will change considerably in 2014.  Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014 the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund.  In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing.<\/p><p>  The general issue of local government sector funding in 2014 will be decided in the context of Budget 2014.  In advance of the Budget it is not possible to comment in detail on the funding situation of the sector as a whole, or on the 2014 position of specific local authorities, such as Kerry County Council.  The setting of commercial rates in 2014 is a matter for the relevant local authority.<\/p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move, from 2014, to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised.  The remaining 20% of the Tax collected nationally will be re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of General Purpose Grants.  The approach used to allocate the 20% of Local Property Tax revenue available for equalisation will depend on factors such as overall yield and yields at individual local authority level.  The priority will be to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases.<\/p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.  A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.<\/p><p>  Placing the local government sector on a more sustainable financial footing is an important objective of the changes to the funding of local authorities.  I am satisfied that the changes which are currently underway will deliver a model of funding which is sustainable in the broadest sense into the long-term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900060#WRO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader Programmes Funding","counter":330,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900060#WRO01550"},{"type":"question","counter":331,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[38888\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900060#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if any flexibility will be afforded in relation to stipulated deadlines to have Leader-funded projects completed in the event of unforeseen challenges that have caused unexpected delays to completing the works; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The reports show that in 2012, the HSE received 19,044 referrals of child abuse and 21,143 referrals of child welfare concerns.<\/p><p>  I have been advised by the HSE that there are a variety of measures in place to ensure the safety of children in State care.  Firstly, a thorough assessment of their needs is carried out prior to being taken into care or, in the case of an emergency, shortly after being taken into care.  Children are then placed with carers who have being thoroughly assessed and meet the strict criteria as set down by the HSE.  Once a child is placed the placement is closely monitored by the child's allocated social worker, and child is visited in the foster home or residential unit. <\/p><p>  Staff in residential units receive ongoing supervision and training to ensure that they understand their role as carers and ensure the safety of children in their care. Foster carers also receive support from a link social worker and are provided with training.  The Regulations provide that care plans for children in care are reviewed every six months for the first two years and then annually thereafter unless there is a change in circumstance when a special review may take place.<\/p><p>  Absconsions and missing in care episodes can occur from time to time.  The HSE has a joint protocol with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to manage such incidents, which was revised in 2012.  Senior HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na meet on a regular basis to monitor the number of missing children.  <\/p><p>  Any allegations of concern or complaint by a child against carers or others are dealt with in line with Children First, National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2011.  Assessments are carried out in relation to their ongoing safety and they are moved to alternative placement where necessary.  <\/p><p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority monitors the HSE to ensure compliance with the Child Care Regulations 1995 the National Standards for Foster care and the National Standards for Residential Care, all of which clearly set out the role for the state in relation to the care, protection and the safeguarding of children in care. HIQA has undertaken over 500 inspections of residential care centres since 2000 and 27 foster care inspections.  Similarly, the HSE Inspection and Monitoring service also inspects and monitors the private foster and residential care  providers to ensure compliance with the Regulations and the National Standards.

These actions require collaborative work with a broad base of interests to protect children from bullying and ensure a safer childhood. New anti-bullying procedures have now been published by my colleague Minister Quinn which place a requirement on all recognised schools to record, investigate and address incidences of bullying in a structured manner. The procedures specifically include incidences of cyberbullying, both in and out of the school context or the posting of hurtful messages, images or statements on social media sites, within the definition of bullying.<\/p><p>  The new procedures highlight the need for parents and young people to understand how to use modern technologies safely; they must recognise the risks associated with the cyber world and know how to protect themselves in school, at home and in their communities. This includes raising awareness of  available tools within social media platforms such as privacy settings, how to block other users and the use of the complaints mechanisms provided.<\/p><p>  The www.webwise.ie site provides valuable information and advice for parents and teachers about the risks involved and how to protect children against cyber bullying.

The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is leading the Government's consideration of this wide ranging report. This report includes a series of recommendations in response to the growing concerns over cyberbullying and its impact on young people. In light of the scale and the transnational nature of social media platforms and the web-based industry in general, the Oireachtas Committee recognised the requirement for collective EU-wide responses.

Licences issued prior to that date can be transferred only once.\u00a0<\/p><p>  In line with the recommendation under Action 14 of the\u00a0Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011, Section 14 of the Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 provides for a prohibition on the transfer of all SPSV vehicle licences. The underlying principle for the prohibition on transfer is that\u00a0a licence should determine a person&rsquo;s suitability to carry out a function and it should not have monetary value or be traded on the open market.\u00a0<\/p><p>  Only in the exceptional circumstances of the event of the death of a licence holder will a taxi licence be permitted to continue in force, as provided for under Section 15 of the Taxi Regulation Bill 2012. <\/p><p>  I intend to make a further amendment to the Taxi Bill to ensure the proportionate application of the legal provisions concerning the prohibition on transfer of a taxi licence to deal the matter of a company holding a taxi licence. <\/p><p>  The Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011 sets out the future approach to regulation of the taxi market. At the core of the Report are recommendations concerning stronger qualitative controls for SPSV licensing, improved standards and effective enforcement. The conclusion of the Taxi Review Group is that this approach is supported by the independent analysis of the economic consultants, Indecon, in particular that non-compliance with the taxi regulations is an impacting factor on the low level of exit from the taxi market.  \u00a0<\/p><p>  There\u00a0\u00a0are no plans for the introduction of a compensation scheme to facilitate licence holders wishing to leave the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013091900070#WRY01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"}]
