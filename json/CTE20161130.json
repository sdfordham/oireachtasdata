Today's meeting is part of the committee's post-budget analysis of budget 2017.  The witnesses have also been asked to provide a look ahead to budget 2018, including the measures and proposals they believe could be introduced that would have a positive impact in the areas of gender equality and poverty in particular.  This is a new committee and it is only now that we are in a position to go into more depth in terms of oversight of budgetary matters and input from bodies such as the National Women's Council and Social Justice Ireland are important in that regard.  It is likely that we will have ongoing engagement with both organisations, especially as we engage with those who are policy-proofing budget proposals.<\/p> <p>  I wish to draw attention to the fact that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.

As members know, the council is the leading national membership organisation for women in Ireland.  We are a feminist organisation and we seek full equality for women in Ireland.  We welcome the invitation to meet the committee today and we also welcome the establishment of the budgetary oversight committee because it provides an important opportunity for greater Oireachtas oversight of and input to the budgetary process.  <\/p> <p>  We commend the commitment in the programme for partnership Government to devote two thirds of budgetary spending on public investment as against one third on tax measures and acknowledge the fulfilment of that commitment in budget 2017.  We recognise the pressures on Government in terms of bringing together the budget but our main comments on budget 2017 will focus on issues of taxation, child care, income, pensions and gender and equality budgeting.<\/p> <p>  We believe that the tax concessions in budget 2017, such as the reduction in the universal social charge, USC, and the increased thresholds for capital acquisitions tax, CAT, do not represent a strategic use of hard-earned public funds.  Budget 2017 gave us an opportunity to discontinue marginal tax reliefs on pensions, for example, but this did not happen.  The opportunity to redress some of the inequities in our taxation system was not taken.  <\/p> <p>  On a positive note, the National Women's Council really welcomes the introduction of the single affordable child care scheme.  This is a really important measure.  The council has long campaigned for the introduction of publicly subsidised universal child care and the single affordable child care scheme represents a good start.  However, I must emphasise that it is only a start.  It is similar to many models of child care in other European countries for which we have advocated.  The lack of child care in Ireland is still one of the most significant barriers to women's participation in society, including in employment, civic and political life.  We welcome the fact that there is a universal element within the child care subsidy so that all families can benefit.  This recognises that all families have child care needs which is critical.  We also welcome the fact that payments will be made directly to the service providers.  This is very important in the context of ensuring that State funding is linked directly to quality service provision.  That said, it is critically important that providers of child care do not increase their costs.  There are some gaps in the scheme and we will be working with the Department to improve it before it is rolled out next September.  One of the issues to be addressed is the capping of child care costs so that prices are not increased, thus making child care less affordable for parents.<\/p> <p>  The council recommended, prior to budget 2017, that the minimum wage be increased to what is called the living wage, that is, to &euro;11.50 per hour.  This did not happen but it remains the council's recommendation in the context of the next budget.  A number of issues arise with regard to social welfare but I wish to focus on pensions in particular.  Pensions are a critical issue for women in Ireland because of the inequities within the system.  The gender pension gap has widened and now stands at 37%.  While we welcome the increase of &euro;5 in pension payments we firmly believe, based on our international research and on consulting widely with women, that a universal pension is the best way to support equality in older age.  We recommend that this committee makes this a priority over the next year and we will also be saying the same to the Department of Social Protection.  This has been a long standing call of the National Women's Council of Ireland.  Currently 84% of those receiving a full State contributory pension are men.  While this payment was protected during the recession, the reduced rate payments on which a majority of women rely have been steadily eroded.  The fact that only 16% of women receive the full contributory rate reflects both the legacy of the marriage bar and a system poorly designed to support individual entitlement or to recognise care.  Rather than addressing these inequalities, the State has allowed them to deepen in recent years by increasing contributory thresholds and making it harder for women to access a full contributory pension.  This is a critical issue for women because of the legacy issues already mentioned and also in terms of how we deal with it going forward.  Currently we are not assisting women to access pensions but are making it harder for them.  <\/p> <p>  The final issue I wish to deal with is gender and equality budgeting, which goes to the heart of equality for women and to the heart of our budgetary process.  In looking to budget 2018 and beyond, the council wishes to offer its support to this committee to embed a process of gender and equality budgeting that would be in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government.<\/p><p>These are commitments we welcomed.  We believe these new mechanisms must be meaningfully developed and delivered.  This is not a tick box exercise.  Gender budgeting, if implemented effectively, has the potential to address structural economic inequalities for women and to allow the Government to assess the extent to which provisions made to improve the lives of women and men are achieving their intended impact.  We have also received funding from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to support the work on gender budgeting and we want to work with the committee to do that.<\/p><p> Having listened to the address of the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, in the Seanad yesterday, it is appropriate to point out that we have a good deal to learn from Scotland on gender budgeting, which was discussed yesterday.  The fact that in Scotland they produce an annual budget equality statement is a positive step and it is one that could be taken up in an Irish context.  We ask that in budget 2018 a similar statement would be produced that would accompany the budget, which would be the start of a process in assessing budgetary demands from different Departments before they are implemented and, similarly, when the budget is produced that it would be  done after that process.  A before and after process in that respect is critical to having a proper gender budgeting process.<\/p><p> We thank the committee once again for this opportunity to present our views and we are happy to answer any questions on our submission that members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Connor for that.

We welcome the establishment of the committee and we believe the work it is doing is very important in shaping the future.  We have already submitted a 24-page analysis and critique of budget 2017 together with some ideas about the future.  My introductory remarks are based on the fact that this document has been submitted, and we can tease it out as the members wish.<\/p> <p>  A number of the budgetary measures were welcome, including the increases in welfare rates and the child care programme initiative.  The tax changes could have been fairer, even if the Government was to insist on a third of the available fiscal space going on tax reductions.  It could have done it in a much more fair way.  For exactly the same amount of money, &euro;383 million, it could have made tax credits refundable, thus tackling the work poor issue and giving every person with a job a tax credit of &euro;100.  That would have been a fairer way to proceed.<\/p> <p>  The long-range issues Ireland is facing were mentioned in the Budget Statement announced by the Minister for Finance but were not taken up in any substantial way.  They include issues such as climate change and the funding of education particularly at third level which is becoming pretty difficult and challenging.  There is also the issue of our changing demographics.  Ireland will have a million people over the age of 65 by 2031, which is only 15 years away, and, of that, 136,000 will be over the age of 85, which is an increase of 132% on the current situation.  We know that will happen and should be planning for it now rather than leaving it until later.  There are other challenges around financing local government, repairing and modernising our water infrastructure, paying our rising European Union contribution, funding pollution-reducing environmental initiatives, the issue of what is required by European international agreements and the need to invest in the building of the rural broadband infrastructure.  Those are some of the long-range issues which have huge implications and which require serious investment but which were not sufficiently addressed in this budget and need to be on the agenda as we go forward.<\/p> <p>  We have an issue around the coherence of decisions taken in the budget.  For example, in the decisions made on housing, there is a lack of coherence on two fronts.  While there is a plan in place, which is welcome and which we fully acknowledge it is the biggest plan put in place for a long time, we would point out that it is planned to build 47,000 new units by 2021 when currently, according to the Government's figures, 89,000 units are required for social housing.  We will only get half way to achieving that but that does not account for any new need that will emerge from our rising population between now and 2021.  That is one issue.  Another issue is that we believe the assistance being granted to first-time buyers in budget 2017 is short-sighted and will not do anything to tackle the current cause of the problem, which is the lack of supply.<\/p> <p>  There is a similar lack of coherence, which has not been highlighted as much in the public arena, in the overall health care budget.  The existing level of service together with the new initiatives that are planned to be delivered cannot be delivered for the money that has been allocated.  Either some of the new commitments will not be delivered or some of the services being provided will have to be reduced if the budget is to come in on target.  Our understanding is that this is the requirement now in the budgetary process, that there cannot be supplementary budgets and that next budget will be next December.<\/p> <p>  Another issue about which we are seriously concerned is the tax take.  The level of revenue remains one of the lowest in the European Union as a percentage of GDP.  The low tax model is not sustainable because in practice it means that Ireland does not have sufficient resources to provide the social and economic infrastructure that we require.  Our infrastructure is below the European continental averages.  It is not possible for us to build the additional infrastructure and maintain it and to do that on the social and infrastructural side generally while having this lower tax take as a very strong commitment.  The issue is not about increasing income tax rather it is about widening the tax base, which is the essential prerequisite to increasing the country's total tax take in a fair manner.<\/p> <p>  Moving on from the tax issue but closely tied to it is the fact that greater public investment is required.  The Government claimed that budget 2017 had been Brexit-proofed.  What that involves is not very clear but I am convinced that the best way to Brexit-proof the Irish economy is to invest in the infrastructure that we desperately need.  That is what is required.  That would be good for the economy and for society.  Budget 2017 does not address that.  <\/p> <p>  We would also point to the fact that budget-proofing has been ignored.  Nowhere else in this society or economy would one be allowed to spend a great deal of money without first having a very clear impact assessment.  When organisations in the community and voluntary sector apply for even small amounts of money, they are always asked by the Department or the agency concerned what is their output and what will be the impact, but that question does not seem to have been asked in advance of the budget.  It is something that happens afterwards and there is something fundamentally wrong with that.<\/p> <p>  Looking to the future, we need an integrated policy framework.  There are five goals the Government needs to work for simultaneously because they are interdependent, intertwined and interconnected in a big way.  We need to build a thriving economy, to move to have just taxation, to have decent services and infrastructure, to have good governance and to do it all in a sustainable manner.  It is possible to do that in a serious way and to do it effectively.  I am talking about good governance.  We welcome very much the improved level of engagement of the Houses of Oireachtas in the budgetary process.  We also believe there is a need to improve the transparency of the budget process in the years ahead and the commitment to do that in the programme for Government is very welcome.<\/p><p> We have been analysing and critiquing every budget since 1988.  Today, we get less information than we used to get 20 years ago in the budget documentation available on budget night.  Something is fundamentally wrong with that, especially in an era when we have all the modern technology, information and so on.  Those affected are not only the people outside.  It seems to us that Deputies and Senators should have access to all this information.  There is far more information than they are getting at the moment.<\/p><p> I will suggest a checklist of things the committee might look at for the future.  There is a need to address the issue of the fiscal rules.  The rules were put in place as a political solution to an economic problem and they will be changed eventually - I have no doubt whatsoever about that and I said as much years ago when the idea was being considered before it was put in place.  We discussed this at the Oireachtas committee at the time and what we predicted has come to pass.  We are now blocked from investing because of the rules.  We are blocked from picking up the money we need to undertake investment, although interest rates are low.  We need to substantially increase investment.<\/p><p> We need to expand the fiscal space as well.  We do that principally by broadening the tax base and recognising that we need to do precisely that.  We maintain that the full year cost of every change in budget 2018 should be available in the budget documentation when the budget is published.  Such information was not in the documentation this year.  There were 2017 numbers for 2017, but where taxation was concerned, in particular, the full year costs were not given.  As a result, the answers to parliamentary questions since then have shown a substantially higher full-year cost for the tax changes introduced in the budget.<\/p><p> The tax and expenditure carryover should be made available from the beginning.  It is not there.  The independent budget office should be appropriately staffed.  This is critical.  We would be concerned if the Oireachtas decided to farm out that work.  We believe the Oireachtas needs its own office, properly staffed, to do the new job of budgetary oversight required.  We are strongly of the view that this should be done.<\/p><p> Everyone should have access to analytical models.  For example, one model gets used a good deal and, although it was paid for 100% by the taxpayer, most people are not given access to it.  The organisation using it is able to make a good deal of money on it.  I am referring to the simulating welfare and income tax changes model in the ESRI.  I am not suggesting people should not use the SWITCH model.  However, if it is used, others should have access to it aside from ESRI staff.  All manner of assumptions and issues around modelling arise.  I am keen to see what the models are based on.  I suspect that many people around the Houses would also like to see these details.  Any models being used in the analysis, whether macroeconomic models or models like SWITCH for analysing welfare and so on, should be accessible and available to everyone.<\/p><p> Probably the most important thing that needs to be noted for the future is the point that unless we increase our overall tax take in a fair way - I am not emphasising income tax and I am making these qualifications specifically - we will not provide the infrastructure and social services for which Irish people have clearly indicated a preference.  Moreover, we will certainly not get anywhere close to the European continental average, especially the EU 15 average, which is where most Irish people believe we should be.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the engagement.  Ms Murphy and I are perfectly happy to answer questions or elaborate on anything members may want us to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Healy.

Should the solution to that problem be totally Government focused?  Should people have a role in it?<\/p> <p>  What would a gender-proofed budget look like?  How different would 2017 have been if the budget had gone through the gender budgeting process referred to by Ms O'Connor?

That is an interesting benchmark for the committee to reflect on and set.  Can Dr. Healy give us an idea of what the 1988 budget looked like?  Again, this may require further correspondence.  I do not imagine anyone in the room was here at that stage, although I am unsure about the clerk.  How did the presentation look then compared to now?

What we are saying is not contradictory in respect of pension tax reliefs.  The National Women's Council of Ireland is recommending a universal pension.  This would be a pension available for everyone that would come from the State.  That should be the priority.  Let us consider what other countries do as well as the needs of women.  Once we start putting in contribution requirements, we are immediately discriminating against people who spend time out to care.  That is what is happening.  We have a system of homemaker credits but they are rather limited.  That is one of the reasons we are calling for a universal pension as a model.  Then, if there is to be a second tier, it should be done through the PRSI system.  No private model of pensions recognises time out of work.  That should not be the case.  The system should be equal for men and women but it is not at the moment.  At the moment the career patterns of women end up changing significantly because of care responsibilities.  No private pension model is going to accommodate that.  When we look at the spend on pensions, we need to look at the income forgone on tax reliefs.  If the tax forgone was invested in a universal pension, then we would have a far more equitable pension model.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about the difference gender budgeting would make.  Let us consider the Scottish model.  Gender budgeting is a process all year round that involves consulting women's organisation and involves them in the process all the way through.  It also looks at the individual requests from various Departments and what the various impacts on women could be.  For example, let us consider the Department of Social Protection.  We would be considering factors such as the issues around lone parents.  If a gender budgeting process had been undertaken for this budget, the Government would probably have prioritised lone parents, because they were a particular group that experienced the most in cutbacks.  Issues such as the disregard for lone parents and how to make it easier for lone parents to move into employment are critical.  That is only one example.  The child care scheme would probably have come out well under gender-proofing.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider the Scottish model again.  As well as looking at individual Departments, the idea is to look at the overall spend and the associated impact on women.  Dr. Healy referred to the models we use in making a calculation.  We need to come up with a model that can look at impacts on women across the board in terms of overall spend.  That is part of the work we want to undertake with the committee.  I suppose that is what I meant when I said that this is not a tick the box exercise.  This can make a real difference to the lives of women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Reference was made to the pensions question.  We carried out a study, published in 2013, on how a universal pension could replace the old age pension at the level of the contributory old age pension.  We used actuarial numbers produced for the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We costed it through to 2046 and we showed how it could be paid for.  It can be done.<\/p><p>We have built in all the population increases, the changes in the pension age and all that sort of stuff.  We have worked out exactly how a universal pension might be developed over the years and how it might be tied to growth in the consumer price index, economic growth and so on.  The total net cost would be &euro;140 million.  It would have been funded partly by standard rating, not eliminating, the pension tax break that exists at the moment and a couple of other relatively small changes.  We will publish a fully updated version of that study within a month so it will be available for the budget of 2018.<\/p><p> The second question was on budget information.  I am delighted that Deputy Calleary picked up on the issue because we have tried to get people to hear about it for a while.  We are of the view that if Deputies and Senators realise that they used to be provided with a lot more information then they might be interested in chasing it.  Let me give an example.  For the first time in my life GNP was not mentioned in the budget documentation this year.  That is extraordinary.  Our organisation has been berated for years for using GDP.  The reason we used GDP was for international comparisons.  We always put in GNP for the total tax take and various other pieces such as how one counts  overseas development aid.  We always got dog's abuse for using GDP, with the point being we should always use GNP, but the Government's budget document does not contain a single reference to GNP, which I find extraordinary.  There are issues about why that has happened and they must be pursued.  <\/p><p> Let me give another example.  The full-year costs were always given.  In a normal budget one would get the actual proposal, one would get a column that said the cost for this budget period, which is 2017 in this case, and a full-year cost.  Some things are full year cost in year one but a lot of stuff is not full-year cost in year one.  Welfare changes can happen later in the year.  A whole lot of other stuff and even some of the proposed tax changes are not in place for a full year in 2017. <\/p><p> Let me outline a third issue in overall terms.  The budget has been laid out in a slightly different way.  The document went through budget initiatives Department by Department or budget heading by budget heading.  Let us take health as an example.  It said we are going to increase the budget in health by X and it then showed where that budget was broken down.  At this moment we are not getting that.  What we are getting is the budget will be increased by this, and we are going to send that to the HSE, which will come back to us with a service plan that will implement all of the existing level of service plus these three or five new initiatives we have proposed.  My point is there is no basis for it.  I have pointed at health because we are quite sure that the numbers are wrong in health and we have said so already.  By the way, we have said it before and were right each time, particularly about the health budget.  I am saying it again and we can give more information if people are interested. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>There will be more questions on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#F00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Earlier I informed the committee that I would have to leave at 2.30 p.m.  My colleague, Ms N&iacute; Chaithn&iacute;a, will take the rest of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Connor for her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#F00400","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Before Ms O'Connor leaves I thank her for her presentation.  I agree with the broad thrust of the excellent analysis from both the National Women's Council and Social Justice Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Healy touched on a good point that was picked up by Deputy Calleary.  I hope it is a matter that the committee will consider.  It is extremely frustrating what happened this year and even last year.  Some of the presentation of the budget document changes every year and, therefore, is difficult to follow.  This term we are well used at analysing the fiscal space, how much is available and where it is but one cannot find it in the document without the expertise or help of the general secretaries of the Departments, who very much engage with us but that is after the fact.  A lot of this is about controlling the narrative.  This is the first year that the full-year effects were not produced.  I believe it was a political stroke because it would have made it very clear on budget day that not only was the Government committing the 2017 budget but more than half of the 2018 budget.  We raised this matter a number of weeks ago and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has amplified it today.  The numbers should have been made available.  I hope that the committee can do something in respect of this type of work.  <\/p> <p>  I would welcome the updated paper on pensions.  The issue has been raised by the National Women's Council as well.  I ask Social Justice Ireland to submit the updated paper to this committee for consideration.<\/p> <p>  I shall start with the pensions issue and the statistics.  One proposal that we included in our alternative budget this year was on the discrimination between the pension system.  We proposed that the pension band rates be returned to their pre-September 2012 position because women, in particular, were discriminated against because of yearly average contributions and would be on a lower rate as a result of the changes in 2012.  I wish to say to the National Women's Council that the issue has gained no traction in the public domain.  It is a terrible inequality that needs to be addressed.  Simple issues are put forward such as, for example, that standardisation is bad because one will lose a few euro if one is getting a pension or paying into a pension in the first place.  The rates, pension bands and what happened in 2012 has become very complex for people to understand.  Earlier the council cited some staggering figures.  It stated that 84% of people who receive a full State contributory pension are men.  That fact needs to be put up in lights and stated repeatedly.  I ask the National Women's Council to elaborate on the universality of pensions and, in the interim, to address some of the issues that took place in the past that would generate a direct benefit to females and access to full State contributory pensions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#F00500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>In terms of the pension issue not being in the public light, the council agrees that despite much work on the matter over the years the issue has not been covered widely.

However, only 47,000 units will be produced under it by 2021.  That will still bring us only half way in dealing with the current problem, without any increase in the number of households.  There will, however, be an increase in the numbers on housing waiting lists because the demographics are changing.  It seemed to us that a different approach was required.  Despite all the pushing and shoving, the private sector did not seem to be able to generate a huge number of new builds.  We were proposing something different.  Perhaps the best way to deal with the problem is to look at it from the other side and see if we can take the 89,000 households out of the equation by building social housing for them.  Once they are taken out of the equation, one will have had a reduction of 89,000 households in the number looking for private rental accommodation.

Their incomes are so far removed from anything remotely close to what is required to get a mortgage to buy a house that they are not at the races.

From talking to people in local authorities, it seems that there is concern that central government is not really serious about building social housing.  There is a belief that it is really trying to get the housing market going again, that it will eventually create one almighty approved housing body that will be given the funding required to provide 100,000 social housing units over a period of time and that responsibility will be taken away from the local authorities.  That is the concern of some of the local authority officials with whom I have had discussions.  My basic position is that money could be made available at very lost, using off-the-books methodology which would require a rental cost approach and removing the ceiling in the differential rent system.  It is clear that there is the capacity to have an off-the-books mechanism to provide the funding needed to build units to eliminate the social housing problem.

I thank both organisations for all of their fantastic work which really helps to inform our understanding of these important issues every year.  I agree overwhelmingly with what the delegates have said.  I welcome their highlighting of the importance of access to analytical models and the proper staffing of the budgetary office.  I also welcome emphasis placed by them on spending on infrastructure and social services, as well as dealing with the pay and pensions gap for women.  On the latter, I have a question for the representatives of the National Women's Council of Ireland.  They mentioned the fact that precarious work - I would add outsourcing - was a major contributory factor to the pay gap for women.  What would the council propose to address that issue?  I have a few thoughts on it and the delegates may have mentioned some of them in their earlier presentation.  They include banning zero hour contracts, substantially increasing the minimum wage to make it a living wage and so forth.  What does the council believe we should do in that general area?<\/p> <p>  On the pensions gap, we have been discussing recently how a certain cohort of women who have worked for a long period and made total social insurance contributions which should make them eligible to receive the full contributory pension are not receiving it because they took a break at some point from paid work.  The payment is worked out based on yearly averages, as a result of which a large cohort of women are losing out.  I do not know if the delegates mentioned this earlier, but it suggests to me the pensions gap will actually widen in the coming years.  There is a large cohort of women who are reaching pension age who will be disadvantaged.  I agree with the council's recommendation of a universal pension as against providing private pension tax breaks.  <\/p> <p>  On the new child care scheme, is the council concerned that it will not start until September 2017?  The additional money allocated to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is very small, which suggests there is not a lot of funding available for the scheme, despite all the fanfare.  It appears that it will not make a significant difference because the amount of money necessary for it to be really effective has not been provided.  <\/p> <p>  I ask the representatives of the council to respond to these questions.

We need to address them radically because they are a major blockage to public investment in infrastructure, services and so forth.<\/p><p>They are a major blockage to the public investment programmes, infrastructure, services and public enterprise we need.<\/p><p> Dr. Healy mentioned housing.  I agree wholeheartedly with him that we will not solve this problem unless we get back to large-scale local authority housing provision.  I wish to dig into this a little more because it is an issue that has not come up much.  He also pointed to all the other problems in the current approach.  Does he agree with me that there is a very significant cost to the State in the approach being undertaken, as limited and unsatisfactory as it is?  He has outlined the numbers and the fact that the 47,000 units will not deal with the current numbers or those that will come on board.  So much of rebuilding Ireland depends on long-term leasing arrangements of one variety or another, whether HAPs, long-term leasing initiatives or whatever.  What is not being calculated even within the 47,000 is the long-term cost to the State.  All this money will be going out, and the amount will increase exponentially.  I do not think this has been drilled into.  I do not know if the witnesses agree with me or if they have thought about this, but it is a real question we must ask.  How much money will be going out over the years rather than into the creation of a fixed asset for the State and a local authority rather than privately leased housing from the State?  Could the witnesses comment on this?<\/p><p> My last question concerns an area where we have had some disagreements over the years, namely, the emphasis on not cutting taxes for middle income earners, whether USC, water and property taxes or whatever.  I wish to ask the witnesses about this again.  Social Justice Ireland always rightly emphasises the issue of equality.  Is it not the case that in the context of about 50% of workers, even those who earn what are called middle incomes, effectively no longer being solvent, it is entirely right for us to champion their getting to a point at which their earnings can afford the basics?  To take housing as the biggest cost for people, such is its high cost that housing alone is making people effectively insolvent even if they are in the middle income earning bracket.  The real problem is that, rather than opposing tax breaks at this level, which might bring the middle income earners up a little as well as the low income earners, the area we really need to go after is corporate tax.  I know the witnesses would agree with that, but there needs to be much more emphasis on this and on genuine wealth taxes.  These are the areas where, it seems to me, a huge amount of money is not addressed properly in budgets, even in the discussions surrounding them.  It is addressed by Social Justice Ireland, but it seems to me that successive Governments are just not interested in this area at a time when profits and profit share as against wage share have gone through the roof.  There seems to be no interest in a redistributive tax system, which is what we need to go for, or the recent CSO figures, which I think show that the wealthiest 10% have increased their share of all wealth from 42% to 54%.  This is the problem.  This is what is exacerbating inequality.  We need to target in a very focused way this 10% and profits as the way to redistribute in a serious way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#H00800","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I will respond to the question about housing and part of Deputy Boyd Barrett's last question.  There is a huge long-term cost to HAP, and this is the challenge.  If the private rented sector is relied on to provide social housing, there will be a significant long-term cost to the State.  That is why we have argued and continue to argue that the social housing element of the housing crisis in which we find ourselves needs to be separated out from and addressed separately to the private rented sector.  We made this argument in our presentation to the special Oireachtas committee on housing.  Of the numbers for housing announced in the budget, the majority, 15,000, are to be delivered through HAP, so only 4,450 will actually be constructed.  This is the real challenge.  The building of a social housing unit is a one-off cost to the State, and the State then has an asset.  If a cost-rental system is then introduced, the State can generate some income from the asset.<\/p> <p>  Second, to touch on the question regarding income taxes and tax cuts, the statistics show that those on middle incomes earn between &euro;27,000 and &euro;30,000 per annum, so any tax cuts for them will be very small.  What should be done is investment in the social wage or, in other words, reducing their cost of living.  This is done by investing in child care, public transport, health, education and so on because there is no way income tax can be reduced so much as to give middle income earning individuals enough money in their pockets to purchase all these services in the private market.  Therefore, the cost of living needs to be reduced.  In order to do so, there needs to be investment in the collective social wage, from which all of us benefit.  Some of us contribute more than others, but we would never be able to afford all these services on our own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>The issue of the fiscal rules was raised.  We published a briefing at the time of the proposed reform and the referendum for an Oireachtas committee that was examining the matter.  This was before the referendum on the fiscal rules.  We pointed out that the measures were quite dangerous.  We set out what would happen, which is exactly what has happened.  What has happened is that we now have the capacity within the country to build the infrastructure and develop services up to European average levels but are hindered in doing so because we cannot access the money due to the fiscal rules.  We pointed out at the time - I believe this even more so now, and we are joined in our concerns by many serious people, big names - that the fiscal rules are not really solutions to the economic issues with which they were meant to deal.  Quite recently, we met with the IMF evaluation unit that is examining the IMF's evaluation of its proposals for Ireland at the start of the bailout.  It is quite clear that it now recognises that it could have got the same results for far less austerity and job losses, which were the two critical issues over which we argued with the IMF every three months during its visits here over all those years.<\/p> <p>  How can the fiscal rules be dealt with?  There are a number of proposals.  We are not alone in this: the French, the Italians and others have suggestions as to how to deal with them.  One very good one, from my perspective, and which I would recommend, is that money going towards investment should not be counted in the calculation at all.  If one builds a house, as Ms Murphy has said, it is built.  It does not have to be built again next year.  Therefore, it is a kind of one-off investment.  This kind of investment in infrastructure should not be included in the calculation.  This is quite different from wage increases or new employees that will recur in the following years.  However, if this suggestion were acted on, Ireland would have more than sufficient space, and the money is there to be borrowed.  Our problem will be that the time would have passed and the interest rates would have risen before Europe gets around to doing it.  In a decade or two or three, people will look back on this generation of politicians and Governments and ask what possessed them, when money was available at a rate of 1% to Government, not to access it to provide the infrastructure that they will have spent decades having to put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>What about the state aid rules, as a linked issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#K00100","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I take a similar approach to the state aid rules.  We need to recognise that Ireland started out, when it joined the European Union, at something like 75% or 78% of the European average - our infrastructure is not at the European 15 average at all.  I do not think anybody claims that it is and the same applies to our services.  While we would like to have the best in Europe, people believe that we should have at least the European average.  We have to recognise that we are substantially below that.  Therefore, the state aid rules, the fiscal rules and other rules, as well as issues relating to bailouts, austerity and the speed at which we need to reduce debt and so on need to bear in mind that the country at the end of the day needs to put the infrastructure in place to give it the capacity to develop an economy and a society that can maintain itself through the various economic cycles that will come.  We will have crashes in the future, just as we have had them in the past.  That is the nature of the economic cycle.<\/p> <p>  On the third issue about not cutting taxes on middle-income earners, it is important to note what we have proposed.  For example, we referred to things that would have made a difference to people on PAYE.  Our budget submission proposed to increase the PAYE tax credit; to make tax credits refundable - that would have benefitted low-income people and not middle-income people, but it would have been very positive.  We proposed standard rating so that the benefits of the tax breaks are at the same percentage meaning that somebody on 40% does not get twice the tax break for a pension, or whatever, that somebody on a lower income gets.<\/p> <p>  We also proposed reform of the research and development tax credit to remove the refund element of that.  The most important one for us was to introduce a minimum effective corporation tax rate.  We have no doubt that that can be done and it should apply to all profits coming through the country and not just what is declared to be profits by some grouping, whether that is a company, the Revenue, the Department of Finance or whatever.<\/p> <p>  We agree with tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, as well as taxing empty housing or underdeveloped land.  We need to restore the windfall gain tax on rezoned land which had been introduced but was removed in 2015 just when it was starting to make some impact.  It could not have made any impact before that - as there was no land on sale, there were no windfall gains.  The introduction of a financial transactions tax was another example.<\/p> <p>  In the longer overall approach, we do not believe we need to go as far as even having the European average tax take as a percentage of GDP, but we need to move towards it.  We are a long way below it; along with a few of the eastern European countries we are very close to the bottom in the European tax leagues.  We need to change our approach in that context.  Then we can make choices.  For example, there are issues to do with resource taxes.  We need to think more about how we address climate change and promote environmental protection through the tax system.  There are many issues there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Dr. Healy referred to Ireland having a lower tax take.

It is necessary to look at the overall tax take.  The OECD has a methodology for doing this.  EUROSTAT has a slightly different version of that.

I read the submission from the National Women's Council, which correctly pointed to a significant policy change in this budget.  It is a very specific and welcome intervention to provide child care support for low-income families specifically using registered child care facilities.  The second payment cannot be called a universal payment.  How can it be called a universal payment when a full category of parents - usually women - who are caring for children themselves or are caring through a relative are not entitled to any such payment?<\/p><p>I have a fundamental concern that we have made that significant policy change and that the implication will be very significant in making it difficult for those who want to care themselves.  For example, in Dublin where property is so expensive, if one form of child care is supported by the State, which is welcome, and another form is not, the other one becomes increasingly unviable with resultant social consequences.  I recently had an exchange with the Minister, Deputy Zappone, in the D&aacute;il about Senator Elizabeth Warren's book <i>The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Parents Are Going Broke<\/i>.<\/p><p>I accept the need to support parents particularly in low-income families where we want to tackle poverty, but I am really concerned that the method discriminates against parents who may want to raise children at home or use a relative.  I cannot understand or accept the word &quot;universal&quot; being used because it see it as the very opposite of universal - if we are supporting one type of care why are we not supporting another kind of care?<\/p><p>I have a philosophical question.  In a sense we have sold our souls to an American, OECD or European Commission job-activation measure which is all about getting the economy going and getting as many people working as possible, and does not value caring because it is telling a category of parents using one type of caring that we do not value that type of caring.  I do not criticise the intention of supporting those on lower incomes in particular who are using child care, with which I absolutely agree.  However, why should we make this policy change where we do not leave it to the parent to decide what is best?  Historically, that was the approach taken.  Every family and every child is different and living in different circumstances.  The parents are in the best position to choose the appropriate care model.  Why is the National Women's Council supporting a system that discriminates against those who choose a particular model?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#K00600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>That has been the crux of the debate, has it not?  There are a couple of pieces.  A core priority in the National Women's Council's work is to increase economic independence for women.  There are a number of reasons for that.  Without economic independence, women are more vulnerable in society.  That is a fact.  In addition, they are more vulnerable to violence, domestic abuse and so on.  Economic independence is a crucial element of women's equality in society.  Providing subsidised child care is a key element of ensuring women participate in the labour market and in other forms of civic engagement.  That is where we are coming from.  We do not at all suggest that providing support for women who are working and women who have the option of staying in the home should be preclusive.  It should not be mutually exclusive.  It should not be one or the other.  The National Women's Council has been talking very clearly about what providing a subsidised model of child care allows.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The National Women's Council has been working on this for about a decade.  Over the past decade, at least, we have heard consistently on the radio, certainly before every budget, that there needs to be a child care model subsidised by the State and that child care levels are precluding women from entering the workforce.  That has to be addressed.  This initiative is the first step in addressing that.  We reject the idea that it should be a matter of one or the other.  There should be other supports for women who are caring for their children in the home.  The National Women's Council does not suggest at all that there should be one or the other.  That, of course, is a choice that needs to be made by a woman and the family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#L00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Eil&iacute;s N&iacute; Chaithn&iacute;a"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Is that not what we have here?  The definition in the policy change is such that it is preclusive.  The previous approach was through child benefit and other mechanisms, which were genuinely universal, to target parents with young children, in particular, and support them.  Admittedly, there was an increase to the home carer's benefit but it is marginal.  Some &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million was allocated for hundreds of thousands of people so it is almost negligible.  Therefore, what has been introduced is discriminatory by definition.  I do not hear the National Women's Council arguing for equal supports for individuals at home, largely women.  What we are getting is an non-equal approach.<\/p> <p>  I have a point on seeking economic independence.  The argument for it goes without saying.  Let us go back to Senator Elisabeth Warren's evidence that giving economic independence to everyone working all the time actually decreases economic independence in the end.  The experience in the United States is that it has led to massive levels of bankruptcy and difficulties, particularly for those couples in a dual-income trap.  Their cost base increased because of the competitive bidding up of prices of housing, health care, child care and so on.  This leads to an economy in which, if anything happens in a family in respect of a child with a disability, special needs, special circumstances, illness or other life circumstances demanding flexibility, there is not economic independence but a precarious economic situation.  Evidence presented very clearly by Senator Elizabeth Warren is that the outcome is not independence.  This is what the United States has created and what we are replicating here.  It is actually an economic growth model that leads to economic uncertainty and difficulties in the long run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#L00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The universal child care model we have been talking about and the first step taken by the Minister is not being presented as the panacea for what is becoming a much more precarious environment.

This is often due to <i>de facto<\/i>unconscious gender bias in that the officers assume the women want to go into the types of roles that women go into, thus forcing them into sectors such as the retail and hospitality sectors, where they will be stuck in low-paid, precarious jobs.<br\/><br\/>There is a range of measures.

The report considered not only child care providers who provide care in their own homes and the question of how parents who want to care for their children at home can be supported.  One would hope this is the beginning of a suite of measures.  This requires an approach that is much broader than one budget.  My concern, which was echoed by some members of this committee, is the very limited resources allocated to the Department.  There is no multiannual budgeting.  We will certainly be bringing this up when the Minister is having a policy consultation on the strategy for children between zero and six.  I am sure this will come up.

There is more to meaningful work than a paid job.  We need to think in those terms.  We are thinking about shaping up society and the economy for the changes that are coming.  The changes in digitalisation and technology that are coming down the line are going to lead to major job losses in some sectors.  We need to recognise that even in that world, if we cannot replace the jobs with other paid employment, people still have a right to work.

I have a meeting to get to that started 20 minutes ago and it is taking a lot of time for people to make a contribution.  That is not specifically directed at Deputy Ryan.  I just want to get my questions on the record, but I really have to run.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Healy referred to the need to have an adult conversation.  I put it to him that we need to have a conversation in this country about what we are willing to do to have certain services, a basic income and a universal pension.  We will have to pay a lot of tax to fund that.  We are at loggerheads because we do not want to pay excessive taxes, yet we want all of these fantastic services.  It is about having that conversation about how one strikes that balance.  Deputy Ryan has asked about how to broaden the tax base.  What are Dr. Healy's suggestions for doing that because we will be having a conversation about it?  The Chairman has already spoken to Dr. Healy about his suggestion that we collect one of the lowest amounts of tax in Europe.  It does not feel like that for most people.  I acknowledge that Dr. Healy answered on the PRSI issue, but does he have any comments to make around the tax bands and the ways to broaden the tax base, increase revenues and make things a little bit fairer?<\/p> <p>  I note Dr. Healy's comments that we are underfunding the education sector.  I have an institute of technology in my constituency which is at risk of closing next year.  It was put to me very simply that if it were a private company, it would be going into examinership in January.  That is how badly off it is.  It is not just that institute of technology; it is the entire sector.  While the universities are a little better able to weather the storm, institutes of technology are under severe pressure.  I would welcome Dr. Healy's thoughts on that given the Cassell's report we had in the past number of months.<\/p> <p>  To the National Women's Council, I note that I do not need to reiterate what everyone else has said about the pensions issue.  It is disgraceful and shocking that women are being so disadvantaged.  I welcome the council's research on that which definitely helps to inform us as to how we fix that issue.  The bottom line is that it needs to be fixed.  The reality is that women were forced out of the workplace through laws we passed and we are now penalising them for it.  I want to get some comments from the council on parental leave and how it might address the gender pay gap.  Sometimes the gender pay gap is thought to be a matter of two people being paid different rates for the same job.  It is actually not that.  It is the average incomes of men versus the average incomes of women and women earn less.  While there are often situations where one is getting paid less for the same work, it is also that one is in lower paid or part-time employment and all of those things.  Access to parental leave might level the playing field a little so that one has access to those higher earning jobs and greater career progression.<\/p> <p>  Both groups touched in their reports on the situation of under-25s and social welfare rates.  I have said before and repeat for the record that it is clear discrimination on the basis of age.  We expect those people to pay full taxes in employment, yet we do not offer them the same social protections.  I welcome the witnesses' comments on that.  It is good to have it on the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#M00300","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>There is enough in that batch before we get to Deputy Donnelly.

We made a presentation and suggested that here should be a very generous water allowance for all households depending on the number of people there and all excess water should be charged for.  It sounds familiar, does it not?  In fact, it sounded really familiar reading this morning's papers.  Most Irish people would be fair about that if the other piece that needed to be put in was there.  That piece is serious and substantial investment to deal with leaks and sewage issues that are not being addressed.  For us, it is quite clear how we should have proceeded in the first place.  The problem was that it got caught up in a whole lot of other stuff that did not necessarily have a great deal to do with water but had to do with people suffering with too much austerity, which I have already talked about.  Some of the pressure for that, at least, came from outside the country.<\/p> <p>  On public sector pay, we are very aware of the fact that any increase in public sector pay, not just this coming year, but any time, involves a choice about resources.  Obviously, people need to be paid the going rate for the job, whatever that happens to be, but in times of scarce resources choices have to be made between infrastructure, services, pay and a range of other issues.  We suggest very strongly that all sectors of society should be engaged in that process.  Formerly, we had a process for doing that in social partnership, which was perhaps imperfect albeit not as bad as it is sometimes portrayed to be.  I am not saying we should go back to social partnership as it was, but I am saying that unless we involve all sectors of society in the decision making this requires, parts of society will not support the decisions and one will wind up to the broken approach to development that we see in politics in Britain, the USA and, possibly, other European countries.<\/p> <p>  The only thing I said in the public arena at the Brexit forum organised by the Taoiseach was that I was interested in, supported and welcomed the fact that there was a great deal of focus on the consequences of Brexit.  Until I stood up and made the point, however, there was not one comment on the causes of Brexit.  Unless we deal with the causes of Brexit, that type of thing will come again from another country in another space.  It could even happen in Ireland.  The issues that have to be addressed in that context are very close to the issues that have to be addressed when choices are made with relatively scarce resources between pay and tax and tax cuts and infrastructure and service development.<\/p> <p>  Certainly, we need a conversation on the cost of universal services.  The numbers we have looked at very closely over a long time suggest we can deliver universal services and infrastructure at a level that is at the European average but for slightly less than the European average tax take.  However, we cannot do it for as little as we have at the moment.  Deputy Chambers said it did not feel like we were a low-tax country.  I accept that a lot of people feel that way.  It is partly due to a certain kind of socialisation into the idea that we are high-tax country.  It is never presented that tax is a contribution we make as citizens to the development of our own infrastructure, services, protection and all the rest of it.  If we compare ourselves to the Nordic countries, they take 50% of our tax take again on top of what we have.  They have no issue about it and cutting it is not in issue no matter who is in government because they deliver services and infrastructure.

Will somebody then be willing to make a decision and say that we need more funding for higher education and then make the difficult choice about how that is done?  We should have a discussion about whether we want the service and whether a student charge should be introduced.  Even if that is done, the amount of State expenditure and funding will have to be increased.  That is a discussion that needs to be had in the context of the question about services and taxes.

I thank the Deputy for her support for many of the positions we are putting forward, which is really heartening to hear.  There is a really low take-up of parental leave in Ireland because it is not paid.  The National Women's Council has welcomed the introduction of two weeks paid paternity leave.  In addition to that, there is a need for the introduction of paid parental leave.  We will continue to push for that and we hope to see committee-wide support for it.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the gender pension gap, there are a range of steps that need to be taken.  It would be really heartening and welcomed if the committee put a motion forward to prioritise the issue of pensions over the next year and, in particular, to push for a reduction in the gender pension gap.  That could be done by suggesting an open consultation on the introduction of the universal pension and by the introduction of a homemaker's credit backdated to 1973.  If those two steps were taken in the first instance we would be a long way closer to reducing the gender pension gap.  I can send around our most recent submission on the universal pension so the committee has the information.  <br\/><br\/>We have been pushing for gender inequality budgeting.  There will be a &euro;5 increase for contributory pensions, but because it is<i>pro rata <\/i>it will not have the same benefits for women as it will for men.  There are all these introductions of what seem to be very promising first steps to increasing people's economic sustainability, in comparison to the past seven years, yet they are not doing what they need to for women and what they are doing for men.  Gender inequality budgeting would allow the women of Ireland to see how much the Government prioritises their economic independence and general well-being.  It would empower women to argue for particular actions to be taken if they could see very clearly the difference between the impacts of Government decisions in each budget.  That can only be done if really effective gender inequality budgeting is introduced.  Gender inequality budgeting should not just look at expenditure, which is what we focused on today, but also on revenue.  That is being done in Austria, Sweden and Scotland.  We will be bringing together experts on that, which we can bring to the committee's attention.

I was gobsmacked at the cacophony of negativity that it was greeted with.  The witness summed it up well.  It is the first step in a fundamentally different direction.  I was stunned to hear so many people stand up and just give out about it.

It is expensive; it was costed at about &euro;700 million.  That is a chunk of change in anyone's book.  There are an increasing number of people who have either retired or are close to retirement, particularly women as was pointed out earlier, who are finding they do not meet the contributory pension eligibility criteria and do not qualify for the non-contributory pension because they are a so-called dependent.<\/p> <p>  I have looked in the last few weeks into the minutiae of the detail and it turns out that if one works for ten years, one gets the full pension.  If people were unfortunate enough to work for three weeks after their leaving certificate back in the 1970s or if they work for 25 years, they could find themselves with less.  Typically what is happening is worse than that.  As men worked and got the stamps, it is nearly always women who were unfortunate enough to be signed up to a month's work or a year's work and then there is a big gap.  As the witnesses pointed out, it has not gone back far enough in terms of the home-makers and so on.  How big a problem is the National Women's Council finding this is?  The witnesses have clearly done a lot of thinking around the State pension.  Deputies have a very strange view of the world.  They are a bit like doctors, who might think that everyone in Ireland is sick because they only ever meet sick people.<\/p><p>Deputies only tend to meet people who are in trouble, so they do not have a very good sense of what is actually going on.

It showed quite clearly that the actual figure at that point was &euro;140 million.  The committee then brought in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners and the first thing they did was cut their estimate from &euro;3 billion to &euro;700 million.  The committee then asked us whether we would be prepared discuss the matter and get our technical people, who produce the actual spreadsheets, to sit down with officials from the Department of Finance and the Revenue.  It was actually Revenue that was really doing the calculations.  We said we would do so.  An hour after that meeting began, Revenue halved its figure to &euro;350 million.  There was no further engagement on the issue.  We stand by our figure and we are also producing a fully updated version of it.  Like the 2013 figure, it is based on actuarial numbers used by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance and the actual costings and is clearly done on the basis of population projections.  We will use the new population projections on the basis of the new census.  Finally, we show how it can be paid for through standard rating and a number of other small changes - nothing dramatic.  Given that the figure is &euro;140 million, it is not a huge amount.  It is a totally different type of animal to &euro;700 million in a budget context.

They get a great deal of abuse for being \"freeloaders\" even though they pay VAT, levies and so forth.<\/p> <p>  Taking people out of the tax net and lowering what they pay in tax have little value to people on low-to-middle incomes if services and infrastructure do not replace, and more than replace, the money that has been taken away.  There is a balance to be found between the money that people are contributing to society in tax and the investment in services delivered for same.  Ireland's problem is that our infrastructure and services are far below the European average and our tax take is commensurate with that, and if we want to give people an advantage, we reduce taxes further instead of increasing infrastructure, for example, broadband and social housing, or improving services, be they health, education or something else.<\/p> <p>  The tax take should rise over time towards the European average - it does not necessarily need to reach it - principally through broadening the tax base.  That money should then be used for investing in better services and so on.

I want to go back to a point made by the Chairman on the level of taxation.  This committee spent some time looking at where we are at regarding public spending.  Reference was made to Mr. Seamus Coffey, who said that we are a lower tax economy and a lower spend economy, however the majority of that lower spend and lower tax is in social insurance as seen in pensions.  Mr. Coffey said that when one actually strips out other European social spend, and when we look at the national accounts and strip out social insurance contributions including employers' PRSI, and we strip out the fact that Ireland has a really low State pension, which is paltry - a lot of other countries have a contribution-based pension - then according to Mr. Coffey actually our total spend on other public services and out total revenue raised are in and around the European average.  I contacted Mr. Coffey and asked for the data on this and I am still waiting on a  reply.  That is, however, what he told the committee and it is my understanding that he knows this stuff quite well.  If we assume that he is broadly correct - there may be technicalities - and if we assume that what he is saying is directionally correct, would the National Women's Council and Social Justice Ireland be in favour of moving in both places?  Would they say that they want to see higher social insurance contributions of probably a mixture of individual contributions and employer contributions, and that we would move from a relatively flat-based pension support system to a contribution-based system?  This would mean that people on higher incomes would end up with higher pensions so it is not a perfect choice.  What is Dr. Healy's view on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#Q00400","speaker":"1230"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I am going to have to leave after this question as I am already 25 minutes late for a meeting with another very serious body.  I wish to be very clear on this.  Our proposal has been that there should be two separate initiatives.  One is the introduction of a universal State pension along the lines that we have spoken about, put the cost of it down and go for that.  On the other side we have also proposed that the State create its own pension fund into which any worker could put money throughout their lives that would be managed by NTMA or such a body with a similar level of competence, and that would basically be able to outperform, we would think, market-driven stuff where lots of profits must be taken from the funds.  In the context of our proposal, it would simply be the State that was supporting it.  This is probably the best way to do it because the critically important thing for us is that with the changing world into which we face, people are going to have much more uneven engagement with the world of employment throughout their lives.  The idea of a permanent job for life, in the same place and paying a family wage is long gone.  The new world of work would be much better served by universal pension on one side, basic income in the normal working years and pension contributions if people want to top up by putting in whatever they like and have the State run the fund.  We could leave the pensions funds there that are currently there but the proposal would be that the State would also provide one that was reliable and not likely to take half of the fund or people losing huge chunks of their pension funds simply because the people who are running the funds are taking a huge amount of the money - which has been the experience of people over the years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":119,"content":"<p>A dual system, State-based with full transparency and so on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#Q00600","speaker":"1230"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>The committee will excuse me but my colleague, Ms Murphy, will stay on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016113000002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Healy and I thank the National Women's Council and Social Justice Ireland for their presentations and in answering a lot of questions.

The three of us will give a short presentation between us.  I am joined by Ms Kate O'Connell, our community and youth worker, and Mr. Pablo Rojas Coppari, our policy and research officer.  Usually, somebody who is affected by the issue would present with us.  However, because of the nature of the issue we are dealing with and the fact that the proceedings are televised, young people did not want to appear on camera or be visible.  A number of undocumented young people are with us today so members are welcome to speak to them afterwards if they so wish.<\/p> <p>  Migrant Rights Centre Ireland has been in existence for approximately 15 years and has been working with undocumented people during that time.  We appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality two weeks ago in respect of this issue and the broader regularisation of undocumented people in the State.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality will be coming before that committee in the coming weeks to discuss the regularisation of undocumented people.<\/p> <p>  I will provide some background.  Migrant Rights Centre Ireland estimates that there are between 20,000 and 26,000 undocumented people in the State.  We also estimate that there are between 2,000 and 5,000 undocumented children and young people under 18 in the State.  An infographic accompanying our submission states that we surveyed over 1,000 undocumented people and found that 84% of them have lived in the State for five years or more and that 89% are working.  These are the parents of the undocumented children and young people we are talking about.<\/p> <p>  Since the 2005 referendum, children born in this State do not have the right to citizenship or residency.  A person is not required to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, when he or she is under 16.  An individual only registers when he or she is over 16.  Children are dependent on their parents' status for their own status.  Therefore, children born to undocumented parents have no independent status because they are tied to their parents until they are 18.<\/p><p> We refer to the children with whom we work having a triple vulnerability in that they are vulnerable as children, as migrants and because they are undocumented.  I intend to focus in my introduction on three issues for these children, namely, the fear and stigma they face, the impact on their mental health and the prospect for them of a restricted or blocked future.  Through our work with young people in the past 15 years and particularly through the Young, Paperless and Powerful campaign since 2015, these are the main issues we are encountering.  Children become aware of their parents' immigration status from an early age.  It is a secret they must hide and there is no scope to be open about this aspect of their lives.  This can have a massive impact on their mental health and well-being and prove detrimental to their progression.  Many of the young people we speak to believe garda&iacute; can come into their homes, take them away and summarily deport them.  Although this is not the case, the perception is that it can happen at any time.  It is a massive worry to bear as a young person.<\/p><p> There is often huge mistrust of authority because of this fear of deportation, which means people are reluctant to report crimes.  A group of young people we worked with were attacked on the street in a racist incident but were afraid to go to the Garda to seek support and assistance and report that crime.  Young people in this situation often feel they need to protect their families and so avoid situations where they might have to disclose their own or their parents' undocumented status.  They very much act as protectors of their parents, which is a huge burden to have to take on.  We see a great deal of stress, anxiety and depression among young people in this regard.  In addition, many young people are dislocated in terms of not having access to their extended families in their countries of origin.  Migrant children often have multiple identities.  Children we work with talk about being Irish but also having another identity which, nevertheless, they do not really understand because they are unable to make a connection with their extended families.  Many young migrants arrived here at a young age and have not returned to their home country since.<\/p><p> In terms of restricted futures, young undocumented migrants are engaged throughout secondary school but when the time comes to sit the leaving certificate, their futures become very uncertain.  There is a loss of hope as they deal with the reality that they do not have a right to go to college or work.  Faced with that scenario, some young people give up and others work harder.  It is a very mixed bag in terms of how people progress.  The State invests in these young people at primary and secondary level but they cannot proceed to third level because they are subject to international fees which can be tens of thousands of euro.  Their parents are often working in low-income jobs and cannot afford to send their children to college.  We are seeing a trend where young people who have turned 18 are entering into low-paid work and potentially exploitative conditions of employment.  A cycle of potential poverty is being perpetuated because these young people do not have access to training or education and cannot transfer the skills, talents and experiences they have amassed over their years in school.<\/p><p> I will be pleased to take questions from members in due course.  Before that, I ask my colleague, Ms Kate O'Connell, to tell the committee more about the work we are doing with children and young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016113000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel McGinley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I am a community-based youth worker for the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, which has been working with undocumented migrants and migrants in general for many years.  Over time, more undocumented young people began to come to our attention, attend our centre and turn up in our campaign groups.  These young people were looking for a space where they could come together and try to reclaim some power over their lives and futures.  They were seeking collective spaces where they could be with other people who faced the same issues, let their guard down and share experiences.  We formed Young, Paperless and Powerful, YPP, in May 2015 and have been working together for 18 months.  It is a creative, dynamic and fun-filled space, although serious issues are also discussed.  The participants have taken part in a number of creative actions over the lifetime of the project.  For example, they created a mural on Dame Lane in Dublin city centre, which I encourage members to see.  It uses the motif of a bird flying from a cage and the motto &quot;Sky is the Limit, not Papers&quot;.  It was the first endeavour which sought to lay down a marker and allow these young people to try to retake control in their lives and effect change for themselves.<br\/><br\/>YPP has made many powerful friends in the past 18 months.  On International Youth Day we had a spoken-word event that was opened by the Ombudsman for Children.  Our campaign has been endorsed by more than 50 business, civil society and community groups, including the Children's Rights Alliance, the National Youth Council of Ireland, For&oacute;ige and the Union of Students in Ireland.  Unfortunately, we are unable to show a video today that was made by the group, but the link is included in our document and I urge members to watch it.  We are trying to bring the voices of young people into this space but, as Ms McGinley noted, there is a challenge in doing that.  I intend now to read a short case study of one of the young people in our group, Sara Jane, which helps to give a sense of the lives of these young people.  Second, I will read a short spoken word piece written by one of our participants as part of a creative project.<br\/><br\/>Sara Jane is 17 years old and has been undocumented for nine years.  She was eight years old when she first moved to Ireland from Mauritius to join her parents, nine months after they had come to the State.  Her parents came to Ireland with student visas, which do not allow dependants, and were unable to apply for official family reunification.  Despite significant efforts, Sara Jane's father was unable to transition to a work permit visa after seven years of studying and residing regularly in Ireland.  As a result, he became undocumented and Sara Jane was unable to regularise her status when she turned 16.  Sara Jane's parents continue to work and pay taxes in Ireland.  Sara Jane is now in sixth year in secondary school and wants to study law.  The reality, however, is that unless she can regularise her status, her family will not be able to pay the enormous international fees needed to take up any CAO offer of a place in university.  This is despite her parents' significant and continuous tax contribution over the past nine years.<br\/><br\/>The author of the spoken-word piece graciously workshopped it with me yesterday afternoon, so I hope to do it justice.  It reads as follows:<\/p><blockquote>Why do I have to feel this way ?<br \/><br \/>Why? <br \/><br \/>I'm trapped.<br \/><br \/>I feel imprisoned<br \/><br \/>Suffocating,<br \/><br \/>Strapped down,<br \/><br \/>Immobilised,<br \/><br \/>Unfree.<br \/><br \/>Unable to grow<br \/><br \/>Unable to escape<br \/><br \/>I'm silently going through my everyday tasks<br \/><br \/>But on the inside I'm screaming to break out<br \/><br \/>I hate small talk and pursuing small empty dreams<br \/><br \/>I'm scared I'm going to end up <br \/><br \/>Like everyone in this place<br \/><br \/>And it's slowly driving me insane<br \/><br \/>But how do I escape?<br \/><br \/>If only you know what goes through our minds when we're all looking into our phone screen to block ourselves from reality<br \/><br \/>Cause reality has become too depressing<br \/><br \/>No one has ever asked me this question...<br \/><br \/>'Are you really okay '<br \/><br \/>I'd break down if anyone does but I'll still say yes with a smile on my face<br \/><br \/>Because ....<br \/><br \/>Because this world taught me that as a young person you don't matter.<br \/><br \/>You're not worth it.

I want to take members through the recent developments that led to our making a presentation today.  As my colleague, Ms McGinley, mentioned, we have been in front of the Committee on Justice and Equality on two occasions addressing the issue of undocumented migrants, including children.  We made a presentation to the previous justice committee a year ago.  Its Chairman is now the Minister of State with responsibility for immigration, Deputy David Stanton.  The committee's report following our presentation in November 2015 recommended the introduction a regularisation scheme for undocumented migrants and children.  It was a reasonable and strong recommendation.  The committee wrote to the Minister for Justice and Equality in this regard seeking a response.  That was in November 2015.  In a presentation to the Committee on Justice and Equality two weeks ago, the Chairman and members felt strongly that a solution must be found for undocumented migrants, including children, in this context.<\/p> <p>  When the D&aacute;il rose in February, there was cross-party support for the introduction of a regularisation scheme, as recommended by the justice committee and the human rights committee.  That was followed in February 2016 by the recommendation made by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  In reviewing Ireland's progress on realising its international commitments under the UN convention, the committee concluded that all children are entitled to full protection and the implementation of their rights under the convention irrespective of their parents' legal status.  It recommended that Ireland expeditiously adopt a comprehensive legal immigration framework in accordance with international legal standards and ensure it provided formal procedures for conferring immigration status on children and their families who are in an irregular migration situation.<\/p> <p>  In July 2016, Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and the young people's empowerment group met members of the advisory council of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to discuss the issues facing children and young people in Ireland and the policy solution of introducing regularisation.  A request for a meeting has been sent to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, to discuss the issue.  We are awaiting a response on the matter.<\/p> <p>  Let me highlight two actions taken since July.  In September 2016, as members are familiar, the United Nations held a migrant and refugee summit in which one of the core points was on addressing the needs of children in migration.  The outcome of the summit is what is called the New York declaration.  There was heavy input by the Irish Government through its representation in New York.  There was a commitment to address the needs of migrant children and refugees.  That commitment has been followed by Commissioner Jourov&aacute; in the European Commission.  Yesterday, the European Commission held what is called the European Forum on the Rights of the Child, one of the priorities of which involved addressing the circumstances of migrant children and the adoption of an EU action plan on children in migration.  One of the outcomes of both the New York declaration and the EU forum was on the adoption of immigration systems that have the best interest of the child at their core.  As my colleague said, Ireland does not have an immigration system that has the best interest of the child at its core.  The issue we are hearing about today, that of undocumented children and young people, is the consequence.<\/p> <p>  I have submitted documentation on the proposal that Migrant Rights Centre Ireland has put to the Committee on Justice and Equality to address the circumstances of undocumented migrants, including children.  We believe these are the minimum standards that must be implemented to address the issue of undocumented migrants, including children, and to meet our commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the recommendations to implement a regularisation scheme for undocumented children and their families.  As such, I will not go into the details of the proposal but I will be happy to take questions afterwards.<\/p> <p>  Let me conclude by outlining our recommendations for this committee.  We urge the committee to consider the implications of irregular status on the realisation of commitments made by the State under the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures national policy framework, particularly in so far as it relates to two commitments.  Commitment No. 2.22 commits the State to strengthening social inclusion measures and reinvigorating efforts to improve educational outcomes among, and the integration of, migrant children.  Commitment 3.7 is to introduce and enact an immigration, residence and protection Bill to address comprehensively the interaction of migrant children with the immigration system and introduce a children-centred immigration policy.<\/p> <p>  Our main recommendation for today is that this committee urge the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to introduce a regularisation scheme that will address the recommendation from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and offer a pragmatic solution to undocumented families and children living in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016113000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pablo Rojas Coppari"},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Rojas Coppari, Ms O'Connell and Ms McGinley for their presentations.

Generally, parents enter the State on tourist visas and student visas and they may overstay.  Children enter in various ways.  They join their families on tourist visas or use other forms of entry to the State.  We are not really talking about direct provision or the refugee system but about an immigration system that is separate from asylum and refugee issues.  Really, we are talking about immigration.  Since children are linked to the immigration status of their parents, we are talking about those parents who overstay in respect of their immigration status.  The two types of affected children we find in the State are children born to undocumented parents and children who come here between the ages of four and 13, for example, to join their parents.  These are the two cohorts of children and young people about whom we are talking.

Is there a particular reason for that?  Two of them are very populous countries.  Is there a particular reason why 37% are from the Philippines, 19% are from China and 19% are from Mauritius?  What is particular to those countries that means there is a substantial number coming?  Is it something to do with visas?<\/p><p> The fear of going to the garda&iacute; when crimes are committed against these young people was mentioned.  When young people go to the garda&iacute;, how do they find them?  Is that leading to a significant under-reporting of crime and racist incidents?  I imagine it is.  <\/p><p> Are there significant child protection issues with regard to child protection legislation?  A substantial part of the witnesses' presentation was about a regularisation programme.  There is a bit of detail about that and it looks quite comprehensive.  Was there a previous regularisation scheme in the State?  If not, are there other models internationally that we could take some example from? <\/p><p> It is about 12 months since the International Protection Act was signed into law.

It was a very worthwhile presentation.  It was fantastic and sobering for 9 o'clock on a Wednesday morning to say the least.  I come from a place near Gort.  Gort has Brazilians.  We have a huge number of undocumented living in Gort.  The barriers they face on a daily basis are unbelievable.  Their parents came, worked and paid their taxes and have probably overstayed their visit.  The issue of the children is unbelievable.  The under-reporting, fear of reporting and fear of talking about any issue that arises for fear they will be sent home or separated from their parents is unbelievable.  We ask what they are afraid of.  If there is bullying taking place at school, they are afraid to approach the teacher for fear of putting their head above the parapet.  They are afraid of the same thing if there is bullying within their community or any other sort of violence perpetrated on a child within their community.  There is also the issue of violence against the female parent which is particularly relevant at this time when we talk about violence against women.  They are afraid all the time to speak up.  I acknowledge the work of the family resource centre.  This is what I am leading to.  What is the MRCI's relationship with various other groups throughout the country that are trying to support or protect the undocumented?  The Gort family resource centre is doing a power of work in trying to facilitate getting people documented but are hitting continual barriers.  The link with the local communities right down to the family resource centre and the developing of policy to assist is important.  Has the MRCI done surveys on the under-reporting, as Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire asked about?  I am talking about bullying and sexual assault on children.

They have given us an understanding of the fear, alienation, loneliness and the experience of being in a place where one cannot settle and call home.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of observations.  The diagram presented by the witnesses shows that the position of undocumented migrants in Ireland is the very same as in the US.  We are great at lobbying and trying to regularise those in the US.  Is there lobbying from the 80% of people from the top three areas - the Philippines, Mauritius and China - for regularisation as powerfully as our lobbying in the States is?<\/p> <p>  Is there a further explanation for how one falls into irregularity?  Sara Jane's father was here on a study visa.  I am just a bit confused.  How, after seven years, did he become undocumented?  He was working and paying taxes.  There is some status there.  They will take the money but will they do anything else?  Could the witnesses provide further explanation of that?<\/p> <p>  How significant is restricted access to support services such as mental health services or third level education to children?  I imagine once they reach 16, they need to become documented.  One would imagine that at 16, they are still in full-time education and trying to access third level education.  How does it affect access to health services?<\/p> <p>  The MRCI has been established for about 15 years.  The witnesses talked briefly about it.  How long ago did the issue of a significant number of undocumented children come onto the radar of the MRCI and encourage them to do something about it?  The numbers within Ireland are 26,000.  How does that compare to our neighbours?  Europe is quite different.  We are talking about undocumented as opposed to refugees or asylum seekers.

I will ask Mr. Pablo Rojas Coppari to take the question on the nationalities.  Reporting to the garda&iacute; is an ongoing issue not only for young people but for undocumented people in general.  We do not have any other studies on it other than the information we collect in our database system from people coming into our service.  We have a lot of case studies of people who do not report crimes to the Garda.  That is a huge fear for people.  People do not want to be visible.  If they go to the garda&iacute; and the garda&iacute; realise they are undocumented, they have a duty to ensure they receive a section 3 letter or a section 4 letter, where they have to report.  People do not want to trigger things that may potentially result in their deportation so often things go unreported.  That is a worry for young people and in terms of crime prevention.<\/p> <p>    We have a very good working relationship with the family resource centre in Gort.  They are very good friends of ours.  The national family resource centres have endorsed the campaign, as have a number of smaller community groups and local groups.  We work a lot in Cork, Galway and Waterford - some of the bigger areas where there are undocumented people resident.  There are particular pockets where people are resident.  I will let Mr. Pablo Rojas Coppari talk about the linkage to nationality.  It is significant, particularly in Gort, where networks of migration build up and people come to a particular place because they have a connection to that place.  There may be extended family there or friend and that expands in terms of the people who are coming to a particular place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016113000002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel McGinley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I will start with the question on previous regularisation schemes.  We have implemented a number of regularisations over the years.  The largest one was in 2005 called the Irish born child scheme, which was a direct consequence of the change in our citizenship legislation.<\/p><p>There was a ruling from the Supreme Court in 2003 that said the parents of Irish children did not have an automatic right to residence in the State as part of the change in legislation in 2005 following the 2004 referendum.  The Department of Justice and Equality decided to implement a regularisation called the Irish born child scheme addressing the needs of parents of children who had Irish citizenship.  That regularised approximately 17,000 people at the time.  There have been minor regularisations since, one was called the undocumented worker scheme in 2009 that addressed more or less 2,000 applicants.  It was such a success that the Government decided to introduce it as a permanent mechanism in our employment permit legislation which means that any person who entered the country legally on a work permit and fell out of that system could apply to regularise their status.  We have also introduced several policy measures to ensure that people keep their legal status.  They are not regularisation procedures but they are measures to ensure that people do not fall into irregularity.  Some parts of the International Protection Act 2015 have already commenced, some are due to commence between now and early in the new year.  The Act deals exclusively with the means by which people can apply for and obtain forms of international protection including refugee status and subsidiary protection so it does not cover the category of people we are dealing with.  It is part of what was intended to be the immigration residents and protection Bill which would address the immigration and residency needs of the broader migrant population in the State so it does not cover the category of people we are discussing today.  <\/p><p> To answer the question about nationality.  There are two reasons for this: these also represent the largest non-EU communities in Ireland.  Irregular migration is somehow related to migration trends, the Philippinos, Chinese and Mauritians constitute a large population of migrants in Ireland regardless.  It is also to deal with the difficulty for a person who is undocumented to obtain a visa and different migration patterns.  I do not think there is any government to government lobbying from these countries.  They have different approaches to migration.  Approximately 10% of the population of the Philippines lives abroad.  It has put in place many measures to protect the interests of their nationals abroad such as an overseas fund.  The Philippine embassy can be supportive to undocumented migrants here.  Other countries, such as China, do not recognise the status of their migrants.  From the official perspective there is no such thing as a Chinese emigrant.  Mauritius does not have an embassy here which makes it more difficult.  The peculiarity of the Irish undocumented in the United States and the long-established advocacy to regularise their situation comes from a very strong policy in the Irish State and a long-standing emigration pattern over generations whereas the history of immigrants to Ireland is much shorter.<\/p><p> In response to the question of how people fall into irregularity, one of the main reasons was a rapid change in Government policy in 2011 in which people residing here as students could not stay longer than seven years in total.  This would have been the case of the father of Sara-Jane who lived here for seven years as a student and when the policy was introduced it was implemented immediately and there was no transitional measure for allow someone like him who had been studying and working for a certain period to remain here or move to an employment permit or other formal status.  Automatically everyone who was living here for seven years or reaching the seven year limit was told they had to return home.  Many people who had invested effort, money, built families and put down roots here decided to stay here undocumented and hope that over time a solution would be introduced to address their needs.  The Government did introduce that for certain categories of migrants but it is very complicated.  I can discuss that with the committee afterwards but do not want to take up other people's time.  This is a very good example of how people become undocumented, mainly as a result of policy changes that do not take full consideration of the implications for the population.  <\/p><p> The main barrier to accessing support is that the rights and entitlements of a child younger than 18 are assessed on the basis of the parents' status.  Even if children younger than 16 do not have to provide their immigration status they are assessed on the basis of their parents' status.  Another main barrier is access to personal public service, PPS, numbers.  Even though everyone residing in the State is entitled to a PPS number regardless of legal status, for a child to obtain one he or she must prove that his or her parents have one.  As undocumented persons they are routinely barred from obtaining PPS numbers because they need to provide proof of employment or other reasons why they are seeking a PPS number.  That is the most common barrier to accessing services. <\/p><p> The undocumented population in Ireland is approximately 0.5% of the overall population, which is significantly lower than countries such as the United States and other countries in Europe where that coefficient would generally be around 1.5%.  That is to do with how geographically isolated we are and the migration routes and trends in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016113000002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pablo Rojas Coppari","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Does Ms O'Connell want to add anything to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016113000002#E00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I think that was quite a comprehensive answer from my colleague.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016113000002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate O'Connell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>On the point about PPS numbers and being employed in the State many people we work with have PPS numbers and would have obtained them a long time ago.

Ireland is very good at providing access to primary and secondary school.  Children of undocumented parents do not have problems accessing school.  Outcomes are different because if their parents are in low-paid jobs, there are poverty issues.  They might also be living in small and cramped accommodation.  Therefore, outcomes, as opposed to access, are also important to consider.<br\/><br\/>As an organisation, we have a child protection policy in place.  If issues of child protection come to our attention, we will report them to Tusla's social work department.  We do not see the fact of being undocumented in itself as a child protection issue.  Child protection arises when there is abuse or some other such issue, which we would pursue.  This does not prohibit social workers or anybody else from acting in the best interests of the child in these cases.  Neither is this something we come across hugely in our work dealing with this group of people.  A minimal number of child protection issues come through to our services.  However, we have a duty of care and we would report any such issues and go through the proper channels if we had concerns in this regard.<br\/><br\/>Deputy O'Sullivan asked what we can do.  I will conclude on this critical issue.  Some undocumented children have been here a long time, and we need to do something.  Regarding peaks and troughs, we needed workers during the Celtic tiger era.  Our immigration system was not fit for purpose.  We developed policy and immigration legislation in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>and piecemeal way that could not respond to the demand of the labour market, so we saw many people come here to take up employment.  The key drivers of irregular migration are employment and family ties.  If there is no work in a country, people do not go there.  When people do come to a country, they set down roots and want their families to join them.  We must clean up the system.  This is a residue of a broken system from a long time ago.<br\/><br\/>To respond to Deputy Chambers, we need to put in place on an ongoing basis what we will need in the future.  What we have proposed is a bare minimum.  If we want to do something proper for children in an ongoing way, we need a mechanism in our immigration system that allows children born to undocumented people in the State to regularise their situations on an ongoing basis.  The committee should consider how this might be done and what it might look like.  We can refer back to the committee with recommendations in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016113000002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel McGinley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Is Ms McGinley suggesting automatic residency or automatic citizenship?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016113000002#G00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to let the witnesses conclude rather than engaging in individual toing and froing.

As the committee knows, the problem with undocumented or irregular migration is that it is unknown.  No one has accurate figures on it, including the State.  They are very hard to come by.  Undocumented migration is calculated by examining a number of people who were apprehended by the State and in whose cases the process of deportation was started.  A number of people are issued with deportation orders that are not enforced.  We are talking about 13,000 people, more or less.  On top of that, a number of people are undetected, which means that the State and the authorities do not know whether they are resident in the country.  We used a coefficient derived from studies of the most similar country to ours, namely, the United Kingdom.  The figures are based on the number of visas and permits issued every year.  A percentage of those granted visas and permits overstay their residence.  All together, we came up with three estimates, what we call low, medium and high estimates, to allow for these three types of situation.  This is outlined on the reverse of the infographic distributed to the committee.  The figure is stated as ranging from 20,000 to 26,000 because we have used a low to a high estimate.  This allows for the impossibility of arriving at an exact estimate and follows models that have been used abroad.<\/p> <p>  I will address some of the other points raised.  Neither asylum and direct provision nor any other issue related to immigration falls within the Ombudsman for Children's remit.  In so far as undocumented children are children, certain aspects of the issue fall under the ombudsman's remit, but interaction with the immigration system does not, which is a problem.  I refer back to my point about prioritising the best interests of the child in all aspects of our legislation, including immigration legislation.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan talked about limited regularisation.  It is limited in the sense that it is done only for people who have entered the country with an employment permit.  The main reason there are pockets of undocumented people in the State is that, as Ms McGinley said, there are many issues with our employment permit legislation and it is very problematic.  In addressing the issue of irregular migration as a whole, we need to reform our immigration system, including our labour migration system.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Chambers asked questions about work restrictions and so on.  In general, there are two types of employment restriction.  People on employment permits are tied to one employer and one job and have very limited opportunities to change employment.  A person arrives to work for one employer and must stay under a system called the employment permit system for five years before he or she is given the right to change employer or sector.  Therefore, because in this system people cannot change employment unless they go through a very difficult process, they can fall out of the system.  In recognition of this problem, this regularisation mechanism was introduced.  The Deputy talks about extending it.  We would propose a solution to the problem of everyone else, that is, people who arrived on student and other types of visas.  The other type of restriction we have concerns people who are here as international students, who number about 40,000.  They can work for 20 hours per week, 40 hours during very specific holiday terms.<\/p> <p>  Regarding taxes and why some people pay taxes while others do not, it depends on how one entered the State.  If one did so on a valid permit such as a student permit, it would have been possible to secure a PPS number.  If one has a PPS number, one gives it to one's employer.  There are no other checks and the employer can pay tax in respect of the person.  Of course, not every employer wants to do so, and if the worker does not have legal status, he or she does not have the bargaining power to request the employer to pay taxes.  This is why we find only about 30% of people who are undocumented are paying taxes.  When we talk about loss of revenue, we are talking about all the other 60% or 70% of people who were able to get PPS numbers or to ask their employers to pay taxes on their behalf.  This is how we estimate the loss in revenue.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan also spoke about our commitments under the UN Charter.  The problem about making a complaint is that Ireland has not signed up to the optional protocol that allows for individual complaints.  Therefore, undocumented children cannot make individual complaints that we are failing to protect their rights under the charter.  However, collective complaints are made, and the UN committee recommendation is a direct result of this.  The UN committee has told Ireland it must implement regularisation.  There are other avenues we can explore, such as making a collective complaint under the European Convention on Human Rights to the Council of Europe and so on.<\/p> <p>  Regarding interaction with the police and what happens if undocumented people are apprehended, Ireland does not have summary deportations, as Ms McGinley mentioned, so people cannot be picked up and deported.<\/p><p>Once one is apprehended, the deportation process starts, under which one can make an appeal for an application called a humanitarian leave to remain.  The waiting time for an answer is approximately two years.  The process can be triggered only when one is apprehended by a garda or an immigration officer.<\/p><p> Although Ireland signs approximately 2,000 to 3,000 deportation orders per year, it enforces only approximately 250 deportations per year.  Only approximately 10% of people who are given deportation orders are deported, which is a good thing in our eyes.  However, it is problematic given that Ireland is declining to deport people, for many reasons, but not giving them status.  Their lives are blocked and they do not have access to services.<\/p><p> As Ms McGinley mentioned, we are faced with a number of people who are in an irregular situation.  Introducing a regularisation system for people will address this.  As I said earlier, the threshold could be, for example, four years.  This is the minimum that can be done to address it.  The committee is welcome to recommend something broader if it sees fit.  We believe all undocumented children should have access to regularisation in order for Ireland to meet its international commitments.  Our proposal is the minimum the State should do to address this today.  If the committee wants to go further, please do so.<\/p><p> To ensure this does not happen again, we must examine our immigration legislation and pass immigration legislation that is comprehensive and flexible and have labour migration policies that are responsive to it.  There are other key issues.  Other European countries have mechanisms which mean children born here may acquire residency at a certain age.  This is to be discussed in a much larger space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016113000002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pablo Rojas Coppari","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I refer to access to services and the structural and perceived barriers to young people who need particular services.

We are pleased to be here to address this important Committee on Children and Youth Affairs on what we see as the hidden issue of children in private family law, the lack of services and lack of cohesion around the care and supports for these children.  For 44 years One Family has worked with people who are parenting alone, sharing parenting or separating.  We were originally established as Cherish in 1972 and that may be a more familiar name to some of he members.  Ireland is becoming more diverse all the time.More families are separating and more children live in blended, step-parent families.  The European trend is that this will continue.  Marriage rates are stable but separation and divorce has been increasing slightly, so that as a society we see our services and laws are still in the process of catching up.  Certainly more investment is needed so the services and infrastructure needed around family law can be out in to support children as they go through what can be quite difficult transitions in their families.  Separation is a long process in Ireland and the requirement for divorce is a separation of four years out of five.  The separation process goes on for a very long time and this can be very difficult for parents and children.  When people are sharing the parenting of their children it is a lifetime relationship and it is very important that people are able to establish the systems, practices and plans that help them to share parenting.  One Family sees people who can do this very well.  They focus on their children, they communicate well, they make good decisions they have predictability for their children.  We also see some parents who are violent and abusive, are incapable of being child centred, they feel threatened and are threatening, and they can use the court system and their children as weapons.  Most people are somewhere in between two stark opposites.  We want to get people right on the good, functioning side for their children or a lot of harm could be done.  Separation <i>per se<\/i>is not bad for children, but how it is done and managed can be bad for children.<br\/><br\/>I will now turn to the services, systems and policies that are available.  There are the statutory services such as the Family Mediation Service.  This service has long waiting lists and it is only available in some parts of the State.  The Legal Aid Board is also under funded with a many waiting lists.  There are also the domestic abuse organisations and ourselves, One Family.  There is, however, no cohesive system built to help these children and families.  The new Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 is a great step forward in recognising the types of families in which children live and also in allowing courts to direct parents to undertake counselling or parenting programmes.  Those parents must do this at their own expense.  Equally, where a court needs an assessment - a parenting capacity assessment or a section 47 assessment where they see what is going on in the family and if there are chid safety issues - parents must pay for these assessments themselves.  If they do not have the means to do so then the court does not have the full information available to it.  There is no funding for counselling, timely mediation, parental assessments, parenting programmes or child assessments.  There is no funding for parents to deal with emotional impact of their separation.  many of the problems encountered by One Family are where parents are not being as child centred as possible and it is because the parent is in pain and they also need the time, space and support.  Separation is actually like a bereavement in many ways but without the sympathy.  The parents need to make a lot of decisions very quickly and they need to make big financial decisions.  they need to make decisions about heir children and they are often thrown into a legal system that is inherently adverserial , none of which is good for children.  One Family would advocate for an alternative system.  Services such as counselling, mediation and parenting programmes really help people to do all of this well.  These services are inexpensive compared to anything to do with courts or the law.  They keep people out of the courts and help them make good decisions that they can stick to rather than a court made decision.  A judge could have ten or 15 minutes on a case but if parents can take the time to work it out themselves it is something that they can live with for longer and it is good for their children.  There is, however, no coherent system or funding to support this kind of work.<br\/><br\/>With regard to child contact centres, we are very pleased to be able to speak about these with the committee.  These centres are safe and supported places where children can spend time with the parent they do not live with.  These centres can be found throughout Europe and the United States.  There are pretty much no centres like this in Ireland.  One Family has researched this issue and we ran a pilot centre with Barnardos, funded by the State for a few years, and it was very successful and used by the courts.  We received very high conflict families who had multiple child protection or welfare issues.  We were able to provide services for parents and safe places for parents - often the dad but not exclusively - time to spend with their children so that relationship was not lost altogether.  We were looking for the best interests of the child.  Those programmes were very well evaluated and were supported politically and by the courts and Judiciary, but were closed due to lack of funding.  Courts in Ireland now do not have anywhere to refer vulnerable families and children at risk in private family law cases.  The do not have access to assessments and reports that we were able to do and sometimes parents, often fathers, then may not get to see their children because decisions are made perhaps without full information.  Or, sometimes a person is ordered to supervise their child but they have a barring order against the other parent.  They have to break the barring order to provide supervised access.  None of these situations are satisfactory.  Sometimes children can be court ordered into contact or access with a parent who is incapable of abusive, none of which we want to happen.  From an economics point of view, when those centres were running people were in and out of the courts less and it saved court and legal aid board time, which was good. <br\/><br\/>I will now turn to the recommendations.  I believe Ireland is catching up.  Divorce is still relatively new in Ireland and we have not got the kind of infrastructure systems that are in other countries.  We have a history in Ireland of seeing things in the family as private and within the domain of a private family rather than needing to provide supports around that.  We want people to be able to separate well and to share parenting of their children well.  We recommend that attention is paid to what services are needed from a child's perspective and when the reform of the law and the Family Law Courts happens that investment is made around what children need.  The legal infrastructure is one thing but if money is not put in to these services it can be very difficult.  There are benefits to reducing the use of courts for conflict and all those issues and children have better relationships with their parents.  Ultimately, we need a system such as the UK's Cafcass system.  It is a child and family service; they are in courts, they do assessments, they risk assess families, they provide parenting programmes and it is a very comprehensive welfare system, specifically around families and children.  Ireland has nothing like that and there are always  gaps here, so children are sometimes getting lost in those gaps.  Ireland also needs a number of child contact centres.  I have some research reports around the value of the centres and what they cost.  These reports are available online and I have put the link in our presentation to the members of the committee.  If we were to consider one centre per Tusla area, which would be 17 child contact centres, it would cost around &euro;3.5 million per year.  This would cover the entire State and give very good services for vulnerable families.  I thank the members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016113000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Kiernan"},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I have read this over.

The organisation does fantastic work.  I know the difficulties families go through in these situations.  In my previous life I was a lawyer and I did a lot of family law work.  I have seen at first hand what children go through when they go through the courts system.  Very often, unfortunately, parents tend to forget the impact their conflict, separation and subsequent divorce has on a child.  Once a child hits the age of two he or she has some understanding that there is a conflict.  He or she will soak it up and there is an impact, which is very lasting.<\/p> <p>  I will not mention names but we have a particular judge on the circuit who is very good at pointing out to parents the most important people in the situation are always the children.  She is very clear in asking parents to think long and hard about the impact their conflict is having on their children, and is very clear at making the point that the impact would be lasting if they did not get their act together, for want of a better phrase.  We need a little bit more of this during the separation process to educate parents that the children will take this with them and carry it forward for many years if they do not behave in an appropriate manner.  Looking in from the outside, it is very easy to be logical and leave emotions at the door, but it is a very emotional process, and almost a grieving process, that people go through.  They grieve for their relationship.  I am interested in hearing the thoughts of the witnesses on the four years required to separate.  Is it too long?  In my view it is far too long.  When people take the decision to separate and subsequently seek a divorce, they can probably make the decision in a very well informed manner in a much shorter time period.  We have one of the longest periods in the modern world to process a divorce.  It is damaging to children involved in the situation.<\/p> <p>  What are the witnesses thoughts on how we facilitate children going through the courts process and the voice of the child?  We have improved a little in terms of being able to ask children what they want.  Previously we waited until they were quite a bit older, and perhaps we did not have an appreciation of the age at which a child has the capacity to have input into separation and divorce.<\/p> <p>  The approach to Christmas is one of the most difficult periods for a family.  I have been in a court setting where parents argued over how many hours on Christmas Day each would get with the children, when they would pick them up on Christmas Eve and what night the children would stay with the mother and father.  The children are aware of this.  It is a difficult situation.  Often this argument is borne out in a court setting, which seems so inappropriate.  One would think if we could get both parties to sit down at a table in a mediation setting to try to work it out we would have a much better outcome.  How can we improve on this?  How can we keep it out of the courts?  What services do we need to see in place?<\/p> <p>  The reasons I saw parents continuously returning to court were access and maintenance.  I worked with people, predominantly women, who were having huge difficulties in getting the maintenance already ordered by the courts and had to return to court on a regular basis to try to enforce the order and get the money due to the children for their welfare and to look after them.  No mechanism seems to be in place to enforce maintenance orders.  The only port of call is to return to the courts.  This clearly creates increased animosity between the two partners and continues the conflict well into the future.  If a better mechanism was in place which did not require an individual to continuously return to court to enforce a court order it would have a real impact on limiting the amount of interaction between parents and the court system, which would be beneficial to the children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016113000002#K00400","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I apologise in advance as I must leave at 10.55 a.m.  I thank the witnesses for their presentation.

There were some good questions about the financial impact and poverty.  Certainly nobody comes out of a separation or divorce better off; there are always more costs.  The process can be costly and people are obviously trying to move into and create two homes for their children.  As was correctly pointed out, this cannot always happen owing to a lack of money and a lack of places for people to live.  We are well aware of many parents who are separated but who need to live in the same house, which causes massive stress for them and their children.  As a result of how things have been in recent years from an economic point of view, people have found it very difficult to move out.  They may be caught in negative equity.  Equally, now there is nowhere to move to.  It causes significant pressure on families.<\/p> <p>  If a father leaves the home, he may not be able to afford a place where his children can stay in order to maintain that kind of high-quality relationship.  Occasionally, there are issues with the Department of Social Protection not quite understanding shared parenting and the impact it might have on social welfare.  We are trying to engage with the Department on some of those issues.  Someone may not get support to have a home big enough for their children because their children may not live with them all the time.  As a society, we need to understand what shared parenting is and whether it is something we want to value.  There could be a need for policy and legal changes as a result of that.  It causes practical difficulties.<\/p> <p>  The vast majority of families going into homelessness are one-parent families.  This could be because someone is leaving an abusive situation or because the relationship has ended - or the person may always have been on their own.  If only one income is coming into a home, it is really difficult, in light of accommodation and child-care costs, to manage.  One-parent families are always poorer than two-parent families, which have someone else to help with child care or with an income.  Statistically, one-parent families are the poorest.  The vast majority of poor children are from one-parent families.  Child poverty rates have increased massively in recent years.  I sit on the advisory council for Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the national children and young people strategy.  It has a target to lift 97,000 children out of poverty.  We have had to increase that figure.  There is a plan in place in the Department of Social Protection - it is a whole-of-Government approach - to tackle child poverty, which would be very welcome.<\/p> <p>  The budget 2012 cuts to the one-parent family payment were horrendous.  The subsequent years were extraordinarily difficult for people parenting on their own who relied on social welfare.  Many of the things introduced had to be reversed because they were not going to work.  People ended up leaving jobs, which was counterproductive.  While some of the things have been reversed, not enough has been done and, in the intervening period, more children have become poor.  It was very disappointing and difficult for people and there are those who are still trying to deal with that.  We saw a massive impact all the time.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Ms Kelly to respond on a couple of points.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan had a query on mediation.  The family mediation service is statutorily funded, but there is a significant waiting list.  To avoid that, people can pay privately, but if they cannot afford to do that, they are waiting.  Sometimes quick intervention is required and that is an issue.  The Deputy also had a question about the overall costing for all services.  That is beyond me because it depends on how big one wants to go.<\/p> <p>  The CAFCASS system in the UK has been greatly cut in recent years; it was a better and more robust system.  It is no longer world-class as it may have been in the past.  However, it means where there are family law cases, there is often a CAFCASS officer in the court.  If there is a need for an assessment of some kind, if concern is expressed over someone's ability to parent and have contact or access visits, or if there is concern over child safety or welfare, it can intervene and carry out risk assessments and parenting assessments and provide information relating to these to the court.<\/p> <p>  The child-contact centres are run separately from CAFCASS but there is a working relationship between them.  The courts in the UK have the parenting information programme, PIP, which is a very short programme.  We believe it is too short to be valuable.  I am not sure who provides the programme.  It could be done directly by CAFCASS or more likely contracted out to NGOs.  The child-contact centres cost just over &pound;200,000 per centre per year to run.  They do all the assessments necessary and provide all the contact necessary.<\/p> <p>  A brief report is available online and I have a copy here.  It gives information about how many families could be dealt with throughout the year.  Not everybody needs the level of a child-contact centre; it is really for the highest-conflict families and not for people who just need some support - we were not getting many of those families.  Judges were using those centres very well for the very intractable cases in order to progress them and keep people out of court.<\/p> <p>  I ask Ms Kelly to deal with the question about homelessness and children accessing their parents.  There was another question about the family resource centres, particularly that in Togher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016113000002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Kiernan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":185,"content":"<p>We do a considerable amount of work with families that are homeless because of separation and other reasons.  When we worked through the child-contact centres, one of them was run through an FRC in Quarryvale in Dublin 22.  We believe the FRCs are very placed as locations for the child-contact centres because people want them at the weekends and in the evening time when the general work of the FRCs is not happening.  Except for very young children, most people do not want the contact centre in the morning time.  When we used the Quarryvale facility, it worked very well.  There was plenty of space; it was a child-friendly environment and was very accessible.  Some FRCs already have the staff who could be trained to work very well in a contact centre.  Some of them do not.  The staffing varies greatly.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken to managers of a number of FRCs who are already exploring the idea of their staff training up and offering some level of child-contact centres, including in Monaghan and Donegal.  It is a huge issue for families that are homeless because the fathers do not have anywhere to go.  Having a child-contact centre is very important because otherwise they are in shopping centres, sitting in McDonald's.  Even for a parent who is who is with their child every day of the week, it is a very difficult experience to be in McDonald's for longer than 20 minutes.  So having contact in McDonald's for two hours will not work out very well.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Lisa Chambers spoke about the Christmas contact and mediation.  We support the shortening of the period of separation before divorce to two years because we see a heightened conflict.  Many people are quite amicable when they first separate, but by the end of the four years the conflict is heightened and it gets worse as time goes on.  Shortening that timeframe would suit many more people better.<\/p> <p>  We often support people with shuttle mediation - because they are in such high conflict having two people in the room at the same time is very difficult.  Having different variations of mediation can work really well, but it needs to be very intense mediation every week.  More resources are required for mediation.  At present, the waiting lists run to four months.  When we get the call for mediation, four months is too long because people are already in crisis at that stage.  If we say to people, \"Agree Christmas now\", it will be Easter before they get a mediation appointment, which is too long.<\/p><p>The aim is to keep parents out of court for contact and maintenance issues.  They are the two main reasons they are in and out of court all the time.  Judges cannot support them with those issues; they are really issues for mediation.  We also offer a lot of parent mentoring which really supports people.  When we ran the contact centres all of the parents engaged in parent mentoring and counselling which really helped them to explore the impact of the conflict on their children.  It challenged them to look at their own couple conflict, try to get past it and to move on with the business of shared parenting.  That really helped people to move forward, leave the couple relationship behind and focus on their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016113000002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I ask Ms Kelly when she responds to the next group of questions to clarify an issue.

I wish to raise the issue of separation cases which have gone through the court system and where the parties are in and out of court on a fairly regular basis.  One parent goes to court to ask that passports be handed over because there is a fear that the child might be taken out of the country.  What support is provided if that fear comes to pass and the child is taken out of the jurisdiction by a parent?  What is done for the parent who is left behind?  That can be a very costly event.  Reference was made earlier to costs in terms of getting all of the required documentation together in order to try to get a child back.  Every page that needs a notary stamp on it costs &euro;40.

I will do my best to cover all of the issues raised.  I will try to clarify the difference between child protection access and what we were doing.  Our work centres on access in private family law cases where the child or children were living with and in the care of one of their parents but were entitled to have access visits with the other parent.  Sometimes there were child protection issues with that parent and sometimes there were no actual issues but there were concerns.  It is a very grey area.  We would like to see Tusla do more work with private family law cases to try to fill in some of those gaps.<\/p> <p>  Members asked about situations where the child has been removed, is in care and Tusla is obliged to provide contact between the child and his or her siblings or parents.  Sometimes Tusla would ask organisations like One Family or the family resource centres to get involved in that process because Tusla is under resourced, in terms of both space and staff.  That is Tusla's obligation.   When we ran the contact centres we offered physical space to social workers and also offered our services in terms of enabling contact, but they did not take us up on that.  We are very unclear as to why that was the case.  We used Quarryvale Family Resource Centre, as Ms Kelly said and we also used a bespoke contact centre in Ballymun which was built for public child cases involving children in care.  That centre has separate rooms for each family and the contact is supervised through a window.<\/p> <p>  There can be cross over.  If the system was built well, we could share resources more to enable children in both public and private family law cases to have access because a lot of the processes are the same.  The children who are not getting enough attention at the moment are those in private family law cases because their families are expected to do it themselves but they cannot always do so.  We are aware that centres in Carrigaline, County Cork and in Arklow, County Wicklow facilitate some private family law contact, as well as contact in child care cases.  <\/p> <p>  Over the years, a lot of this work was done on a voluntary basis in Ireland through the churches.  That was certainly the tradition in the UK where a lot of churches ran contact centres in church halls.  They were extremely low cost and were run by volunteers, usually with a part-time co-ordinator.  The difference between the UK and Ireland, however, is that the former has the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, Cafcass, which means that children arriving at the contact centres had already been risk assessed, they had their folders and the volunteers knew exactly what they were dealing with.  It should be noted that those services were not necessarily moving on the parents.  They were solely facilitating contact.  In our case, we would also want to intervene with the parents to try to move them on and out of the centre, ideally.  That is not always possible but that is what we would be aiming for.  Figures indicate that the cost of these centres in the UK is very low but there is good reason for that.  <\/p> <p>  The voice of the child is an issue of concern to us.  While there is now a requirement to take into account the voice of the child, the courts have not yet figured out how to hear the voice of the child in any systematic way or how to do so in an age appropriate way.  Some judges may hear children in chambers while others may not.  There is a lot of work to be done in that area and it will require additional resources.  Based on our experience, we would argue that it requires specially trained people to work with children over a period of time to actually figure out what they may need.  One Family provides play therapy for children and we did so in the contact centres too, which can be a very effective way of supporting children through a process like separation or any kind of difficulty or trauma.<\/p> <p>  Members mentioned repeated court visits, particularly around issues like access and maintenance.  That is the bane of peoples' lives.  We would have got people to reach fairly good agreements around access and shared parenting and then if something happened on the money side, all of those agreements went out the window.  It is a constant process of working with people, keeping them focused.  Maintenance is a very difficult issue.  How maintenance payments are assessed for social welfare purposes is particularly difficult.  If, for example, a father stops paying maintenance, the mother may need to go back to court to prove that.  It can be a very long process and during that time she can be out of pocket.  An attachment of earnings is possible but if the father changes jobs, the mother may have to return to court again.  It can be both lengthy and costly.  The courts would like more cases to be settled out of court, particularly maintenance cases because the courts are under a lot of pressure.<\/p> <p>  In the UK, they have the Child Support Agency but my understanding is that it did not do what it was supposed to do.  It is very difficult to access money from the liable relative.  In countries like Sweden, the state takes the responsibility.  The state provides what is needed and guarantees an income to the child.  If the liable relative does not pay, the state follows that up.  That works very well for children, particularly in terms of combating child poverty.  That is the gold standard system in terms of the desired outcome, which is money going to children.  <\/p> <p>  We recently conducted a national survey of people who share parenting.  We got over 1,000 responses and we are going to publish the findings of that survey at a seminar with a number of respondents from the legal world and from Tusla on 30 January.  I invite all members of this committee to attend that seminar.  As I said, we got over 1,000 responses and thousands of comments from parents which we have read thoroughly.  Maintenance is a massive issue and a massive trigger.<\/p><p>There are gender issues around separation.  Sometimes men can feel that the court, the system or the mediation is against them.  Sometimes women say it is definitely against them and that they are treated differently as single parents.  There is a great deal of pain and confusion there and, at a distance, the rest of us are looking at all that and finding that it is difficult to make policy because people's experiences are so different.  What we are trying to do is understand how people share parenting and what would help them to do it better.  We are learning a great deal from that as well.  Access and maintenance are a huge part of that but there is no easy answer that we can see.<\/p><p> There was a query on passports and abduction and Deputy Chambers clearly knows a bit about a particular case.  We do not have expertise at the level of legal support around abductions.  We do a lot of family parenting support and have a helpline.  It may be that Deputy Chambers knows more around legal support in respect of abduction.  Certainly, we can support people emotionally and signpost them.  It is something that is becoming more common.  There are concerns around Brexit and whether it will cause more difficulties within the island of Ireland never mind for those living in Britain.  It is an area of concern which needs to be looked at.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, has already looked at issues around Brexit and this has come up.  Professor Geoffrey Shannon is looking at doing some work around that because we need to know.  It is a hugely distressing area.  We have worked with people around those cases.  It is not our area of expertise.  Does Ms Kelly have anything to add to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016113000002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Kiernan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>When we work with families, some people always worry about the passport at the start; who has the passport, where is it going to be and is somebody going to take the child without telling the other parent?

I have not met a family where someone has abducted a child but I have met a lot of families where it was initially a huge concern.  Through a great deal of work over a number of months and a couple of years, their concern has decreased to the stage where they are quite happy to pass the passport freely from one parent to the other or they leave it with a solicitor.  I do not know how much they pay the solicitor to mind it for them.  It comes back to supporting people to get past the conflict so that they trust each other to take children out of the country and bring them back again.

An additional allocation of &euro;100 million was recently sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to facilitate the delivery of further large projects and the payment of the minor works scheme grants in 2016-17 to primary schools.<\/p><p>We will complete 48 major projects on the capital side and we have a strong pipeline of work ahead.  As members will be aware, a tranche of new builds was approved in April and a further tranche was approved in October.  This money allows us to continue this pipeline of work, which is driven by substantial pressure on school places.  We are currently providing funding for approximately 20,000 additional school places per annum.  The strong and beneficial population growth we are experiencing is exerting significant pressure on schools.  The population bulge, which continues at primary level, is now moving into secondary level.  For this reason, the balance of projects is moving more towards secondary level, which tends to involve larger, more complex buildings.<\/p><p> The other element is an increase of &euro;37 million being sought for increased superannuation payments in 2016 in respect of teaching and non-teaching staff in certain first and second-level schools.  This additional sum will cover the additional lump sum and related costs of a projected 488 extra retirements in 2016 above the original estimate.  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;11 million is being sought for increased superannuation payments in respect of institutes of technology staff in 2016.  This extra allocation will cover the additional lump sum and related costs of 59 more retirements in 2016 than originally estimated.  It is difficult to forecast the scale of retirements from year to year in the educational sector.<\/p><p> On appropriations-in-aid, an estimated shortfall of &euro;18 million is being factored into the 2016 Supplementary Estimate due to an overestimation of the level of receipts to be brought to account in 2016.  The 2016 allocation in the Revised Estimates Volume provided for overall estimated receipts of &euro;505 million to be brought into account.  However, it is very difficult to accurately forecast the exact impact of teacher retirements and increasing teacher numbers on the level of superannuation contributions payable in a given year.  The impact of previously announced reductions in the rate of pension related deductions adds to this difficulty.<\/p><p> There are also expected to be savings on a number of subheads, which offset the total amount required in the Supplementary Estimate.  Estimated savings on primary teacher salaries of &euro;24 million are being projected.  These savings arise mainly as a result of lower than anticipated substitution costs, which are difficult to forecast owing to the complexities associated with estimating them.  There are three individual substitution rates and, depending on the nature of the absence being covered, a personal rate may be paid.  The increased number of teachers retiring has also contributed to this saving as those retiring have usually reached the higher points in the incremental salary scale but are generally replaced by new teachers who are starting at the lower end of the scale.<\/p><p> To address grants to schools, education and training boards and other institutions, my Department's budget for 2016 included provision to fund the implementation of an arbitrator's recommendation for pay increases for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers.  The first phase of the multi-annual pay increase under the arbitration process came into effect from 1 January 2016 and the full amount for this payment was provided in the subhead for this year, leading to savings of &euro;6 million in 2016.  The full funding will be needed in 2017 and beyond for future phases of the arbitrator's recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2016113000002#A01000","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480514400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>We will consider the subheads in order, commencing with subhead A3, superannuation in respect of teaching and non-teaching staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2016113000002#B00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1480514400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for their attendance.

The capital budget is being increased by &euro;100 million from &euro;427 million.  While I welcome the decision to build more schools, the proposed increase amounts to approximately 25% of the original capital budget for the year.

Have costs shot up dramatically or are additional projects and school places planned?<\/p> <p>  The question asked in the media is whether the Department has run out of money and whether it is able to pay the bill for projects that are due for completion.  It has also been suggested that this increase reflects a pre-election splurge that has gone wrong.  In other words, too many projects were announced in the rush before the general election.  While I am sure all these projects were necessary and welcome, is it the case that they were not planned for financially?  This is a legitimate question in light of the substantial increase required in the capital budget.  All the Deputies present will fight to secure as much of the capital budget as possible for our own areas and schools in general.  However, this increase appears to suggest extremely bad planning by the Department.<\/p> <p>  The minor works grant is included in the capital budget.

It has been suggested that the money required has been spent by the Department and that funding is no longer available.  Is this a widespread problem?  Has the programme of major capital works the Department announced last year slowed down because costs have increased or did the Department not provide sufficient money to complete it?<\/p> <p>  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;11 million for superannuation for institutes of technology staff will cover lump sums for 59 retirees.

I will give every Deputy an opportunity to make comment and revert back again to the Minister for his closing remarks.<\/p> <p>  To a certain extent, I am in agreement with my colleagues.  It is always important to see extra investment in education, something for which we have all been fighting in the D&aacute;il Chamber and at this committee.  Having proper sustainable development in the right area is equally important.  I understand this is the largest Supplementary Estimate placed before the House for many years, which is significant.  The saving of &euro;24 million on salaries should have been reinvested to address the issue of pay inequity, to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio, to provide extra resource teachers and possibly to restore teachers for the Traveller community.  Some of it could also have been invested in professional development education courses for teachers.  It is an opportunity wasted.<\/p> <p>  Regarding non-teaching staff, the school secretaries and caretakers I know are doing sterling work and it amazes that they have to be paid from the ancillary grant which does not cover their full pay.

The saving on substitution costs is a once-off and not a basis on which we could fund a pay increase in the longer term.  There is always an estimating element in deciding different issues and, as we see, superannuation and substitution costs are particularly hard to forecast.  Just because there is a saving in one subhead does not mean that we can change pay levels that are negotiated centrally.  The central negotiation of pay levels takes place within the Lansdowne Road agreement.  We have used the flexibility within the agreement to make provision for new entrant teachers, an issue on which we negotiated with the TUI and the INTO.  At the same time, in this school year which started in September provision was made for an extra 2,260 teachers.  Provision is being made for an extra 2,400 teachers next September.  We always have to balance the appetite for pay increases with the need to invest in services.  Deputies will know that a lot of the money went to services with a particular priority, including special educational needs and so on.  It is a balancing act.  I was happy to be able to sit down with the trade unions and negotiate not just on new entrant pay levels but also in other areas such as permanency and flexibility in the use of Croke Park agreement hours, as well as dealing with other issues that are important to teachers.  It is important that we have a well motivated teaching force and respond to pressures that are emerging.<\/p> <p>  On the increase in the construction budget, the original provision was smaller than in the previous year and the increase is necessary in the context of pressures that are emerging.  It is not late; it was flagged much earlier in the year when I attended a meeting of the previous committee.  It is not something that is happening at the last minute or an indication of bad planning.  We were able to release a block of school projects in April and October.  That shows that the Department's planning approach is delivering a consistent flow.  The number of schools at which construction work is taking place on site is largely the same as it was last year.  The increase in costs in the past two years is in the order of 35%.  Deputy Thomas Byrne is right that there is pressure on costs as we see a recovery in the construction sector.<\/p> <p>  The allocation for minor works grants came to &euro;28.5 million.  I understand it has been paid out; therefore, it is gone.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne mentioned that in the programmes school projects were described as due to go to construction.  When flagged, it may be a misnomer, but I understand it means that a process is due to start which will lead to tendering.

Therefore, we cannot say it will happen in month X or Y because it depends on the complexity of the work on the site.  We have often come across additional traffic or conditions to be applied in the planning phase, meaning that the school has to come back and obtain approval from the Department.  It is not by any means a perfect science, but it means that the process is due to start in the particular year.  Some projects will move very rapidly through the process, depending on their nature.

This is due to the phasing.  The pay increase of 2.5% in the hourly rate of grant came in on 1 January 2016.  In addition, the introduction of a minimum hourly rate of &euro;10.25 was introduced.  The ancillary service grant was increased in 2016, from &euro;147 to &euro;153, to enable primary schools to implement the first phase of the arbitrator's recommendation and also to provide for a pay increase under the FEMPI Act for grant-funded school cleaners.  Primary schools that had insufficient funds to pay the minimum hourly rate of &euro;10.25 could apply to the Department for top-up funding and this application process resulted in &euro;107,000 being allocated to 133 primary schools.  Further increases in the ancillary service grant will be made to enable schools to implement the future phases of the arbitration recommendation.<\/p> <p>  This came from an arbitrator's recommendation.  Obviously, the schools have to determine how they deploy across their requirements.  This will result in a 10% increase over the phasing.  The full increase is 10% between 2016 and 2019.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin raised whether we need to step up capital funding.  We have a step-up in capital funding for the coming year.  It is a &euro;40 million increase.  That is recognising both the cost pressures and the pressures of the bulge moving from primary to post-primary.

The Department breaks the country down into 314 squares within which the population projections, both at primary and at secondary level, are forecast against the available places within that catchment.  It is where we anticipate the growth in numbers which are documented by children who are coming through the scheme or from other population indicators, such as those of the CSO and our own school data.  We use that to forecast.  That is the basis on which we identify an area that has a shortage of school places, either at primary or secondary.  We then look to identify whether the best way to provide those extra places is the expansion of existing schools or new builds.  That is the process.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman will be aware, sometimes people would like a particular type of school.  The Department looks at the whole catchment and all the school places available to it.  It does not look at the preferences of parents in planning the buildings.  There could be spaces available in one school and a lot of people want another school, and that can result in pressures which we all know about.  I suppose, as the Deputy rightly says, if we had more money we could provide more options.  The policy has been to live within the available capital that we can get for this purpose and to provide for the growing population areas.  I think we stay on top of those, but there can be difficulties with individual parents.<\/p> <p>  The forecasting of superannuation is a tricky matter too because staff have a certain degree of flexibility in when they time their exits.  We have to anticipate what that might be from year to year and that gives rise to difficulties in forecasting.  That is one of the big reasons for the Supplementary Estimate.<\/p> <p>  This is perhaps one of the biggest Supplementary Estimates, although it is probably not as big as some of the other areas because Health, Social Protection and Justice all had increases.  I suppose this was flagged.  The &euro;100 million, which is the mainstay of it in terms of substantive change, was flagged much earlier in the year.

Funding is provided from two subheads covering the pension and gratuity costs of former IOT staff.  The number of IOT staff retiring fluctuates from year to year and the scale of these fluctuations is not possible to precisely predict.  The fact that these persons are not employees of my Department but of 13 IOTs, and are paid on those bodies' payrolls, adds to the complexity of the estimating process within my Department.  The average costs of the gratuities, that is lump sums, fluctuates throughout the year as staff of differing service and grade levels retire.  The 2016 allocation allows for the payment of 145 gratuities to newly retired employees of the IOTs, at the current average gratuity rates.  However my Department now anticipates that the number of gratuities payable to the new retired IOT employees will be 204, an extra 59.  Accordingly, a supplementary allocation of &euro;11 million is being sought from the IOT subheads.  The supplementary allocation will allow for the payment of an additional 59 gratuities to retired IOT employees at current average rates and associated increases in the cost of servicing the ongoing pension payroll.

Vote 35 is the Army Pensions Vote and Vote 36 is the Defence Vote.  I will commence with a short statement setting out the background to these Supplementary Estimates.  For 2016, a Supplementary Estimate is required to address the net shortfall of &euro;11 million arising from the Army Pensions Vote and a technical Supplementary Estimate is required within the Defence Vote to facilitate payments under the naval vessel replacement programme.  At the outset, I should explain that the Supplementary Estimates sought are on an Exchequer neutral basis and all additional funding requirements will be met from within the Defence sector envelope for 2016.<\/p><p>I will start with the Army Pension Vote which makes provision for the retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces.  In 2016, the Estimate provides a net sum of &euro;218.5 million for the Army Pension Vote.  However, net outturn this year is expected to be &euro;229.5 million, leaving a shortfall of &euro;11 million.  This amount will be funded by the savings on the Defence Vote.  Subhead A2 is the largest subhead of the Army Pension Vote.  It covers expenditure on all superannuation benefits for former members of the permanent Defence Forces, PDF, and their dependants.  It accounts for over 95% of all military pensions expenditure including gratuities.  It is also demand driven and non-discriminatory.  The original provision of &euro;214.3 million for subhead A2 will be sufficient to meet all requirements for the year.  The shortfall on this subhead is estimated at &euro;10.8 million.  <\/p><p>I will outline the main reasons for the shortfall in subhead A2.  In other public services areas most people leave at a standard retirement age, which can generally be predicted well in advance.  However, the PDF is atypical.  The vast majority of military personnel who retire on pension do so voluntarily, that is, at a time of their own choosing.  For example, during 2015, some 80% of enlisted personnel who retired on pension did so voluntarily, that is before their compulsory retirement age.  The position for 2016 is very similar.  This situation is a product of availability - for operational and manpower policy reasons - of the early payment of pension benefits immediately on retirement after relatively short periods of service and regardless of age.  Forecasting of Defence Forces pensions expenditure is very difficult from year to year.  While up to 270 new retirees on pension were anticipated for 2016 as a whole, current indications are for actual numbers of some 320 by year-end.  There is also the ongoing impact on military pension payments of the high numbers of retirements on pension in recent years.  During the years 2010 to date, over 2,600 military personnel retired with immediate pension and gratuity entitlements.  In addition, many retirees qualified for the maximum retirement benefits, which also contributes to the ongoing increased costs.  The number of Defence Forces pensioners has continued to rise during the past year and currently there are some 12,200 military pensioners of all categories.  This is a net increase of about 1,200 since 2007.  A shortfall also arises on subhead A3 of the Army Pensions Vote.  This covers the cost of military disability pensions, disablement lump sums and related dependants&rsquo; pensions.  It accounts for some 4% of all military pensions expenditure.  The original provision of &euro;8.5 million for this subhead will not be enough to meet the full costs arising during the year.  A shortfall of &euro;400,000 is expected.  This shortfall is due to greater than expected expenditure in respect of new disability pensions and disablement lump sum awards over the course of 2016.  The combined shortfall of &euro;11.2 million on subheads A2 and A3 will be partly offset by expected savings of &euro;200,000 on subheads A4, A5 and A6 of the Army Pensions Vote.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 35 is to seek additional funding of &euro;10.8 million for subhead A2; seek additional funding of &euro;400,000 for subhead A3; and reallocate savings of &euro;200,000 on subheads A4, A5 and A6 into subhead A2.  As I indicated to the committee on 30 June 2016, it has been my intention to seek extra funding for military pensions as part of the overall future budgetary negotiations.  As announced in budget 2017, the gross allocation for Army Pensions will increase by &euro;6 million to &euro;230 million next year.  The military pensions funding envelope for 2018 will be addressed next year as part of the ongoing engagement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and his officials.  <\/p><p>I will now turn to Vote 36 - Defence.  A technical Supplementary Estimate involving a transfer between subheads within the Vote is required to facilitate payments under the naval vessels replacement programme.  Earlier this year, an order was placed for a fourth offshore patrol vessel for the naval service.  This continues the commitment underpinned by the 2015 White Paper on defence to continue the modernisation of the Naval Service fleet.  This order has been placed under the existing contract which has already delivered three vessels, the <i>L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett<\/i>in 2014, the <i>L&Eacute; James Joyce<\/i>in 2015 and the <i>L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats<\/i>earlier this year, at a cost of &euro;199.4 million.  The fourth vessel will be delivered in 2018. <\/p><p>The 2016 Estimate provides a gross sum of some &euro;682 million for the Defence Vote.  Payments relating to the purchase of ships are made from the Naval Service subhead A11.  The original 2016 allocation for this subhead was &euro;33 million.  However, due to increased commitments under the naval vessel replacement programme and some additional maintenance required on the other ships, the projected outturn on this subhead is now &euro;61 million. <\/p> <p>An adjustment within the Vote of &euro;28 million is, therefore, required.  Offsetting savings will be met from the pay and allowances subheads in Vote 36 as follows: &euro;23 million on subhead A3, Permanent Defence Force pay; and &euro;5 million on subhead A7, civilian employees pay.<br\/><br\/>The three ships already delivered under this programme are now in operational use and have added significant value to the operational effectiveness and capabilities of our Naval Service fleet.  For example, Operation Pontus, which commenced in 2015 as a humanitarian search-and-rescue mission in the Mediterranean Sea, has been directly responsible for the rescue of more than 15,300 people to date.  Both the <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>and the <i>LE James Joyce<\/i>have participated in this operation.  The commitment to modernising the fleet, together with the professionalism and commitment of Naval Service personnel, has made a substantial contribution to this operation.  It highlights the ongoing importance, impact and value of the vessel replacement programme.  The acquisition of modern new ships under the naval vessel replacement programme, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair, will ensure the operational capability is maintained and that the Naval Service is fully equipped to carry out its assigned roles.  Along with continued investment in Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure, the overall funding will ensure that the Defence Forces are equipped to fulfil the roles set by Government.<br\/><br\/>Again, I thank the committee for the opportunity to present these Supplementary Estimates.  I commend them to the committee and I will be pleased to answer whatever questions may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2016113000002#A00500","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480525200,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Obviously, ,any pensioners who retired from the Army are, like the rest of us, living longer.  Is this taken into account for the future?  As with everywhere else, the age to which we live we live is being extended greatly.  The Minister of State said that he would come back here next year with an increase.

We will have a serious problem as the European quotas will impose in our waters, which will add to our difficulties in policing these waters.  Therefore, we need to do preparatory work well in advance to see what extra resources we will require and what negotiations we need to carry out with our partners in Europe.  It is one of the biggest difficulties we will face with regard to Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  It is highly complicated and I am aware from my days as Minister with responsibility for the marine that all sorts of agreements exist with regard to quotas in Irish water.  I want to bring this to the attention of the Minister of State.  It will put more pressure on the Naval Service.  While I fully support the efforts made by the Minister of State and the Department in participating in the rescue of people off various shores, it has put a great strain on the resources available for protecting our fishing waters.

I was in the Chamber.  I very much welcome the increased expenditure on the Naval Service and clearly it is required given the other three vessels we own are approximately 30 years old, which is quite old.<\/p> <p>I have a concern about how it is to be financed.  It says in the documentation that it is being offset by an underspend in two other subheads.  A saving of &euro;23 million is to be made in Permanent Defence Force pay and a saving of &euro;5 million is to be made in civilian employees' pay.  I have raised with the Minister of State on a number of occasions my very real concerns about our failure to reach a personnel level of 9,500 within the Defence Forces.  We do not seem to be getting any closer to that level.  If I am correct, the current number of personnel in the Defence Forces is 9,110.  It looks on paper like a concerted effort was made to make savings so that this shortfall in the pay requirement could be used to offset perfectly the cost of &euro;28 million.  Are real efforts being made to hire the additional soldiers needed in our Defence Forces to increase the personnel level to 9,500?  Has the strength of the Defence Forces been conveniently maintained at approximately 9,100 to achieve the savings required to pay for the new vessel?  It is suspicious that the savings made in the area of pay are exactly those needed to offset the cost of the new vessel.  I would welcome the Minister of State's comments in this regard.<\/p> <p> It is a real concern that there has been a reduction of &euro;23 million in Permanent Defence Force pay because of our failure to reach the required number of personnel.  We are continually under-recruiting.  We are not reaching the required levels.  I suggest that 9,500 is a very conservative target and that a larger number of personnel is needed in our Defence Forces in light of the precarious international security position, this country's UN commitments, the need to protect international security and defence and the implications that Brexit will have for defence.  We are constantly way below the 9,500 level.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party would like that target to be increased to 10,500.  We are not even meeting the 9,500 requirement.  The two points I am making are linked.<\/p> <p> I would like to ask the Minister of State about a completely different topic.  What is the level of subvention paid to the representative associations?  I would be interested to hear what amounts are paid to RACO, PDFORRA and the RDFRA?  I understand that the RDFRA has made a business case to the Department for an increase in its subvention.  My understanding is that it receives less than the other two representative bodies.  Clearly, it has been severely affected by the problems in recruiting personnel into the Reserve Defence Force.  As a result of the lack of recruitment and the dwindling numbers in the Reserve Defence Force, the RDFRA is getting decreased revenues from the member subscriptions on which it relies to fund itself.  It is in real financial difficulty because its subvention is less than it should be getting and it is having to deal with reduced payments from members.  Will the Minister of State comment on the business case that has been made to the Department?  What do the Minister of State and the Department propose to do to deal with the RDFRA's financial difficulties?

I suppose it is my job to ask the questions.<\/p>  <p>  I understand, having met representatives of the RDFRA yesterday, that the association made a business case to the Department regarding its subvention some months ago and is struggling to get a response.  I appreciate that this might not have been brought to the attention of the Minister of State.  I will ask the RDFRA to write directly to him.  He might take the matter up with the Department to see whether something can be done to assist the association with the severe financial difficulties it is encountering as it seeks to keep the show on the road.  The RDFRA is considerably less well resourced than RACO and PDFORRA.  I accept that PDFORRA certainly represents more members and RACO probably does.  At the same time, the RDFRA is performing an important role.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State is right when he suggests that in addition to making criticisms, the members of this committee should also offer solutions.  I would like to suggest a couple of things that would help the Reserve Defence Force with recruitment.  We need to get back into more communities.  When we took a lot of the outposts away, we removed the opportunity for many towns and villages to access the Reserve Defence Force.  The facilities are simply too far away.  There is a social benefit to joining the Reserve Defence Force.  It is not merely a stepping stone to the Permanent Defence Force.  It can be for some people, but for others it is an opportunity to give something back to their communities.  I know that reservists in my own community gave their time voluntarily to play an important role in flood defence in the Athlone area last year.  We need to reflect in this context on the whole concept of volunteerism, the experience it brings to the individual and what it gives back to the community.  There is a social benefit.<\/p> <p>We struggle to put a financial figure on that or its worth to our community but we should give it more consideration.<\/p> <p> I do not know how we will solve the problems of recruitment and Garda clearance.  I have tabled questions to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality asking if there is a backlog.  The Department tells me there is not.  It will not give me a breakdown of the number of recruitments to the Defence Forces.  I now hear from the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, that it too is struggling with Garda clearance.  I ask the Minister of State to liaise with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and her Department to see if we can fast-track some of these individuals or at least set a reasonable timeframe so that when young people join the Reserve, they are told they absolutely will have an answer within a specified period.  As it stands, people are waiting for a year or perhaps two and still do not know if they ever will get clearance or be able to join.  This uncertainty leads to their saying, \"To hell with it, I will not even bother.\"  I ask for a little certainty about the timeframe.  If it were a lengthy timeframe, at least applicants would know what it is and would be able to plan ahead.  Units would also have a better idea of the numbers coming into the unit so they would be able to plan ahead for the coming year in terms of resources, training and having personnel on board to train people.  That is one solution to the problem.<\/p> <p> Regarding the difficulties we have in recruiting to the PDF and RDF, I maintain my support for a three-brigade structure.  The fact that we have a two-brigade structure means there are soldiers covering a very large area of the country who can be posted to Finner, Donegal, one day and to Dublin another.  This lack of work-life balance and this uncertainty make it a less attractive prospect perhaps initially for people to join, but certainly makes it less attractive to stay on and continue in longer levels of service.  I believe that is why we see so many people leave the Defence Forces.  Again, let it not be said that I have not attempted to offer at least some solutions to the many problems faced by the Defence Forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2016113000005#D00700","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480527000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I hope that in any discussions at Government level, the Department of Defence is fully represented regarding anything to do with Brexit.

We have never left the Irish population in need of anything.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Barrett's point on Brexit, I assure him that I have instructed my Secretary General and his officials to make sure they are involved in all aspects of the conversation and deliberations about Brexit.  I would be the first to acknowledge that there are huge consequences for the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces in this regard.  The Deputy can be assured that at every MinMAC meeting between my office and the senior officials in my Department, Brexit is discussed as a standing item on the agenda.  This occurs on a bimonthly basis to make sure we get an update each month.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Deputy Chambers's comments on the recruitment process for 2017, I have spoken to the Chief of Staff and the Defence Forces about different ideas and told him that I can assist him with such.  If anyone has any ideas to contribute, I am absolutely open to them and would be delighted to take them on board.  The recruitment campaigns can be quite difficult.  If a class of recruits is being inducted in Galway, attempts are made to have as many people from that region as possible in the class.  Similarly, if a class is being recruited in Cork, attempts are made to have many people from the region of Cork in that class.  The same applies to Limerick or Kilkenny.  The point is to avoid someone from Kilkenny being obliged to travel to Galway, someone from Donegal being obliged to travel to Dublin or someone from Dublin being obliged to go to Cork.  There are ways and means in this regard.  I absolutely take on board the Deputy's point that quite a number of people are travelling.  Travel is part and parcel of joining the Defence Forces.  Someone who has been used to being in a barracks quite close to his or her home sometimes will have to shift somewhere else.  The relocation process can take quite some time.  With the reorganisation, it took at least 12 to 18 months to relocate people to a barracks while considering their personal circumstances and so on.  This has settled down but it is a huge issue for officers because the nature of their responsibility means they may have to travel quite a lot.  I have asked, with the new recruits for 2017 and into the future, that we cater for them as much as possible in that they are located as closely to home as possible.  The cadets are trained in the training college in the Curragh and can be located anywhere after that.  When people enter the Defence Forces, especially cadets, they accept that they might not go back to the barracks closest to their home and that they can go anywhere in the country.  Deputy Chambers spoke about the social benefits in the context of the RDF.  I absolutely agree with her.  I encourage as many people to enter the RDF as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I will give the committee an interesting story.  The Sunday before last, I was in a barracks in Wexford.  A Polish man of 28 or 29 years of age had joined the RDF there.  Fair play to someone from outside of Ireland having such an interest.  He wants to give something back to Ireland and felt the only way he would do so was by joining the RDF.  There are many other such people.  Deputy Chambers is right in saying that at the start of the year, if quite a number of people put their names forward for the RDF and must wait for six, seven, eight or nine months for Garda clearance and vetting and our own security checks within the Defence Forces, they can get fed up and leave.  I want to streamline this more so that we try to retain the people who put their names forward.  It might only be people submitting expressions of interest, but I want to make sure that they are given every opportunity to become members of the RDF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2016113000006#E00400","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1480527000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Surely, the Government could take a decision to issue an instruction that these matters must be replied to within a certain time limit.

Applications to the Reserve Defence Force are vetted by the Garda's central vetting unit.  I am led to believe that in standard cases this takes four weeks.  However, additional vetting also takes place as appropriate to the role of the Defence Forces as an element of the national security infrastructure.

At the last meeting of the select committee I highlighted the undervalued importance of this resource during the years.  From where I come, many young people have been kept out of the way of harm and prevented from getting mixed up with the wrong company by good Reserve Defence Force officers who recruited young people who might have been vulnerable at a particular stage in their lives but who went on to serve in the Reserve Defence Force and, subsequently, the Permanent Defence Force and many other careers.  I firmly believe the role of the Reserve Defence Force was crucial in ensuring successful careers for the people concerned and preventing them from getting involved with paramilitary organisations, etc.<\/p>  <p>  There must be some innovative campaign to try to recruit to the Reserve Defence Force.  I do not have the answer, but some colleges of further education offer security courses.  The cohort of students attending such courses may be interested in joining the Reserve Defence Force.  It might be worth considering having Army personnel liaise with the education and training boards which run the colleges of further education.  Cavan and Monaghan institute of further education run very successful security courses and a cohort of the participants may be interested in becoming involved with the Reserve Defence Force.  It might be worthwhile for senior Army personnel to speak to these classes.  In my area, Cavan and Monaghan, many members of the Reserve Defence Force have given sterling service during the years and they never did it for the few pounds they received but to serve their local communities.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State spoke about the unanticipated number of retirements that could occur in any year.  Unfortunately, two or three years ago, too many personnel in the lower ranks were pushed out of the Army when they reached a certain age or had completed 20 years of service.  Many people I knew well, predominantly men in their mid to late 40s, who were still extremely fit and had the physical capacity to meet all duties that would have been assigned to them, were pushed out because they had served a certain number of years.  It was regrettable that this knowledge and expertise were lost.  Having a finite cut-off point is incorrect in any organisation.  It is regrettable that so many good people were lost.  Many of the individuals I knew had serious family commitments, with children just starting in third or second level education.  They had to leave their professions and jobs to which they had given absolute commitment.  A few of them had served on several overseas missions and had always worked extremely hard to honour the national flag to the greatest extent possible.  They were exemplary members of the Permanent Defence Force.  It was regrettable that the Army pursued this policy which should be examined.  Where there are good people with the required fitness levels to continue, they should not be pushed out because they have completed so many years of service or because they have reached a certain age.  I hope the Minister of State will take this into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2016113000007#F00300","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1480527600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Some 80% of retirements are voluntary.

I appreciate the opportunity to be here.  I am joined by my colleague, Liam Woods.<br\/><br\/>Approximately one year ago, <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>ran an extensive article, entitled &quot;Inside the HSE&quot;, in which I was quoted as saying that we do not have a single collective national understanding of what we want from health care, particularly when it comes to how much we want to spend and invest in our system.  One year later, I am genuinely delighted to be before this Oireachtas committee to provide input on what I hope will be a major step in developing clarity for the first time in terms of what we, as a nation, wish to achieve, how much of our overall Exchequer funding we are willing to invest and what we can realistically expect from our health services.<br\/><br\/>To my mind, this clarity and consensus has never really been achieved at societal, political or health service level.  This has resulted in the progressive evolution of a platform whereby health has become a political football - political in the sense of using both a small and a big P.  Fully 80% of services are of a very high standard, such as those seen recently on the RTE documentary &quot;Keeping Ireland Alive&quot;.  However, these services are often overshadowed by the 20% of services that are not delivered as well as we would all like.  This arises to the extent that many people describe our health services as third-world in nature without stopping to consider the excellent services that are delivered day in and day out by staff in hospitals and in communities throughout the country.  It is important to acknowledge today what is working well.  I am keen to step beyond the usual headlines - to use RTE's strap-line from the programme &ndash; and paint a picture of our health care as it is delivered currently and the positive impact it is having on patients, service users and staff.<br\/><br\/>My focus today is not on structures.  I am of a view that over the decades there has been an overemphasis on the importance of structures to the detriment of putting the patient at the centre of all we do, integrating how we deliver care and ensuring that patient safety and care quality is our utmost priority.  My focus today is more on a number of important themes, principles and considerations, such as the need for a decisive shift from the acute hospital sector to the primary and social care setting due to changing demographic profiles, the impact on our health services if we fail to make this shift and some suggestions on how such a significant shift could be funded.<br\/><br\/>As I mentioned earlier, 80% of our health system is of a very high standard.  Despite the resource constraints faced by the health services over the past six years, numerous improvements - too numerous to mention today - have occurred throughout all areas of the health services.  Stroke treatment is an excellent example.  Each year, more than 500 stroke patients receive thrombolysis to dissolve clots in arteries that cause strokes.  In addition, some 150 people have had thrombectomy procedures, whereby obstructing clots were removed from large brain arteries to prevent devastating strokes.  This places Ireland in the top three countries in Europe delivering acute stroke therapies.  We are seeing similar positive outcomes for people with major heart attacks.  Approximately 85% of patients received primary angioplasty within 90 minutes.  This compares singularly well internationally.<br\/><br\/>Our success in diagnosing and treating cancer is well known and follows a difficult centralisation programme that, like many other areas in health care, became a political football for many years.  However, thankfully, the views of the clinical experts prevailed and the outcomes are positive today.  I have no doubt that we will face other decisions in health care very soon that will be equally contentious and will involve situation where local views diverge from those of clinical experts.<br\/><br\/>Another major success in the Irish health service is the improved uptake of childhood and school immunisation programmes.  The figures compare well with World Health Organization targets.  For example, in 2015 over 65,000 children were immunised.  For the 6-in-1 childhood vaccine, there is a 95% uptake.  For the MMR vaccine at 24 months, the uptake is 93%.<br\/><br\/>While we continually hear and read criticism of our mental health services, significant improvements are seldom mentioned.  For example, the numbers on the child and adolescent mental health services waiting lists continue to decrease.  Furthermore, in 2015, 95% children were admitted to age-appropriate child and adolescent inpatient units, compared with 25% in 2008.  Moreover, one in every 100 adults in Ireland is estimated to have received suicide prevention training through applied suicide intervention skills training and safeTALK.<br\/><br\/>I could spend the entire 20 minutes discussing other improvements, such as the success of the quit smoking initiative, the increase in numbers of community intervention teams throughout the country and so on.  However, I wish to move my focus to the horizon and to the future of health care in the country.<br\/><br\/>The positive examples I have outlined show that despite the challenges faced by our health services over the past six years, which was a recessionary period, there has been a positive trend in awareness, early detection and the provision of the right care in the right place at the right time.  This means we are living longer, ageing better and learning to live with ill-health.  In fact, these improvements to our health care system in recent years mean that we are adding approximately 20,000 people over 65 years of age per annum to our population.  This figure is projected to increase by 4%, or approximately 188,000 people, between now and 2021.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, the Irish longitudinal study on ageing, TILDA, reports that 64.8% of this over 65 age cohort live with multi-morbidity.<\/p><p>This is defined as the presence of two or more chronic conditions.  Treating an older population with the presence of chronic disease is costly and getting more costly.  A graph in my written submission shows the relative cost of inpatient treatment by age category last year and projected to 2022.<\/p><p> While it is good news that we are likely to live longer, it carries with it new challenges in the required changes to our health service.  Unless we plan for these changes now, we are going to run into significant difficulties in ten years' time.  In fact, we are facing those difficulties already, as we can see in the 5% to 6% increase in the presentations to our emergency departments year on year and the impact that this is having on our acute hospital system and, in particular, available bed capacity for elective work.  Our data show that we are doing more emergency work and less elective work each year.  It goes without saying that, as the number of emergency admissions increases, there is reducing space for elective activity.  This trend is set to continue unless something changes.  If it continues, all work will be emergency work and we will be unable to accommodate elective work.<\/p><p> Committee members will have heard many times in the course of their work witnesses highlighting the need for us to shift our planning away from the acute hospital setting towards primary care.  However, this necessitates a \"decisive\" shift towards primary care and for us to be clear about what we actually mean when we say this.  To me, this means doing things in acute care settings that can, and should, only be done in acute care settings.  Historically, we would have engaged in a simplistic restructuring exercise to achieve this.<\/p><p> As we are all well aware, the HSE was created with a big bang.  Politically and legislatively, it was easy, but it was not necessarily a good idea and not well thought through.  The rationale behind the establishment of the HSE was to centralise operations.  This type of structure, coupled with an unexpected economic recession, led to a command and control-type system that disempowered those tasked with service delivery.  It also tended to stifle the creativity and innovation required of a sustainable, adaptive organisation.  Overall, we have learned that 105,000 staff cannot be managed from a central location.<\/p><p> Following a decision by the Government in 2011, we are now at a stage of advanced progress in slowly unwinding much of that.  Seven hospital groups, nine community health organisations and the National Ambulance Service have been established.  While not a perfect structure, significant consideration has been given to these new health care delivery organisations, which are premised primarily on patient population flows.  These new organisations now require to be left alone and given time to embed and grow as the main operational delivery arm of the health service.  Whether these structures are the most optimal has become less important than the need to implement them fully, including by providing them with sufficient management capacity and then allowing them a period of at least five to seven years to bed down properly before evaluating them and considering any further change.<\/p><p> In much the same way that restructuring does not provide the easy solution, simply increasing the numbers of acute hospital beds is not the easy solution either.  The committee will have heard many people, including representative bodies, calling for an increase in our acute bed stock.  If I may, I will put this in context.  The health system uses 3.5 million bed days per annum.  When adjusted only for demographics for the next 30 years, this number of bed days will have to grow to 6.4 million.  That would be unsustainable in cost and staffing terms.  There would be a requirement to add in excess of 300 beds per year.  The current cost of the public hospital system is &euro;5.3 billion per annum and we would require double this spend to deliver a doubling of capacity as well as providing capital funding for new facilities.  We would do far better to invest in the development of primary and social care services to support people in their communities.<\/p><p> To achieve the decisive shift away from the acute hospital setting to primary care and social care, a significant additional resource is required.  However, such a resource will take time to develop, given how we are funded currently.  To overcome this, a considerable rethink is needed of some of our existing policies, particularly in terms of how to fund sustainably the type of supports that we need as we grow older, whether that be long-term care, home care packages, home help hours or aids and appliances.  It will also require a rethink of our capital funding investment.  A change to multi-annual service planning and budgeting would also assist in supporting longer term planning for the demands on our resources.<\/p><p> Currently, we have a health planning environment that is tied to an electoral cycle as well as a 12-month fiscal public service budgeting cycle.  Both of these factors essentially drive short-term decision making and their resultant outcomes.  The change cycle in health is longer than 12 months.  An annual budget-service plan cycle hampers, rather than facilitates, improvement and reform.  Instead, we need a capacity to plan that allows and supports longer term decision making and promotes an environment of strategic thought based on evidence.<\/p><p> Closely aligned to this, and a matter on which I have commented publicly in the past, is the need to build a general public consensus concerning the maximum appropriate and feasible investment in health and social care for the next 15 to 20 years.  In other words, how much are taxpayers willing to hand over for the health service they want?  This consensus would have to bear in mind the realities of the economic cycle at any given point in time and competing pressures for Government funding.<\/p><p> I will turn to the issue of a fair deal for primary care.  Our population is getting older and their care needs are becoming significantly more expensive.  How do we sustainably resource this into the future?  We tackled part of this problem a number of years ago through the introduction of a successful scheme that gave a good degree of assurance for the older population around their long-term care, namely, the nursing homes support scheme, or fair deal.  It is a fair question to ask why we do not have such a scheme or level of assurance around care that is not long term.<\/p><p> One of the policy issues that should be considered as we examine the future of health care is whether we are going to put in place a demand-led funded environment that guarantees the supports for people moving on from the acute phase of their care to live their lives where they wish to, which by and large is in their own homes.  Such a scheme would allow the likes of expensive home care packages to be funded into the future, but we need to reach a settled view on that.  Otherwise, our system will become increasingly unsustainable.<\/p><p> The HSE's programme for health services improvement has 12 major programmes under way, constituting in the order of 500 subprogrammes.  For the most part, these are patient-centred projects that will happen over three to five years and are designed to enhance service delivery to patients and service users.<\/p><p> There exists a perception that the health services can undertake these major improvement programmes for free or, to put it another way, carry out such major transformation while continuing to provide the same level of services as last year without getting any extra money.  This does not happen in large industry, and it has dawned on health systems internationally that transformation programmes need to be funded.<\/p><p> The committee will have heard from many witnesses about the number of transformative processes that are under way in our health services with varying degrees of success.  To date, all of these programmes have been funded from within existing resources, but then we question why we have not seen a quantum shift in health care performance in Ireland.  This is one of the reasons that we have been talking for decades about a decisive shift towards primary and social care, but not actually achieving it.<\/p><p> I wish to tell members about a health service where this issue is being taken seriously.  In the state of New York, a major health service reform, called the delivery system reform incentive payment programme, DSRIP, is being undertaken.  The aim of DSRIP is to improve significantly the way Medicaid beneficiaries receive their health care in order to reduce that cost and deal with the issue of chronic disease through integration and the avoidance of hospitals.  The aim over the five-year implementation period is to cut costs by $17 billion.  However, it is recognised that, in order to make that saving, there must first be investment.  An overstretched system cannot easily move resources from one part of its service to another in order to effect change.  We know that we must move resources and spend out of the acute sector and into primary care, but if we were simply to do that now, we would probably collapse our overall system.<\/p><p> New York calculated the saving over time and decided to invest up front part of that saving against a clear roadmap and clear deliverables, as a result of which the service providers in the state participating in this programme have been provided over the five years with $8.5 billion to fund the cost of transformation.  This is the reality of health care transformation.  DSRIP will promote community-level collaborations and focus on system reform, specifically on a goal to achieve a 25% reduction in avoidable hospital use over five years.  All DSRIP funds will be based on performance linked to achievement of project milestones, thus paying for value.<\/p><p> In the UK, the King's Fund reached similar conclusions about what was necessary to effect effective transformation in the NHS.  In Northern Ireland, a recently published expert panel report, entitled \"Systems, Not Structures - Changing Health and Social Care\", recommended that a ring-fenced transformation fund be established to ensure its transformation process was appropriately resourced.<\/p><p>I make no apology for saying that if ongoing and future transformation is not funded in this jurisdiction, particularly in an overstretched and growing health care economy, we will not achieve the transformation which members expect or desire.  It is as simple as that.<\/p><p> Another important consideration that is often overlooked when we discuss deficiencies in our health service is the level of annual capital funding.  Members will be aware of some of the mega-projects in health such as the children's hospital.  Through other committees, many will be aware of some of the lesser-known capital projects, including the upkeep and repair of many existing buildings and pieces of equipment in the health sector.  We will spend approximately &euro;375 million on capital developments in health this year across primary care, mental health, acute care and a wide other variety of services.  Of great concern to me is the amount of money available to us between 2017 and 2021 in the capital space to pay for our ambulances, x-ray machines, MRIs and all those types of equipment on which we critically depend.  That sum is &euro;2.25 billion.  However, that sum does not meet the &euro;3.64 billion that is required to meet the long list of priority replacements to maintain safety and quality in our health care system.  We have, therefore, an immediate problem.  There is a mid-term review of the capital programme in 2017 and health needs to be very high on that agenda.  I will seek to ensure that all those who have the responsibility for carrying out that review are aware of this capital challenge.<\/p><p> Looking at the next ten years, we need to be spending in the order of &euro;9 billion in health capital to address issues of infection control and ageing equipment.  This takes cognisance of the fact that we replaced a lot of equipment at the height of the economic prosperity, most of which is now ageing very rapidly.  This includes critical equipment such as our ambulance fleet.  As this exists as a quality and safety concern it becomes even more of a priority.<\/p><p> Often forgotten within our capital budget is the funding of e-health.  I will not spend too much time on this as members have previously heard from the CIO, Richard Corbridge.  Health, like every other sector, needs ready access to good information to improve and sustainably deliver quality cost-effective services.  The delivery of integrated care, with a strong primary care focus, is predicated upon having effective technology to allow for easy access to the appropriate clinical advice independent of the care setting and across care settings.  In other industries in Ireland this is a given.  The farming sector, for example, has an electronic record to trace animal identification and movement for all sheep, goats, pigs and bovines.  We need to redesign our systems at every opportunity to ensure that the true benefits of an e-health programme are available to patients and staff.  The current electronic health record business case envisages that, by 2020, clinicians will be able to access digital information about patients appropriately, and by 2025 we will see a digital fabric throughout the health system including a system that is also accessible and in the hands of the people of Ireland.<\/p><p> This is a ten-year journey which will put in place a set of solutions built around the individual health identifier.  It is not a big bang but an evolution of today's systems.  It is not an immediate large investment but rather a commitment to incrementally evaluate the success of digital over a ten-year period and continue to add to the investment as benefits can be seen and success is clear.<\/p><p> Obviously, health care cannot be provided, nor can space and equipment work, without people.  Despite considerable attention, attracting and retaining certain cohorts of our staff remains a considerable challenge at both national and local levels.  Recent OECD reports identify that the health system in Ireland has a low number of doctors when compared with other jurisdictions.  The work of the clinical programmes within the HSE has demonstrated this at a specialty level in Ireland, in specialties such as orthopaedics, obstetrics, ICU and neurology.  Typically, we need to double our number of doctors to deliver on the models of care set out for our population.  As part of the development of hospital groups, future recruitment of medical staff will be part of the group structure.  This will allow for significant flexibility in the rotation of staff across hospital sites and allow for an enhanced training experience for doctors and will reduce the vacancy level of sites with traditional recruitment difficulties.<\/p><p> A committee appointed by the HSE regarding reform of the processes for creation, approval recruitment and appointment to consultant posts has concluded its work and developed a paper, Successful Consultant Recruitment and Retention, which is available and which we have shared with the committee.  Recruitment in the health sector is and will remain an ongoing challenge for the foreseeable future.  Policy decisions regarding the level of training places, salaries, terms and conditions for health sector workers are required in order for the Irish health services to remain an attractive destination for our most qualified staff.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I thank all members of the committee for the invaluable work that they have undertaken.  I am sure the evidence given to this committee so far has been an eye-opener for some members in terms of how complex and challenging the delivery of health and social care services can be.  The simple-fix solution may not be as simple as it first seems.  I am of the belief that, with the correct strategic approach and a close re-examination of some of the policy constraints within which we are obliged to function, we can better meet the challenges that face us with an ever-increasing demand for our services over the next ten years.  This is especially so in relation to seed funding for our major transformation programmes to allow us to be able to invest now to generate more efficiencies later.  It also applies in relation to the need for multi-annual planning and budgeting.  The level of capital investment in the health sector is an area that also requires close consideration.  Above all, it is important that we all work together to build the best health service that we can and that we can restore the public's confidence in the services that we deliver.<\/p><p> I will close out by taking the opportunity to thank all of my colleagues who work so diligently delivering services right across the country in such challenging circumstances. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Before members come in, I will ask Mr. O'Brien to clarify two points from his opening statement.

It is my view, as it would be that of other people in similar roles in other jurisdictions, that there are no perfect structures and that whatever structures we have at any given time, it is always possible to argue that a different structure would be preferable.  There is also, however, very significant evidence from restructuring processes around the world of the impact of restructuring.  Following a study of the context and processes of the mergers of health care providers in England, Professor Naomi Fulop has produced a report which shows that structural changes typically lead to delays to service improvements of at least 18 months, that there tends to be a loss of managerial focus on services leading to a risk to patient safety and that the expectation of cost savings, generally speaking, are not realised.<\/p> <p>  A satirical study, A Surrealistic Mega-analysis of Redisorganisation Theories, made the serious point that, around the world, one can observe a pattern across many countries whereby one poorly planned, top-down restructure invariably leads to another.  We are well into a process in which the hospital groups, in particular, are beginning to bear fruit in terms of the alignment of services, as are the CHOs.  If we decide to stop that there will be a price to be paid, as there was when the eastern regional health authority was stopped before it got to a certain point.  We will not necessarily be able to produce a structure to replace it which would be perfect, or less imperfect, than what we currently have.<\/p> <p>  We are spending a very substantial sum of money on health and there is an opportunity, through some of the processes currently under way involving groups and CHOs, to use the funding better by the realignment of services.  I am not saying we need to spend an ever-increasing amount on health care.<\/p><p>In order to allow strategic change planning, we need to plan ahead over a longer time horizon than we do.

He referred to the cost of equipment and said, to paraphrase, we bought a lot during the boom and it could do with being replaced.  Why are we buying equipment?  Normal process in businesses is that large plant would be leased and maintained by a service provider.  Why is this not common practice in the HSE?  I understand some is going on, however it seems we are front-loading money on equipment and then, I assume, the HSE needs to employ engineers to maintain it.  It seems completely contrary to how it is done in a normal corporate entity.<\/p> <p>  It is concerning that we would not set out to have a perfect structure and then, maybe, move back a little from it.  We are always using the word \"ambitious\" in the committee.  Would we not try to be ambitious to have the optimum structure?  I am probably wearing people out speaking about the alignment of the seven hospital groups and nine CHOs.  We have raised it on numerous occasions and examined the structure we have been given in one of the documents.

I do not know why it has not percolated beyond in terms of capital spend and capital investment in plant.<\/p> <p>  I would like to tease out hospital groups.  There are various views as to whether they are coalescing properly with the CHOs.  The HSE establishes a hospital group and gives it independence.  Will there be any overarching national policy that will set down parameters for the hospital group in terms of the type of investment it will make and the services it will provide?  For example, if all seven hospitals decide to do left hips very well, who will do the right hips?  Will there be a national policy that will filter down to ensure we have adequate services in all specialties across the country and that we do not have unnecessary duplication?  Given that we are giving the hospital groups independence and their own decision making processes and budgets, how can we ensure we have adequate cover, particularly for sub-specialties, across the country?<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien said we needed to make a decisive shift from acute hospital settings to primary care.  Probably one of the key issues in making this decisive shift will be negotiations around the GP contract and the delivery of chronic illness care in the community.

What are the broad parameters of what is required regarding the detail of the contract for chronic illness and manpower and manpower planning for this inevitable and decisive shift from acute to primary and community care?<\/p> <p>  We talk about our aging population and the demographic bulge that is evident a short time down the road.  Yet, judging by our investment in geriatric services and specialties, we do not seem to be planning in accordance with what we know is going to happen in training, recruitment, retention, expanding training programmes to ensure we have sufficient capacity and manpower to deal with those challenges.<\/p> <p>  Do we need a division to oversee the roll-out of primary care, or should it be done by the hospital groups?  How should we do it to ensure we get primary care running efficiently in tandem with the acute hospitals?  Over the years, we, and everybody else who has examined health systems across the world, have consistently said primary care is the way health care should be delivered in the years ahead.  Yet, the minute a budget adjustment is required, primary care always seems to be hit first, and then everything falls back on the acute hospital setting.

Mr. O'Brien made many references to the trend that we are moving more towards emergency and away from elective procedures.<\/p><p>My position is that the HSE is not serious about tackling this.  I see no evidence of a systematic plan to deal with the issue.  From the response to a parliamentary question I tabled recently, we learned that, from 1 January to 16 November, Tullamore hospital instigated the full-capacity protocol 511 times.  That is a phenomenal figure.  It suggests that the full-capacity protocol, which I understood was supposed to be a response to an emergency situation, is now becoming more or less a way of life.  I agree that we are heading in the direction of more emergency and less elective care, but I put it to Mr. O'Brien that he is not in any way serious about dealing with that.<\/p><p> In responses to other parliamentary questions I asked, I learned that not one of the 14 primary care centres to be built is to get any additional staff.  Everybody talks about the need to invest in primary care.  Mr. O'Brien said that a significant resource will be required.  How would he quantify a significant resource?  What will it be?  I am sure he knows.  I am disappointed that he did not provide the information earlier but perhaps he would enlighten the committee on what significant resource will be required to begin the move from dealing with emergencies.  The full-capacity protocol is a recognition that there is an emergency situation at a hospital and that drastic measures must be taken.  It appears that hospitals are in an almost permanent state of full-capacity protocol.  I am familiar with the protocol because I worked in the unions when it was first discussed.  At the time, we were given to understand that it would seldom be used but now it is almost permanently in use.  I do not see a plan to move from emergencies only over to primary care, so I would be interested to hear about that.<\/p><p> There was a reference to 20% of what happens in the health service not being of a high standard.  What areas have been identified as not being of a high standard?  What plans are in place to bring them to a high standard?<\/p><p> We are all aware of the difficulties with recruiting and retaining staff in our hospitals.  We are also aware that a significant amount of money is spent every day on agency staff and outsourcing to the private sector.  The Minister has said repeatedly, and I agree, that using agency staff is not good value for money.  However, I do not see a plan to convert agency hours into directly employed hours.  Is there such a plan?  I do not believe there is one but if there is, perhaps the witnesses would share it with us.  As part of that plan, has the HSE set targets for the number of hours currently provided by the private sector or by agencies that will be converted into the best value for money, which is direct labour?<\/p><p> Finally, does the HSE have a timeline for the conclusion of the discussions on the GP contract?  That will be central to planning for the future.  A number of my constituents are GPs and they ask me regularly if there is any news on it and whether there is a timeline.  If there is no deadline, it will be an open-ended process.  This is being held forth as something that might solve some problems but we are already way behind in those negotiations.  We all accept the GP contract is out of date.  The negotiating bodies are ready to begin the process.

The traditional method has been the application of capital in the capital development plan to purchase equipment.  Both members referred to what we would call managed equipment service, MES, contracts which are now being examined intensively as part of the national children's hospital proposal, which was mentioned, and also at a wider level for use across the HSE.  We have looked at models internationally, such as the Karolinska Institutet, which has entered into a major MES, and into an innovation and joint venture arrangement with the Philips corporation, which was the successful applicant, on the back of that.  We have done some assessment of that and we are very open to it.  There is a certain amount of equipment leasing within our system at present.  The HSE must seek prior approval to borrow, a point that arose previously.  Leasing is a form of borrowing and it requires prior approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is not an obstacle.  I am just stating that it is part of the process.  We estimate we need approximately &euro;62 million per year in capital to maintain the equipment base of the health environment.  If we were to examine that on a funded basis over a five or ten-year period, clearly it is an annual amount which is not a capital sum but which would be required to be an increased revenue sum.  The HSE is very open to the idea of considering accessing capital equipment in that way, which is somewhat innovative.  It would still require revenue funding instead of capital funding to pay that increased cost.<\/p> <p>  On maintenance, we have a small number of biomedical engineers who are very capable.  Our national lead is based in Cork and is very strong on all of this.  It is his data I was quoting when I referred to &euro;62 million.  We have a small resource ourselves.  Much of the contract maintenance is carried out by the providers of equipment.  Some of it, and it is an increasing amount, has been taken on board by us as a cost efficiency measure.  We do not have an excess of such people but we must maintain them because they help us to drive value and drive down the cost of maintenance contracts, which typically can last seven years and can be up to 7% of the cost of the equipment.<\/p> <p>  We are very open to the MES idea and we are pursuing it.  We have carried out research on what is working best internationally.  There has been mixed experience with this.  In Sweden, when the full appraisals were carried out, they determined that it would make more sense for the county councils, which run the health environment there, to provide the capital but to proceed with an MES without the use of the private sector, because they were avoiding interest costs and a profit charge.  There are a few variants regarding what that might look like and we are exploring those at present.  The core point is that part of the wider future for the hospital and health environment is that there is a choice between funding a revenue stream or a capital stream, but it needs to be funded.  It is not free if we go with MES, but it can prove productive.  Typically, those contracts internationally are for two life cycles of equipment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I thank the members for the variety of questions.  I will attempt to cover all of them by grouping some of the topics together.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the core relationship between acute and community or primary care, Deputy Kelleher asked an interesting question on whether we should let the hospitals effectively control primary care.  To be honest, that is the last thing I would do.  These relationships are explored in different ways in different jurisdictions.  However, I believe that if we did that, which effectively would be giving hospital groups control of the health care system, we would end up with a more hospital-centric rather than a less hospital-centric care system.  To look at that through the lens of the issue of alignment, there is a legitimate discussion about the alignment between those two sets of organisations.  My back-stop position is that they should be kept separate.  There is a big job of work to be done within hospital groups, whatever boundaries they have, around the relationship between larger and smaller hospitals and more rational use of the resources.  There is a separate piece of work to be done to build strength in our community services.  If they were put into one place in singular organisations, as happens in some jurisdictions at this point, it would be a retrograde step for the development of community health care services in Ireland, which are coming from a lower base of resource.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that our hospitals have had more investment and historically have had slightly stronger management processes.  If they were given control over primary care, I do not believe it would benefit the long-term aspirations we have for a decisive shift towards primary care.<\/p><p> On the alignment of boundaries, I will tell the committee a short story.  Five years ago, when I was in the special delivery unit, all hospitals and community services were organised in what were called integrated service areas, ISAs, of which there were 17.  On a geographical basis, that meant that one person had responsibility for hospitals and community services.  Around that time, as we were heading into the winter, with my job being to manage trolley crises, we organised meetings in every ISA.  Despite the fact that there were common governance structures and processes and singular management, the first thing representatives of the special delivery unit had to do was introduce community service colleagues to hospital colleagues.  The structural approach was not the solution.<\/p><p> I was at a lecture given by Professor Rafael Bengoa who recently led the process in Northern Ireland where they have integrated trust areas.  He made the very same point.  They have not provided the solution and system issues need to be addressed.  I am really dealing with the potential argument that has not been made that what we should do is have singular structures that combine both hospitals and community health organisations.  Something like this was tried in the past but was not successful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":355,"content":"<p>With all due respect, the hospitals were not fully involved in the 17 ISAs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#K00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":356,"content":"<p>They were.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":357,"content":"<p>What role did HSE personnel have in what was going on in voluntary hospitals, for example?

May I come back to Deputy Kelleher's question?<\/p> <p>   Deputy Kelleher asked about the independence issue in respect of hospital groups.  Independence is a word that has been thrown about a lot in the debate around hospital groups.  It is important to stress that there is no definition of what independence means.  Some people have perceived it to mean something like a foundation trust status in the NHS.  Others simply think it means operational freedom to do a set range of tasks in a way that makes operational sense at local level.  The truth is at one end or somewhere in between.  It is clear that hospital groups will be funded by a central entity against a set performance set of standards using activity-based funding, which drive behaviours.  Mr. Liam Woods has spoken about that and can do so again.  We would never go back to the type of thing that happened under the health boards, best illustrated by breast cancer surgery where there were 37 hospitals dabbling in breast cancer surgery resulting in sub-optimal outcomes.  At central level, individual hospital groups will have to be authorised to provide services that are evidence based, sensible and meet a population need based on our population size and distribution.  They would never have the freedom to go back and reintroduce cancer services of a scale and type that are not appropriate.  Some hospital groups get distracted by this notion of trust status, particularly because it has been in the air for such a long time.  I do not believe that the public sector environment in Ireland would move in the direction of the types of freedoms that foundation trusts have in the UK., which gives them freedom to decide the number of staff they will have, what they will pay them, to step outside of national procurement contracts and all that type of thing - I do not think that will ever happen and it is something of a distraction - all we are really talking about is the opportunity for a set of hospitals - in which it makes some sense to put them together - to decide how services will be organised across their sites.  An example was given at a previous meeting of the interoperability that is now occurring between the Mater and Navan hospitals and that is making some sense.  There are similar examples between Beaumont and Cavan hospitals.  While there are those kinds of ground-based operational freedoms, they would not allow hospitals to go off and deliver services, or to use the example, to become left hip specialists.  That would not be permitted by the funding model.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the GP contracts, there is no set timeline for that.  I was asked about my ambitions in this regard.  My view is that we need to re-establish the primacy of the generalist.  In our health system, as in so many, we have tended to make sovereigns of specialists.  One GP colleague put it to me in this way.  In general practice, the patients stay the same and the conditions change; in specialist hospitals the condition stays the same and the patients keep changing, which can be rather annoying from their point of view.  We need to have a health system that over a period of time recognises the specialty that is general practice, puts general practice at the heart of prevention and chronic disease management and gives it a full range of access to diagnostics.  The general practitioners who refer patients to hospitals should not be second guessed by junior doctors there with only a fraction of their experience in general practice.  We need to fund general practice in order to do that.  We must recognise the workforce base, if I can use that term, in general practice right now is stretched.<\/p><p>We have not been retaining GP trainees in the numbers we once did.  We also have an age profile that is concerning.  Consequently, whatever we do or do not agree during the GP contract negotiations, it will not be possible to implement the ideal general practice primary care service in one fell swoop.  We have to recognise that there is a workforce development issue which will probably take ten full years to address.  This will be a long journey rather than a single event.  Those are my broad ambitions and hopes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#L02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I presume the skill mix comes in to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#M00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":404,"content":"<p>And premises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#M00400","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Both premises and skill mix come into it.  Recognising what is currently a scarce commodity of experienced general practitioners, we need to look at how we can support general practitioners with other allied health professions in order to ensure that they can design processes which work optimally for the populations they are trying to serve.  That will require the extraction of resources from the acute sector over time.  It will require over time some reconfiguration of the acute sector so that some facilities that we currently regard as acute facilities effectively become primary care facilities.  That will be difficult.  Local communities may not necessarily be delighted with that.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the issue of agencies, the only reason the health service depends on agency staff currently is because of its inability to fill permanent posts.  No health service manager, apart from in rare exceptional circumstances, wants to have a dependency on agency staff, either in medical or nursing.  The Deputy will be aware that currently there is a real challenge in recruiting permanent staff notwithstanding our willingness to give permanent contracts.  It is a major difficulty for us.

That has been reported and, in our dialogues with the INMO and our own staff, we are very aware of that.  Income and the earnable net income have become a challenge.  Opportunities for education and development are also an incentive and are desired by staff so the extent to which we provide that, which is quite extensive, is an attractor.<\/p> <p>  I will make a point on agency staff.

There are challenges in this regard.  For us to come forward with a report that works for the health service in Ireland over the next ten years and to have the most effective health system in the short, medium and long term, we need to be able to deal with these challenges if we are seriously looking at a non-restructuring solution or, at least, trying to minimise restructuring.

Who will be responsible for oversight of the step-down facilities required when someone needs to leave hospital when their care comes to an end and they need to go to a step-down facility or a nursing home?  What is the governance structure between the hospitals and our primary care centres?  Mr. O'Brien needs to elaborate on this.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien made reference to acute hospital beds and said that simply increasing their number is not the easy solution.  He made reference to the importance of community care and step-down facilities.  We are all in agreement that if we had properly functioning community care and primary care centres it would alleviate bed capacity issues in our hospital system.  The clinical director of the Saolta group, Dr. Pat Nash, came before the committee.  The group stated University Hospital Galway, which is a centre of excellence model 4 hospital for seven counties, is not fit for purpose and cannot expand due to physical space issues.  Even if we had functioning community care, we would still need extra bed capacity.  The group made reference to the need for a new hospital at Merlin Park on State-owned land.  What are Mr. O'Brien's views on this?  Improvements in the ability to treat people and medicines mean that we will have an ageing population and that there will be a great need for acute hospitals.  We will still have very sick people who will need to go into hospital.  Does Mr. O'Brien agree that we need an independent assessment of bed capacity in Ireland?  By this I mean independent of the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#N00700","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien for coming before the committee and for his presentation.  He also came before the committee at the start of this process.  I am now a hell of a lot more knowledgeable of the system then I was back then and it is very beneficial to have Mr. O'Brien before the committee again.  We are focusing on number of areas we see as critical for our report to give the health system an opportunity to succeed.<\/p> <p>  An issue that keeps arising is the lack of accountability throughout the entire HSE.  I will ask Mr. O'Brien a very direct question.  In the structures under which he operates, can he bring about accountability?  Is the system so far gone that it is impossible for him to do so?  What would make it possible?  If we do not have accountability in health system we will not solve the problems.  This theme has arisen with group after group which has come before the committee over the past four or five months.  Is it possible for Mr. O'Brien to do the job he was employed to do in the current circumstances?  Do we need to introduce legislation or changes to allow him fulfil his role?  For how long has Mr. O'Brien been in his current position?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#N00800","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":447,"content":"<p>Four years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#N00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":448,"content":"<p>In his responses to the questions we sent him on recruitment, Mr. O'Brien stated the HSE is looking for a chief operations officer and a chief strategy and planning officer, and he provided a list of other changes he would like to bring about.  He states that both roles mentioned will be filled as soon as is practicable.  This is of concern to me.  Why is it so difficult to get people in place for such critical roles?  The HSE should go about recruiting for a particular critical role and appoint a group to advertise and interview, or do this internally.  A working group should be established to acquire these individuals, a timeline should be set and they should be appointed.  To state that the positions will be filled as soon as practicable is too open.  I would much prefer to see a statement that these roles will be filled by the first quarter of 2017.  This would create a target for which somebody would be accountable.  If the person is in place, that would be great.  If, however, he or she is not, we could ask why that is the case.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Mr. O'Brien that it is very difficult for anybody to make an assumption on whether the hospital groups are working if they are not working optimally.  The seven hospital groups came before the committee.  I was very impressed by the set-up in the mid-west and felt it is working quite well because of the structures in place.  It carries out routine procedures in its category 2 hospitals, which frees up capacity in its category 3 hospitals.  I thought this was a very simple way to do business which improves efficiency.  The next obvious question is why this does not happen in all of the other groups.  It should be happening and we should make it happen.<\/p> <p>  I asked each hospital group whether it recruits as group or individually and I received different answers from the various groups.  Recruiting as a group should be the only way it is done.  To go back to the area I know best, which is Kerry, it is extremely difficult for Kerry University Hospital to recruit but it is not as difficult for Cork University Hospital.  If the group recruited, the doctors, nurses and consultants could be assigned so there would be no cherry-picking by people who want to go to where all the activity is.  We would have much more successful outcomes.  This system exists in the mid-west where recruitment is done by the group, but the latter is not done in the area from which I come.  It should be compulsory.<\/p><p>Again I return to the question of whether it is possible to make this happen.  Mr. O'Brien mentioned the success of acute stroke units.  There is no acute stroke unit in Kerry University Hospital, a category 3 hospital.  There is no cardiologist in the hospital.  It depends on a phone call up and down from Cork once a week.  These are structural issues that can be addressed if tackled properly.  The people in Kerry to whom I speak say the people in Cork, if they are of a sympathetic mind, might come down and help us but, if they are not, there is nothing we can do about it.  The cost of recruiting staff through agencies is three times that of recruiting staff directly.  If a group recruitment system were in place whereby staff were sent to the less attractive areas, this issue would be solved and the less attractive areas would become more attractive with the increased staffing.  One problem solves another.<\/p><p> Regarding the shift to primary care, do the witnesses have any figures or data as to what kind of investment is needed in primary care to make it work and subsequently take the pressure off the hospital system down the line?  From the first day this committee met, the message of investing in primary care to help solve the issues further up the line has been coming across.  Mr. O'Brien mentioned the New York model.  New York had a specific savings target and investment budget.  Do we have anything like that?  If not, we should seek it.  If we know what to invest in with a degree of - I will not say certainty - hope that if the work is done, significant moneys will be saved further down the line in the hospital system, then it is worth investing in it.  Do the witnesses have any figures that would help us in this area?<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Brien mentioned IT although he said he would not spend much time discussing it.  It comes across to us that IT is one of the most important areas in which to invest to allow savings to be made and the system to run efficiently.  Do the witnesses have any figures as to the amount of money needed to invest in IT to get us to where we want to be?  This is critical.<\/p><p> Regarding Mr. O'Brien's issue with 12-month budgets, I do not know of any organisation that does not operate according to such budgets.  The whole country operates this way.  By what system does Mr. O'Brien suggest we operate?  What different model could we consider?  Nearly every organisation I know works according to an annual budget.  What would Mr. O'Brien like to see done differently to this to help the HSE do its job?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#N01000","speaker":"1321","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":450,"content":"<p>For the benefit of members, and following on from Deputy Brassil's question about vacancies at senior management level, I draw the committee's attention to the document we circulated which contains responses that came in to this question.

I will try to be brief in my comments and questions.  The terms of reference of this committee are to provide a single-tier system that provides services in a timely manner based on need rather than ability to pay, which effectively means patient-centred care.  In our planning, patient-centred care tends to be forgotten about, unlike structures and governance.  My questions therefore concern patient-centred care.<\/p> <p>  First, what do the witnesses think will trigger the transfer from hospital-centred care to primary-centred care?  We have a capacity problem in general practice but also with public health nurses, therapists and psychologists.  A range of personnel make up primary care, not just general practitioners.<\/p> <p>  Second, Mr. O'Brien mentioned transitional funding, which seems to be absolutely essential in any transformation programme.  How would such transitional funding be targeted?<\/p> <p>  Third, there is a problem with integration of GP and hospital services and there is a gap between the two.  The trigger of the transfer of people from general practice to hospital services tends to be immediate.  There is no transition between hospital and GP services.  I would like Mr. O'Brien to comment on how this transition could be filled.<\/p> <p>  There is a problem with governance in our hospitals and within the hospital groups, and there is very little GP input into governance in the hospital groups, which leads to much frustration among general practitioners.  There is also very deep frustration among consultants in the hospital groups that their voice is not heard.  There is a gap in the governance between what it is intended to do and how it is delivered.<\/p> <p>  Finally, regarding bed capacity, I believe 600 beds are occupied by people who are on delayed discharges.  This is a huge rate of bed occupancy which does not fulfil an acute need.  Perhaps Mr. O'Brien could comment on how delayed discharges and transfer to community services could be bridged.  There has been a huge withdrawal of or reduction in publicly-funded chronic care, which has been transferred to privately-funded chronic care, and the gap in this regard needs to be addressed.  Publicly-funded chronic care is very important but seems to be decreasing rather than increasing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#O00500","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I will respond to Deputy Brassil's questions first, if I may.  I was appointed as acting CEO in 2012 and became the director general in 2013 on the passage of the legislation that created those changes.  By this stage, if the statements of the time were to be believed, the HSE would not exist.  It was my expectation at that time that many of the changes we are discussing around hospital groups would be much more advanced than they currently are.  The intention was that each hospital group would have a board appointed to it on an administrative basis, that is, without legislation, and that legislation would follow to create those hospital groups as legal entities.  As we know, that has not happened.<\/p> <p>  At a certain point during my time in the HSE, it appointed boards to two of the hospital groups, namely, mid-west and what we now call Saolta.  General practice was well represented on both boards, as were other local and relevant interests.  Unfortunately, the process of appointing other boards has not progressed, although the Minister is currently progressing it and, as recently as last week, on a ministerial basis, appointed or reappointed a board for the mid-west hospital group and is progressively intending to do so for all the other hospital groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Brien said primary care was represented.

The exception is the Children's Hospital Group, which has a ministerial appointed board.  The Children's Hospital Group is in a slightly different position for a variety of reasons.  In terms of the six acute hospital groups, two had boards and four did not.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the process of appointing chief executives for those hospital groups is difficult.  The level of interest in those roles was small and the potential to recruit outside of our system or to attract any international interest was adversely affected by the level of remuneration, which was not competitive in terms of those fulfilling similar roles in other jurisdictions.  Ultimately, at my request and that of Mr. Woods and his predecessor, the brightest of our own staff were prepared to stand forward and take up those roles.  The chief executives we currently have in place were appointed on an interim basis outside of the recruitment process simply because those recruitment processes carried out by the Public Appointments Services had not been successful.  That having been said, and the committee having met them all, they are all doing pretty good jobs and making a good contribution.<\/p> <p>  On the two posts the Deputy asked me about, I used the term as soon as practicable because, contrary to what one might expect, I have very little control over those processes.

That led to provisional approval in August which enabled me to engage in the dialogue I needed to engage in with the others who were affected, which included the issue of the communication the Deputy has there.  We then had to get into a further process which required the individual job specifications to be signed off, not only by myself and the Department of Health but also by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, before we could invite the Public Appointments Service to proceed with the recruitment process.  That is why I was ambiguous about the deadline.

In our submissions to the Department when this was being mentioned as part of the Government formation process, our central point was that this should not be an acute bed review; it should be a total bed review taking into account long-term care beds as well rather than only acute hospital beds.<\/p> <p>  I touched on the governance issues around hospital groups.  The delay in the appointment of boards has led to some ambiguity in the sense that we have groups which, by general public comment, are intended to have various operating freedoms but the reality is that the directorate of the HSE remains fully accountable for them and the legal authority that they have currently is through the delegation structure set out in the 2004 Act.  I receive a delegation from the directorate and Mr. Wood receives a delegation from me and he parcels that out to the seven group chief executives and their authority is very much HSE authority, but, as was said, there are very different mixtures of underpinning governance in the different hospital groups.  Saolta and the mid-west group, with the exception of St. John's, are essentially statutory hospitals where the governance is simple in that sense in that we can give full authority to an individual and state something is his or hers and he or she is accountable for it.  In hospital groups which have a mixture of statutory hospitals and voluntary hospitals and the level of control of the group chief executive is through ownership of the budget and the service level arrangement with the voluntary hospitals, that is of a different quality.  Obviously, we have had to take the view that we work with the raw material we have.  There is no policy direction currently as to what way that will ultimately be resolved and the HSE does not have a position or has not taken a position, one way or the other.  In other words, we are not saying they should all be statutory and we are not saying they should all become voluntary.  We are saying all these groups are slightly different and there may have to be an eclectic set of arrangements, provided they are effective, clear and straightforward in relation to each group.  We are not saying they all have to be exactly the same.  There is a diversity in the health system.  That is the way it developed.  Some of that diversity has been good and some of it not so good.  Mr. Woods will address the issue of Saolta and beds, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#P00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Deputy Brassil asked specific questions about numbers of beds.  The Deputy is correct in saying that some hospitals are running at capacity and do not, for example, as referred to by Deputy Harty, have significant delayed discharged.  In the context of Galway, there is good access to community services, there are relatively few patients clinically appropriate for discharge who cannot be discharged and the hospital is in that sense running at high capacity.  Galway is putting in a 75-bed block which will open in February next and that is replacing existing capacity.  We are looking at proposals to see can we also then retain another 30 beds because we see a need in Galway for increased capacity.  Those 30 beds would be available within the existing facility and would require some upgrade.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brassil mentioned that Dr. Pat Nash had referred to the Merlin Park site as a potential location.  In many ways, in Galway it has long been thought that Merlin Park - even parking on the campus in Galway would indicate that it is difficult and challenging - would be a suitable site for another hospital over time.  It has not happened yet.  Some services, as part of the group's overall service design, are moving to Merlin Park.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien addressed the independence issue.  On the notion of an independent review, it is already determined to be so.  HSE has data that would help inform that but the review itself would be independent.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked how groups could work effectively if there were no restructuring, if I understood the question.  In a way, where we see it working well is that there is a strong view of what the appropriate clinical pathways are and that they are adhered to.  There are some examples of that working well, for instance, in neurology.  I am not sure if Dr. Colin Doherty from St. James's was here but we were at the Joint Committee on Health recently.  There is a model working which is connecting GPs, patients and neurologists, freeing up space in St. James's, providing better care for patients, and linking effectively with GPs and speedily providing GPs with advice online.

The net problem is that regardless of who is in control, there are limits on total supply and total capacity.  It is for that reason I mentioned in my opening remarks the issue of making non-fair deal as demand-led as fair deal is.  If the hospitals controlled it, they would ultimately have exactly the same capacity and the same budget that the communities have now.  I would be concerned that this would turn the hospitals into magnets for access to home care.  In the past, for various reasons we have sought to prioritise egress from hospitals.

This is probably relevant to the point made by Deputy Brassil about the assignment of individuals across locations within a group to provide care on multiple sites during the training phase or in permanent employment.  The groups are focused on the latter aspect of this issue.  I will come to the actual recruitment mechanisms in a moment.  Joint appointment across sites is happening and we will see more of that.  I think we will be increasingly dependent on rotation from larger to smaller sites to maintain appropriate staff levels and the right kind of clinical input, which is a point that has been mentioned.  This is part of group planning.  We can give the committee documentation on the recruitment process itself.  Voluntary hospitals tend to recruit for themselves.  Approximately half of the total acute service resource is in voluntary hospitals.  The statutory hospitals recruit through the national recruitment service.  Truly national campaigns are sometimes run.  A recent campaign to recruit emergency department nurses asked for applications to all points.  The recruitment service will support somewhere like Limerick in running its own competitions locally.  It does the same in Galway.  Local units are supported in running competitions.  There can be back-end administration around Garda clearance and contracting that does not necessarily exist on every site.  The interviewing and the creation of competitions is done locally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#Q02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Deputy Harty raised the question of what would trigger a transfer of activity and also asked about the possibility of a transitional fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#Q02500","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":499,"content":"<p>The questions are linked.  I mentioned DSRIP earlier as an example because I do not believe, given the current pressures on the hospital system and the amount of work that is waiting outside the doors of the hospital system, that we can expect any time soon to be able to extract the type of funding from hospitals that is necessary to develop the primary care system to the point where it is viable to do that.  I believe it is going to be necessary to pump investment into primary care so that the transition can take place.  The negotiations on the GP contract are central to our understanding and conceptualising of that.  Just before the economic implosion, efforts were made to remove funding arbitrarily from the hospitals and invest it in primary care.  The net effect of this was that the hospitals went into meltdown and all of this was unwound in the course of a year.  I think the concept of transitional funding is absolutely central to whatever it is the committee ultimately recommends, or whatever it is that any one of us would like to see by way of transformation in the health system.  DSRIP is just one example, but it appears to be a very successful example.  I shared a book with the committee earlier that gives details of some other examples in other parts of the world that may be of help.<\/p> <p>  A couple of Deputies have referred to the governance issue.  I sit here in a very unusual position.  I occupy a job which, as the Chairman will know, I did not actually apply for.  I am both the chief executive and the chairman of the largest organisation in the State, bar none.  I took up this position in the expectation that I would probably have it for a shorter period than I have had it for to date.  At some point, when there is a settled view about hospital groups and so on, there will need to be legislation so that accountability rests where authority lies, which is not the case at present.  I would not wish to see a legislative revision of the health service that does not address the fact that we have one person operating as chairman and chief executive of the largest organisation in the State.  It is a very uncomfortable position to be in, as I know the Chair is aware.  This brings me back to the issue of accountability.  This year we introduced a new accountability framework for all of those who hold budgets within the system.  It has been effective.  It has been difficult to do that in the past because - not to put a tooth on it - we have entered a number of years - probably five years of service planning - where everyone has known that the level of funding provided was not equal to the level of service committed to.  That recurrent supplementary funding of &euro;500 million or &euro;750 million has had to be provided is evidence of this.  In the current year, the Oireachtas voted a revised budget - not a supplementary budget - which was able to bring that cycle to an end.  This enabled us to say to all the budget holders across all of their domains that they can no longer simply say the job is undoable.  That has a fundamental impact on the psychology of accountability.<\/p><p>I also believe that just as clinicians, nurses and other professionals are accountable for professional standards to professional bodies, we need to recognise that management, administration and leadership in the health system, where it is provided by people who are not members of those professions, should be similarly regulated to prescribed professional standards so that we have an equal playing field in the health care setting.  Without it, we are not valuing that discipline in health care to the extent that we should and we are not providing equal accountability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#Q02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":501,"content":"<p>There are major corporate governance issues which were flagged at the time, which remain and need to be addressed.

It was announced in the budget that &euro;35 million would be allocated for mental health services but we found out later that only &euro;15 million would be available to be spent.  The reason given by the Department of Health was that it was not possible to spend the other &euro;20 million.  Is that a decision of the HSE?  Does the HSE stand over that, that is, there is no where to spend &euro;20 million on mental health services, if it had that additional amount this year?  When is it expected that the HSE service plan will be delivered?<\/p> <p>  A motion was passed two weeks ago that stated that any unspent money allocated to mental health would be retained year on year.  Has that been communicated to the HSE?  Is Mr. O'Brien confident that the &euro;15 million that has been allocated to the HSE will be drawn down and spent on mental health in this 12 months?<\/p> <p>  Let me describe the morass of trying to get information.  I had two people online this week trying to find out the geographic areas of the 14 mental health teams.  I went online and spent all day Saturday and Sunday doing research on mental health.  It was impossible to find out online where the 14 mental health teams were.  This committee has allied health professionals, trade union professionals, lawyers and yet six months into this process, we are still finding new layers of structures in the HSE.  It is impossible to find out how the system actually works.  One example is from the HSE website.  If one looks up mental health services, one will see that information is only provided for one area, Limerick, north Tipperary and Clare.  If one lives outside those areas, one will not find out anything about the services.  The page on infant mental health is blank.  There is another page on mental health services in one's area, but it only is corporate waffle.  There is a link to more corporate waffle and then it links back to the first page.  It is a loop and one cannot find out the structures of the health services in the country.  To find out the health services available, one would think that by putting in one's eircode, the website would bring one to the services in that area.  Instead, professional researchers cannot find out the information.<\/p> <p>  Currently the Corporate Manslaughter (No. 2) Bill 2016 is going through the Seanad.  When a similar Bill was enacted in the UK, it dramatically changed accountability in the NHS.  Is this Bill on the radar of the HSE?  Is Mr. O'Brien preparing for the very serious decisions that will fall from it?  One of the issues with the HSE is the lack of delineation of people's roles in it.  I often find that one gets a commitment from a manager and when the manager moves on, the new manager will say it has nothing to do with him or her.  Under the Corporate Manslaughter (No. 2) Bill, management churn would no longer allow staff movement to effectively negative the decision, or the lack of decision-making.<\/p> <p>  The leader of the mid-west hospital group states she would have no difficulty giving money from her budget to the community.  That is because of the incentive.  If she transfers money to primary care facilities, they can keep people out of hospital, which drives down the waiting lists.  The primary care managers then know they can get people into the hospitals quicker.  There is an incentive.  <\/p> <p>  One point that keeps coming up week after week is the perverse incentives in the health care system to encourage people to simply waste money.  I have heard the arguments about the different alignments for hospital groups and community health organisations.  Let us look at the services in County Wexford.  If one has mental health issues in north Wexford, one goes to Wicklow while if one is in south Wexford, one goes to Waterford.  We are in the Ireland East Hospitals Group but the county councillors sit on the health committee for the southern group.  It is just all over the place.  The Wexford manager must be driven demented going from one area to another trying to co-ordinate everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#R00500","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":505,"content":"<p>We all share the frustrations that have been articulated so well by Deputy Browne in terms of Deputies navigating the system, let alone the patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#R00600","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I have two questions.

I will begin with the more straight forward questions from Deputy Browne.  The service plan was approved by the HSE directorate in draft form last Thursday and submitted to the Department of Health on Friday.  Under legislation the Minister has 21 days to consider that plan.  He does not have to take the full 21 days, so I would expect that within the 21 days the plan will either be approved, rejected or amended, whatever the process is.  The normal process is that within a day or so of its approval, it gets published.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the mental health allocation of &euro;35 million versus &euro;15 million, this is in my view an application of reality.<\/p><p>When the development of services is being prioritised, as is being done by that money, and that development is predicated on the recruitment and deployment of staff, as we enter a year and begin the process of recruitment, we need to know that in the second year we will have the full year cost and that we can pay the wages for the full year.  There is, however, the reality that with the approval of the budget in November or October or a service plan in December, one will not be able to spend that full year cost in year one.  That has been the pattern in recent years.  The formula arrived at is that sufficient funding would be made available in 2017 to fund full year expenditure of &euro;35 million in 2018.  Experience indicates that this is about the right approach.  It is our approach to retain any unspent moneys where they are on unspent, which includes mental health.  I believe that the &euro;15 million that is allocated and which will be addressed in the service plan when published will be appropriately expended in 2017 on mental health.<\/p><p> With regard to structures, I acknowledge that there is an issue with the website.  It is not a good website, but there is a national information line on 1850 241 850, from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. Monday to Saturday, where staff are available to answer such enquiries.  As of last week a new live chat feature was introduced on the website which gets through to the same people.  We recognise that it is not always the easiest website to navigate and that this is more of a problem with the website than it is with the services.

At the moment, however, we have seen up to a 15% increase in referral from primary care to some specialties since January.  We have seen a 5% increase in referrals from community to emergency departments in the current year.

The commentary that we have shows there is a significant increase in out-of-hours work which is up 11% in the current year in the GP space.  That has a higher propensity to give rise to hospital referrals.  I would emphasise that only about half of our total attendances at accident and emergency departments first see a GP.  Many people are self-referring, are walk-in and are not going the GP route.  There are multiple factors there.  It could be pressure in the GP environment but also a higher level in the community of people who are self-presenting to hospital.  Those are the kinds of drivers for the increase.<\/p> <p>  Our current capacity is a concern for us and it is a key focus towards the end of this year to try to address some of the longer waiters.  Our current capacity in terms of delivering scheduled care is challenged.  The committee would have heard some of the hospital groups say they are trying to create dedicated elective space, to protect some space from emergency take, to allow for the rational doing of work on a surgical basis such as day surgery units, for example, on stand-alone sites, and that is happening at the moment.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on multiple co-morbidities.  There is a plan for frail elderly management which is to deal with that issue.  There is investment in this, with a number of other programmes in chronic condition management, of about &euro;9 million to do some pilots this year and next year.  The plan itself has been documented by Dr. Siobhan Kennelly who is a geriatrician in Connolly Hospital.  That would involve moving resources and has involved nurses and geriatricians moving into the community, attending at nursing homes, particularly private nursing homes where there may be limited or no service available, and looking to see to what extent they can reduce presentation at accident and emergency departments resulting from infection or fairly simple health care needs.  That plan has started at the moment and work is undertaken in some hospitals.  St James's Hospital did some very specific work in addressing the needs of frail elderly last year, and very successfully.  There is other work under way specifically in areas such as COPD and cardiology where there are relatively significant numbers attending emergency departments that are potentially avoidable and could be treated in the community, with some support.  There is investment going into those areas, but as the discussion here has flagged, it will need to be much greater in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#S00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1480496400,"counter":515,"content":"<p>What about the Keane report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016113000002#S00700","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480496400,"counter":516,"content":"<p>The Keane report, which was circulated to the committee, is primarily around the recruitment of consultants.

I think there is a significant degree of frustration within the hospital groups, particularly at senior level, about the fact that their journey has become unclear.

The hospital groups would have expected to have a degree of freedom they do not currently have.

I am the director of the Ana Liffey Drug Project.  Established in 1982, the Ana Liffey Drug Project works directly with people who use drugs, many of whom are injecting drug users.  We currently have centres in Dublin, the mid-west and the midlands and we work with over 2,500 people annually.  There are at least 3,000 injecting drug users in Dublin with approximately 400 openly injecting in the city each month.  We believe this number could be far higher, but due to the furtive nature of public injecting it is difficult to give a more precise figure.  People who inject drugs in the public domain do not want to do it; they find the act degrading and shameful.  However, there is currently nowhere for them to go to inject where they can be safe or supported to make healthier choices.<\/p> <p>  Since January 2012, one of the strategic objectives of the Ana Liffey Drug Project has been to secure stakeholder support for the provision of supervised injecting facilities.  Many organisations have stated their support for same, including the Better City For All group, the CityWide Drugs Crisis Campaign, the National Family Support Network, Safetynet Ireland, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and many more organisations and institutions.<\/p> <p>  We understand that concerns exist about an intervention that seems counter-intuitive to some people.  To those of us working to help our most vulnerable people with complex and multiple needs who inject drugs in the public domain, however, the provision of supervised injecting facilities is an important step in the right direction.  For our part, the argument for supervised injecting facilities is not in question &ndash; they are an empathetic and effective response to the issue of public injecting.  It is obvious to us that, as with our current services, supervised injecting facilities must work within the existing health system by offering referral pathways and working in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This view is reflected in international research on the delivery of supervised injecting facilities.  With this understanding, and based on the latest available evidence, we expect that supervised injecting facilities will achieve the following outcomes: they will attract the target group; they will reduce health risks; they will address public order and safety concerns; and they will not increase drug-related crime or local drug use.  More importantly, they will save lives.  No one has ever died from an overdose in any of the 90-plus drug consumption rooms throughout the world.<\/p> <p>  I wish to express some words of thanks on the record.  Ana Liffey Drug Project has worked closely with the voluntary assistance scheme of the Bar Council of Ireland to produce an initial draft of the legislation that the committee is considering.  I wish to note our thanks to the Bar Council for its support in this regard.  I also wish to express thanks to the previous Government.  In particular, I thank the former Minister of State, Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, for championing this important issue, and the former Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, for bringing the issue to Cabinet in December 2015.  I thank the current Government and, in particular, the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, for continuing to prioritise supervised injecting and ensuring that funds have been allocated for this purpose for 2017.  I wish to thank the other senior politicians with whom I have spoken on this matter.  All have been open, engaged and alive to the fact that supervised injecting facilities are important evidence-based health interventions that will make a real difference to the health of drug users and to the amenity of the areas in which they are situated.<\/p> <p>  Moreover, I wish to thank the statutory agencies with which we work closely.  These include the HSE, Dublin City Council and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An extraordinary amount of genuine inter-agency work takes place in Dublin city centre and this should be recognised.  The introduction of a safer injecting facility is not without its challenges, especially from a policing perspective, but all the challenges have been met elsewhere.  In Ireland, we are fortunate to have some of the most skilled, pragmatic and empathetic officers anywhere and I believe they will meet these challenges admirably.<\/p> <p>  It is a pleasure to be before the committee today.  The Ana Liffey Drug Project has worked hard on this issue.  It is fantastic that we no longer talk about whether an injecting facility is needed in Dublin.  The conversation has moved to how it should be done.  Essentially, it is a question of the issues these Houses need to consider in dealing with this legislation.<\/p> <p>  I will outline our advice to the Houses.  The Houses should learn generally from the legislative experience of other jurisdictions and avoid pitfalls.  The Houses should keep the legislation focused on the primary task of creating a legal framework within which injecting facilities can operate successfully.  I appeal to the Houses not to make the mistake of legislating on operational matters.  Adequate controls on the conditions that need to be met to operate a supervised injecting facility can be dealt with through a licensing process.  This framework has the advantage that the conditions of a licence can be varied to respond to local or emerging needs.<\/p> <p>  In summary, there is considerable support for supervised injecting facilities.  There has been and continues to be brave leadership across the political spectrum.  Our hope is that this legislation will be sufficiently flexible to do what it is intended to do, that is to say, to create a framework under which supervised injecting facilities can be established.  We urge all present to resist making it more complex than it needs to be.  Experience elsewhere tells us that such an approach creates unnecessary barriers to accessing support and further isolates the people we are trying to help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Duffin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I am the head of day services at Merchants Quay Ireland.  We have been providing low-threshold accessible services to drug users in the country since 1989.  We provide supports to those who are chaotic drug users on the streets and many others all the way through to those who are in need of rehabilitation, detoxification and drug-free aftercare and employment.<\/p> <p>  The services at Merchants Quay Ireland provide a range of supports, including assistance with food, medical issues, drug treatment, accommodation, psychiatric, justice and welfare issues.  In 2015 Merchants Quay Ireland provided services to approximately 7,500 individuals, up to 3,000 of whom were injecting drug users.  A significant proportion of the intravenous drug users accessing our needle exchanges are homeless street injectors.  Sadly, Merchants Quay Ireland has been operating on the front line in respect of over 5,000 drug deaths in Ireland in the past ten years.  Ireland has one of the highest drug mortality rates in the EU.<\/p> <p>  Merchants Quay Ireland is keen to highlight several points in consideration of the misuse of drugs (supervised injecting facilities) Bill 2016.  The central theme of the national drugs rehabilitation implementation committee case management protocols is the importance of a continuum of care from harm reduction through to recovery.  While there is consensus that more resources are needed in areas such as methadone maintenance and residential recovery, the medically supervised injecting centre represents an evidence-based element of the continuum of care that does not currently exist in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The latest research from the Centre for Global Health at Trinity College highlights the importance of understanding the needs of all stakeholders in an injecting centre, including drug users, the community, treatment services and justice.  To this end, the proposed legislation represents an opportunity to address the limitations of Irish drug service provision.  For example, to operate in line with the current Misuse of Drugs Act, services such as Merchants Quay Ireland have to exclude people based on the fact that they have sought a safe place within our services to inject drugs.  These are precisely the people who most need our support.  As a result, the only option available to such people is to inject in alleyways on the streets of Dublin, where the likelihood of overdose and death is far higher.<\/p><p>Homeless and drug services such as the Ana Liffey Drug Project, the Simon Community and Merchant's Quay Ireland operate in line with the quality in alcohol and drug services organisational standards, which are currently being aligned to the national standards for safer and better health care.  Such services have strong working relationships with hospitals, community GPs, garda&iacute;, community groups and drug treatment providers.  These relationships are critical to the operation of pilot injecting centre sites.<\/p><p> When injecting centres are being provided, it is important to learn from the evidence and experience of the earliest injecting centres in cities such as Sydney and Vancouver.  We should also take account of the latest evidence from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction on how injecting centres are evolving to include not just injecting facilities but also a full range of immediately accessible practical on-site supports to address the complexity of needs associated with street injectors, including medical, accommodation and psychological needs and basic needs such as food and clothing.  The legislation should, therefore, support the development of existing specialised service provision to injecting drug users.  It should maximise the ability of the existing network of services, which are highly skilled in working with injecting drug users across the county, to reduce harms, develop working relationships and provide treatment options on the basis of need.  Many Irish homeless services in large urban areas that are working with street-based injecting drug users now provide needle exchange and nursing supports.  If the pilot sites are located within these services, this will empower such services to intervene and save lives.  Such an approach would also engage synergies with existing services, thereby eliminating the need to reinvent the wheel and, in so doing, ensure cost-effectiveness.<\/p><p> The most recent evidence on implementing injecting centres indicates efficacy in reaching injecting drug users and in reducing health risks, public injecting, mortality and injecting harms.  Injecting centres are most effective when they are integrated into a wider public policy framework as part of a network of services; when they are based on consensus, support and active co-operation among local key actors; and when they are seen as highly targeted services that aim to reduce problems of health and social harm involving high-risk drug use populations and to address needs that other responses have failed to meet.  It is important to admit that, realistically, injecting centres in isolation are not going to eliminate drug deaths, street injecting and the spread of blood-borne viruses.  An injecting centre would form part of a solution by operating at the harm-reduction end of the continuum of care.  It is critical for the legislation to take advantage of the evidence-based operational and budgetary synergies that may be gained from locating injecting centre pilot sites inside existing services in urban areas with a high prevalence of injecting drug use.  This should not be limited to Dublin.  The ability to operate the licensed injecting centre model represents a natural addition to existing low-threshold harm-reduction services.  In line with the case management protocols of the national drugs rehabilitation implementation committee, the injecting centres can operate as part of an inter-agency multidisciplinary response to high-risk drug use, with that response being provided in a caring ethos as part of a care plan which the client plays an active role in developing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I ask Professor Gerry Bury to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#E00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the joint committee for the opportunity to speak this afternoon.  I am a GP and I work in the Dolphin's Barn area of Dublin.  As I have been working in the south inner city since 1984, I have some experience of the conditions that have led to the serious drug problems that have been experienced in that area over the past three decades.  I am also a professor of general practice at the UCD School of Medicine.  One of my functions in that role is as director of the centre for emergency medical science, which is responsible for training paramedics, advanced paramedics and GPs in the care of pre-hospital emergencies.  The centre is the only body in the State that is recognised as a trainer of advanced paramedics for all the statutory emergency medical services.<br\/><br\/>It is also worth mentioning that along with other doctors in my unit, I work as a volunteer to support the emergency medical services in the greater Dublin area.  Approximately 100 GPs throughout the country provide similar services on a voluntary basis in extreme emergencies.  My experience is of providing that service largely in the north inner city.  Over the last year and a half or so, I have been providing care in cases of cardiac arrest.  The three backgrounds I have mentioned give me some basis on which to comment on what is proposed.<br\/><br\/>Perhaps I will repeat the context for this proposal.  Approximately 10,000 people in this country currently receive treatment for opiate dependence from the State on an annual basis.  Opiate substitution therapy, using methadone, was formalised in 1998 and is delivered by drug treatment centres and accredited GPs throughout the country.  However, injecting drug use, chaotic lifestyles, overdoses and drug-related deaths remain common and continue to devastate families in Dublin and elsewhere.  I welcome the committee's interest in this matter because it highlights a health problem for Irish society which sometimes attracts little interest or urgency.<br\/><br\/>The first issue I want to highlight is the legislative proposal to provide for supervised injecting facilities.  My colleagues have spoken very well about the mounting evidence that injecting rooms are an effective harm-reduction measure for certain groups of injecting drug users.  The proposed initiative should certainly be supported in so far as it assists those with chaotic or uncontrolled drug use.  While I am very happy that the Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill 2016 is to be supported wholeheartedly by this committee and by those who want to see lives saved and improved, I am concerned that it may have a more limited effect on some of the more strategic issues relating to our drug treatment services.  I will refer briefly to some of those issues.<br\/><br\/>Opiate substitution therapy has grown to the point where it has almost become an end in itself within our health services.  Few services or incentives exist to help doctors, therapists or patients to reduce and stop methadone use, or to be of assistance in the recovery phase thereafter.  I have no wish to undermine the key and absolutely role played by opiate substitution therapy.  I was involved in the initiation of opiate substitution therapy and the introduction of methadone in the mid-1990s.  It has saved countless lives and improved others.  I emphasise that opiate substitution therapy should not be a <i>de facto<\/i>life sentence.  It seems that research and service development to achieve the goal of offering discontinuation to those who are in a position to take up that offer should be explored and prioritised within the research and development plan of our drug treatment services.<br\/><br\/>Opiate overdose and access to naloxone is a further issue.  Naloxone is a rescue drug which can reverse the respiratory depression caused by opiates.  It must be given within minutes of the overdose.  In Ireland, more people die from opiate overdose each year than are killed in road accidents.  Some 387 poisoning deaths occurred in 2013, of which 203 involved opiates and 93 involved methadone.  Access to naloxone is inappropriately restricted in Ireland.  Urgent action is needed to allow GMS access to the drug for prescription to patients.  A second possibility is co-prescription with methadone or other opiates.<\/p><p>A third is the prescription of the drug to the family or friends of those who are on methadone.  We have had some legislative change in recent months to allow rescue drugs to be introduced but the limitations on those rescue drugs, in particular naloxone, are inappropriate and inhibit its effect.<\/p><p> On the investigation of opiate overdose deaths, any patient who receives opiate substitution therapy and dies from an overdose has died in the care of the State's mental health services.  Each of those deaths should be regarded as a serious adverse event and investigated in precisely the same manner as, for example, a suicide which occurs in a patient attending HSE psychiatry services.  That does not currently occur. <\/p><p> The purpose is, of course, not in any way to create a culture of discipline, blame or attribution.  However, in each of these awful events there is learning and the possibility for improvements in carers and services.  The opportunity to have a root cause analysis of those events and explore the learning that is possible within them is something we, as a caring community, would benefit from.<\/p><p> I want to take this opportunity to thank those who care for those who are in difficulty because they are dependent on drugs.  The NGOs like those represented by my colleagues have done an outstanding job and continue to do so.  It is extraordinary to see the circumstances in which they work and the care and quality of that care.<\/p><p> I also thank my colleagues in the emergency medical services.  Their work is also extraordinary, and is often without thanks.  I thank my colleagues within mental health services and general practice who work within drug treatment systems.  They also have long, arduous and tough jobs.  They deserve to be acknowledged for the work they do.  I again thank the Chairman for the opportunity to put some points to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerard Bury","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Bury.

It states that: \"authorised users will be required to provide for those individuals who will be exempted from the offence of possession of a controlled drug on a premises licensed under this Bill and the supervised injection facilities\", and I have an objection to that.  I do not think we should have registration lists of authorised users.  <\/p> <p>  In many cases drug users lead very chaotic lives.  To have a system whereby people would be required to register in advance in order to access a facility defeats the whole purpose of the facility.  It is supposed to be a harm reduction measure.  We need to have as few obstacles as possible when drug users want to access services.<\/p> <p>  I feel very strongly about this.  I have studied how other regimes operate.  In other countries which have registered lists, they have been used to prevent people from obtaining driving licences and, in some cases, to discriminate against people who are described as active drug users.  I also have issues around data protection.  I could be a recovering addict who was addicted to heroin and have a relapse in the morning, but if I needed to register before I could go to a medically supervised injection centre that defeats the purpose from a harm reduction point of view.  <\/p> <p>  Can Professor Bury comment on that, given that drug users lead very chaotic lives?  In many cases, there are literacy issues.  By Professor Bury's admission, many of those who are openly injecting on the streets have a background of homelessness.  I do not how know how the first head of the Bill will work in practice.  I also have issues around the application for a licence, but they are minor and we can overcome them as we make progress.<\/p> <p>  I have another major issue around head 10 of the Bill.  It provides that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can enter a supervised injection facility without a warrant for the prevention or detection of offences.  I have no issue with a garda being able to enter a facility if a crime is underway - if as a serious assault taking place within a unit a garda has to come in and enforce the law.  However, it would defeat the purpose of having a safe place for people to go and inject if a person coming in the door behind them was a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not see the point in that.  We are either moving towards a harm reduction model and away from the criminal justice system; there is no in between.<\/p> <p>  I do not think there is any need for a garda to have access to these facilities unless a crime is being committed on the premises.  The head is very specific when it states that a garda can enter a supervised injecting facility without a warrant for the prevention or the detection of offences.  If a garda is entering a premises to detect offences, that is completely counter-productive to what we are trying to propose.  The head needs to be tightened up.<\/p> <p>  I have concerns that we are only considering a pilot project, but that is the current situation and we cannot do anything about it.  However, if we are considering the introduction of a pilot project we need to get it right.  I still believe that there is an element within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - I will put this point to it later - and the Department that is not convinced of this project.  On the one hand, they are saying we need to examine the models but, judging by the brief heads of the Bill we have, they will try to make it almost impossible for the project to succeed.<\/p><p> Head 9 provides that an offence of possession of a controlled drug would not apply to an authorised user, provided he or she is lawfully on the premises of an injecting facility during its normal opening hours and with the permission of the licence holder or his or her agents.  Therefore, technically, under the law, if a person is 10 ft. away and on their way to one of these facilities, they are breaking the law if in possession of a controlled substance.  For me, this goes to the very heart of the issue.  We are trying to bring in medically supervised injecting centres in the absence of a debate on decriminalisation for personal use.  I believe this will be a very difficult task.  I know people will argue that they are two separate issues, and they can have that opinion.  In my view, however, if the Bill is only saying it is lawful to be in possession of a controlled drug on these premises, it means that as soon as a person steps outside, or if he or she is on his or her way to one of these facilities, once he or she is stopped and searched by a garda, even if it is an authorised user as described in head 1, he or she would be breaking the law, even though he or she was going to a facility which could potentially save his or her life if he or she overdoses.<\/p><p> We cannot have it both ways.  We cannot move to a model of harm reduction while still trying to have this criminal sanction element.  It is either one or the other.  That is why I feel so passionately about heads 1, 9 and 10 of the Bill.  If we do not get this right, it will fail, and the only people who will suffer if it fails are the drug users themselves, not us, as politicians, or members of the Garda.  Drug users in Cork will never even get the opportunity to have a medically supervised injecting centre if this one does not get off the ground and does not operate correctly.<\/p><p> I am sure the garda&iacute; will say it is not their intention to be harassing anyone on their way to an injecting centre and that if they do stop and search people, common sense will be applied.  That does not wash with me.  The law is the law in the eyes of many people and common sense does not come into it.  If common sense did come into it, we would have a policy of decriminalisation across the board for personal use, although that is just my opinion.  If it was my decision, we would not even be looking at medically-supervised injecting centres and we would be moving to the model every other country is now moving to, namely, that of drug consumption rooms.  We should not be confining it to medically-supervised injecting centres.  We need to move to a model of drug consumption rooms.  Even the briefing documents that we got from the Department of Health talk about drug consumption rooms.<\/p><p> I will finish for now.  I am particularly interested in hearing the witnesses' comments on heads 1, 9 and 10.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#F00300","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I agree with the majority of what Deputy O'Brien said, apart from the authorised user piece.

Hopefully, it is people who are equipped and well used to working within the hostel services who would staff these facilities, such as anyone training under those like Dr. Austin O'Carroll and Dr. Fiona O'Reilly.  The assessment when people first access the service should not rely on their being registered in order to use it.  There should be a process whereby a user of the service is registered somehow with that service in order to provide that continuum of care.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure whether the term \"authorised user\" implies that people need to somehow authorise that they are going to use the service at a specific time or whether they just become regular users of the facility.  While \"authorised user\" might be a strange term to use, a person should somehow be registered with the facility.  It would also come into play if somebody was arrested on his or her way to use the facility.  The fact he or she is a registered user of an injecting room could come into play in that there would be a way to find out if he or she is a registered user of the facility so he or she would not be arrested.<\/p> <p>  I have several concerns that I wanted to flag.  Do the witnesses believe there is potential for needle exchanges around Dublin to be impacted in any way?  I know the struggle of the harm reduction workers in the community sector to keep a constant flow of needles into the suburbs of Dublin city for people who are using in places like Tallaght and the canal communities.  It is very difficult to keep that ongoing supply coming from the HSE.  Do the witnesses foresee any form of backlash in the sense that people will be encouraged to use the facility whereas the supply of needles to harm reduction workers outside Dublin city will be minimised?  Will this have any impact on people who do not want to come into the city centre to use, but still want to use within their own communities?<\/p> <p>  I have a question in regard to Professor Bury's point on overdose deaths, although it is slightly off the topic.  Have the witnesses heard of the new naloxone spray product which will come on stream in 2017?  What are their thoughts on that being accessible within all services, particularly the injecting rooms, and whether it will be taken up by Ireland?  I do not know about the costs involved.<\/p> <p>  Do many women access needle exchanges?  Accessing services can be difficult for women in the first instance, especially if they are mothers.  In light of the fears around that, I am curious to know if they do.<\/p> <p>  Professor Bury might be able to explain the position regarding the GMS contract.  This is something I am pursuing in respect of methadone and the attempt to move all stable methadone users out of the clinics, out of Trinity Court, and into their doctors' surgeries.  However, we need it to be written into the GMS contract that their own GPs cannot refuse to prescribe methadone, just as they would not refuse to prescribe diabetic medication, so we can free up some of the services within the city centre and make them better equipped to deal with the more chaotic users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#G00400","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I have engaged very actively with Tony Duffin and Mark Kennedy in recent months, both of whom I have met with my team.  I thank them for talking me through this but also for giving me a live experience of the services they provide and that interface with the people who use their services.  I am also conscious of the broader societal picture around their service provision and all of the drug litter and paraphernalia.  This is part of providing a future opportunity to users, who need the same care, intervention and multifaceted package of measures in their own lives.  However, it is important they get that care.<\/p> <p>  Within my party, I have tried to change our position or to develop a position on this as part of our submission on the national drugs strategy.  We support the legislation.  It is important to give people an opportunity and to have evidence-based harm reduction move towards treatment, rehabilitation and recovery.  That cannot be done if we allow all the different drug users to operate very visibly on our streets, without getting the proper and substantive care they deserve, like everyone else.<\/p> <p>  Many of my questions have been touched on by Deputy O'Brien and Senator Ruane.<\/p><p>I agree with Professor Bury that the number of people on methadone is quite high.  That number has remained stagnant.  What was a welcome and progressive measure at the time has become an end in itself.  When one talks to people who are in recovery, one of their criticisms is that the transitional piece is minimal or non-existent for many users.  They have the cycle of dependence, where we are not providing a future, and it becomes a permanent harm reduction piece for people who want to recover.  With regard to Senator Ruane's comments, what can we do to build the transitional piece, to incentivise GPs to take the extra step and to encourage the other care providers to move from the harm reduction model to treatment, intervention and recovery?  The number of GPs who are willing to provide the service is an issue.  There are counties in Ireland where GPs are wholeheartedly refusing to prescribe methadone or to treat users, which, I believe, breaches the practitioners' entry requirement into the medical profession; namely, that it does not matter who comes through the door, it is important to care for and to treat everybody in the community.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I want to ask about Suboxone.  I have been trying to pursue this with the Minister.  We have got a vague commitment on its use being legislated for, potentially in future legislative measures.  We all know that is not an immediate response.  I know that Tony O'Brien has corresponded with Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in about this.  I echo the comments made by other members in respect of Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  As Minister of State, he achieved a lot towards changing the discussion on the subject and that has helped this committee and the Oireachtas to try to address the measures positively.  What are Professor Bury's views on Suboxone and what does he consider to be the legislative delay regarding its use?  It is important - and all the witnesses have referred to it - that this is one part of the jigsaw.  It will, however, become an end in itself if we do not talk about everything else relating to drug treatment and intervention.  From what I have seen in this Parliament in the past couple of months, the problem with politics is that sometimes it requires a blinkered focus in order to get something of this nature over the line.  However, we also need to broaden the discussion on the other important care mechanisms and packages.  This is in order to give people who are vulnerable and who have experienced significant difficulties in their lives a chance.  While that includes our streets and communities, it also includes prisons.  Hopefully we can engage with penal reform more actively in this D&aacute;il or in future D&aacute;ileanna.  I thank the witnesses for being here and I look forward to working with them all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#G00500","speaker":"1255","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":590,"content":"<p>A number of points have been raised.  Deputy O'Brien made reference to the pilot, which is to be welcomed.  I understand that one pilot site will be established initially.  In Dublin, we have a river that divides the people moving through the city.  Our clients are no different.  Ideally, we would have two pilot sites in Dublin, one to the north of the river and the other to the south.  It would be remiss of me not to mention that colleagues and the local drugs task force in Cork have taken a position and have identified that they want to establish a pilot site there.  So, it is not solely a Dublin issue.  There are other areas where public injecting is deemed to be problematic for the local communities.<\/p> <p>  Members spoke about registering people and authorised users.  We need to talk about this and work out what exactly we mean.  I was fortunate enough to have worked in the Sydney medically-supervised injection centre in March 2015.  While it is important to gather data so that we understand what is going on with the people who attend, it is a confidential service.  In Sydney the process is managed whereby people give a name.  It might not be their name, but they give a name and they give a password which they must remember.  The centre then knows it is the same person coming back each time and knows the history of the person.  However, we may not identify truly who that individual is.  That appears to be a very pragmatic way to address the issue.  If the person walks in to the centre and cannot match the name they give to the password then they must re-register and go through the process again.  That is one example.  There are other examples of centres where people do not register at all and where access is open.  Other places may have a stricter registration process.  It makes sense to me, however, that the pilot would emulate the Sydney experience.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Garda entry into a service, I know that the police in New South Wales can access the Sydney centre.  The policing plan for that area says that the police will make contact ahead of coming in, which is more of a courtesy.  I understand that the legislation provides for the police to access the centres as and when they like and they can walk straight in without any difficulty.  In actual operations, one is working closely with a team of police officers who understand the nuance of what we would be trying to achieve and so they do not just storm in and walk around.  They make contact before coming in.  If, however, a police officer is in pursuit of a person for a crime, then of course they will come in and arrest that individual.<\/p> <p>  I will now talk about the issues of areas that surround a supervised injection facility or drug consumption room.  Prohibition exists in New South Wales so I was able to see, at first hand, that people who were walking to the medically-supervised injection centre in Sydney were not stopped at all by police.  I also saw people who were drawing attention to themselves perhaps by anti-social behaviour or by suspicious behaviour such as dealing.  I saw police officers stopping them, arresting them and processing them as they would normally.  There were no zones around the centre where the prohibition does not apply.  It was not an offence to be in possession of drugs only within the designated premises.  That is my experience and while it does not always make sense to people, I saw that it worked in action and it was manageable.  I was fortunate enough to go to a local community policing meeting with the area commander who used language like \"our\" medically-supervised injecting centre.  The sense of ownership was quite obvious.<\/p> <p>  The garda&iacute; on the ground and the people at the Ana Liffey Drugs Project, Merchant's Quay Ireland and the various other services are very pragmatic.  We work together and we will find our way in managing the situation, notwithstanding obviously that legislation will be put in place.<\/p> <p>  I do not see how the needle exchanges would be impacted upon particularly.  I do not envisage people travelling.  The evidence is that people do not travel far to get to supervised injecting facilities.  We have a very serious problem in Dublin city centre where public injecting occurs.  Supervised centres would address that issue.  We do not envisage people travelling from other areas.  Once the pilot is over - all being well and the evidence being that it has worked - then people in other areas would be able to apply for licences which, if awarded, would enable them to establish the services themselves.  I will leave the issue of Suboxone to my colleague Professor Bury.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Duffin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I thank the members for the questions.  I will address a couple of them.  Mr. Duffin has dealt appropriately with a number of them.<\/p> <p>  To deal with some practical matters, on the issue of naloxone, Senator Ruane raised the possibility of an intranasal delivery device being available.  We have been using intranasal naloxone here for the past three years.  It is restricted to paramedic, advanced paramedic and medical practitioner use.  We have been using a number of formulations of injecting naloxone and saved countless lives through the availability of those drugs for use by paramedics and advanced paramedics.<\/p> <p>  The Department introduced legislation last year on rescue drugs, which restricts lay access to naloxone to a single product that is unavailable.  It is not available on the general medical services, GMS, scheme.  I thought it might be a bit bulky to bring here and that I might be stopped on the way in so I took a photograph of 2 grams of naloxone we purchased a year ago on the expectation of the implementation of the rescue drugs Bill, which was going very well until the detailed regulation made it clear that a single product was to be licensed which is not used by any clinical outfit in this country.  The problem is that the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, FECC and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland have access only to a single product, which is effective but unavailable.  If the regulation were changed to allow access to the pre-filled syringe product currently used by the emergency services, and if that were made available for GMS prescription, we could very quickly move towards a situation where overdose prevention, education and treatment might become a reality.  We will save some lives.  It is in itself just a desperate measure to help with those at the chaotic end of the scale but it will indicate the willingness of society generally to take an extra step on behalf of those people at the margins.<\/p> <p>  The second point is about the pilot, and I want to follow the point about people on the margins.  What are the outcome measures for that pilot?  We use the term all the time.  It is clear sometimes what we mean by success and sometimes it is not.  If the measure of success to be used for a pilot site is that the streets are cleaner, tidier or possess less obvious drug use, that is not much of a pilot.  The purpose of the pilot must be to improve the lives and save some lives for this very large number of people who are currently not just marginalised, but forgotten about.  The measure of success has to be how better off are these individual drug users and their families.  That is not an easy measure to come up with and it comes somewhat to the issue raised about registration and data collection, but it is not beyond the bounds of man to identify ways to collect good quality data and identify outcome and process measures that reflect the value of the people we are trying to serve, not the cleanliness of the streets.<\/p> <p>  The issue of access to general practice services is a thorny one.  I cannot speak on behalf of my colleagues or of my profession but I can offer members some comments as an inner city general practitioner, GP, for the past 30 years.  The difficulty is that this is not an evenly distributed problem for society.  Opiate dependence is a reflection of societal difficulties.  It has been medicalised endlessly over the past 30 years and is now regarded as a health problem - I give the health committee as an example.  Many of our problems with drug dependency arise from deprivation, poor education, hopelessness, awful homes and a chronic tolerance and dependence.  Those problems are characterised in certain key areas and those are the areas, particularly of this city, which are vastly under-served by medical services and by general practice in particular.  It is not simply a matter of putting into a contract an obligation for each individual GP to take on one, two or three individuals.  That is a hopeless approach.  It is a matter, at a broader level, of ensuring that those societies are served by the sorts of services that address their needs, some of which are unique to the communities that have been devastated by drug dependency over the past 30 years.<\/p> <p>  As part of his MD my colleague, Professor Fergus O'Kelly, who was one of the leaders in Dolphin's Barn in the late 1970s and early 1980s in bringing this problem to the attention of the health services, followed a cohort of his patients from 1981 through to the late 1980s.  He stopped in the late 1980s because most were dead.  There were very few left of the original 120 people he had identified in his practice in 1981 who were injecting drugs.  An entire layer of that community was stripped out as if by war.<\/p> <p>  This is a problem of focused need which needs innovative and effective action.  I completely agree that we as GPs need to come up to the plate and take on our responsibilities here.  Most have done that.  In the areas affected by these problems, it is extraordinary to see the level of commitment of my colleagues and the work they do but training, licensing and support services are essential.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude in a second but to take the point about Suboxone because it relates to this, the issue about general practice and services to address very damaged communities is not about more therapeutics.  Drugs are not the answer to this issue.  The evidence on Suboxone is mixed.  I do not believe it offers any greater advantages than good quality methadone delivery but the potential to offer opiate overdose education and prevention strategies might give us some extra saving from the current opiate substitution therapy, OST, system.  The point I want to make is that if it is not simply about the class of drug we use for OST, rather it is about the psycho-social supports, the counselling, the reintegration to society and the addressing of those societal issues that have led to the drug problems in the first place.  Clearly, that is a big ask but, at the end of the day, the evidence is that if we come back to whether people should be on methadone for the rest of their lives, and we would hope not, we have no well-proven method to remove people from that system safely and keep them abstinent for the rest of their lives.  We know that most of the systems in use currently have success rates of not much better than 30% and the ones that work best address not just the drugs and therapeutics needs of these patients, but their psycho-social, personal development, psychological and other needs as well.  Those are the services I would appeal to the members to consider in future rounds of their reflection on this problem to add to the available services we currently tap into.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerard Bury"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":592,"content":"<p>On the international experience, how many lives are saved by offering this service?

I compliment Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for his work in the previous Administration, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, who is currently dealing with the issue.  I have a couple of questions.  In a previous incarnation, I had some experience of the Swiss experiments in Zurich and St. Gallen, as well as the Amsterdam ones.  One of the first things they had difficulty with regarding registration was to stop intruders from superimposing themselves by benefitting from the scheme, while at the same time double-dosing outside the scheme.  There is a need for controlled registration, otherwise the authenticity of the centres will become vague and they will not work.<\/p> <p>  Have the figures for mortality rates involving drugs users, including those injecting, been broken down?  Are they mainly from habitual, occasional or accidental users?  It is hugely important to have that information.  I entirely agree with the remarks concerning some parts of the inner city that have been beset with the problem over many years.  It is distressing to see its effects and the colossal impact on those communities.  Sadly, it is both debilitating and degenerating.  However, it is positive to see this forward movement in the form of supervised injecting facilities.  <\/p> <p>  Ireland has one of the highest mortality rates in the EU from drug abuse, including injections.  I presume the Netherlands has a higher rate.  I am not sure but I would be interested to know.  Why are they such leaders in that dubious contest?  What are the contributing factors there and have the witnesses studied them?<\/p> <p>  The societal issues are well known.  However, one of the things we discovered in St. Gallen was that an emphasis was placed on the need to assist those who wish to recover, as opposed to those who do not wish to recover.  They were discriminating between one and the other.  In fact, they had provided work spaces so that people who were habitual and did not appear to be in any way disposed to recovery, would have employment.  The employment was not great but it occupied the minds of those concerned.<\/p> <p>  In the past, methadone treatment was criticised because it went on forever in some cases, but it does not.  There are people who have recovered successfully.  I would like to hear the witnesses' comments on those who have successfully recovered from severe addiction.  We must salute their cause and the work they have done, both as an example to everybody else and the manner and method in which they went about it.  These are personal issues and personal confrontation is not easy.  It is one of the most difficult things to handle but they have done it.<\/p> <p>  I am not certain how the operation will work through GPs.  One of the problems GPs will always have is a huge queue in a waiting room, which takes time.  I am therefore not so sure that that will work with habitual users.  If my patience can be tested at a GP's surgery due to delays, how will it work for drug users?<\/p> <p>  To what extent will professional accountability manifest itself in operating these centres?  Professional responsibility is required so that society knows that those in charge are disposed towards helping addicts and victims that, hopefully, are on the road to recovery.<\/p> <p>  What procedures will be followed in regard to suspending or withdrawing a licence?  What kind of activities would result in the withdrawal of a licence?  What kind of vetting will take place in providing and allocating a licence in the first instance?  For example, to what degree will the authorities need to be satisfied that the person to whom a licence is granted to operate a centre is a responsible individual?<\/p> <p>  Under no circumstances should we allow cross-fertilisation whereby those in the illegal drugs trade outside can gain access either to the supply or the provision of supplies, both of which have happened in the past in various situations.  If people are disposed to undertaking a programme, we should be certain that nothing interferes with it.  Nobody should have any influence over it, except those disposed towards its success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#K00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their comprehensive presentations.  While there is evidence that this programme has worked in other countries, we need to convince people here that it will work.  Mr. Kennedy referred to the latest evidence of implementing these centres, which supports this as the way forward in dealing with this particular aspect.  I wonder about the presentation of that evidence and how it can be used to get the public on board.  For instance, we have received a letter from a Temple Bar company raising concerns about this proposal.  It was signed by a number of people who seem unconvinced.  The only way of getting people on board is by producing clearer evidence and getting it out there.  This comes back to some of the areas around methadone treatment facilities.  I note that there have been complaints in Cork where the local authority had to take certain action to ensure the area was properly cleaned up so that no one was left exposed.  How do we get the message across to convince people that we should move forward with this project?  If we are talking about doing a pilot project, what timescale is involved before there is clear evidence that the project is working?<\/p> <p>  My apologies for being absent earlier but we had a vote in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#K00400","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the committee and the panel for their kind comments.<\/p> <p>  Professor Bury's presentation is one of the most impressive presentations on this issue that I have heard in the past number of years.  He spoke in stark terms.  He repeated one of his sentences in order to ensure that we all understood the magnitude of the situation and how  drug overdose has reached epidemic level.  He stated twice that In Ireland, more people die from opiate overdose each year than in road accidents.<\/p> <p>  I agree with much of what has been said by other members of the committee.  I also agree with the sentiments expressed by Professor Bury about the day-to-day work done by the people who work on the front line.  They save lives and deal in a very inglorious area of volunteerism or their professional life of caring for people who really live on the edge.  It has been said that the term \"junkie\" is often used.  It is one of the last derogatory terms that is politically acceptable or acceptable in the media to throw around the place.  Even though the word \"junkie\" is a disgusting term it is deliberately used to undermine anyone who suffers from addiction.  Whenever we discuss how an injection facility can save lives and alleviate the suffering of addicts the first question that is always asked is where will it be located.  In other words, the debate feeds into the idea that the people who would benefit from a facility are undesirable and a subspecies.  The media and others use the term \"junkie\" in a derogatory manner to underline that message.<\/p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke mentioned that people have yet to be convinced there is a need for an injection facility.  During the many months that the facility was debated the Temple Bar traders never contacted my office when I was the Minister responsible for the drugs strategy.  It is only lately that we got a letter from them.  The traders are in an excited state and we are happy to debate the matter.  Where have they been for the last period?  <\/p> <p>  I ask the delegation to put this matter in a human context.  I ask them to describe the visual nature of somebody who has died, and they can tell a story that they are aware of or give an instant that they have handled themselves personally.  People die in toilets.  People die behind dumpsters.  People die in urine soaked stairwells.  They die surrounded by blood and faeces and they die all of the time.  People do not like to hear that people die on the streets of this city and other cities around the country.  I can appreciate Deputy Jonathan O'Brien's desire for a full programme of injection facilities to be rolled out rather than just a pilot programme because his city needs one.  I ask the witnesses to explain in human terms the rationale for having a facility.<\/p> <p>  Professor Bury hit the nail on the head with is presentation.  A campaign has been deliberately orchestrated to ensure that everybody is on board.  The retailers who have a concern about the drugs paraphernalia have been convinced that a facility will alleviate the problem.  I agree that it is unfair to expect Dublin City Council workers to pick up or sweep up this material and the accompanying excrement.  A broad umbrella of people have reached the conclusion that a facility is necessary for different reasons.  Fundamentally, a facility is not about having cleaner streets but about saving lives.  I ask the witnesses to explain in human terms that the facility will save the lives of people whose lives need to be saved.  I ask the witnesses to describe in graphic terms what people need to know and I mean that with the best respect in the world for the Temple Bar traders or whoever else opposes the facility.  I want them to hear what really happens in the city in which I live and in which many people here live, or in cities around the country.  The Chairman has asked for statistics on the number of people whose lives have been saved as a result of the facility. I believe we will reach the point when this programme becomes more than a pilot and, as a result, we will be able to provide statistics in support of such facilities.<\/p> <p>  Professor Bury made an interesting correlation between opiate overdose and road deaths.  It took between 20 or 25 measures to reduce the number of road deaths.  An injection facility will not reduce the number of overdoses overnight.  As Deputy O'Brien has said, the programme along with possibly 20 or more measures will eventually reduce the number of people who die from an overdose or are addicted in Ireland.  A facility is not a panacea but is part of the jigsaw.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#L00100","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I suggest in the interest of time and as another group is due to join us that Deputy O'Connell makes her contribution and then witnesses can make their final comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#L00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late but this meeting clashed with another meeting next door.  I do not have the gift of bilocation yet.<\/p> <p>  I have quickly read the presentation.  I am, by profession, a community pharmacist and I originally come from the midlands.  Twelve years ago I worked in both Athlone and Portlaoise at the height of the crisis.  Beforehand I spent a short time studying in the UK and on my return to Ireland I was shocked at how drugs ravaged the communities and the extent of heroin use in the regional towns in the midlands.  During the recession the problem spread to the smaller towns of Mullingar, Banagher in County Offaly and various places where the injection of drugs never happened before.  It is fundamental that we view people as human beings and that it is not necessarily their poor choices that have led them to drug addiction.  As Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has said, the aim of a facility is to save lives, limit harm, educate people, reach out to people and have services that engage with people.  All of that means that when a bad batch of heroin reaches our streets that instead of finding out about it from the lad standing on the next corner that there is a facility that acts as a safe place where helpful information can be shared.<\/p> <p>  I fully support the use of injection centres.  Anybody who opposes them is exercising a severe form of NIMBYism.  It is important to point out that people have died on stairwells and in public toilets but middle class people have died in sitting rooms.  We must open people's eyes to the fact that drug addiction transcends the class system.  <\/p> <p>  When I worked in the UK huge needle exchange programmes were rolled out in community pharmacies with great success.  At the time there was huge resistance to the approach.  The idea of people and drug dealers congregating around injection centres is an issue for the Garda and we must be vigilant about the problem.  <\/p> <p>  It annoys me when people claim addicts receive methadone treatment forever.  Methadone is quite cheap as medications go and its administration can be well managed in the community.  I have often had patients receive 10 ml maintenance dose of methadone yet live functioning lives.  Somebody who becomes addicted to heroin in their late teens should not carry a criminal conviction for the rest of his or her life if he or she manages to sort out their lives.  I believe we should give people a second, third and fourth chance or whatever is necessary.   I fully support the work of the delegation.  I shall work with my party to expedite this initiative to the best of my ability. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#L00300","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":605,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan asked where did we got the information on the number of drug deaths and how the information is broken down or classified.  The Health Research Board has provided the information for the past ten or 11 years.  Each year the data has shown that there are 600 drug deaths of which 300 to 350 are overdose related deaths.  The data is broken down into age, gender and the substances used or the groups of substances used.<\/p><p>The big offenders are alcohol, methadone, opiates and benzodiazepines in combination.  That information is gathered from the coroner's data.<\/p><p> I was asked the countries that are up at the top in terms of drug deaths - it would be a terrible way to look at it.  We know what works in terms of preventing drug deaths.  Certainly, having a national overdose prevention strategy, which would be multifaceted and would include measures such as injecting rooms and the provision of naloxone in the context of a multi-agency multi-disciplinary care plan for each individual, is something that works.  There is no one thing that can be applied to all people.<\/p><p> In terms of trying to put a human face on it, those who I would know who have recovered and come through their own journeys with drug use all have a particular thing that worked for them.  Sometimes it was getting a job.  Sometimes it was getting into college or getting an education.  Sometimes methadone helped them.  There was family support involved.  There can be dozens and dozens of contributing factors.  We would see people who are in our services for many years and they do not show an inclination to change, but there often is a window which opens up.  Generally, people do not want to be in this chaotic drug fuelled life, but a window opens and they say, \"Look, that's it.  I want to go in and detox.\", or \"I want to address my drug use.\"  For us, as services, it is about being able to jump on that, seize that opportunity and be able to put options in front of people very quickly.  From the evidence available, this medically supervised injecting centre is well positioned to do just that.  There is this concept of the teachable moment where a person may overdose and medical staff can intervene to save the person's life and are then able to say: \"Look, you nearly died.  Here are the treatment options that would be available to you.\"<\/p><p> In terms of professional accountability, another point that Deputy Durkan raised, services in Ireland that are commissioned now come with a service level agreement.  Often these are policed by agencies, such as the local authority or the HSE.  Any provider that would apply or be granted a licence would have to sign up to a service level agreement.  This would insist on compliance with all of the legislation, including safety legislation, ensuring that there are competent professional staff delivering the services, that the governance is in place, and that the service would be open to audit and would be accountable for its outcomes.  Deputy O'Rourke asked when would be the appropriate time to audit such a service.  The Sydney injecting room was audited after only one year and there was considerable evidence on the efficacy of the service that was being provided.<\/p><p> In terms of setting up an injecting room, it would need to involve all of the local stakeholders.  That would include: community groups, such as the Temple Bar group mentioned earlier, where everybody would have a say because everybody, I suppose, has his or her own priorities in terms of what he or she would want from an injecting service.  Primarily, they are about saving lives but they would have to consider the justice, community and other stakeholders that would be party to such a service.<\/p><p> Finally, in terms of the human face of this on which Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in asked that we might speak, it is shocking seeing an overdose and seeing somebody there dead, cold, laid out.  It is a cold experience.  It is shocking for the staff team which may have been working with that person for many years.  For us, it would be seen as a failure.  There is a grief associated with that.  There is a grief that one must process with the staff team to get them back on their feet.<\/p><p> One has got to talk to the family.  This is very difficult.  One is trying to arrange the care and support for the family after the death.  I have spoken to mothers for whom after many years the grief is just as alive.  It never ends.  Particularly when we are talking about issues like injecting rooms, one sees mothers looking at one knowing that they are wondering if that had been around when their sons died if they would they still be here today, and that is very difficult.<\/p><p> It is devastating.  One sees it in partners of drug users, and partners' sons and daughters.  It just never ends.  If one has 300 to 350 people die each year in this country, that is on average one person every day.  That grief just ripples through a family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":607,"content":"<p>Following Mr. Duffin, Professor Bury will make some final remarks and we will conclude this session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#M00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan raised the Swiss model, registration and the double dosing.  In Switzerland, if we are talking about the same matter, there is diamorphine prescribing and heroin assisted treatment.  We are not talking about that here and I would not envisage the double dosing being a problem.<\/p> <p>  I would agree with Mr. Kennedy on the Health Research Board.  We have fantastic statistics from the drug-related death index from 2013 and we hope to have the 2014 statistics as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, professional accountability will be important.  The licensing will take that into account as well.  Insurances will need to be in place.  People will inject themselves.  People will not be injecting other people - that kind of thing will not be happening.  The standards that Mr. Kennedy mentioned in his opening statement are in place and will be adapted and expanded upon to include new service provision such as this.<\/p> <p>  In terms of this issue of recovery and moving away from drug use, first, one cannot rehabilitate somebody who is dead.  We have to keep people alive and, ideally, as well as they can be.  It is difficult when somebody has HIV, hepatitis C, damaged veins and all sorts of complex health problems to motivate him or her.  Such people do not see the point.  If we can keep them as healthy as we can while they are in their drug use and keep them alive, then where there is life there is hope.  I would strongly advocate that side of things.<\/p> <p>  The European drug report from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is clear that one gets people through to treatment and rehabilitation faster than otherwise where one has these services.  If we leave people down alleyways, there is little option for intervention and for building a therapeutic relationship.<\/p><p>On the issue of the Temple Bar letter, signed by the Temple Bar Company, the Restaurant Association of Ireland and the Licensed Vintners Association, the Ana Liffey Drug Project and Merchant's Quay Ireland had a seminar last week.  We invited a wide range of people, including Deputies and Senators and local stakeholders.  Representatives from that group were there.  We had a healthy discussion.  Profession Catherine Comiskey presented the latest information, which I can share with the committee.  I have the presentation here.  I hope that people heard what was said because at the presentation Professor Comiskey was very clear about how well these services work and achieve what they are established to achieve.  <\/p><p> Deputy O'Connell mentioned attracting people to the area.  The evidence is quite clear that when these services are set up it is in an area where there is a problem of public injecting and as a consequence it is already meeting the needs of an established cohort of people and the honeypot effect does not happen.  The service works very closely with the Garda to ensure that drug dealing does not take place.  We already have drug services in the city centre.  I do not really envisage the policing of this to be much different from how we currently police the situation.  The difference will be that people within that service will be safer and able to inject themselves with the drugs that they bring to the service. <\/p><p> In response to Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, it is not just death that is real for people.  It is like a war torn city for some people.  We do not like to use words such as junkies and zombies.  People who use them almost dehumanise the person in order to justify what they do to that group.  They are very unwell people.  The staff who work for me, such as the nurses, say that when people come in and take off their shirts they can see the scars and vein damage.  We know about the referrals made to accident and emergency departments and to hospital where people have chronic illnesses.  I know two people in the city who have necrotic legs.  The leg is dead, maggots are crawling out of it.  They can still walk around because they are addicted to heroin which is the most powerful of pain relievers.  When they come in the nurse cleans them up and they go on their way.  While the nurse is cleaning them up they swear and abuse the staff because they have mental health issues but those on the team are so good they just keep going.  They are incredible.  That is the kind of thing we are dealing with.  We have a cohort of people who are groin injectors.  That is risky behaviour.  A study by the Maudsley in the UK on groin injecting found that everybody in that study had deep vein thrombosis.  That is a very serious health problem.  Unfortunately, I have found people dead and many of my colleagues have.  We know people and work closely with them and we care for them.  We would not be human if we did not.  It is very very sad.  It is hard to describe what it is like to come in and find that someone who is significantly younger than me has died prematurely and would probably still be alive if he or she had been in an injecting room at that time because no one has ever died in an injecting service, across the globe.  The one that strikes me most is a 21 year old that I and a colleague found some years ago in the bed, her needle still sticking out of her arm, in a homeless hostel.  A colleague from Crosscare said at the meeting last week that if there had been an injecting room in that hostel, where people who inject lived, that young woman would probably still be alive.  Those things sit with one for a long time and never leave one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Duffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":610,"content":"<p>The really supportive role of the garda&iacute; has been mentioned.

It does not happen in isolation and the wholehearted support of the garda&iacute; in protecting this client&egrave;le is really important.<\/p> <p>  We have mentioned road accidents.  In 2013 the Road Safety Authority had a budget of &euro;40 million to effect road safety across the State.  I can find no such ring-fenced budget allocated to the prevention of death from drug dependency, even for those who were in the care of the State at the time.  Mention was made of an 18 year old being made to carry a criminal record for the rest of his life.  Let us deal effectively with young people who are vulnerable.  He does not need to carry methadone on his back for the rest of his life either.  We must offer people an opportunity to normalise their lives as they would if they were insulin-dependent diabetics by the use of appropriate drug therapies to stabilise their lives.  Just as a diabetic does not sort out his or her problems with insulin alone, all the other necessary supports have to be offered.  <\/p> <p>  I have been attending approximately 100 cardiac arrests a year in Dublin over the past year or two.  I have been at three deaths in the past ten days or two weeks involving drug users who died at home.  This is not just a street use problem.  I am not convinced that some of these people did not intend to end their lives because of the arrangements they had made.  It is most sad to see someone with a needle still stuck in his arm.<\/p> <p>  The committee wanted a human perspective but I would not dream of imposing on it the horror that goes with some of those situations.  Sounds are what stick with me, the distress of families on finding their loved one in these circumstances is appalling and the sound of that distress is awful.  The second sound I ask the committee to think about is phones.  People's phones always go off: who is going to pick it up?  Who is going to answer it?

I am currently paying to dispose of &euro;2,000 worth of out of date Naloxone.  A simple change in regulations would enable us to do this better.  Recovery needs to be part of our initiative as well as reaction to the crises and the horrors we have described.

I thank the committee for inviting us to address it today about the Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill 2016.<\/p> <p> As we are all aware, there is a problem with public injecting in Dublin and other cities and towns in Ireland.  This practice is unhygienic and unsafe and as a result, people who inject drugs are at an increased risk of contracting blood-borne diseases such as Hepatitis C and HIV and an increased risk of death as a result of overdose.  Public injecting is antisocial behaviour that impacts on other citizens and businesses in the area in which it occurs.  The wider community is also at risk due to unsafe disposal of syringes, needles and other drug paraphernalia.  The establishment of a supervised injecting facility, SIF, has been proposed to ameliorate these problems.  A SIF provides a clinical, controlled environment where drug users may self administer by injection drugs they have brought with them.  Such facilities provide access to clean, sterile injecting equipment; medical and social care interventions; referral pathways to other treatment and rehabilitation services; and trained staff to provide emergency care in the event of an overdose.  More simply, they provide a low-threshold point of contact for people who inject drugs.  <\/p> <p>  A SIF is not a \"free for all\" for those who wish to inject drugs.  Rather, it aims to attract and reach out to hard-to-reach or marginalised populations of drug users.  It works to minimise the harm associated with injecting drugs until an individual is able and ready to address their problems.  An injecting facility does not support or promote drug use.  Rather, it works to prevent injury and death and to connect people with help.  It is not a solution to the drug problem but rather should be seen as part of a suite of harm reduction measures that can be deployed to address what is a complex and difficult issue.<\/p><p>There are almost 90 drug consumption rooms operating around the world, in cities such as Luxembourg, Copenhagen, Barcelona, Sydney and Vancouver.  Evidence from these sites demonstrates: a reduction in fatal overdoses and transmission of blood borne diseases; a decrease in the incidence of public injecting; significant reductions in drug related litter, and no increase in the use of drugs or of drug-related crime.<\/p><p> Drug consumption rooms have been operating for more than 30 years and to date worldwide there have been no reported death as a result of an overdose in such a facility.  The previous Government, and the then  Minister of State at the Department of Health the then Deputy now Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in approved the drafting of additional heads to provide for supervised injecting facilities in the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill in December 2015.  The programme for a partnership Government agreed in May, reaffirmed the commitment to legislate for what was termed \"injection rooms\".  Originally it was intended that the legislative provision for supervised injecting facilities would be included as part of larger Bill, but earlier this year, it was decided that there would be two separate Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bills.  The first Bill was passed by the Oireachtas in late July.  The second Bill, which is being drafted at present will deal with supervised injecting facilities.  <\/p><p> The proposed legislation would allow the Minister for Health to issue a licence with conditions to operate a supervised injecting facility.  This licence would be for a defined period of time and could be revoked, suspended or the conditions of the licence amended by the Minister.  The provisions of the Bill would also exempt authorised users of a supervised injecting facility from the offence of possession when in the facility, and with the permission of the licence holder; it would provide an exemption for licensed providers where it is an offence to permit the preparation or possession of a controlled substance in premises; it would enable the Minister to consult with the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or others on matters relating to a supervised injecting facility and it would enable the Minister to make regulations relating to the operation of such facilities.<\/p><p> Possession of controlled drugs would continue to be an offence outside of an injecting facility.  Possession for sale or supply will remain illegal both inside and outside the facility.  There can be no suggestion of creating a \"no go\" area for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To support an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na it is proposed the Bill would include a provision that Garda members will be able to access a facility, for the prevention or detection of offences, without the need for a warrant.<\/p><p> This Bill will not establish the location of a supervised injecting facility.  However it is envisaged that the first facility would be in Dublin city centre where there is a significant, recognised problem of public injecting.  This first facility would be a pilot service to determine the utility, safety and cost-effectiveness of a supervised injecting facility in an Irish context.  It would be run by the HSE or a non-governmental organisation, working under a service level agreement with the HSE.  Preparatory work would be required in advance of the establishment of such a facility.  The HSE would consult with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other relevant authorities, NGOs and community groups prior to its establishment.<\/p><p> The aim of any supervised injecting facility in Ireland and therefore the aim of this legislation will be to reduce the incidence of public injecting and the impact this has on people who inject drugs in relation to their dignity, health and ability to access health and social care services; the wider community; in relation to public health, drug related litter and public amenity; public services in relation to Garda and ambulance resources and most importantly, the number of drug related deaths, resulting directly from overdoses on our streets.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman.  I will be happy to address any follow-up questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Lennon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I thank Mr Lennon.

I am accompanied by Assistant Commissioner Mr. Jack Nolan, who is in charge of the Dublin metropolitan area and Detective Superintendent Howard, who is attached to the Garda Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p> <p>  Members of the committee will be aware, I am sure, that Government policy on tackling the drug problem is set out in the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, which, it is planned, will shortly be replaced by new strategy covering the period 2017 onwards.  The overall objective of the strategy is to continue to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research. <\/p> <p>  Tackling the supply of drugs remains a key element of the national drugs strategy and in this regard, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to place a particular focus on tackling misuse of drugs from a supply control perspective.  This is reflected in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s policing plans, in which tackling drugs and organised crime is set out as a core focus of our work.  To achieve relevant objectives, multi-disciplinary approaches are utilised with a view to ensuring that those involved in illicit drugs activity are effectively targeted, including through the use of drugs legislation, the proceeds of crime legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.<\/p> <p>  The National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau continues to lead out the policing strategy for tackling drugs supply and working closely with the local drug units across the State.  This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.<\/p> <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has recently launched a modernisation and renewal programme which includes a plan to build on our expertise in the drugs and organised crime area by amalgamating our skills and introducing a special crime task force to focus on criminals working at lower levels in organised crime gangs.  Results achieved to date include, significant arrests and seizures which have substantially disrupted and degraded organised crime gangs by taking guns, drugs and cash from them.  Lives have been saved and more than 12 assassination attempts have been foiled.<\/p> <p>  When the Garda Commissioner appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, on 12 October 2016, she stated that between 9 March 2015, when the drugs and organised crime bureau was established, and September 2016, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had seized over &euro;1.9 million in cash, as well as 35 guns and 1,000 rounds of ammunition, including AK-74 assault rifles, submachine guns, sawn-off shotguns, Glock pistols and other semi-automatic weapons and silencers.  Drugs worth more than &euro;36 million have been seized and we have arrested 167 people for drug trafficking, money laundering and possession of firearms.  On that occasion the Commissioner referred to the fact that the many organised crime gangs, that operate internationally, cannot be tackled effectively without international co-operation and that in this regard, we work actively and effectively with our counterparts in Europe and with the Europol and Interpol organisations.<\/p> <p>  However, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is acutely aware that supply reduction is but one of five pillars through which the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs must be tackled.  For this purpose, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to doing all it can to support initiatives undertaken by the State with regard to the other four pillars, namely, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.<\/p> <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aware that a commitment to support a health-led rather than criminal justice approach to drugs use, including legislating for injection rooms, was set out, in May 2016, in chapter 5, titled &lsquo;Health&rsquo; under A Programme for a Partnership Government.  We are also aware that on 15 December 2015, the Government decided to include additional heads in the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill, to provide enabling provisions for supervised injecting facilities.  We understand these provisions will enable the Minister for Health to issue licences permitting the establishment of supervised injecting facilities to provide enhanced clinical support to, and mitigate the problem of public injecting by, chronic drug users.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that there is a problem with street injecting in Dublin and elsewhere.  It is accepted that this practice is unhygienic and poses a significant health risk for the drug users themselves and results in discarded needles which present a public health risk to others.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na understands that the establishment of supervised injecting facilities has been proposed to ameliorate this problem.<\/p> <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aware it is envisaged that initially one supervised injecting facility will be established on a pilot basis in Dublin city centre.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will do all it can to assist in ensuring the initiative succeeds in achieving its objectives.  We are aware that an independent evaluation will be an intrinsic element to the initiative, designed to determine the utility, safety and cost-effectiveness of the supervised injecting facility in an Irish context and that the outcome of such an evaluation will inform any decision to licence further facilities.  In this regard, we will ensure that the policing and law enforcement issues which arise from the existence of a supervised injecting facility, will be shared with all concerned, for the purpose of informing the planned independent evaluation.<\/p> <p>  Dealing with the law enforcement issues which arise as a consequence of opening a supervised injecting facility of the type proposed, requires the making of necessary amendments to existing relevant legislation.<\/p><p>We are aware that the drafting of a misuse of drugs (amendment) Bill, which it is intended will contain provisions that will allow for the licensing, provision and operation of supervised injecting facilities under specific circumstances, while protecting the public health and ensuring that the prohibition on possession and supply of illicit drugs outside such facilities is adequately maintained, is at an advanced stage.<\/p><p> Upon enactment of planned relevant legislative provisions, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be in a position to inform its personnel regarding the appropriate manner in which to address the law enforcement and policing issues which will arise following the opening of a supervised injecting facility.  It will also facilitate the inclusion of relevant information in policing plans and operational orders.  I am sure it will be appreciated that the less ambiguity and avoidance of grey areas in the legislation which will be introduced to underpin the undertaking of the proposed initiative, the less likely it will be that any law enforcement issue will impact negatively on achieving a successful outcome to the initiative.  Meanwhile, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to develop necessary policing strategies in preparation for the opening of Ireland&rsquo;s supervised injecting facility.  The planning, to date, has involved interaction with law enforcement authorities in jurisdictions where supervised injecting facilities have been in place for some time and visiting and observing the policing of such facilities elsewhere.  <\/p><p> We welcome the opportunity to answer any questions which the committee may wish to put to us regarding relevant matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":619,"content":"<p>How will the facilities be policed?

From the point of view of the Garda, what importance does the Assistant Commissioner place on the need to have an indoor facility treating people who are addicts as opposed to having an uncontrolled treatment centre on the street, on stairwells and in unhygienic situations?  What degree of emphasis does he place on the controlled centre?<\/p> <p>  From the Assistant Commissioner's point of view, what is the most effective example to give children in the course of their recreational hours on the way to and from school?  I believe we know the answer to the question but it is no harm to hear it repeated.  I have seen young people studying in the stairwells surrounded by used needles, users and injectors, which is hardly a good example for the next generation.  How does the Assistant Commissioner value the need to have a facility that caters specifically for addicts who are in that situation without excluding them from society?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the influence of open street injection in areas that are economically and socially challenged, has the Garda made comparisons with other jurisdictions as to the extent to which controlled injection centres can be of quantifiable benefit?  I believe we also know the answer to that question. <\/p> <p>  I wish to make two further points.  One relates to licensing oversight, which was raised with the witnesses who made the previous submissions, and the importance of preserving the integrity of the injection centres and to ensure they are not in any way interfered with by those engaged in the illicit drug trade who would have vested interest and an ambition in making intrusions into that area.  How does the Assistant Commissioner foresee that those engaged in the illicit drug trade, who are very powerful as is very evident, could be prevented from attempting to gain access to treatment facilities of any nature, but particularly of this nature?  By what means could the Garda intervene to prevent interference by the illicit drug trade?  To what degree does the Assistant Commissioner foresee the injection centres competing in the marketplace, in other words, to draw people who are vulnerable addicts into a control system as opposed to allowing them free-fall in the open streets and thereby  become victims of the traffickers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#Q00700","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I will call the speakers in groups of three because of the time constraints.

I will be honest and say that I felt a great level of discomfort when we moved on to the policing presentation.  I have worked in the addiction field and in the homeless sector for a long time.  I find the words \"policing this facility\" distressful in that I would question why anybody would want to use a facility that is being policed in the first place.  I could not even let the community garda anywhere near the front gates of a community project in which I was involved and if i did the young men would not come in and use the facility.  We will fail from the very beginning if we see this as some sort of hub for dealers which will never be the case.<\/p> <p>  As someone who works in hostels with users with high needs, I can say that the staff of these facilities know what they are doing.  People are removed from a hostel not by the police, but because the staff want to protect the most vulnerable within those services.  I can guarantee that if there was any sale or supply in the injection rooms, it would be detected very quickly and the person concerned would not be allowed to use that facility.  Then and only then could the Garda intervene if the staff telephoned to say they have a person dealing in the facility.  That is not accounted for in head ten of the Bill under which the Garda can show up and come into the facility.  The broad scope of that provision is extremely worrying.<\/p><p> If a member of staff telephones the Garda to seek assistance on an issue, that is different.  As someone who has worked in these services for a long time, I believe we need to trust the people who work in them.  Some of the narrative around this issue can be scary.  Drug dealers have telephones now.  They do not always hang around on a doorstep somewhere.  It is much more organised and orchestrated.  When we talk about people in stairwells with needles all around them, the question I would ask is why a child is studying in a stairwell.  Bigger questions arise as to the reason those environments exist.  They do not exist in a vacuum in terms of drug dealers.<\/p><p> I want to tease out further the question of the role the witnesses believe they play because the health model disappeared very quickly and the justice aspect is very heavy in terms of drug dealing and policing.  Are we making any move towards a health-led approach to addiction because - this is a matter of concern to me - the injection rooms appear to be a justice-police led initiative?  Head 10 overstates the power garda&iacute; should have in accessing this facility, unless they are required to do so, much like in hostels.  Injection rooms might as well be located within the hostels.  We have had to set our place up to ensure people could inject safely.  Regardless of whether that is against the law, it happens.  We take someone out of their room, sit him or her between their two friends in a living room and tell them to watch that person to ensure that he or she does not overdose.  That is already happening and we need to trust the staff that will operate the services in that if they need the assistance of the Garda, they will call them.  There should only be intervention from the Garda when it is requested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#Q00900","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":628,"content":"<p>Senator Ruane touched on the issue I wanted to raise, namely, head 10, which gives the Garda powers to enter without a warrant for the prevention or detection of offences.  I presume the goal of all of those present - members of the Garda, Department officials, Senators or Deputies - is to get to a position where we have a facility in which drug users can safely inject and where, if they overdose, there is help on hand.  People from different backgrounds will have different priorities in that regard but I strongly agree with Senator Ruane.  If we start the conversation in this room, it will seep out into the wider public.  If the conversations we are having in this room are about being able to police these facilities, users will not access them.  That is a reality, regardless of whether we like it.<\/p> <p>  We talk about the interests of the Garda being about the sale and supply of drugs, yet over 86% of all drug convictions are for personal use.  Those are the figures we need to examine when we talk about safe injection centres.  Users will not use a facility if they know that the person coming in behind them might be a member of the Garda drug squad.  Regardless of how good the intentions may be on the part of the Garda, the reality is that those to whom I refer will not use these facilities and we will not solve the issue as a result.  As I said in the previous session, we cannot have it both ways in terms of moving to a public health model from a criminal justice model.  If we are talking about drug users accessing a facility, they need to be able to do that in the knowledge that when they do it there will be no legal comebacks.<\/p> <p>  There are issues to do with the legislation that we need to examine.  Eventually, we will have to move to a model of decriminalisation for personal use.  It is proposed in head 9 that it would be lawful to be in possession of a controlled substance while in a facility but if someone steps two feet outside a facility, it will be unlawful to be in possession of that controlled substance.  That is the law we are dealing with because we are not having the wider discussion on decriminalisation for personal use.  We are trying to deal with a public health issue but we are not having the debate about moving away from a criminal justice issue.  We are riding both horses at the same time and the only people who will suffer are the users.<\/p> <p>  Many people know my personal situation.  My brother is 11 months clean and is doing extremely well, but he has four drug convictions for personal use.  We talk about criminalising people for life.  We talk about people being on methadone for life but a situation should not arise where someone is on methadone for life.  Someone who is a chronic drug user should not end up with a lifetime of convictions for personal use.  If there are cases where individuals are trying to use these facilities for the sale and supply of controlled substances, by all means that is an issue for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I will put the question to the assistant commissioner.  Under what circumstances would he envisage members of the force having to enter these facilities?  Can we tease out the discussion that way?  If there is not a telephone call from the centre to say a crime is being committed within the facility or if somebody telephones to say they are just about to eject someone because he or she is trying to sell drugs within the facility, under what circumstances would the assistant commissioner envisage a member of the force having to enter one of these facilities and for what purpose?<\/p> <p>  I refer to head 7, which provides for a licence holder to be required to supply such information as may reasonably be required for the purpose of evaluating supervised injecting centres.  I presume the legislation will be organisation specific in terms of who will have access to that information for the purpose of evaluation.  I am not suggesting for one moment that it will be open-ended but I have concerns about head 1 and the officials from the Department might explain the rationale behind it.<\/p> <p>  To clarify what I said in the first session, I wrote in my notes that I would oppose the advance registration of users.  I have no issue with people who access this facility, and there is some sort of database for that continuous care, but they have to be on an advance register to even access the facility.  I do not see the rationale for that.  We have situations where people who would not be on a register suffer a relapse.  I have to leave shortly to raise a Topical Issue matter in the D&aacute;il but I would like to know if it is the case that people would not be able to use these facilities unless they were on an advance register or is it the case that once they access the facilities they go into the system.  If that is the case that is a different matter, but that is not clear from the head.  I ask for clarification on that.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to come across as if I am being critical of the Garda.  The force is doing tremendous work in trying to combat the sale and supply of drugs and target individuals who are involved in the illicit drug trade, and everyone will support those activities.  I am talking about the users from a public health point of view.  If they are accessing a facility and they know that a member of the force can walk in the door behind them, we are lessening the chance of them using that facility.  We are not addressing the very reason we are establishing these safe injecting areas, which is to enable people to have a safe place in which to inject.  The assistant Garda commissioner might comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#R00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I will answer the questions on behalf of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Deputy Bernard Durkan raised the issue of street injection and the proliferation of needles on the city streets.  It has been a problem for some considerable time.  Dublin City Council, the Ana Liffey Drug Project and other NGOs have been working very hard to reduce the amount of detritus of self injection on the streets.  A visiting academic from Australia produced a worrying report during the summer and Dublin City Council has bins in place.  If a self injection centre is established in Dublin city centre, the level of drug detritus should decrease considerably and it would be welcomed by business people, tourists and the inhabitants of the city.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, would also welcome this outcome of a self injection centre.<\/p> <p>  There is a possibility that there will be vested interests associated with supervised injection centres.  There is a possibility that people involved in the sale and supply of drugs would target individuals entering centres.  There is no question about it.  This is where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing plans would come into operation.  Those policing plans will be founded on whatever the final version of the legislation looks like, and this will be very important.  Those plans happen now.<\/p> <p>  Senator Lynn Ruane asked us about the policing of the supervised injection facilities.  I am heartened to see that the national drugs strategy refers to a health-led approach.  The entire world has struggled with the criminal justice and policing-led approaches to trying to control the problem of drugs for many years.  Besides all that, drugs are a fact of life in every one of our communities at various levels.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien said there was a proliferation of prosecutions for possession, which we call section 3, and this is a concern for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is also a very significant percentage of prosecutions for sale and supply under section 15 and other sections of the Misuse of Drugs Act.  Within Dublin city and nationally there has been an increase in the numbers of prosecutions for sale and supply.  The policing element of the issue is very important.<\/p> <p>  While we are not in a position to eliminate the sale and supply of drugs, we are making inroads.  The members have seen the feuding in Dublin city and the policing responses to those feuds, the large numbers of arrests and seizures of guns and drugs.  I have a list of highly significant seizures that have occurred.  During the past month, over &euro;1.1 million worth of drugs was seized in Tallaght and &euro;400,000 in the Sheriff Street area.  These are examples of the type of policing activity that is happening.<\/p> <p>  The draft legislation suggests power be given to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enter the supervised injection facilities.  We have been conscious of the advent of the legislation and have engaged with our colleagues overseas in researching what has happened in their areas.  In other jurisdictions, the police have the power to enter the supervised injection facilities.  It does not seem to cause any problem.  From professionals working in the area and other police forces, I understand this supervision and engagement is welcomed and supported by professionals in the area.  I would expect and hope it would continue in this jurisdiction.  Decriminalisation for personal use is a different topic and not for us here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#S00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jack Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":630,"content":"<p>The assistant commissioner can say he supports it.

We visited one of the newer centres in Copenhagen, saw how it all worked and spoke to senior people in the Ministry of Health and the people running the centre.  They stressed that for such centres to be successful, there must be a partnership between the health authorities, police authorities and, in this case, city authorities, with most of the services being delivered through the municipalities.  The director of the centre noted that police officers walk in once a day to have a look around and this does not seem to cause any particular problems for anybody.  Indeed, it offers an element of reassurance for members of the wider community, some of whom had concerns about an injecting centre operating in their midst.  Part of the reassurance given to the community was that police officers would be able visit the centre regularly and ensure everything is okay.  It is a low-key look-around.<\/p> <p>  Some analysis has been done on how things are working in Denmark.  The document is in Danish but the centre staff gave us a summary in English.  The analysis shows that while there were concerns before some of the centres opened, there was generally a reduction in public nuisance incidents in the relevant areas once the services were up and running.  In the part of Copenhagen we visited, the data show there have been fewer call-outs to the police following the opening of the injecting centre.  The health-led approach being taken with the setting up of these centres seems to be leading to a win-win situation, with benefits for the drug users availing of the service, reduced demand for police resources and a positive outcome for the community in terms of reduced crime rates.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the concept of an authorised user, as set out in head 1, it is not the intention that people will have to register in advance.  In the injection centres we have looked at abroad, there is a quick registration process for first-time users.  We are conscious that these are people detached from the system, who often live chaotic lives and do not engage generally with authorities.  In some countries they ask for a nickname and a year of birth but there is nobody checking up on that information.  Each time a user presents at a centre and gives the name Jonathan 1984, for example, that will be recorded, along with the drug the person is using.  This allows staff to track users' drug use through the system.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the proposed evaluation process, the intention is that all the data will be anonymised.  The objective is not to create and maintain a register that will be handed over to anybody.  The people in this room today are generally very open to the idea of injecting centres, but there are people in the broader society who have concerns.  If we are to run a pilot service, we will have to justify any decision to go for a second or third centre.  We must be able to offer a robust evaluation of any such proposal.  From what we have seen of the studies on centres abroad, they do stand up and there are benefits both for drug users and the wider community.  We hope the same will apply in Ireland but we will have to provide robust evidence to back up our arguments.  The Minister has managed to secure some funding for next year, but if we are to acquire further funding, we must be able to provide an evaluation which shows the service is working well in co-operation with the various authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Lennon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":639,"content":"<p>From a HSE perspective, we are very clear that what is being proposed is a health care facility.

We have engaged with the service user representative group, UISCE, and are working with it to produce a survey of street injectors.  The survey asks users their views on the operation of such a facility and any concerns they have about it.  Deputy O'Brien mentioned the registration process.  When somebody has drugs and access to a facility like this, he or she wants to use the drugs quickly, not to have to hang around and undergo a long process before being given access.  Some people may be injecting into the groin and the facility will have to be able to accommodate that in a dignified way.<\/p> <p>  There are concerns among users that they will be hopped on when they visit the facility, engaged in counselling straight away or forced into a treatment process.  We are saying we will work with anybody within the context of our national drugs rehabilitation framework, which offers a broad approach to ensuring a continuum of care.  Our position is that a supervised injecting facility is at the far end of harm reduction and people can move from it right through to a situation where they are able to access services.

I understand that the witnesses are restricted in what they can say because the Department has to implement Government policy, the Garda has to implement law and personal opinions do not come into it.  I understand that terminology is important and the idea of this centre being policed is not what we want to emerge from these proceedings, but streets and areas are policed.  I visited a centre in Rotterdam and the injecting room there was one small component of the overall centre.  There were a range of activities in the centre ranging from counselling to interactions.  If what we achieve here is an injecting centre, just a room where people inject, then it will fail.  It must be part of a much wider suite of services for people.<\/p> <p>  A common question that will be asked is how one interacts with an individual whom garda&iacute; in the area know has an illegal substance on their person as they proceed to the centre.  I would say, and many people would agree with me, that this person is making a leap of trust in engaging with these services and he or she probably has many reasons from personal experience not to trust the services.  A comparison could be made between this centre and the average methadone clinic or health centre that people attend, and Mr. O'Driscoll mentioned the North Strand.  The average garda on the beat knows there is a higher chance of a person attending such a clinic having something illegal on their person.  I ask the Garda representatives about discretion and how that is policed.  The situation will be same when it comes to an injecting centre.  The Garda representatives, who are knowledgeable about the law, know the difference between a person who is pushing drugs and a person who is the victim.  If a person is interacting with this centre in a positive proper way, is it not similar to a person who has a chronic addiction but is going to a methadone clinic to get their methadone?  Does An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not deal with that situation in a particular way?  What we will be doing here is replicating that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#U00300","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":647,"content":"<p>Who would like to take those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#U00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":648,"content":"<p>On the question of how matters would operate if there was not a head 10 provision in the Bill, the existence of such a head 10 provision would prevent the need to use other sections, which are not being put aside, as a result of the opening of the centre.  If there was not such a head 10 provision, in particular circumstances we would have to use powers that are in place to enter the centre with a search warrant.  That is why we have this type of provision applying to many premises that have a licence.  If a similar situation arose in a public house and we did not have the power to enter it, we would have to use some other legislative provision.  This allows for ease of access and a friendly interaction.  We would argue it is one that will help the facility to operate in the way it is intended to operate.  We can be trusted, I hope, to use our capacity to enter the premises with the same discretion that we use entering any other premises we can enter by way of a similar provision.<\/p> <p>  This provision is being introduced from a health perspective, but we are not qualified to say whether lives will be saved as a result of it.  We accept the evaluation of the professional people who have the capacity to reach that conclusion.  Beyond anything else, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is there to preserve life.  As I said, I worked in the north inner city and a Christmas tree is put up outside St. Joseph's Mansions with a star to recall each of those who have died from heroin use.  If there are fewer stars on that tree in the years to come because of an initiative such as this one, we along with everybody else would be delighted if that were the outcome.<\/p> <p>  As far as back as 1996, a holistic approach was being adopted in the north inner city.  At that time I sat around a table with Dr. Joe Barry, Tony Gregory, Christy Burke, who was then a member of Sinn F&eacute;in, Cyprian Brady from the Fianna Fail Party and representatives from all the political parties.  There was a cross-party approach in terms of politics.  It involved every Government agency interacting.  While it was recognised the primary responsibility for law enforcement rested with the Garda, members of the force act, as we continue to do, through the national drugs strategy and with each of the other pillars, to offer whatever we can to ensure that, from a health, harm reduction and research perspective, we bring to the table whatever we can, in a common interest, to ameliorate and eliminate the drugs problem to the extent that this can be done.  The first report of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs, otherwise referred to as the Rabbitte report, has at appendix 3 a map that graphically displays that heroin use is very much associated with poverty and particular financial circumstances.  We all agreed in all the State agencies that it needed this holistic approach even as far back as then.  However long it has taken for initiatives such as this one to come forward, they are being put forward by those who have the qualifications to say that they will have the benefits that are being ascribed to them.  We hope at the end of the pilot project that we will be able to report that they should be replicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#U00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512600,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Driscoll for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2016113000002#U00600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1480512600,"counter":650,"content":"<p>I might add a further comment in support of my colleague, Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll.

I understand from conversations with professionals in this general area in Dublin city that there is no deep unease about this facility being afforded to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

There is significant research evidence regarding the minimal number of deaths associated with overdoses in supervised injection facilities.

These are people who may be living a chaotic lifestyle, for example, chronic users and hard-to-reach people.  The aim is to make it accessible for them.  Normally, there are some restrictions.  These services operate in other countries.  They tend to restrict children, pregnant women and what are termed naive users, in other words, people who we believe are not really drug addicts but who may want to try it out.  They do not normally facilitate such people.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to licences.  Several of the heads relate to licences because the proposed legislation would represent a major change for Ireland.  There are injecting centres in approximately 90 cities throughout the world.  This has been a cause of debate in Ireland.  We have to take the licence issue seriously.  Five or six of the heads relate to how people get a licence, how a licence may be revoked and how conditions may be applied during the time the licence is in force.  There is an issue with transfer.  Let us suppose an operator is given a licence.  Then, for some reason, the operator is unable to continue the service or the licence is revoked.  We may need to transfer that licence relatively quickly to be able to maintain the service for users.

There is a general duty of care for any employer but there will also be provision for regulations around managerial and clinical governance and related issues.  This will be taken into account.

I want to offer some reassurance to Deputies O'Brien and Durkan in respect of their concerns regarding the heads of the Bill, especially head 10, which relates to the provision of access for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I wish to reiterate what my colleagues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na said.  These provisions are already in existence for nightclubs and public houses.  The legislation is not envisaged to go beyond what is already in place for many other established licensed premises.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, this is a health-led and harm-reduction initiative.  It will be a low-threshold portal to reach out to marginalised individuals to allow them to access a safe environment to administer their own drugs.  There will be people there to support them if things go wrong.  They can also access other services as well.  They will and should be integrated with other services provided by the State.  The purpose of head 10 will not go beyond what is already in existence anywhere else, but it offers reassurance to the greater public.<\/p> <p>  I wish to address some of the issues raised by Deputy Durkan in respect of what has happened in other jurisdictions and the concerns that have arisen.  People have concerns over what they call the honey-pot effect.  This relates to people being attracted to an area and drawing in crime, drug users and various characters.  The concern is a gut reaction to all of these things and it is understandable.  However, we have a significant body of evidence gathered over a long period.  These places have been established for over 30 years.  In particular, in the past 16 since the foundation of the centre in Sydney there has been more evidence gathering.  The same applies throughout European sites as well.  There is significant evidence to show that there is no honey pot effect, no rise in criminality and no rise in drug use.  However, we have improvements in drug overdoses and drug-related litter.  A question was asked in the first session about how we manage and measure these things.  It is a difficult thing to measure.  There are few tangible things we can measure.  However, we can measure perceptions.  There are many different ways of data mining and gathering information and perceptions.  In Sydney, they have measured perceptions before, during and after.  They saw the support in the community rise and rise.  We heard reference to the fact that the police in Sydney referred to it as \"their\" supervised centre or \"our\" medically-supervised injecting centre because they are so involved in it.  These perceptions exist.  The perceptions of people who inject drugs will be important, as will the perception of people in the local community.  All the evidence gathered to date, especially during the past 16 years, shows that the concerns can be ameliorated quickly.  There are legitimate concerns.  The areas where these centres are located start to benefit from the provision of the service as well.<\/p> <p>  I wish to address some other concerns about the bureaucracy.  The intention in the Bill is to keep bureaucracy to a minimum and to remove any barriers.  At the same time there needs to be an element of monitoring and data collection to ensure that we can build more evidence in an Irish context to prove the benefit of these facilities and to engage any potential developments in future.

Would members like to comment before we bring this matter to a close and proceed to the next item, the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Justice and Equality?<\/p><p>I will afford an opportunity to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, the mover of the legislation, to make a brief comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#A00200","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":662,"content":"<p>As the Chairman said, I am the mover of the legislation.  It is important to put it in context, as well as the decisions made previously by the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>The legislation was passed on Second Stage on 26 October.  On that day D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann made a decision, pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 141, to refer it to the Select Committee on Justice and Equality.  During the course of the debate on Second Stage the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport spoke on behalf of the Government.  They said they would not oppose the Bill which, in many respects, they welcomed.  They stated it was their intention to bring forward Government legislation shortly.  At no stage during the course of that debate did either of them suggest the Government would seek to obstruct the Bill by preventing it from receiving a full hearing at the Select Committee on Justice and Equality.  On 19 November the committee decided that the legislation did not require to be subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny and it was agreed that Committee Stage would be taken today, 30 November.  At no stage has a complaint been made about the orders made by the committee made on 9 November.<\/p><p>It is important to bring into focus the background to this dispute and the efforts made by the Government to subvert this legislation and ensure it will not be brought before this Oireachtas committee for consideration.  I was contacted by the Government on the evening of Tuesday, 22 November and asked whether I would withdraw the Bill which was to be considered by the select committee today.  The reason I was given was that the Government was under pressure to get the Courts Bill through the Oireachtas, especially the part dealing with the reappointment of the costs accountant.  I was asked by the Government, on the basis of the urgency of the Courts Bill, to agree to allow an adjournment until 14 December in order that the Courts Bill could be dealt with today.  I refused that request.  It is instructive to note that, in fact, the Courts Bill is to be taken by the committee tomorrow.<\/p><p>On Wednesday, 23 November I was again contacted by the Government amd asked whether I would withdraw my Bill in order that it could be subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny.  Again, I refused, politely.  During the same call I was asked whether I would agree to withdraw the Bill and then work with the Government on its Bill.  At that stage I mentioned that there was a particular urgency because the Government had indicated that it was not going to appoint judges because of the insistence of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport that it not do so until a new statutory regime was in place.  At no stage during my discussions with the Government last week did anyone mention that it was going to raise an objection to this legislation because it involved what is referred to as a charge on public expenditure.<\/p><p>I am now aware, from speaking to members of the select committee, that it is being suggested sections 10 and 11 of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.  I have my own views on that matter and do not necessarily agree with the suggestion made.  Section 10 states:<\/p><blockquote>(1) The Minister may make available to the Commission such services, including staff, as the Minister may determine from time to time with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<br \/><br \/>(2) The Minister may second or assign to the Commission such of his or her officers as he or she may determine, with the consent of the Commission and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to be members of the staff of the Commission.<\/blockquote> <p>Section 11 states: &quot;The expenses incurred by the Commission in the administration of this Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas&quot;.  Even if it involves expenditure, every real politician in this room and the country knows that it would be minor.  What has happened, however, is that because it involves some minor technical details of expenditure, the committee requires a message from the Government in accordance with Article 17.2 of the Constitution.  The Government has made a decision not to grant that money message, as it is referred to in the Oireachtas.  The sole purpose or reason the Government is invoking this constitutional provision is not that it has any concern about the expenditure of public moneys - it is aware that the public moneys expended would be minimal - but to solve a political problem for it.<\/p><p>Although I am the person who is sponsoring the Bill, it will have consequences for all Members of the Oireachtas in the future.  There are many Second Stage debates in the Oireachtas and many Bills are then referred to a select committee.  There is no doubt that we could find in every tranche of legislation examples of where some minor expenditure could be incurred.  In this case it appears as if the Government does not want the legislation to be placed before a select committee and that it will simply use its veto and seek to invoke, inappropriately, Article 17.2 for the purpose of trying to get itself out of a bind.  That places this committee in a difficult position.  I know that all members prepared for this hearing and that they have considered the Bill carefully and tabled amendments.  I would have thought that as an act of courtesy to you, Chairman, and the committee, if Government knew it was going to invoke this measure, it would have been communicated to the committee earlier than yesterday.  I was notified yesterday of its intention to do so.  I believe that even the Chairman was not notified of it yesterday.  I understand he was only notified this morning.  It showed extreme disrespect to the committee and the Legislature by the Executive branch of the Oireachtas.  It is important that this dissatisfaction be epressed.  It needs to be described for what it is - a stroke by the Government.  It is trying to stop the Oireachtas from doing its job and introducing legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#B00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":663,"content":"<p>Before giving other members an opportunity to speak, I reaffirm that I am only offering the opportunity to say what their reaction is and on what they want to reflect.

That is all it is and the only thing we can call it.  It strikes a blow at the autonomy and functioning of the select committee in a way that flies in the face of the so-called new politics.  I just cannot believe it.<\/p> <p>  The committee discussed whether we needed to subject the Bill to pre-legislative scrutiny.  Based on our input, we decided that we would not do so, that we wanted to move ahead.  This is an incredibly well functioning committee.  When dealing with other Bills we decided that pre-legislative scrutiny was necessary.  We have been through that process in dealing with another Bill.<\/p> <p>  I want to make two points.  There is no point in accepting any Opposition Bill on Second Stage if the Government is going to behave in this manner as it makes an absolute mockery of the process.  I do not understand what a money message is.  I gather it is a message placed on the Order Paper, giving permission to proceed.  If this is not a bureaucratic manoeuvre, could the Government not simply do it now and proceed with the Bill next week?  I do not fully understand the mechanics involved.  However, I understand that if the Bill is not allowed to continue and we do not overturn this attempt, there will be no point in any Opposition Bill moving beyond Second Stage.

That is singularly important.  It is vital that appointments be based on merit in the appointment and ranking of the different members.<\/p> <p>  I read again the speech of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality on Second Stage and at no stage did she mention anything about invoking Article 17.2 of the Constitution.  The Government allowed the Bill to pass and the Minister mentioned how it was a useful framework.  She also mentioned how the Department of Justice and Equality had engaged with stakeholders and that the Bill was progressive and provided an interesting basis on which to engage in consideration of reform.<\/p><p>The Minister said there is common ground on Bills and that she would not oppose it but she hopes to come up with her own Bill.  It was disingenuous to allow this Bill go through Second Stage and to present, as Deputy Daly has mentioned, a bureaucratic stroke to the committee at such a late stage, without respecting the Chairman.  The Minister is the Deputy Leader of this State.  We hear repeatedly about the programme for partnership Government which states:<\/p><blockquote>The new political landscape in Ireland presents a historic opportunity to radically reform Irish politics &ndash; to fundamentally change the relationship between Government and the Oireachtas, and with it the relationship between the Irish people and their parliament.<\/blockquote><p>It is said to be a partnership between Government and Parliament.  It is when it suits the Government.  The Government says it wants to be part of this change, not only to shape it but also to help drive it.<br\/><br\/>We have seen how this Bill has progressed through the Houses.  We are here at this select committee, prepared for the amendments and to progress this, but as Deputy O'Callaghan has said, the Minister is addressing internal governmental issues and we have a de facto Minister for justice who is not here, Deputy Ross.  The Minister has allowed another member of the Cabinet ride roughshod over the Executive, the Government, and undermine this Parliament.  That is wrong.  If the Minister wanted to achieve what is in A Programme for a Partnership Government, a partnership between the Government and the D&aacute;il, she would have respected that process and mentioned that there were issues around Article 17.2 when she made her presentation to the House.  To allow it to progress, to allow Deputies put forward amendments in a constructive fashion over weeks and to pull it at the last moment is wrong and undermines the rhetoric the Government uses repeatedly in our Parliament.<br\/><br\/>I am really angry about how this has been stroked to suit one Minister who has forgotten about his own portfolio.  The Minister for Justice and Equality needs to exercise her own authority as Minister and T&aacute;naiste.  She could have facilitated this, with constructive amendments from the Department, by allowing this Bill to go through Committee Stage.  Instead, it has been blocked, undermined and pulled at the last minute.  It is a waste of the time of Members who have put significant work into drafting and amending this and it undermines everything the Minister and the Government has said about new politics.  This is a dark day for what this partnership Government was intended to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#B00800","speaker":"1255","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":670,"content":"<p>Deputy Brophy is next, then Deputy Wallace.

To listen to the righteous indignation of some Deputies, one would swear we are never going to consider this legislation again.  Am I not right in understanding that at some point soon we can carry out pre-legislative scrutiny of Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill and maybe of a Government Bill too?  Surely it is important to get the work of the committee right rather than rush along according to a timetable orchestrated in a way I cannot fathom but that does not seem to have anything to do with getting the work right.  The Bill is so deeply flawed in so many ways that pre-legislative scrutiny was probably essential.  It was regrettable that it did not happen.  I understand why it was decided not to have it but the grounds for that no longer apply.  If there is an opportunity to get the process right it is better to do that.  The delay is not inordinate.  It would be better to concentrate on our role than to focus on what Minister is doing what.  If Deputies have prepared amendments, the work is done and the benefit will come to the committee when it gets an opportunity.<\/p> <p>  There has been tremendous cross-party co-operation and continuing that kind of co-operation would be much more effective than going down a route that might make the committee work less effectively or coherently.

The Chairman has been here much longer than me and can perhaps confirm this.  I respect Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan, his profession, qualifications and experience.  However, without the benefit of the available resources of the Department of Justice and Equality, I think even he will admit that there might be issues in his Bill that need to be worked out.  Therefore, it is only appropriate that the time be given for a thorough examination of it and that it come back to this committee and the D&aacute;il in the appropriate way.  The Deputy does not have a monopoly on views on the subject of the Bill.  The programme for Government sets out a similar aspiration.  I see no reason both Bills cannot be debated, if not together then in close proximity to one another to make sure that Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s views and those of his party and others are taken into consideration.

He admitted that on Second Stage.  It is not a case that there might be issues, there are issues, as recognised by the person who moved the Bill.  That is the very reason for a legislative process, with Committee and Report Stages, when amendments are put forward to rectify problems.<\/p><p>If there are issues with legislation in the eyes of the Government, it is the responsibility of the Government to propose amendments on Committee and Report Stages.  That is why Bills do not stop on Second Stage.  It seems that if they did, many more Opposition Bills would be passed.  At the moment, they go into a black hole after Second Stage.<\/p><p> I understood we were changing the way we do politics in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  That is clearly not the case.  It is very disappointing and downright insulting to the committee that a decision which was supported by all members of the committee, including Fine Gael members, is not being upheld now.  The Fine Gael members in question are rocking up in here today to say we should have pre-legislative scrutiny, but no such case was made when we decided to take Committee Stage today.  It is cowardly to support legislation on Second Stage only to block it when the time comes for amendments to it to be debated on Committee Stage.  The whole point of the amendments is to improve the legislation and perfect it as much as possible.  It needs to be improved, as Deputy O'Callaghan has recognised.<\/p><p> It would be preferable if the Minister and her Government colleagues were to vote down legislation on Second Stage, rather than pretending to support it only to show on Committee Stage that they are not really supporting it.  Such an approach to legislation is not good for politics, in my opinion.  I remind Deputy Brophy, who has described the Bill as \"deeply flawed\", that the Minister does not share his view.  If the Deputy's view is that there are so many issues with the Bill, he should have voted against it on Second Stage.

The points I have to make might assist the committee in its consideration of this matter.  I remind Deputies O'Callaghan and Jack Chambers, in particular, that new politics works both ways.  As Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned on Second Stage, the confidence and supply arrangement provides for a ten-week period for bringing forward a Government view on legislation before it is considered on Committee Stage.  The Bill we are discussing was introduced less than five weeks ago.  Deputy O'Callaghan told the D&aacute;il on that occasion that this \"brings us to the beginning of January 2017 and I want my legislation before the committee at the beginning of January\".  What has happened in the meantime?  I accept that when he brought the matter before the committee, it decided not to have pre-legislative scrutiny.  I would like to make some points about that decision.<\/p> <p>  New politics envisages that legislative proposals will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny.  When I publish my Bill next Tuesday, I will ask the Chairman of this committee to provide for it to be the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny.  When Deputy O'Callaghan brought his Bill to this committee, he also booked time in the D&aacute;il next week for Report Stage.  His party agreed to allocate Private Members' time for this Bill in advance of this committee having any discussion on it, in advance of any amendments and in advance of any timetable coming from the committee.  I do not know how Deputy O'Callaghan decided that the Bill would be considered on Report Stage next week, but I have to say it does not smack of new politics to me.<\/p> <p>  I accept the point that there is a range of policy issues arising in this context.  I respect the work that Deputy O'Callaghan has done on this Bill and the contribution he has made to the discussion in this area.  I think he will share my view that since the foundation of the State, the Judiciary has served this State very well.  Regardless of the system that is used for the appointment of judges, my personal belief is that there has never been any fear that judges will not behave impartially after they are appointed.  I have made this view very clear all along.  I have spoken of my respect for the Judiciary.  I have emphasised how well this country has been served by its Judiciary.  Times move on, however.  Views have changed regarding the best method of appointing the Judiciary.  That is what is under consideration in the Bill that Deputy O'Callaghan has proposed and the legislation I have been working on.<\/p> <p>  I believe there is common cause between the Bill I will be introducing and the Bill that has been published by Deputy O'Callaghan.  There is agreement on the need for a new system of appointing judges.  I do not believe that reflects in any way on those who have previously been appointed.  Instead, it takes account of the best modern approach to recruiting the most suitable people.  While I recognise that there are special requirements in any judicial appointment, that does not mean lessons cannot be learned from changes in selection processes generally.  I believe those lessons should be applied to this arena now.  After 20 years, it is time for change.  We have seen a sea change in selection processes in other areas.  The challenge we face is to decide how best to go about making improvements in this area.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that although we have a common objective, there are proposals in Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill that run directly contrary to the contents of the programme for Government.  Of course he has a right to make such proposals.  Members of the D&aacute;il have an important role in making proposals.  Of course some of them will be contrary to Government policy.  I note that Deputy Clare Daly has tabled a number of amendments that directly contradict what is in the Bill at it stands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#D00600","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":681,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#D00700","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":682,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#D00800","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":683,"content":"<p>It is the democratic process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#D00900","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":684,"content":"<p>Of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#D01000","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":685,"content":"<p>That is what we are here to discuss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#D01100","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":686,"content":"<p>Exactly.  I mention the Deputy's amendments to make the point that there are real issues of difference here.  The Government members of the committee have such issues as well.  We are bringing forward our own Bill.  We have given priority to the drafting of that Bill in accordance with our own legislative proposals.  I have already said, those Government proposals will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny immediately.  I believe the side-by-side consideration of both Bills as part of the legislative process would be in the best interests of the production of the most effective set of legislative proposals.  I think the examination of both Bills in this way, with both of them being subject to pre-legislative scrutiny, would be an example of new politics.  It would certainly be preferable to a rush to legislating for this important constitutional area.<\/p> <p>  I have a series of concerns about certain points in Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill.  I believe there is a constitutional issue in it.  Other issues that arise from it also need further development and change.  I accept that this is what happens on Committee and Report Stages.  I will not pretend that there are not substantial differences between my approach and that advocated by Deputy O'Callaghan.  I refer, for example, to his proposal for an independent chair and his approach to the composition of the new board.  In light of the complex choices that are before us, I strongly submit that working co-operatively on pre-legislative scrutiny of both Bills would be in the interests of the production of the best legislation possible.  I have already suggested that to Deputy O'Callaghan.  I am happy to work closely with him in a co-operative way.  I can arrange for officials in the Department to meet him to go through the details of our approach and to explain how it differs from his approach.<\/p> <p>  I believe our Judiciary is of the most profound importance to the State.  I am sure all members of the committee will agree we should follow the best procedures for ensuring the best people are selected.  That is of profound importance.  That is why I believe everything possible should be done to ensure we examine this legislation in a detailed way, as opposed to rushing to Report Stage next week as Deputy O'Callaghan had envisaged.  The timeframe that was available would have left me unable to make the kind of detailed amendments I would want to make.  I would certainly have been able to make them by January if we had gone down that route.  Equally, the Government decided yesterday to appoint judges where there are vacancies and that will happen next week.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan's motivation in proposing this legislation, as I understand it, was his concern about delays in judicial appointments.  That issue has been addressed.  I suggest we need to take the time to examine this legislation and engage in pre-legislative scrutiny, rather than following the accelerated process proposed by Deputy O'Callaghan.<\/p><p>Those are the main points that I would make.  I hope it has cast a light on the approach that I would like to see for this legislation, which I think would be the most productive way forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#D01200","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":688,"content":"<p>Sorry-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#E00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I am not going to open it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#E00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":690,"content":"<p>May I respond briefly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#E00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I will allow Deputy O'Callaghan a very brief-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#E00500","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":692,"content":"<p>One minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#E00600","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I believe the most particular point is in regard to what now-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#E00700","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I agree with the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#E00800","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":695,"content":"<p>If the Deputy focuses on that, I will of course allow him to contribute.

The Supplementary Estimate requirement in respect of the Garda Vote is &euro;10 million and an additional &euro;2 million is required for the Courts Vote in 2016.  The additional requirements will be offset by surrender balances at year end in respect of the other votes in the justice group: prisons, the Property Registration Authority, justice and equality, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Valuation Office and the Policing Authority.<\/p> <p>  The additional funding for the Garda Vote in the current year is the final part of the funding package announced by Government earlier this year.  It is largely due to the sustained response to tackle gangland crime, fund the continuation of Operation Thor, with which the committee will be very familiar, and to ensure that measures to prevent international terrorism are continued throughout the year.  This funding is in addition to the &euro;40 million already provided in the Revised Estimates for 2016.  That was provided in October.<\/p> <p>  The Government has consistently made clear that we would fund whatever measures were needed for An Garda Sioch&aacute;na to best tackle the challenges it currently faces.  We have backed up these assurances with the approval of substantial additional funding to support large-scale policing operations, which members of the committee and the Chairman will have seen in Dublin and around the country.<\/p><p>The additional funding will ensure that garda&iacute; may continue to confront and dismantle criminal networks.  The funding will be utilised across a number of subheads, including: overtime expenditure, which is expected to be over &euro;90 million in the current year; travel and subsistence; and the purchase of additional operational equipment for specialist units, etc.<\/p><p> There is no question but that this investment is yielding results.  For example, Deputies would be interested to know Operation Hybrid has been established to co-ordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and to address concerns about public and community safety.  As of October, 38 arrests have been made and five charges have been brought in connection with recent shootings.  In addition, 23 firearms have been seized and over 9,000 lines of inquiry conducted.  In excess of 14,350 high-visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from the armed support units and a major amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic and forensic evidence is also being examined.  The committee can see how the funding I outlined is being put to very good use in terms of Garda operations.<\/p><p> The goal of this budget allocation is focused on the key objectives of strengthening the law to get tougher on serious and repeat offenders and investing in the capacity of the Garda to enforce the law effectively.  I will not go into too much detail.  Operation Thor is a multi-strand national anti-crime and anti-burglary operation.  It is a significant stepping up of the response to burglaries and we know patterns of crime change.  There was a pattern around the country regarding burglaries.  This operation has provided a very swift return on the Government's  investment made in Garda resources and that is reflected in the figures recorded by the Central Statistics Office, which indicate a reduction of 26.3% in the level of burglary crimes.  In the first six months of this year, there were 36% fewer burglaries than in the first six months of 2015, underlining the impact of Operation Thor since it was established at the end of last  year.  Everybody would welcome that success.<\/p><p> There has been concentrated activity throughout the country as a result of Operation Thor.  I have already spoken about Operation Hybrid and Operation Thor has brought about more than 30,000 crime prevention patrols, with 38,500 targeted checkpoints nationwide.  There  have also been approximately 2,500 arrests and 2,900 charges, covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.<\/p><p> A number of technical adjustments are also included in the Supplementary Estimate, including the reallocation of a capital expenditure underspend of approximately &euro;20 million in the building programme to other areas.  One often gets that underspend with very large capital projects as it can be quite difficult to predict precisely the pace at which they develop and the spending of money.  We have reallocated that to capital expenditure in important areas like information and communications technology, ICT.  There is a major ongoing ICT programme and we have reallocated some of the money there, as well as to transport, including for the purchase of 191 extra cars for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be delivered by the end of the year.  There is also &euro;9 million in respect of unspent buildings capital that will be carried over to 2017 to meet costs relating to the completion of the divisional headquarters at Kevin Street in Dublin, Wexford and  Galway, all of which are under way.  This will ensure the effective use of the capital allocation on a multi-year basis.<\/p><p> Even allowing for the capital carryover adjustments, it is projected  that over &euro;90 million will be spent on Garda capital in 2016.  Under the transport heading, in 2016 alone, 520 new vehicles have come on stream to ensure that garda&iacute; are mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  As I stated, before the end of the year another 191 vehicles will be bought at a cost of &euro;4 million.  This area has been neglected because there was no capital investment and stock had run down very considerably, as all Deputies realise.  That is now being replenished.  There will still be &euro;4 million under the capital plan for new vehicles next year.  A constant programme of replacement is needed for those vehicles.<\/p><p> It is expected that &euro;53 million will be expended in Garda ICT capital in 2016.  There will be significant expenditure on new systems.  There will be new rosters and a duty management system to facilitate better management of resources, with a cost of &euro;1.5 million.  There will be investigations management systems to ensure enhanced management of crime investigations.  This will ensure that PULSE does not just record incidents but that it also follows through on investigations.  The cost attaching is &euro;5.7 million.  There will be technology to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, at &euro;1.6 million, and Microsoft upgrades, at &euro;5.2 million.  I am very pleased we have been able to start the work on the Schengen information system II this year as we are one of the few countries in Europe that does not have interoperability with other countries on that system.  This allows the Garda to work with international colleagues to develop the Irish Schengen information system II.<\/p><p> Aside from capital, there are a number of other overruns and savings in various subheads, including surplus receipts mainly relating to pension-related deductions, which are being rebalanced as part of the Supplementary Estimate process.  I am particularly pleased that an additional amount of almost &euro;3 million is being provided in subhead A2, maintenance of Garda premises, which provides funding for improvement and maintenance works to the Garda estate to support the effective discharge of the force's functions.  This where garda&iacute; can do this work in local Garda stations and although they are essential, they are smaller items of work.  That is in contrast to larger-scale refurbishment with which, for example, the Office of Public Works and the Garda would be involved.  As well as the relatively routine maintenance expenditure, significant improvements have been carried out at a wide number of locations throughout the country.  These smaller non-capital projects are addressing security and health and safety matters in  particular.  In addition, a large number of Garda stations have received minor but necessary upgrade works to provide enhanced facilities for both members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the public.  There is a large-scale refurbishment programme that must go on, given the state of many of the Garda stations around the country.  We must continue to invest in that area.<\/p><p> The Government recently agreed a five-year reform and high-level work force plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is ambitious and has not previously been attempted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a new departure that marries reform with resources.  The resources in terms of personnel are backed up by the substantial capital investment already earmarked, as I outlined, for critical ICT systems, the transport fleet and Garda stations under the capital plan for 2016 to 2021.  It is in the programme for Government and the supply-and-confidence agreement that we will increase the overall size of the Garda organisation to 21,000 by 2021.  This will be made up of 15,000 garda&iacute; but also a doubling of the number of civilians and the Garda Reserve.  The recruitment for the Garda Reserve will start mid-year.  This high-visibility policing will fulfil a key commitment in the programme for Government and is a direct response to what the public have told us they want to see happening.  The funding secured for 2017 ensures we can make a strong start in realising this vision for the overall work force; 800 Garda trainees, up to 500 additional civilians and 300 new members of the reserve are to be recruited next year.  These are ambitious targets but we will certainly focus on delivering them so we can reach the overall target in five years.<\/p><p> The net additional Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;2 million in the courts Vote is made up of a gross expenditure of &euro;3.5 million offset by a surplus in receipts of &euro;1.5 million.  The additional requirement is mainly accounted for by ICT capital expenditure to meet video link investment costs of &euro;1 million and other essential ICT infrastructure, including network upgrades and replacement of various parts.  Those costs are &euro;1.5 million as well.  The additional requirement also includes certain costs associated with works required for the second Special Criminal Court, reflect in the annual public private partnership payment in respect of the Criminal Courts of Justice.  The additional receipts, which offset, in part, the cost of the Supplementary Estimates, mainly comprise income collected in the court examiner's office due to residual liquidation cases being dealt with by the office.<\/p><p>The final element of income from this source will materialise during 2017.  The introduction of the Companies Act 2014 has ceased the requirement for fees to be paid on company liquidation cases dealt with by the examiner's office.  The underspends in the other Votes across the justice sector, which are offsetting the cost of the Supplementary Estimates, mainly arise in payroll savings due to a longer lead-in time than expected for recruitment in some areas.

I have a few questions on it.  We have had positive results from Operation Thor and there has been a welcome shift in the figures.  The Minister outlined that 520 new vehicles will be purchased in 2017.  Does she have an indication of the number of vehicles that will be installed with automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, technology?  How many vehicles have had that technology installed to date?  It is an important technology for crime surveillance and road traffic issues.  Many garda&iacute; would mention it to me as being a priority technology.  Given that new vehicles are being purchased, it is important that they would have this technology installed.  There were previous announcements about an investment in ANPR technology.<\/p> <p>  Regarding recruitment towards meeting the targeted figure of 15,000 garda&iacute; provided for in the confidence and supply arrangement, it is projected that there will be massive increase in Garda retirements.  In the three-year period from 2018 to 2020 there will be a significant number of retirements.  Has the Minister planned as part of the Garda recruitment process to offset the number of retirements to ensure there is not a large reduction in Garda numbers? There have been fewer retirements this year, and the same will be the case next year because of the recruitment embargo in the 1980s.  Are there budgetary plans and projections for Garda recruitment?<\/p> <p>  I have a concern about the underspend of the allocation for prisons.  It is important that the Minister and the Department focuses on some new programmes around penal reform and on what can be achieved in the prison system.  If money from the allocation to prisons is being returned to the State, I would prefer to see it allocated within the system towards new programmes or reforms.<\/p> <p>  The elephant in the room with respect to these Supplementary Estimates is the funding of the Labour Court agreement if it is approved.  There are some welcome improvements in Garda pay and conditions.  What is the Minister's plan to fund those?  What discussions are taking place at Government level towards funding that agreement, which will probably occur and which many garda&iacute;, particularly younger garda&iacute;, deserve?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#G00300","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I will take the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#G00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":723,"content":"<p>Deputy Chambers' first question on the ANPR technology is an operational matter.  The ICT funding we allocated would cover that technology if the Garda decided to install it in vehicles.  The goal would be to have a fairly comprehensive usage of ANPR technology because it is incredibly helpful in crime detection.  I am informed there are some vehicles with that technology installed in every division.  Clearly, the operational decision that has been taken is to make sure that throughout the country some vehicles have this technology installed.  The goal would be to move to a fairly comprehensive management of ANPR technology with new vehicles.  I will see if I can the get a more detailed breakdown on the approach to this and I will forward it to the Deputy.  Essentially, it is an operational decision.  From a policy point of view, I would fully support it.  The funding it would provide would be intended to cover the increasing use of ANPR technology in vehicles.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of Garda retirements, that has been built in, following discussions with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to ensure we reach the target figure of 15,000.  It has been agreed that to reach that figure, taking account of retirements which will average approximately 300 per year, we would need to recruit 800 garda&iacute;, but that can be subject to review as we note the level of retirements.  The agreement we have come to on the number of garda&iacute; that will go into Templemore is based on an assessment of the retirements not only over a year but over the five-year period.  Plans have been made on that basis.  The retirements will average 300 per year but it is difficult to predict the number precisely.  We have had detailed discussions on the numbers we would need to recruit, taking account of retirements over the entire period, to reach the target figure of 15,000.<\/p> <p>  I will deal with the Deputy's last question and then return to the prisons issue.  I am awaiting the outcome of the ballot and I have full respect for that.  What I have said about it, and what I hope will happen, is that every garda in the country who has a vote in that ballot will have all the information on the offer on the table.  I understand that is what both Garda associations are ensuring.  If there is an agreement and if it is passed, there will be budgetary implications.  I welcome the recommendations from the Labour Court which seeks to address the concerns articulated by the representative bodies about Garda pay and conditions, including those of new recruits.  There is also access to the new dispute resolution mechanisms.  That is part of the agreement.  Once the outcome of the ballot is known, and if the proposals are accepted, and I hope they will be, the additional budgetary cost will be the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In that regard, officials of both Departments can have initial discussions but until we have the outcome of the ballot, we will not be going any further on that.  The most important thing at this point is to give the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, and the Garda Representative Association, GRA, the time and the space to discuss the issues that are before them.<\/p> <p>  On the prisons issue, I understand the savings in this area are due to the fact that there has been a slowness in recruitment.  I am told that in quarter 2 of 2016 the Public Appointments Service carried out a job analysis of the recruit prison officer role and designed a revised competency framework for use in the selection process.  The previous one to that was done in 1998.  We made a decision to recruit more officers in 2016 and it coincided with significant changes in the service.  It was considered appropriate that the job analysis should be revisited.  The principal aims were to identify whether the job had changed and also to consider the evolving nature of the role.  The size of the prison population has shrunk since 2008 and an increasing emphasis is being put on the rehabilitation of prisoners.  Technology continues to change the balance of prison officers' duties and a higher proportion of their time is spent in contact roles while information technology is increasingly used for monitoring and management of the prison population.  This large item of work was done and it has meant that there has been an underspend because that delayed the recruitment, but it is intended that the first classes of the new recruit prison officers will begin their training at the end of quarter 1 in 2017.  The Irish Prison Service, IPS, is also recruiting prison administration and support officers who are due to commence service in January 2017.  The fact that the funding is in the base is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#G00500","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":724,"content":"<p>Regarding the time and space that the Minister outlined for the Labour Court recommendation, I assume it will not impinge on what the she has presented here.

I will not ask any further questions on that.  I expected that but just wanted to check.  I am always critical of underspending by Departments and I do not think I should be any less critical of the Department of Justice and Equality.  Normally, I reserve it for the Department of Education and Skills, which is overspending this year.  My query relates to the capital building programme.  The Minister referred to &euro;29 million due to delays in certain projects and, of course, that happens.  How imminent is the draw down of that &euro;29 million in those particular projects?  Are we talking about months or years?  The Minister can be specific if she wishes.  I do not mind.<\/p> <p>  I refer to &euro;8.7 million in respect of aircraft.  The Garda operates two EC135s and a Defender.  I stand to be corrected, but I understand the two helicopters were acquired in 1997, or at least one of them was.  Is there an operational ceiling on that or is there a major programme to keep the aircraft airworthy?  I assume the considerable increase in budgetary spend of 52% might, in fact, relate to that.  If its operational life is coming to an end, is there a plan in terms of the budget to acquire another EC135 or similar aircraft?  Is the Defender aircraft a Garda aircraft or does it belong to the Air Corps?  Does it have a duality of use?  Will it appear in the Defence Estimates or as part of the maintenance budget?<\/p> <p>  My question on clothing and maintenance has been covered somewhat by my colleague, Deputy Jack Chambers.  There is an additional &euro;1.7 million for uniforms for student garda&iacute; and the armed response unit in Dublin.  Can the Minister provide a breakdown of the type of equipment associated with the uniform of the armed response unit?  Are we talking about body armour?  Is that included in the term \"uniform\" or are we literally talking about fabric here?  Perhaps, the Minister can be a little bit more specific for me.<\/p> <p>  As a member of the committee, I note that the figures provided by the Department from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and which were assessed by the CSO recently were nothing short of remarkable on a 12-month basis in regard to my own constituency and Garda division.  In my division, which includes the constituency of Deputy Jack Chambers, there was a 40% reduction in burglary, which is extraordinary.  These are CSO figures and, as such, are not coming out of the Department.  I add the caution that we know there is a reduction in the reporting of crime, which is always a concern, but from my perspective and perhaps from that of the Minister, we can only allocate resources where we know about the issues involved.  As my local Garda inspector has been saying during my 12 years in public life, constituents should always be encouraged to call An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na even if a matter is minor because otherwise they will not know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#H00500","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":730,"content":"<p>The answer to the Deputy's question is that these are not projects which will slip back months and years.  For example, the project at Kevin Street is being built a cost of &euro;33.539 million.  While there have been various problems with it, the projected completion date is now the second quarter of 2017.  It is estimated that the project might slip by six or seven weeks, but it will be completed in 2017.  In Galway, the project cost is &euro;31.181 million and there have been some weather-related delays there.  There was some underestimation of the complexities of the concrete elements of the structure by the contractor and there was a staffing issue for a vital subcontractor.  Those are the reasons for some of the delay.  However, the projected completion date, which was September 2017, is now the fourth quarter of 2017.  The projects are going ahead and there are very practical reasons for any underspend, as I have outlined.  The projects will be completed in 2017.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Farrell is right to say the position regarding aircraft needs to be reviewed.  My understanding is that a new aircraft will be needed by about 2020.  That is one of the matters the Department will be discussing in the context of the mid-term capital review next year.  Obviously, we want to ensure that appropriate and safe aircraft are available.  That will be up for discussion in the first instance in the review of the capital programme.<\/p> <p>  The budget for uniforms, including for the armed response unit, includes equipment.  That is an operational decision.  I have responded positively to any requests I have had specifically for equipment for the armed response unit.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for his comments on burglary reductions.  People will confirm that it is the situation albeit I always note that if one is the person who is burgled, it is one burglary too many.  That is why we have to be vigilant.  Clearly, targeted operations, like Operation Hybrid or Operation Thor, work.  We also saw with the targeted operation on sham marriages that the incidence of those decreased completely.  When we put Border operations in, in particular under the new North-South task force, on which the report was presented to me just two weeks ago, we saw really good success.  There was a targeted operation in the Border area on rural crime and there was good success in terms of finding machinery and bringing people before the courts in the North and the South.  While there are issues in relation to what gets reported, notwithstanding that and notwithstanding either the issues identified by the CSO on which it is still working, there has been a huge success in preventing crime, interrupting burglaries and protecting the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#H00600","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":731,"content":"<p>I have a supplementary question which I forgot to ask.

There is no extra money involved.  It is about reallocating money from areas in which there has been an underspend and moving it to areas that we have prioritised, for example, ICT and the purchase of Garda vehicles.  There was an underspend in the areas I outlined.<\/p> <p>  As to SIS II, there is no connection with the fact that Ireland is outside the Schengen agreement.  It is called the Schengen information system.  The second generation of the SIS is a state-of-the-art EU-wide IT system that allows for an easy and automated exchange of information between national border control authorities, customs and police authorities in different jurisdictions.  It is one of the important tools member states are using to exchange information, particularly on terrorist threats.  We use other methods also, but there is a move at EU level - I have attended many meetings and chaired a number of others in the Department of Justice and Equality - to try to ensure we will have the best possible interoperability, while respecting the need for data protection and other issues that arise.<\/p> <p>  As the investment in information technology had been stopped for a number of years, we are behind, but I am keen to accelerate investment.  It is a complex matter from an IT point of view, but we are working on it with a number of groups from within the Garda and specialist agencies, including at European level, to ensure we can reach the point of proper interoperability between the systems in order to deal with criminal activity and irregular border movements.  The current concern is that we exchange information in a timely way to tackle terrorism.  There needs to be greater interoperability between systems and member states in real time.  It has been a complicated discussion and it is expensive, with the total amount being very substantial.  The timeframe for implementing the necessary systems and structures to support the integration of the SIS II has been provisionally estimated at between 18 and 24 months at a cost of between &euro;18 and &euro;22 million, but this substantial investment in information technology is necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2016113000002#J00800","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1480500900,"counter":740,"content":"<p>We all concur.

This was missed earlier this year when the Public Transport Act 2016 cited the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2014 in section 8 of the Public Transport Act as the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2016.

I have taken legal advice on this technicality and the proposed wording will ensure that nothing in the collective citation is lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#B00400","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":750,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":751,"content":"<p>Section 1, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":752,"content":"<p>Section 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":753,"content":"<p>NEW SECTIONS<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":754,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, and 34 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#B00900","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":755,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p><blockquote>In page 5, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:<div>&ldquo;PART 2<br \/><br \/>REGISTER OF WRITTEN-OFF VEHICLES<\/div><blockquote><b>Definition - Part 1<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>3. <\/b>In this Part &ldquo;vehicle insurer&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it in section 58 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>The issue of what to do about written-off vehicles has been talked about for a very long time.  It has been raised repeatedly as a matter that might be included in successive road traffic Bills.  In the end it has always been deferred.  When I became the Minister for Transport. Tourism and Sport the current Bill had already been passed by the Seanad and it was restored to the Order Paper for the D&aacute;il after the election.  I decided that this time around written-off vehicles should not be left as the also-ran issue of road traffic law.  I decided to introduce an amendment to the Bill to address, for the first time on a statutory basis, the question of written off vehicles in Ireland.  I shall begin by speaking on how things stand currently.  Under existing voluntary arrangements some vehicle insurers submit notification details regarding total vehicle right offs to my Department's national vehicle and driver file, NVDF.  On receiving these details, records relating to such vehicles are locked down on the NVDF so that no further transactions can be recorded against them.  This means there can be no renewal of motor tax or change of ownership for the vehicle.  The locked down status of these vehicles can be altered only if the NVDF receives confirmation from the insurance company involved in the original notification that an incorrect vehicle right-off categorisation had been relayed to the NVDF.<\/p><p>There has long been agreement that this approach - being as it is entirely voluntary - is not satisfactory.  The current road safety strategy includes a commitment that the Road Safety Authority, RSA, would carry out a consultation on the matter for the good of developing policy to legislate to ensure that unsafe, written-off vehicles are taken out of circulation.  The RSA completed this consultation.  While the RSA proposals have merit they are also highly complex and would take a great deal of time and cost to implement.  They would also require a great deal of additional time and consideration to work out fully.  I decided that we could not let the matter wait any longer.<\/p><p>I, therefore, decided to address this matter now in a way which will work and which will have practical benefits.  I am not precluding further developments in future, but I am determined that we should lay the groundwork now by taking real action on this question.<\/p><p> I am proposing to place the current voluntary arrangements between the insurance industry and my Department on domestic write-offs on a statutory footing.  All insurers will be statutorily required to notify my Department of category A, irreparable and fit for scrap only, and category B, useful for viable spare parts only write-offs, so that these vehicles' records can be locked down on the NDVF and their circulation within the national fleet prevented.  It is not necessary to cater for category C and D write-offs as these vehicles are capable of being repaired and returned to use on the public road.<\/p><p> I know many people would like to take this further as I also would.  I considered and I am still considering additional measures, for example, to do with imported vehicles.  However, this is very complex and if I had gone down this road, it would have led to the inevitable and unacceptable result that yet again a road traffic Bill would have been passed without any measures to address written-off vehicles.<\/p><p> Relevant legislation is already in place in both road traffic and consumer law dealing with written-off vehicles.  It is currently an offence to drive a dangerously defective vehicle in a public place under road traffic legislation while under the Consumer Protection Act 2007, car dealers are obliged to give full disclosure of the history of second-hand vehicle to potential buyers.  Under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980, a vehicle being sold should be free from any defect that would render it a danger to the public.<\/p><p> I know Deputy Munster wants to address her own amendment on written-off vehicles.  I am glad to see that we are both on the same page with respect to this important issue.  I believe her amendment has great merit, but it is covered by the amendments we have proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#B01000","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":757,"content":"<p>I tabled amendment No. 34.

Unfortunately, driver impairment through alcohol and drug misuse is still a large contributory factor in road traffic accidents.  The list, however, of banned substances in sections 4(1A) and 5(1A) is very limited in that it only lists the main illegal drugs, namely, cannabis, cocaine and heroin.  Based on current national and international prevalence data, the drugs to be targeted initially in this Bill are cannabis, cocaine, opiates and benzodiazepines.  However, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, study, on whose recommendations this Bill is based, is heavily reliant on a 16 year-old study, Driving Under the Influence of Drugs in Ireland, Results of a Nationwide Survey 2000-2001.  In particular, the study indicated that cannabis and benzodiazepines were the most prevalent drug in driving under the influence of drug cases, followed by opiates, methadone and cocaine.<\/p><p>While it might be the case that these drugs remain the most widely used in Ireland, it is also the case that over the past 16 years, drug use in Ireland, as elsewhere, has evolved significantly.  In particular, the use of psychoactive drugs has become more prevalent in that period.  According to the EU drug markets report 2016, Irish people are the largest users of illegal psychoactive drugs in the EU.  According to the survey of people aged 15 to 24 on the highest levels of use in the past year, Ireland was at 9%, Spain and France were at 8% and Slovenia was at 7%.<\/p><p>Eight psychoactive substances are not included in the Schedule of banned substances in this Bill.  Another limitation of the Bill is that it ignores the possible misuse of legal prescription drugs which can be worse than alcohol for impaired driving.  In particular, the misuse of prescription benzodiazepines, such as Valium and Xanax, has increased significantly over the past 15 years with numbers of people seeking treatment for addiction to benzodiazepines has more than doubled since 2009, according to the Health Service Executive.  While benzodiazepines are often prescribed as sedatives for use in the treatment of anxiety disorders and insomnia, they have become increasingly common as recreational drugs.  Recent statistics show that benzodiazepines were the main problem drug of 547 people who sought treatment for substance abuse in 2012.<\/p><p>While it is recognised that the Bill cannot take a zero-tolerance approach to individuals driving after having consumed such prescription drugs, any provision which caught drivers abusing these drugs would strengthen the Bill significantly.  At the very least, there is a need for a parallel health education initiative to go with this Bill, especially to inform drivers of the dangers of driving while taking prescribed medications.  Last year in the transport committee, Professor Denis Cusack of the MBRS called for as much.  A parallel health education initiative is needed to encourage and support drivers with medical conditions to take their prescribed medications in accordance with health care advices and medical fitness to drive guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#D00700","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":790,"content":"<p>These are ambitious but understandable amendments.  The approach the Department has taken with regard to the list of specified drugs is one that has been discussed in great detail with the MBRS.  This Bill, in addressing drug driving, is not based on the MBRS report referred to by the Deputy but on more recent experience of the bureau on testing specimens for drugs and best international practice.  I have also consulted with the bureau in light of the proposed amendments to expand the list of drugs.  While I appreciate the motivation for these amendments, the bureau's advice is very much against extending the list at present.<\/p><p>There are many complications.  One of the risks is of mixing together drug intoxication and road safety matters with misuse of drugs provisions.  British legislation in this regard, similar to that proposed in the amendments, approaches the matter from a different angle.  The Road Safety Strategy action No. 77 relating to drug levels states &quot;legislate for the introduction of zero tolerance approach to illicit drug driving and impairment approach for other drugs.&quot;  This continues to be the basis for the new driving under the influence of drugs provisions.<\/p><p>The drugs included in the current Schedule are the most prevalent illicit drugs, namely, cannabis, heroin and cocaine.  The proposition of including specified limits referred to in the literature as <i>per se<\/i>levels for all the drugs in the misuse of drugs legislation would be novel when compared to other jurisdictions.  Even the UK has not gone this far.  The common approach is to select drugs known to be used by drivers, based on prevalence data.  Setting levels for all drugs is not practical for many reasons.  These include the lack of data proving impairment, selecting appropriate levels and the fact not all drugs in the misuse of drugs legislation are a concern in driving under the influence.<\/p><p>The Schedule taken from British law with the proposed limits for drugs such as benzodiazepines sets the legal levels at super therapeutic levels so as not to capture people on prescribed medications, taking medications on prescription, with the difficulty being the biovariation between individuals on such medications.  Drivers with significantly lower levels than these could be seriously impaired.  Although the old impairment offence remains, it could be argued they are driving under the legal limit for the drug and thus should not be prosecuted.  This would be an unforeseen consequence of such a change and contrary to road safety.<\/p><p>The proposal of including the table, which appears to be a copy of the section 5A annex of the England and Wales legislation, does not fit with the road safety strategy action either.  I note the proposed THC, tetrahydrocannabinol, level is higher than that in the current text of the Bill.  On the other hand, the proposed amendment would exclude cannabis acid which should be there if we are to make serious limits for that drug.  The MBRS has advised that the other illicit drugs proposed for inclusion in the amendment, ketamine, LSD, MDMA, and amphetamines, are not, in the bureau's view, significantly prevalent in Irish drivers.  The remaining drugs proposed, Nos. 10 to 17, inclusive, are all benzodiazepines, except No. 14, methadone, and are not illicit drugs although may be misused.  These are again covered by existing measures combined with impairment.<\/p><p>The bureau is committed to continue to monitor changing societal drug use.  The results, over time, may lead to adding to the drugs to be tested, which in time may be reflected in future legislation.  As a general comment, the Department did not consider it possible to set limits for certain classes of drugs which were not illicit, given the difficulty of deciding on levels at which people might be impaired, but would depend on the person's use, level of medication, length of time on medication, weight, mass, gender, etc.  The setting of limits for drugs is in the early stages of acceptance in the scientific and legal communities.  As this Bill works, we should consider expanding the number of levels and categories.  While the expansion of illicit drugs specified will be considered over time, it was considered best to begin with a small number of the most common illicit drugs in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#D00800","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":791,"content":"<p>I appreciate where the Minister is coming from.

There are some drugs that one is allowed to take and then to drive.  In terms of a test for safe limits of alcohol, the Minister is saying that those who drink three pints are safer drivers than those who have had three drops of whiskey.

For all other drugs, the position remains that the presence of a drug plus intoxication to the extent of being unable to control the vehicle is an offence already.  Under the existing impairment offence section of the 2010 Act, section 5, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, tests for seven different classes of drugs, including opiates, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines and others.  It is very difficult at this stage to say exactly what the levels will be but what we are doing, unashamedly, is starting with the ones which we actually know are the most common drugs.

I would like to clarify whether they will be imposed by way of by-law.  The arrangements for by-laws can be convoluted and until they are introduced in a composite way, they can delay the introduction of new proposals.  This can be clumsy.  For example, significant advertising must be undertaken.  There is a complex regime surrounding by-laws.  Will the Minister comment on that?<\/p> <p>  It is important that we do not give the impression that the imposition of the proposed speed limits will be automatic because there would then be an expectation that they will apply to every housing estate.  People will be disappointed if that does not happen.  The proposal lets designers off the hook.  Garda&iacute; cannot be deployed in every location to enforce speed limits and, therefore, roads have to be designed to a particular standard.  There must be self-enforcing measures, particularly when designing new housing estates, which will achieve the proposed speed limits in order that we do not make the same mistakes again.  Good design means that the motorist cannot see and must slow down on particular bends, for example.  It is important that there should be dialogue between the Department and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to make sure a standard is built into the design of housing estates to achieve speed limits without enforcement.  Will the Minister indicate how they will be applied?<\/p> <p>  If it is intended to reduce speed limits and, at some point in the future, revert to the original speed limit, does the Bill permit that?

I come from a local authority background and the process of introducing by-laws is lengthy.  Given the legalities and paperwork, many county managers prefer to pool all the by-laws into one book and, therefore, the proposed speed limits could take a few years to introduce.  There will be a rash of applications to reduce the speed limit on housing estates to 20 km\/h.  Will the legislation fast-track them?  Could individual municipal districts legally alter speed limits?  Obviously, they will have to consult the Garda.<\/p> <p>  The legislation will have major implications for the position of speed signs.  For example, if a crash occurs, there will be questions about whether it occurred inside or outside the speed limit zone if a sign is moved, and about where one defines the entry to an estate from another controlled speed limit zone.  When a motorist enters a village or a town, he or she usually enters a 50 km\/h zone but the speed limit will change when he or she enters an estate.  There will be a legal quagmire in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#G00200","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":848,"content":"<p>I will address the questions first and then the amendments.  Deputy Munster asked about the definition.  It is being examined by the Attorney General.  It is a bit of a problem.  We have a problem with her definition because it is more difficult than we anticipated to define a \"housing estate\".  Apparently, it could be interpreted to include five houses alongside a dual carriageway.  We, therefore, have a difficulty, which is an ongoing problem that we are addressing.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Deputy Murphy's questions.  The speed limit will be introduced by way of by-law.  I accept her point about the process being convoluted and about delays but the proposal must go through the prescribed public consultation process.  Sometimes, that causes a delay but it is thorough.  Traffic calming is a matter for the local authority.  She is correct that the speed limit will not be introduced automatically.  It is up to the local authority.  Her comments about the design of roads and self-enforcement are probably outside the scope of the Bill.  It is a long-term issue and she is correct that housing estate design should be considered, particularly in the context of speed, and that applies to current estates.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the amendments, I accept there is a need to control the speed of vehicles in residential areas.  I am not opposed to the principle of making provision in legislation for the application of a 20 km\/h speed limit.  I also wish to ensure the right to apply appropriate speed limits on regional and local roads continues to rest with local authorities.  A major practical difficulty with the amendments in respect of a mandatory centrally imposed default speed limit of 20 km\/h or 30 km\/h relates to the designation of what constitutes a housing estate or, indeed, a residential road within a housing estate.  Throughout the country, there is a vast variety of estates of different types, size, configuration, location and population which no single legal definition, including this one, can satisfactorily encapsulate.  Many roads in our cities and towns, while having houses located on them, are also substantial routes for traffic, including, but not limited to, rush hour or commuting times.  Examples of such include James's Street on the south side and Church Street on the north side of Dublin.  How would the proposed definitions apply to such areas?<\/p> <p>  I am supportive of the Deputy's intention but I do not favour default 20 km\/h or 30 km\/h speed limits as proposed.  By the nature of their definition, they are too discriminatory and do not cover all envisaged residential development scenarios.  Elected councillors supported by expert advice from local authority road engineers have statutory responsibility for evaluating varying local conditions and are best placed to decide on the most appropriate special speed limit by-laws and associated traffic calming measures that should apply to any particular road, including residential, under their remit.<\/p><p>My Department's guidelines for setting and managing speed limits reiterate these responsibilities and provide guidance on such.  These guidelines encourage the use by local authorities of the special speed limit of 30 km\/h in residential areas, accompanied by the introduction of appropriate signage.  Other publications such as the traffic management guidelines and the design manual for urban roads and streets also detail the options available to local authorities to facilitate traffic-calming measures and promote reduced vehicle speeds in housing estates and residential areas through modifications to the built environment, modifying road design with traffic islands, interrupted sight lines, pavement displacements, etc., an approach which is equally as important as setting an appropriate residential speed limit.  This addresses Deputy Catherine Murphy's point.<\/p><p> Regarding the provision of a 20 km\/h special speed limit, I have, in addition to the existing 30 km\/h special speed limit available to elected local authority councillors, already made provision for the lower 20 km\/h limit in the Bill.  Once the Bill is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, local authorities will have the option to impose 20 km\/h special speed limit by-laws in respect of roads for which such a limit is deemed necessary.  My Department continues to support local authorities in implementing speed-reduction measures in residential areas by providing, through the aforementioned publications, detailed advice on the application of special speed limits and appropriate traffic-calming engineering measures, as well as dedicated funding for the provision of appropriate signage in residential areas.<\/p><p> One of the issues of concern raised by the Jake's Legacy campaign relates to the absence of legal powers for local authorities to apply speed limits in residential areas where the relevant roads have not been taken in charge by the authorities.  My officials are exploring such a lack of powers with the Attorney General's office to see if a solution can be found that would be suitable for future legislation.<\/p><p> I met the Jake's Legacy group on one occasion.  Members of the Oireachtas, my Department and others have responded to this tragedy and to the very worthy campaign in a fairly proactive manner.  Some of the measures taken in the Bill are a direct response to that campaign and the tragedy to which it relates.  This is one of those measures.  It is being put in place in the hope that such events can be prevented and in response to something very traumatic which has happened.  That is why the measure is included in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#G00300","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":850,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to consider at some point the issue of by-laws and partial reviews as opposed to full reviews.

It is very frustrating because it delays matters around which there should be flexibility.  I can see the point in providing the flexibility in the Bill for the individual local authorities to consider specific proposals as opposed to a generalised approach.  This probably overcomes the issue of the definition to some degree.  It permits lower speed limits where they have not previously been permitted.  The typical answer of local authorities has been that they were not legally allowed to apply lower speed limits.  That is a valid finding in the report.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the estates not taken in charge, the current situation in which the extension of duration is permitted to a planning permission can mean that people cannot petition to have their housing estate taken in charge for up to 17 years after planning permission has been granted.  These are often the very estates in which there are large numbers of young children.  Why would it not be legally permissible to have speed limits applied to estates that are not taken in charge?

I suppose the question of by-laws is a problem in that they operate in a kind of one-size-fits-all manner.  I have some sympathy for local authorities in that regard.  We must give them the flexibility because what suits one estate does not suit another and the application of an overall 20 km\/h limit would be dangerous.  I share the Deputy's frustration about the delays.  However, if such thorough procedures are not in place, there will be complaints on the other side that there has been no thorough procedure, so I would prefer to leave it the way it is.  This is a big step.  It gives local authorities a lot of power.  It will be interesting to see how they exercise it.  It is probably right that we give them the power but we will review how they exercise.  I am of the view that they should do exercise it fairly ruthlessly, given, as the Deputy noted, that the only real priority is the safety of the children who live in these estates.

As other Deputies have said, there is also the reluctance of local authorities in not being to the fore or acting swiftly enough sometimes on speed limits and by-laws.

I am proposing a number of technical amendments here to Part 3 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.<\/p> <p>  Part 3 of the 2010 Act replaces the existing legislation for fixed charge offences and in particular provides for the so-called \"third payment option\", with which everybody is familiar.  At present, motorists who receive a fixed charge notice have 28 days in which to pay the charge and if they do not, a further 28 days in which to pay the charge plus 50%.  If they have not paid at that point, court proceedings would be initiated.  The third payment option adds to this system a notice issued with the summons to court allowing the person to pay the original charge plus 100% not later than seven days before the due date of court proceedings.  If they do so the court proceedings are discontinued.  The operation of the third payment option will reduce the burden on courts and will also end the practice of motorists going to court and claiming that they never received a fixed charge notice.<\/p> <p>  For the new system to be brought into effect, we need to make a number of changes to the 2010 Act.  First, we have to ensure that the first fixed charge notice sets out in its entirety the procedure concerned up to and including the third payment option.  Currently, the legislation does not provide for this.  Second, we need to make changes to account for a clarification in policy to state that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and not the Court Service, will be issuing the summon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#J04200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":905,"content":"<p>Amendment

It was always my intention that the vehicle registration number would be provided but it has been drawn to my attention that the phrase \"unique identification mark\" could be interpreted as either the registration number or the vehicle identification number.  I am now proposing to change the wording to remove the ambiguity.  The current list of details to be provided by insurers consists of six items labelled (a) to (f).  I am proposing to add a seventh, namely, the licence or learner permit number of the policyholder and any named drivers.  This is a crucial piece of information in ensuring that records provided by insurers can be matched correctly to drivers.  As a consequence of this amendment, I am also proposing to remove the word \"and\" from the end of subsection (e) and add it to the end of subsection (f).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#K00500","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":923,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":924,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 30:<\/p><blockquote>In page 16, line 6, to delete &quot;and&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#K00700","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":925,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":926,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 31:<\/p><blockquote>In page 16, line 8, to delete &quot;policy.&quot;.&quot; and substitute &quot;policy, and&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#K00900","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":927,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":928,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 32:<\/p><blockquote>In page 16, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:&quot;(g) the licence number, or permit number, of the driving licence, or learner permit, of the holder of a motor insurance policy and of any named driver whose driving is covered under the policy.&quot;.&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#K01100","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":929,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":930,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 33 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":931,"content":"<p>Section 19, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":932,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 34 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":933,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":934,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 35, 41 and 42 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#K01700","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":935,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 35:<\/p><blockquote>In page 16, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:<b>&quot;Regulation of Rickshaws<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>20.<\/b>The Taxi Regulation Act 2013, is amended in section 20, by the insertion of the following subsection:<blockquote>&quot;(5) (i) The Authority may make regulations, to be known as non-motorised passenger transport regulations, in relation to the operation of non-motorised passenger transporters in towns and cities.<blockquote>(ii) &lsquo;non-motorised passenger transporters&rsquo; means hackney carriage or rickshaw propelled by pedal cycle, pedal tricycle, horse, pedestrian or other such non-motorised means.&quot;.&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>We are all aware of the issue and the lack of regulation or legislation around rickshaws, particularly in cities.

I will summarise the two amendments we have put down on the regulation of rickshaws.  No agency currently has the authority to regulate rickshaws.  The NTA, which regulates small public service vehicles such as taxis or hackneys, cannot regulate them because a public service vehicle is defined as one which is mechanically propelled.  The Minister provided feedback on his Department and Dublin City Council and set out that local authorities do not feel they have the authority to regulate or license rickshaws because they are not pedal-powered vehicles.  This is aside from the other issues in relation to pay rates and lighting of vehicles, never mind their licensing.  While Dublin City Council made draft by-laws to regulate rickshaws in 2013, these were withdrawn on legal advice.  This is because the great majority of rickshaws are neither pedal-powered or mechanically-propelled, rather they are battery-assisted.  This means that under current legislative definitions, they are not small public service vehicles or taxis, which are defined as mechanically-propelled vehicles.  Hence, the National Transport Authority is not authorised to regulate them.<\/p> <p>  The amendments we are putting forward, in addition to those tabled by Deputy Munster, alter the definition of \"small public service vehicle\" to include battery-powered, pedal-powered and non-mechanically powered vehicles and seek to create a new category of public service vehicle now to be called \"public service rickshaws\".  This includes all rickshaws including mechanically-powered, manually-powered and cycle-rickshaws.  This would clean up the legal lacuna the Minister has mentioned and would mean the NTA would become the authorised body for regulating rickshaws nationally.  The amendments also oblige the NTA to make certain regulations in respect of rickshaws.  These include that rickshaws must be licensed, that drivers can be subject to background checks and that vehicles can be inspected for roadworthiness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#L00100","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":940,"content":"<p>The Minister has indicated that he wants to do this through primary legislation and this is primary legislation.

There is a certain amount of concern, which I share.  I will not include provisions in this Bill because of some questions that need to be answered.  It needs time.  I refer to the legal definition of \"vehicle\", who will test the safety of vehicles, whether there will be licences as with taxis, how the fares will be set and by whom, who will regulate fares and issues around the regulation of drivers.  All those issues are being discussed by the NTA and Dublin City Council.  I could say I will include provisions now but that would delay the Bill.  That is the reality.  However, I will get on to the NTA and Dublin City Council before Report Stage and come back to Deputies to say what is happening and proposed in more detail.  To be fair, I have not given them nearly enough detail here.  Primary legislation will be required and that legislation must be sound.  I do not want to rush it and have a flaw there.  I will report back to Deputies because I acknowledge that this is a problem and that we will have to regulate.  Perhaps the issue needs an injection of urgency.

It has been an offence since 2006 to hold a mobile phone while driving.  Regulations were introduced in May 2014 by the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, which prohibited texting from hands-free mobile phones, for example, mobile phones held in a cradle on the dashboard.  This addressed a loophole which had allowed people to text while driving as long as they were not holding the mobile phone.  The penalty in this case is a fine not exceeding &euro;2,000 on summary conviction.  In-car technology and communications equipment is evolving rapidly.  In some instances the technology is increasing road safety.  However, we still face a huge problem in the number of people who continue to use mobile phones while driving.  I have been informed by the Attorney General's office that this year to date 22,170 people have been caught driving while using a mobile phone.  I will be monitoring this issue with a view to making changes in policy, as necessary.  I will be interested to see whether the increase in penalty points in the United Kingdom to six on conviction for driving while using a mobile phone has an impact in changing driver behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#M02100","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":971,"content":"<p>Is the Minister saying the issue which I am seeking to address in the amendment, namely, the use of a mobile phone held in a cradle by the steering wheel, etc, is covered by existing legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#M02200","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":972,"content":"<p>Yes; it has been an offence since 2006 to use a mobile phone while driving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#M02300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":973,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":974,"content":"<p>Section 22 deleted.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":975,"content":"<p>Section 23 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":976,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":977,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 39 and 52 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#M02800","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":978,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 39:<\/p><blockquote>In page 18, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;Amendment of section 4 of Vehicle Clamping Act 2015<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>24. <\/b>Section 4 of the Vehicle Clamping Act 2015 is amended&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(a) by substituting the following for subsection (1):<blockquote>&ldquo;(1) Before making regulations under this Act (other than under section 15)the NTA shall&mdash;<blockquote>(a) consult with the Minister, and where the proposed regulations relate to a statutory clamping place, the body having responsibility for that place,<br \/><br \/>(b) publish a notice in at least one national newspaper circulating in the State and on its website&mdash;<blockquote>(i) indicating that it proposes to make regulations under this Act,<br \/><br \/>(ii) indicating that a copy of the proposed regulations is available for inspection at the NTA offices specified in the notice and on its website for a specified period (being not less than 30 days), and<br \/><br \/>(iii) stating that representations concerning the proposed regulations may be made in writing before a specified date (which shall be not less than 14 days after the end of the period for inspection), and<\/blockquote>(c) consider any representations received pursuant to paragraph (b).&rdquo;.<br \/><br \/>and<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>(b) in subsection (4), by deleting &ldquo;(1)(b) or&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#M02900","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":979,"content":"<p>Section 24 relates to the Vehicle Clamping Act, in which a gap was identified in the reply to me to a parliamentary question.<\/p><p>I have a big problem with clamping on private open space.

The NTA will do that.  The changes proposed in amendment No. 39 are technical amendments to section 4 of the Vehicle Clamping Act 2015 and are designed to correct an error in the Act.  The Act has implications for the regulation of clamping activities wherever they are operated and, upon commencement, the NTA will assume the function of regulating clamping activities in relevant clamping places in accordance with the Act.<\/p> <p>  A number of Deputies have made inquiries about the Act's commencement in recent months.  The NTA required a period of time to recruit a small number of additional staff and to put in place the necessary back-up support to ensure the reasonable operation of its new duties under the Act.  That period is now complete and during final discussions with the Department in recent weeks regarding commencement of the Act, it was noticed that section 4(1)(b) required the NTA to publish in full a draft of any proposed regulations in a national newspaper as well as on its website.  The requirement would result in possibly 20 or more pages of draft regulations being printed in a national newspaper, which would not only look very unusual but would also cost a considerable and totally unnecessary amount of money.  Such a requirement on publication is not what is required in similar and analogous cases.  My intention, therefore, is to amend the Act to bring this publication and consultation provision into line with those used elsewhere.  The amendments will require the NTA to publish in full any draft regulations on its website and then publish a notice of the draft regulations in a national newspaper.  This is in line with the requirements elsewhere in other similar legislative measures.  During the consultation period the NTA will also be required to make available for inspection a copy of the draft regulations in its office as well as on its website.  The NTA will still be required by other provisions in the original Act to consider any representations it receives in response to any such consultation.<\/p> <p>  These amendments will allow for the speedy commencement of the Act, which many people have called for.  As amendment No. 39 amends the Vehicle Clamping Act 2015, it is necessary to amend the long Title to this Bill to reflect this.

He also said it was important to reflect on the question of how many unaccompanied learner drivers are on the roads of Ireland on any given day and how many parents and family members allow their cars to be driven by these drivers.

When I saw that case reported on the news the night it happened I rang the head of the Road Safety Authority and asked what the situation was and whether legislation should be introduced to remedy the awful problem highlighted by the Clancy family.  She agreed that it definitely should be addressed.  Strengthening the law with regard to unaccompanied learner permit holders is something I have asked my officials to examine in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, whose advice will have to be sought as to the barriers to introducing such an offence on the registered owner of a vehicle.  My officials will also liaise with the Garda as to the enforceability of such a proposal.<\/p> <p>  It is a serious problem.  We do not know the extent of it but the fact that it had to be highlighted by a death and a court case such as this is unacceptable.  A learner permit holder who is driving when unaccompanied is not meeting one of the key conditions attached to their permit and therefore is driving unlicensed.  This is already an offence which carries three penalty points on payment of a fixed charge notice and five penalty points on conviction in court.  Furthermore, the cost of insurance working group, chaired by Deputy Eoghan Murphy and in which the Department is a participant, will introduce measures to deal with unaccompanied driving.  I understand that its report will be finalised and presented to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, before the end of the year.  That is the insurance aspect.

The idea has merit and my officials will also liaise with garda&iacute; about the enforceability of such a proposal.  It is a little more complicated than it looks and it has a lot of implications.  There may be a more direct way of dealing with it, such as giving garda&iacute; powers to seize and detain a vehicle.  Legal advice is necessary and perhaps the Deputy, along with Deputy Ryan, can come back to this on Report Stage, which is planned for next week.  A learner permit holder who drives while unaccompanied does not meet one of the key conditions attached to their permit and is, therefore, driving unlicensed.  It is already an offence which carries three penalty points on payment of a fixed charge and five penalty points on conviction in court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#O01700","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":1008,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480498200,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>SECTION 25<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":1010,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 45 to 49, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#O01900","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 45:<\/p><blockquote>In page 18, line 37, after &ldquo;residence&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;on the date of the offence&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2016113000002#O02000","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1480498200,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>Is there a European dimension to the legislation relating to co-operation of this kind?
