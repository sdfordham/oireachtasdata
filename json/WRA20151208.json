The purpose of the reintroduction project was to bring back eagles to Ireland, restoring a species that had been persecuted in the late 19th   Century. The golden eagle was present in Glenveagh until 1910.<\/p>  <p>  Experts on eagles in Scotland visited Glenveagh, by then a National Park, in the 1990s, and considered that the habitats in north Donegal were suitable for a reintroduction programme.  61 birds, sourced as chicks in Scotland, were released in Glenveagh between 2001 and 2012.  The original plan was to release 75 birds over five years but it became increasingly difficult to find suitable donor stock in Scotland, resulting in fewer releases over a longer time span than originally planned.<\/p>  <p>  Using data from radio and satellite tags and wing tags fitted to the released birds, it was established that some birds moved around Ireland and some even returned to Scotland. Some birds are known to have died of natural causes but 3 of the 10 satellite-tagged birds were poisoned, two in Donegal and one in Northern Ireland. My Department produces annual reports on all known cases of mortality and persecution of birds of prey.<\/p>  <p>  The re-introduced eagles have nested over a number of years, and in 2014 and 2015 there were 3 known nests. However, breeding success has not been as good as anticipated. Sometimes, as is the case in 2015, this may be due to adverse weather at critical stages during nesting.

A total of 12,787 reports were dealt with by the Department&rsquo;s Control Division from January - October 2015.  <\/p><p>There are no plans to undertake a national print media advertising campaign encouraging members of the public to report social welfare fraud at this time.  It should be borne in mind that there is often a perception of fraud however when a case is examined the individual may be doing something that is allowed under the rules for the particular payment that they are in receipt of e.g. working and receiving a OPF payment provided earnings are within the limits and the Department is aware of the situation is legitimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800059#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Fraud Data","counter":166,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800059#WRC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":167,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[43571\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800059#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons prosecuted for social welfare fraud in each of the years 2013 to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":168,"content":"<p>It is the Department's policy to consider for prosecution cases of fraud against the social welfare system.

The provision for 2015 represents a transfer of funding in excess of &euro;20 million to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to support the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). <\/p>  <p>  A review of the rent limits undertaken earlier this year found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients. Analysis shows that increasing the current rent limits nationwide by 5% would result in a full year cost in excess of &euro;15 million; a 10% increase would carry a cost of almost &euro;32 million, with a 15% increase costing approximately &euro;51 million. A breakdown of this cost on a county basis is not available; however, as an approximation, the costs to apply such an increase in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford regions, would account for approximately 70% of the total share of increased costs for the scheme. Though the costing model accurately reflects the increased cost for the scheme, the likelihood is that increased supply would not be achieved as the market would adjust to the revised rent limits.  <\/p>  <p>  Rather than increasing limits at this time rent supplement policy will continue to allow for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of current limits. Flexibility is provided under the National Framework for Tenancy Sustainment for both existing customers of the scheme and new applicants. As part of this flexible approach the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues have been particularly acute. Plans are actively underway to extend this Protocol to Galway City.   This approach has assisted over 5,400 households nationwide to retain their rented accommodation through increased rent payments. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that these measures and the reforms to the private rental sector announced in November will provide increased certainty for both tenants and landlords in the current market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800059#WRC05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living Alone Allowance","counter":190,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800059#WRC05900"},{"type":"question","counter":191,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[43745\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800059#WRC06000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the cost of increasing the living alone allowance to &euro;15 and to &euro;20; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":192,"content":"<p>The cost of increasing the Living Alone Allowance to &euro;15 and &euro;20 per week is &euro;60.5 million and &euro;110.8 million, respectively, in a full year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800059#WRC06100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Schemes","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800059#WRC06200"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[43746\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800059#WRC06300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the saving she has achieved from the abolition of the telephone allowance in 2015 to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>The overall concern of Government in its Budgets has been to protect the primary social welfare rates. Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.675 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2015, representing approx. 34.4% of overall expenditure. Because of demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year. The Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;168 million in 2015 for the increasing number of pensioners. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. <\/p>  <p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was estimated to provide annual savings of &euro;48 million, and with the year-on-year increase in the number of people qualifying for the household benefits package, this yearly saving will increase. These savings meant that the Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. The Department will spend approx. &euro;227 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 416,000 customers. <\/p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and I have sought to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way. In Budget 2016, I was able to announce the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years, by &euro;3 per week.

The electricity and gas allowance is currently &euro;35 per month.  There have been no reductions to this allowance in recent budgets.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full. <\/p>  <p>  Changes were made to the household benefits package and fuel scheme during 2011. These changes were provided for in Budget 2011, which was introduced by the previous Government, but details were not specified at the time.  The number of free units provided under the electricity and gas allowance was reduced to the level at the start of 2007 (from 2,400 to 1,800).  This change was effective from September 2011. Estimated savings for this measure at that time were &euro;29.8 million per year.

Funding is provided in the form of a financial contribution for the employment of staff to deliver the service.  The CSP became operational in 2006 absorbing a previous programme operated by F&Aacute;S including a grant structure linked to the minimum wage.  Any such link is historic given that many current contracts have been in place for at least nine years and the wage levels in service providers have increased.  The grant structure was remodelled in 2009\/10 in response to the financial crisis with the value of the full-time equivalent wage element maintained at &euro;19,033 per annum only.  The programme has never provided full funding for wages.  The rules of the programme require service providers to pay the local rate for equivalent employment, which is generally well in excess of minimum wage levels.  Contracts of up to three years duration are available to service providers that continue to deliver needed services and demonstrate an ability to generate and maintain income from other sources for the services delivered. <\/p><p>The level of grant support available from the CSP contributes no more than a third of aggregate turnover of the community companies in contract.  It has been at all time clear that the CSP represents a contribution only to the cost of employment. The service providers undertake to generate additional revenue from the services they deliver to support the adequate remuneration of staff employed and to provide for overhead, operational and future development costs.Pobal is engaged by the Department to provide contract management and financial oversight and compliance services.  Currently, the value of CSP contracts is just under &euro;42 million providing a contribution to 2,111.5 full time equivalent positions.  The Department estimates that 2,800 people are directly supported in employment by the CSP contribution when part-time work is taken into consideration.  An estimated 300-500 additional employees are supported indirectly from income generated from activities and other public resources provided to the companies.<\/p><p><b>TABLE<\/b><\/p><p><b>CSP CONTRACT VALUES &amp;amp; NUMBER OF EMPLOYEE APPROVED FOR FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION - 2015<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Contract Value in 2015 &euro;<\/th><th>Number of employee supported*<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>460,006<\/td><td>29.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>593,474<\/td><td>30.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>1,235,233<\/td><td>103.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>2,442,724<\/td><td>142.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>3,099,650<\/td><td>143<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>8,461,604<\/td><td>403<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>1,997,959<\/td><td>89.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>2,170,212<\/td><td>111.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>429,078<\/td><td>20.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>371,979<\/td><td>17.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>343,429<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>1,355,167<\/td><td>62.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>1,156,035<\/td><td>54.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>480,660<\/td><td>23<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>1,350,046<\/td><td>67<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>3,419,506<\/td><td>180<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>928,221<\/td><td>44<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>1,074,419<\/td><td>51<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>1,109,870<\/td><td>51.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>2,200,322<\/td><td>102.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>661,309<\/td><td>30.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>688,858<\/td><td>37.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>712,924<\/td><td>34<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>1,110,419<\/td><td>53<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>2,281,026<\/td><td>126.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>1,829,508<\/td><td>87<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>41,963,638<\/td><td>2111.5<\/td><\/tr><\/table>* Includes contribution to manager position, if employed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800060#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Eligibility","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800060#WRD00450"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[43766\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800060#WRD00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a person (details supplied) in County Kildare who is claiming a social protection payment for 389 and not 390 days can be entitled to the Christmas bonus; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>A bonus of 75% of the normal weekly payment was paid in December 2015 to people getting a long-term social welfare payment.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement. Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. <\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties. The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for SPC also being satisfied. <\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support. If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them. Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has no plans to backdate this scheme prior to 1994 as the costs would be significant. In addition, under the current rules, the costs of the scheme are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994. <\/p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;. Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received. It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation. The position of women who were homemakers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800060#WRD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Operation","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800060#WRD03150"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[44007\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800060#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of a community employment scheme (details supplied) in County Cork; if she will review the situation, given the invaluable contribution this project makes to the community; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>The service provider to which this question relates has held a contact with the community services programme (CSP) to support the operation of a community facility and to operate a telephone, home visiting and handyman service to elderly residents in the surrounding parishes.

NAMA will in this way make an important contribution, on a strictly commercial basis, to increased supply over the coming years and will be\u00a0part of the overall housing solution, although only one part of the solution.\u00a0  <\/p>  <p>  NAMA debtors and receivers control\u00a0about 30% of zoned residential sites in the Dublin area.  Accordingly, market participants who control the other 70% of the sites also have a major role to play in\u00a0addressing the supply\/demand imbalance in the years ahead.<\/p>  <p>  This\u00a0Government is examining what role it can play in supporting increased output by the wider development sector and in particular is examining how to address infrastructure deficits that are holding up the supply of commercially viable new housing in the main urban growth centres.<\/p>  <p>  I am encouraged by the increasingly visible activity of other market participants\u00a0as demonstrated by the recent announcement by Cairn Homes that\u00a0their successful acquisition of Ulster Bank's Project Clear portfolio\u00a0will provide them with the\u00a0opportunity to build over 14,000 new homes, with an expected net development value of in excess of &euro;2 billion. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy rightly identifies increased social housing provision as a priority for Government.  That priority is reflected in the housing package announced recently by Minister Alan Kelly and in the substantial increases in direct Exchequer funding for social housing over the lifetime of this Government.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out that NAMA cannot subvent the supply of social housing.  Section 10 of the NAMA Act requires NAMA to act in a commercial manner to obtain the best financial return for taxpayers.  In line with NAMA's obligations under Section 10, all residential projects will be required to pass a stringent commercial viability threshold before NAMA approves funding and funding\u00a0will\u00a0only be made available if it is expected to\u00a0increase the overall recovery for NAMA\u00a0from the security being funded.  NAMA must act akin to a private sector commercial entity.<\/p>  <p>  NAMA has, however, already played a very important role in facilitating on a commercial basis the supply of houses and apartments for social housing from within its existing portfolio.  By the end of this year, NAMA will have facilitated the supply of 2,000 houses and apartments for social housing through its debtors and receivers.  This equates to more than one-third of total social housing provision under Part V (Social Housing) legislation in the years between 2002 and 2011.  It should also be noted that NAMA originally made over 6,500 houses and apartments available for social housing under this commercial initiative but local authorities confirmed demand for just over 2,500 of these.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, NAMA's\u00a0contribution to the housing market and, by association, social housing, is certainly both timely and welcome.  The core housing issue that we currently face is that of insufficient supply.  It is only by substantially increasing housing supply, particularly in the greater Dublin area, that we can deliver a sustainable solution to the current housing situation.  By increasing the level of housing output, we will increase the affordability of housing generally, which in turn will have a positive effect on our ability to provide social housing. <\/p>  <p>  NAMA continues to be mindful of commercially attractive opportunities in the social housing sector.  However, the reality is that current social housing delivery models require direct Exchequer subvention.  The Government is\u00a0fully committed to delivering on our Social Housing 2020 strategy, which will provide 35,000 new social housing units at a cost of &euro;3.8 billion over the period to 2020. <\/p>  <p>  We are also combining these long terms measures with interim solutions to deal with the immediate issues that families currently face.  This is why Budget 2016 increased the current allocation for social housing by &euro;69 million to &euro;414 million.  This will enable local authorities to secure accommodation for an additional 14,000 households. <\/p>  <p>  Under\u00a0the Government's 6 year capital investment framework,\u00a0\"Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021\", which was recently announced by Minister Howlin, the current allocation for emergency accommodation for the homeless, has been increased by &euro;17 million.  This increase will bring Exchequer support to &euro;70 million, which\u00a0amounts to a 56% increase\u00a0since last year.  This injection of funding\u00a0will help the homeless\u00a0transition to long term sustainable housing.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also recently agreed on a package of measures designed to give certainty to tenants in relation to their rent, to better protect tenants in their homes and to provide clarity to both tenants and landlords as regards their rights and obligations.  The primary measure in this package is the amendment of the Residential Tenancies Act so that rent reviews for all tenancies will take place every 24 months, rather than every 12 months as currently is the case.  This will provide tenants with a longer period of predictable rent. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, addressing the\u00a0issues facing\u00a0the\u00a0housing market generally, social housing, and\u00a0homelessness, particularly among families,\u00a0are clearly key priorities for this Government.  The above\u00a0measures are tangible evidence of our commitment to tackle those issues head on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800062#WRF02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":353,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800062#WRF02400"},{"type":"question","counter":354,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[44208\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800062#WRF02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the additional revenue that would be generated if the band A9 vehicle registration tax rate was increased from 30% to 33.5%, if the band A10 rate was increased from 34% to 38.5%, and the band A11 rate was increased from 36% to 43%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":355,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that additional revenue of &euro;4 million is estimated to be generated in a year from introducing the proposed rates of VRT for Categories E, F, and G, assuming\u00a0a similar pattern of new and used car registrations in 2016 as in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In the first eleven months of 2015 these categories accounted for 0.7% of the new car registrations and 6.5% of the used car registrations which are liable to VRT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800062#WRF02600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[44209\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800062#WRF02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the additional revenue that would be generated from a reduction of the pension fund allowance for tax purposes on retirement from &euro;2 million to &euro;0.95 million; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>I assume that the Deputy's reference to a pension fund allowance is meant to refer to the Standard Fund Threshold or SFT.

To this end I established a Social Clauses Project Group in 2014, led by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) to proactively look at public contracts where social clauses could be deployed to contribute to employment or training opportunities for long term unemployed.  The objectives of this project group are: <\/p>  <p>  -\tthe identification of suitable policy priorities to be addressed through the insertion of social clauses in public contracts;<\/p>  <p>  -\tthe provision of guidance in relation to suitable candidate project types and spend areas;<\/p>  <p>  -\tidentification of suitable contract clauses developed in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's Office; and,<\/p>  <p>  -\tthe design of a monitoring and reporting framework which can be applied to future projects where social clauses are to be used. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to adopt a targeted approach to the use of community benefit clauses on contracts where employers are likely to be hiring additional workers to deliver the contract.  This is likely to mitigate the risk of displacing workers already in employment while offering the opportunity of assisting with labour activation measures for the long-term unemployed.<\/p>  <p>  Two examples of this approach currently in progress are the Grangegorman Development and Devolved Schools Build Programme.  In relation to the latter, a clause has been included in the Public Works contracts which require that<\/p>  <p>  -\t10% of the aggregate time worked on site to have been undertaken by individuals who have been registered on a national unemployment register within the EU for a continuous period of at least 12 months immediately prior to their employment on the project.<\/p>  <p>  -\t2.5% of the aggregate time worked on site to have been undertaken by individuals who are employed under a registered scheme of apprenticeship or other similar national, accredited training or educational work placement arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  Experience of this pilot have been positive.  It is important to learn from such practical experience of where community benefit clauses are utilised.  This is a complex area.  It is important to develop a robust structure that will assist the contracting authority to develop the correct clause and to provide the support from the appropriate agency to aid the company in implementing the clause.  I have instructed the OGP to report on this issue and to issue practical guidance designed to assist Contracting Authorities to carry out this important role in a consistent manner.  I expect both the report and guidance to issue shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800062#WRF06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":401,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[44021\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of occasions to date that a social clause has been attached to a public contract, and the project to which each has been attached to, in tabular form.","asker":"1080","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[44023\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"to provide the text of each of the social clauses attached to a public contract to date.","asker":"1080","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":403,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 and 189 together.<\/p><p>The consideration of social clauses is a matter for each contracting authority as they are best placed to gauge to appropriate clause for each contract.

Therefore the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the use of social clauses and the wording of each social clause is not available as such information is not collected centrally. <\/p><p>As part of the reform of the public procurement function the Office of Government Procurement has initiated measures to make it easier for contracting authorities to carry out public procurement in a consistent manner. One such measure was the introduction of standard procurement template documents that are used throughout the public service. These template documents make it easier for suppliers particularly SMEs to take advantage of public procurement opportunities. In relation to Social Clauses these template documents already provide for the inclusion of clauses in a number of wider policy areas that would include the following:<\/p><p>- Taxation and Social insurance payments<\/p><p>- Employment legislation<\/p><p>- Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005<\/p><p>- Waste management<\/p><p>- Human Rights<\/p><p>- Environmental legislation<\/p><p>Government recognises the valuable contribution that a vibrant construction sector makes to the economic and social well-being of the State and has introduced a range of measures as set out in Construction 2020A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector.

However, there has been no interest in the building due to a number of factors including the state of repair of the building, and the fact that IDA Ireland cannot offer a prospective client vacant possession.<\/p>  <p>  The Agency has assured me that they are addressing these issues, and as such are not in a position to consider making this site available to the Local Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Schemes","counter":415,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG01050"},{"type":"question","counter":416,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[43564\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the ten projects selected for the &euro;500,000 competitive start fund to encourage enterprise and the diaspora to set up here, when the successful applicants will start these enterprises and in what location; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":417,"content":"<p>Targeting start-ups and early stage companies that have the capability to succeed in global markets, the objective of this call was to attract international entrepreneurs and members of the Irish diaspora to start, scale and succeed from Ireland, ultimately creating jobs in Ireland.

There are 12 IDA Ireland client companies, employing 1,874 people in the county. Companies supported by IDA Ireland in Kerry added 361 additional new jobs between 2011&ndash;2014 compared to 502 job losses in the period 2008 &ndash; 2010.  It should be noted that 70% of new IDA jobs come from existing client companies, not from new investments.As part of its efforts to market Ireland and its different business locations, IDA Ireland continues to explore marketing opportunities based on the key criteria used by companies to assess different locations. In relation to County Kerry, IDA Ireland is actively exploring the potential of different digital marketing initiatives.  The agency is also keen to work in partnership with other stakeholders in the delivery of effective marketing of Kerry as a location for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). In this regard, a number of stakeholders, not limited to IDA Ireland have an active role to play in making this happen.<\/p><p>Marketing of any regional area, including Kerry, for FDI is done through IDA Ireland&rsquo;s network of overseas offices.  IDA Ireland actively incentivises and encourages investors to consider a range of potential locations in Ireland although the ultimate locations selected are always decided<font color=\"#5F5F5F\"> <\/font>by the companies themselves.<\/p><p>IDA Ireland launched its new five-year strategy entitled <i>Winning &ndash; Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019<\/i>in April of this year. The strategy has a strong focus on regional development, setting forth aims and strategies to achieve a significant increase in investment going into regional locations. To support that aim, IDA Ireland is rolling out a &euro;150million capital investment programme to help attract more multinational jobs into each region over a 5-year period. This programme will include investments over the coming years in building advanced technology buildings and office facilities in a number of regional locations to provide state-of-the-art property solutions for clients.  Tralee is to be the site of one such advanced technology building.<\/p><p>Finally, a further boost to the county is the reinstatement of Regional Aid for Co. Kerry under the new Regional Aid Guidelines, which came into force on 1July, 2014. The RAGs enable the State to grant State Aid, at enhanced rates, to businesses in order to support new investment and new employment in productive projects in Ireland's most disadvantaged regions. The funding for this comes from the Exchequer. This means that the full range of Regional Aid assistance options are available in Kerry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":436,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG02450"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[43743\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG02500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views that there would be cost implications for the Exchequer from ending age-related compulsory retirement in the private sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":438,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[43744\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG02600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on the impact of ending age-related compulsory retirement in the private sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":439,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 200 and 201 together.<\/p><p>Apart from public sector employees, where certain statutory retirement ages may apply, there is no statutory retirement age for employees in Irish legislation. A contract of employment will generally contain a retirement age but this is a matter of contract between the parties. <\/p><p>The upper age limit for bringing claims under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 was removed by a provision in the Equality Act 2004. It is now the case that a person of any age, when dismissed, may take a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts unless she or he has reached the &ldquo;normal retiring age for employees of the same employer in similar employment&rdquo;, if one exists. In such circumstances, the burden of proof is<b><\/b>on the employer to prove the normal retiring age. Furthermore, the upper age limit of 66 years for receipt of statutory redundancy payments was removed by the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Act 2007. <\/p><p>As the issue that arises around compulsory retirement at a given age is whether this entails discrimination on age grounds, the more usual avenue of redress for employees compulsorily retired is to take a claim, under the Employment Equality Acts, to the Workplace Relations Commission.  <\/p><p>Responsibility for employment equality legislation rests with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald T.D.  As the Deputy is aware, Minister Fitzgerald is currently bringing the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bill amends Section 34(4) of the Employment Equality Acts to bring it fully into line with Framework Directive 2000\/78\/EC and the interpretation of that Directive by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The CJEU rulings provide that it is not unlawful for an employer to fix a compulsory retirement age for employees provided it can be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim, including legitimate employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and if the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary. <\/p><p>Issues around retirement age generally are very complex and require a Whole-of Government approach.  In addition to the issues set out above they also raises significant issues in respect of pensions policy and the State Pension Age which come within the remit of the Minister for Social Protection.  Retirement age issues have been brought into sharp focus by the ending of the State Pension (Transition) and the standardising of the State pension age at 66.  In this regard, I understand that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is currently conducting a preliminary analysis of the issues involved, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform intends to bring a Memorandum to Government in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1067"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Ireland Funding","counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG02750"},{"type":"question","counter":441,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[43754\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG02800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which he and the relevant statutory bodies under the aegis of his Department continue to meet the requirements of a firm (details supplied) in County Kildare, with particular reference to the need to ensure that all relevant supports continue to be made available, as required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":442,"content":"<p>Firstly, I should point out that individual investment decisions are day to day operational matters for Enterprise Ireland.

For the first time, ambitious investment targets have been set for each region, with a strong focus on securing a significant uplift in the number of investments. Central to this is a driving ambition for employment growth throughout all regions over the lifetime of this strategy.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to achieve a significant uplift in the amount of FDI projects going into regions, the strategy outlines key actions aimed at achieving that, including a &euro;150m property investment plan, spread out over five years, which will support the achievement of the organisation's regional goals. The funding which includes the &euro;12 million referred to by the Deputy will be used to upgrade Ireland's business and technology parks, make investments in a number of strategic utility-intensive sites and build new advanced technology buildings in a number of regional locations.  About 30% of the property investment plan will be allocated to the construction of nine advance facilities.<\/p>  <p>  These sites were decided on by IDA Ireland based on a number of criteria including population density, cluster of activities of other companies in the area and third level educational institutions.  It is important to note that all investment must be targeted to potential investment wins and associated job creation opportunities.   <\/p>  <p>IDA Ireland has decided to concentrate the investment programme in particular in locations where the private sector has been reluctant to build capacity suitable premises for FDI.  In that context, the Government announced earlier this year that three locations, Sligo, Tralee and Castlebar,   located in Co. Mayo would be the key focus for the 2015 investment programme.  <\/p>  <p>  In this respect, planning permission was sought and has been obtained for facilities in Sligo and Castlebar.  The procurement process is underway to appoint contractors to construct these facilities and it is anticipated that this process will be complete and contractors will be on-site by year end.   It is planned to submit a planning application during December 2015 to construct a facility in Tralee.  IDA Ireland plans in 2016 to follow a similar process to deliver facilities in Galway, Dundalk and Limerick and in Athlone, Carlow and Waterford in 2017.   <\/p>  <p>  The Agency has approximately 11 hectares of land on the Sligo Road, Ballina, Co. Mayo, which are zoned and concept master planned with planning permission obtained for core park infrastructure development.  These lands are included in the Agency&rsquo;s database of available lands for marketing to FDI client companies or EI client companies as appropriate.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition, IDA Ireland has approximately 27 hectares of land on the Navan Business Park available for marketing to FDI client companies or EI clients as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Staff Recruitment","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG03650"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[43845\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800063#WRG03700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will approve funding for the appointment of three additional full-time accountants for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":455,"content":"<p>My Department secured sanction for the recruitment of five additional accountants for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in October 2014.

The office is manned by two permanent IDA Ireland staff; one dedicated regional official and one official from IDA Ireland's Engineering and Industrial Technology Division.  The office is jointly shared with Enterprise Ireland.  Donegal also has the additional resources of IDA Ireland regional staff in Sligo including a full-time manager focussed on the North-West region.  <\/p><p>IDA Ireland is satisfied that its foot print in the North-West of the country is sufficient to meet the requirements for Foreign Direct Investment in Donegal.  Marketing of any regional area including Donegal for Foreign Direct Investment occurs through IDA Ireland's network of overseas offices.  IDA Ireland actively incentivises and encourages investors to consider a range of potential locations in Ireland.  The agency markets Letterkenny as a gateway location for the region.  The ultimate locations selected are always decided<font color=\"#5F5F5F\"> <\/font>by the clients and not IDA Ireland.<\/p><p>There were 6 IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits to Donegal in 2014 and in 2015 there were 3 up to the end of September.  It should be noted that 70% of new IDA Ireland jobs come from existing client companies, not from new investments.  The numbers of IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits for the years 2007 to 2015 inclusive are set out in Table A attached.  <\/p><p>IDA Ireland markets Donegal as part of its North-West Region, which also comprises Leitrim and Sligo.  The main FDI activity clusters that have emerged in the North-West are in the life sciences and engineering sectors, particularly in the manufacture of medical devices and automotive components.  There are also a small number of large employers in the financial services sector, particularly in Letterkenny and a growing pharma sector in Sligo. <\/p><p>The number of jobs in IDA Ireland client companies in county Donegal, as per the 2014 Annual Employment Survey, rose from 1,854 in 2010 to 2,612 in 2014.  I attach the breakdown in Table B. The figures for this year will not be available until the 2015 Annual Employment Survey is published early next year.  There are 41 multinational companies in total based in the North-West, employing 5,294 across the Region.  Given the global economic operating environment in recent years, the existing client base has performed well in not only retaining their presence in Donegal, but expanding the number of employees.  The most recent example of this was the announcement in July of this year by Pramerica of the expansion of its facility in Donegal by 330 jobs.<\/p><p>Achieving a balanced regional dispersal of employment is challenging. IDA Ireland's new five year strategy <i>Winning &ndash; Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019<\/i>contains a strong focus on regional development, setting forth aims and strategies to achieve a significant increase in investment going into regional locations.  To support that aim, IDA Ireland is rolling out a &euro;150million capital investment programme to help attract more multinational jobs into each region over a 5-year period.  This programme will include investments over the coming years in building advanced technology buildings and office facilities in a number of regional locations to provide state-of-the-art property solutions for clients.<\/p><p>In addition to attracting Foreign Direct Investment to Donegal, I am very committed to encouraging start-ups and nurturing small, high technology companies, with potential for growth.  There are 3,302 people directly employed in Enterprise Ireland client companies in Donegal. Enterprise Ireland has supported, through various programmes, 101 start-up entrepreneurs in Donegal in addition to a further 196 supported by the Local Enterprise Office in Donegal.  A strong indigenous sector is also key to ensuring all the necessary supports are in place for potential FDI investors.<\/p><p>My Department published its North-East\/North-West Regional Action Plan last month as part of the wider Actions Plan for Jobs programme.

In January 2015, the EU Commission introduced emergency measures to reduce the fishing mortality in commercial fisheries (pelagic trawling) of this stock.  The EU has since adopted a new Regulation that introduces a comprehensive prohibition on commercial fishing for seabass by all EU Member States fishing vessels in the Irish and Celtic Seas.  This underpins the conservation actions already taken by Ireland for over 20 years with regard to this vulnerable stock.  The EU has also increased the minimum landing size for seabass and again Ireland supported this measure. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes further conservation measures for this stock but we have a concern that the proposal as it stands, while aimed at protecting the stock, may inadvertently harm the highly regulated recreational angling sector in Ireland.  The current proposal would ban all angling activity for seabass for the first six months of the year and a one fish per day rule for the rest of the year.  Currently Ireland operates a 2 fish per day rule and the rest of the EU applies a 3 fish per day rule.  I fully support the one fish per day limit suggested, however as I agree with the Deputy on the potential harm to our tourism sector, I do not support a complete ban on angling for the first six months of the year.  Irish anglers are not the reason that seabass is continuing to decline and Ireland has been at the forefront of conservation measures for this stock for decades.  It would in my view be unfair to take such a severe approach to the recreational sector in Ireland given their ongoing efforts to protect the stock.  Consequently, I will endeavour, at December Council, to persuade the Commission that a catch and release recreational fishery be permitted to continue during the first six months of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800065#WRJ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":562,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800065#WRJ02350"},{"type":"question","counter":563,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[43818\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800065#WRJ02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the schedule for payments under the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These include the Westmeath GAA County Board, the Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA), the Order of Malta and the Midland Youth Services.  The former barracks is also currently used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service for training purposes and it is intended that these arrangements will remain in place.

In addition, numerous requests from other community groups wishing to avail of accommodation within the Barracks have also been received.  Regarding accommodation for Westmeath Civil Defence HQ, initial contact was made with my Officials to discuss the possibility of them relocating to Columb Barracks.  The position, however, is that the provision of accommodation for Civil Defence Units is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant local authority.  I would, of course, be happy to consider a proposal from the Council in this regard.  Indeed, given the number of local organisations interested in using the facility, I believe that it may be useful to engage with the Council regarding the long-term development of the Barracks. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality, who is the lead Department for the Refugee Accommodation Programme, is also working with my Officials to establish whether any of the buildings falling within the remit of the Department of Defence, including Columb Barracks, are suitable for the purposes of temporary accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy can appreciate, proposals involving the long-term retention of Mullingar Barracks by my Department, which includes administering multiple leases and fulfilling the many responsibilities of a landlord, will put a significant administrative and financial burden on my Department.

","asker":"1090","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":714,"content":"<p>The Legal Services Regulation Bill, which is scheduled to complete its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas this week, gives legislative expression to the commitment in the programme for Government to \"establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints\".  Having been a sectoral objective under the EU\/IMF\/ECB 'Troika' Programme, the Bill is now the subject of a Country Specific Recommendation under the EU Semester Process as well as an objective of the Action Plan for Jobs, the Medium Term Economic Strategy 2014-2020 and the National Reform Plan. <\/p>  <p>  The Legal Services Regulation Act will constitute a key component of the Government's strategy to bring greater transparency to legal costs and to reduce their burden on consumers and enterprise - including by reference to the competitiveness indicators raised by the Deputy, which would appear to be those also cited by the National Competitiveness Council in its 2015 Report on the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland.  That Report notes that despite reductions in legal costs during 2013, Ireland remains an expensive location to enforce a business contract (ranked 9th in the OECD, not 8th as the Deputy suggests) and is a place where it takes a significant amount of time to enforce a contract (the 6th longest in the OECD).  The legal services data used for the Report is based on a group of 16 respondents to the relevant CSO survey and 96 separate price observations. <\/p>  <p>  The more transparent legal costs regime being introduced by the Legal Services Regulation Bill, in tandem with the use of more efficient alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, is intended to bring about significant improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s position in the medium term.  The Bill makes extensive provision, in Part 10, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged by legal practitioners, along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients.  Legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients.  This will be in the form of a Notice, written in clear language, which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions.  Among other things, the Notice must disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not known, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated.  A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client.  When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question.  In addition, the Bill sets out that it will not be permissible for legal practitioners to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business and that it will no longer be permissible for barristers to charge junior counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.<\/p>  <p>  An aggrieved client also has the option of applying for the adjudication of disputed legal costs by the reformed and modernised Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators, which is currently known as the Taxing-Master's Office.  The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles.  These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that shall be taken into account in the adjudication of disputed legal costs.  The Bill also provides for the establishment of a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will disclose the outcomes and reasons for decisions made by the Legal Costs Adjudicators. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill will also introduce a system for processing complaints about excessive costs, which will be the subject of attempts, firstly, by the new Authority at informal resolution, but then escalating to formal resolution where alternative dispute resolution means do not succeed.  This will be the first time that complaints about all legal practitioners will be dealt with by an independent statutory public authority.<\/p>  <p>  I might add the Bill sets out a clear path to new Legal Partnerships involving barrister\/barrister partnerships and barrister\/solicitor partnerships, which will allow for such partnerships to open for business, in competition with the more traditional lawyer structures, by late next year.  The new Legal Services Regulatory Authority is also tasked with carrying out public consultations and reporting to me as Minister with further legislative recommendations over its first four years in areas such as removing existing client money and direct access restrictions relating to barristers; examining entry and training requirements for the legal profession; unification of the two legal professions; and the opening of the market to multi-disciplinary practices.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the Bill seeks to achieve greater flexibility in the legal-services market, more competition and improved access to justice and will pave the way for the introduction of new business structures for legal practitioners.  These combined measures will enable those availing of legal services, be they private consumers or enterprise, to identify costs more clearly, including in competition with other possible legal service providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800067#WRL03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":715,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800067#WRL03350"},{"type":"question","counter":716,"qnumday":295,"qnumall":"[43996\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800067#WRL03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"The supports available to assist a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1194","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":717,"content":"<p>On Friday 2 October, I published a Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities.

A crucial element of this  strategy is to have ongoing seamless recruitment to renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b>With this in mind Budget 2016 made provision for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; that will be recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014. So far 295 of those new recruits are fully attested  are on the ground in the community nationwide.<\/p><p>The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will, in addition to the recruitment of new trainee Garda&iacute;, also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community. <\/p><p>The recently announced Operation Thor builds on previous and current Garda operations to tackle crime, particularly burglaries the number of which, as we know, increase with the advent of the long winter nights, in both urban and rural communities nationwide.  In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor which entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.<\/p><p>I am confident that this comprehensive operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Government investment in Garda resources and personnel, will  disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve  the safety of all our communities across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800068#WRM03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":770,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800068#WRM03500"},{"type":"question","counter":771,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[43972\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800068#WRM03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status in determining an application for leave to remain in the State submitted in May 2012 by a person (details supplied) in Dublin 11; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":772,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that  the position remains the same as my reply to Parliamentary Question no. 84 of 23 September and no. 583 of 3 November 2015 that the person in question should be advised to contact the Residence Division, INIS regarding their current position.

I am advised that Kilmihil Station was a new build and originally constructed as a purpose built Garda Station.  Its reopening and use facilitated the Office of Public Works in not having to enter into another lease with the associated financial implications.  <\/p>  <p>  The Rationalisation Programme was based on a review of the Garda Station Network by Garda management which concluded in relation to certain stations, many of which were only open part-time and manned by a single Garda, that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.   In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  The Programme supports the provision of a modern 21st century policing service for both urban and rural areas and allows front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefitted from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public. <\/p>  <p>  The Garda Stations which have been closed were returned to, and are now under the control of, the Office of Public Works (OPW).

To all those affected, I wish to express my sincere sympathies. In order to identify learning about how to better address the needs of vulnerable children and families, the National Review Panel (NRP) was established in 2010 to review serious incidences and deaths of children in care.  It is an independent body chaired by Dr Helen Buckley of Trinity College and its reports are published on the Tusla website. <\/p><p>The National Review Panel recently published its 2014 Annual Report of reviews of the cases of 29 children and young people, 26 of these children died, and a further 3 were involved in serious incidents:<\/p><p>-Nearly one third of these deaths were a result of natural causes, including congenital conditions;<\/p><p>-Very sadly, a further 8 children and young people died by suicide, 3 of whom were in care;<\/p><p>-Five children died in road traffic accidents and 2 died by homicide.<\/p><p>The Review Panel found that there was no case where either action or inaction on the part of the HSE or Tusla was a direct contributory factor in the deaths.  However, as is the explicit purpose of this work, the Review Panel also found areas of historical deficits in practice and inconsistencies in service provision.  These include providing timely access to a social worker; more clear evidence of parental capacity to change in social work assessments and earlier decisions to take a child into care.  This Government&rsquo;s establishment of a dedicated Child and Family Agency, Tusla, has already addressed some of these historical deficits.  Government has provided additional funding to Tusla this year to significantly increase the number of social workers dedicated to working with these vulnerable children and families.<\/p><p>As a learning organisation, Tusla is committed to embedding the lessons of such reviews, and a number of relevant actions are currently underway to further enhance the response to vulnerable children and families such as:<\/p><p><i>-Meitheal<\/i>is an initiative to make best use of all early interventions to support families in a coordinated way and to best address childrens' needs;<\/p><p>-Tusla is developing an assessment model for social workers, to support evidence- informed assessment, greater consistency and enhanced practice in engaging families;<\/p><p>-New <i>Threshold Guidance<\/i>has been introduced to ensure social work interventions are made in a proportionate and timely manner.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is represented in the following tables.

Following the development of the report, the Health Service Executive (HSE) established the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinical Programme.  The scope of the Programme covers the whole of the patient journey from self-management and prevention through to primary, secondary and tertiary care.  This provides a national strategic and co-ordinated approach to a wide range of clinical services.  The Programme includes the standardisation of access to and delivery of, high quality, safe and efficient hospital services nationally, as well as improved linkages with primary care services.

Close links will be maintained with the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinical Programme to ensure that there is no duplication of effort and that all initiatives receive optimal support.

While certain flexibilities had been built in to the Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability the <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures<\/i>children and young people's policy framework contained a commitment to develop a plan to facilitate the full participation of such children in the ECCE Programme.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has lead responsibility for the implementation of this commitment and has concluded an intensive process of deliberation and consultation on the matter in conjunction with the Departments of Health and Education and Skills and has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.<\/p><p>As part of Budget 2016, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs announced the necessary funding to implement the new model of ECCE supports for children with a disability.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18th November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with my full support and the support of my Government colleague Jan O'Sullivan T.D., Minister  for Education and Skills. <\/p><p>Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand, inter alia, the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings as part of the rollout of the new inclusive preschools model. <\/p><p>It should be noted that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.<\/p><p>Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case she has raised.

In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive (CBD) on its website -  - and also by phone.  The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified for the dissemination of information on the CBD by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements.  The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the right to healthcare, if any, that they may have through the European legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (EU Regulation 883\/04) and which may be more beneficial to them.  The NCP is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State. <\/p><p>The healthcare being sought under the CBD can only be healthcare that a person would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, which is not contrary to Irish legislation.  It will be a matter for the patient and his\/her referring doctor to identify the clinician abroad and satisfy him\/herself in relation to the qualifications, quality and safety of the services being availed of in the other jurisdiction.  In general, healthcare is not routinely advertised and the best options for treatment are most appropriately discussed within the professional setting and advice received as to where services might be sought, including availing of the provisions of the CBD for treatment. <\/p><p>It is also noteworthy that access to healthcare abroad under the Directive is based on patients following public patient pathways; that is, a referral is required in order to be eligible for reimbursement. Referral for care under the CBD can be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other HSE clinicians.  This referral is not limited to Irish health professionals but nevertheless the great majority of patients are likely to have consulted an Irish health professional who then referred them for treatment here or, if they wished, within the EU\\EEA.  As a consequence, a general information campaign regarding the CBD has not been undertaken.  It is also noteworthy that Recital 4 of the Directive states &ldquo;the transposition of this Directive into national legislation and its application should not result in patients being encouraged to receive treatment outside their Member State of affiliation&rdquo;.  The HSE has tried to balance its dissemination of information regarding the CBD with this Recital in mind and has concentrated on informing the clinicians who make the referrals about the Directive.  To this end it has met with the ICGP and various consultants at hospital level to inform them of the provisions of the Directive.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine the matter of the data requested and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

The legislation obliges the HSE, when making a decision on a person&rsquo;s eligibility, to take account of a person&rsquo;s financial situation. This requires the provision of information by the applicant. <\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of difficult circumstances, whether medical or social which might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical services.

In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold. Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.<\/p>  <p>  The Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) payment is made by the Minister for Social Protection to carers in respect of a child at home under 16 years of age with a severe disability, where it has been determined that the child requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age. Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required. As such it is not possible to say if a particular child or any particular medical condition or disability will qualify for a payment under the DCA scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility, known as the Keane Report, recommended that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card and that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions for medical card eligibility. Nonetheless, it is clear that there are people &ndash; including children - with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner. <\/p>  <p>  Consequently, the Clinical Advisory Group on medical card eligibility was established by the HSE to develop a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease and appropriate operational guidelines for the medical card scheme. However, the Clinical Advisory Group has not recommended that children in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance should automatically qualify for a medical card. In advance of the Group completing its work, there are no proposals to issue automatic medical cards to one particular group.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to making the medical card system as responsive as possible to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs. As a result of a range of improvements, the HSE is exercising greater discretion. Consequently, the number of discretionary medical cards has increased by about 84% - from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 96,000 at the beginning of November this year. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, the proper way to address this issue is to develop a system of universal health care, which is at the centre of Government health policy. Otherwise, whenever there are qualifying rules, there will always be a person who is above the means test, does not have the selected disease, or is not in receipt of the specific social welfare payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800074#WRS00400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Contracts","counter":1142,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800074#WRS00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1143,"qnumday":440,"qnumall":"[44155\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800074#WRS00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of general practitioners in receipt of the rural practice allowance, and the amount allocated by county in each year since 2010, in tabular form.","asker":"983","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1144,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

That is why our main focus remains on doing all we can to ensure that the UK remains part of the Union, rather than planning for their departure.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time, the Government fully recognises that it must be prepared for all scenarios and we are already in regular contact with a wide range of stakeholders, both North and South of the border and across the UK. This should help identify the many different issues that could arise, including with regard to Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Further work is also being undertaken across other Government Departments in this regard. The Department of the Taoiseach continues to coordinate cross-Governmental efforts in this area as we move forward with this work. This includes research that the Department of Finance has commissioned from the Economic and Social Research Institute on macro-economic links between the UK and Ireland in the context of EU membership.<\/p>  <p>  My own Department, given its responsibility for both Foreign Affairs and Trade, is naturally heavily involved. My officials are engaging actively with counterparts across our own system, as well as within the Northern Irish and British administrations and further afield in other EU capitals.<\/p>  <p>  A key aim for us is to ensure that stakeholders in Northern Ireland and across the UK understand why their EU membership matters as much as it does for Ireland.

This provided a valuable opportunity to stimulate debate on this issue, raising awareness of the potential impacts for Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I have also addressed influential audiences on this topic in Chatham House, London and most recently in Dublin at a Breakfast Seminar organised by the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce (BICC) and hosted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at Iveagh House.<\/p>  <p>  At a political level, my recent meeting with Foreign Secretary Hammond in London on 23 November provided an opportunity to re-emphasise the importance of the UK&rsquo;s continued membership of the EU. The Taoiseach has had similar exchanges with Prime Minister Cameron, most recently on 9 November. We have underlined our commitment to supporting the UK&rsquo;s efforts to reach agreement at EU level on reforms that address the broad issues raised by Prime Minister Cameron in his letter of 10 November to European Council President Donald Tusk, while ensuring an outcome that is not only good for the UK, but good for Ireland and good for the EU as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800074#WRS02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":1166,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800074#WRS02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1167,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[43600\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800074#WRS03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of meetings requested by private external lobby groups and the number of meetings held, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1168,"content":"<p>Since my appointment in July 2014 I have met with the groups listed in the following table, on the dates indicated.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also receives many requests for meetings at Headquarters and in Missions abroad from a wide-range of groups and individuals whom it is not always possible for me to meet.<table><tr><th><div><b>Date of meeting<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Details of meeting<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>27 August 2014<\/td><td>Meeting with Mary Robinson<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8 October 2014 <\/td><td>Meeting with representatives of the following NGOs:<br \/><br \/>Tr&oacute;caire<br \/><br \/>D&oacute;chas <br \/><br \/>Plan <br \/><br \/>Sightsavers <br \/><br \/>GOAL<br \/><br \/>Oxfam Ireland<br \/><br \/>Camara <br \/><br \/>Tearfund Ireland<br \/><br \/>World Vision Ireland<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>27 November 2014<\/td><td>AmCham <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12 February 2015<\/td><td>Amnesty Ireland<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5 March 2015<\/td><td>AmCham (Launch of the Ireland-US Economic Relationship 2015 Report)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15 May 2015<\/td><td>Meeting with Justice for the Forgotten\/Pat Finucane Centre<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7 July 2015<\/td><td>Meeting with Front Line Defenders<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>21 July 2015<\/td><td>Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>27 July 2015<\/td><td>Fermanagh Orange Order<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7 October 2015<\/td><td>Meeting with ICTU<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>22 October 2015<\/td><td>Meeting with members of the Civil Society Network<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800074#WRS03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":1169,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800074#WRS03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1170,"qnumday":449,"qnumall":"[43632\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800074#WRS03300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his Department's photography costs since he came into office, inclusive of costs incurred from use of the ministerial allowance, by year in tabular form; the occasions for which photographers were booked; the photographers used; the costs associated with each occasion; the policy in place regarding the booking of photographers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1171,"content":"<p>My Department only avails of the services of external photographic agencies where it is warranted, in particular for major events and State occasions.

My Department has not incurred expenditure on external public relations services since my entry into office in July 2014. The expenditure in question has rather arisen in the context of specific initiatives under Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme for which we have from time to time commissioned companies with a public relations and communications background to provide other professional services such as project management, logistics and event management.  DHR Communications has been contracted to manage and administer grants to journalists reporting on international development issues under the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) and to manage and administer annual Africa Day celebrations.The SCMF involves managing three funding rounds each year and managing the SCMF student competition. This typically involves the following activities: <\/p><p>Convening national and regional information workshops;<\/p><p>Managing and administering the application process;<\/p><p>Organising the judging process<\/p><p>Providing detailed feedback to all applicants;<\/p><p>Processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records;<\/p><p>Maintaining and updating the SCMF website.  <\/p><p>It should be noted that expenses paid to third parties account for approximately 30% of the total paid to DHR for managing and administering the Simon Cumbers Media Fund. This includes costs associated with maintaining and updating the SCMF website, facilitating the judging process and raising awareness of the Fund among journalists.  DHR was awarded a new two-year contract in April 2015 following a competitive tendering process.<\/p><p>Following a further competitive tendering process, DHR was also engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day 2015 flagship event in Dublin. Like annual Africa Day events held over successive years, this incorporated musical entertainment and cultural activities aimed principally at family audiences. DHR&rsquo;s role involved the administration of a small grants scheme for regional events which they managed on behalf of the Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website. This work represented a very minor element of the overall project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.<\/p><p>In relation to the expenditure on Africa Day, expenses paid to third parties accounted for between 70% and 80% of the total costs listed below.

While such restrictions are a serious matter in any society, the terrible circumstances which gave rise to them has to be taken into consideration.

There has been a positive public reaction to this Irish-led innovative project including from those Irish citizens who travel frequently within Europe. It is also appears to be in demand by young adults for age-identification purposes.We have been informed by a small number of citizens that they have encountered difficulties with the card being accepted. This appears to have happened at regional airports in the main. To avoid this in the future I have asked our Embassies in each EU and EEA country and Switzerland to make contact with Ministries of Justice\/Home Affairs as relevant and request them to ensure that all border guards are fully appraised of the validity of the Irish Passport Card for travel.    Additionally the details of the Passport Card have been uploaded to Keesing&rsquo;s document checker database.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that one member of staff in the NEPS Castlebar Office has been lost due to long-term career break and that my Department is actively pursuing a replacement.

It recommended that a school's Special Needs Teaching allocation should be determined by a baseline component according to pupil numbers and a school's educational profile.

An initial list of schools was selected by the Educational Research Centre, using sampling techniques designed to ensure that as full a range of schools as possible is represented.  For primary schools the sample included appropriate representation by disadvantaged classification, gender mix and size.  For post-primary schools the sample included appropriate representation by sector, disadvantage classification, gender mix and size.  A list of schools was generated within each of these categories, along with replacements for first-selected schools.<\/p><p>The pilot will test the practical impacts of the new model prior to full implementation.

These include assessment reports not only from staff from my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) but also from a range of professional staff within the HSE (Clinical Psychologists, Occupational \/ Speech Therapists, Psychiatrists, etc) and their private sector counterparts. Application for resources in support of individual pupils are submitted by school authorities to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) using the assessment reports furnished by the forgoing agencies as support the application.<\/p><p>My Department's NEPS service provides educational psychology service to all primary and post primary schools through an assigned NEPS psychologist and in some cases through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p><p>NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. <\/p><p>Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention. This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological assessment and\/or intervention. When a NEPS psychologist becomes involved with an individual pupil it is for the purposes of identifying that pupil's special educational needs and the appropriate interventions to be put in place to meet those needs. These interventions commonly have relevance to the work of the existing class teacher, learning support staff, the provision of advice on alternative placement, as well as the provision of additional Resource Teaching or SNA support.While NEPS maintains a client database of its involvement with individual students this structure was developed to track the history of NEPS involvement with the student during the course of their school careers, it was not designed to record their eligibility for additional resources.

Accreditation, including that provided by some of the predecessor agencies, is, by its nature, time-limited and subject to renewal.  It is not a permanent status attributed to a provider.  Re-engagement with such 'legacy' providers involves agreeing revised quality assurance procedures in accordance with specified requirements set down in the 2012 Act and in QQI policy.  The one-off re-engagement fee to be applied to legacy providers seeking to re-engage with QQI has yet to be determined.<\/p><p>Regarding providers in the Community and Voluntary Sector specifically referred to by the Deputy, it was agreed at a meeting hosted by my Department in December 2014 that 2015 would be a lead-in time for the re-engagement process and that the issue of fees for community and voluntary providers would not arise until 2016. <\/p><p>QQI established a Joint QQI \/Community and Voluntary Working Group, which is facilitated by an independent facilitator with extensive experience in the community voluntary sector. The working group has met on 5 occasions this year, with a further meeting scheduled this month.  The working group also jointly hosted a consultative event on QQI's quality assurance guidelines and criteria relevant to this sector on 30th June 2015. Through these initiatives, QQI and the community and voluntary sector are engaging on a range of operational, developmental and strategic matters in the specific context of quality assurance and re-engagement. The work of the group will assist QQI in clarifying its operational requirements for future re-engagement with community and voluntary sector organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800077#WRV05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Admissions","counter":1388,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800077#WRV05700"},{"type":"question","counter":1389,"qnumday":524,"qnumall":"[43956\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800077#WRV05800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill 2015 will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.","asker":"1065","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1390,"content":"<p>I published the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill in early April of this year.

The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting the work of schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with a broad range of problems, behavioural emotional and social.<\/p>  <p>  The process spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers. It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.<\/p>  <p>  Schools are assisted by Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2012), which was developed to implement Action 2.1 of Reach Out: the National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014 (HSE, 2005).<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines are for all members of the school community, boards of management and in-school management teams who play a central leadership role in mental health promotion. They are also useful for parents' associations, student councils, health and other personnel who are seeking an understanding of how to work in and with schools.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important that this message is conveyed to pupils at an early age. To this end, Wellbeing Guidelines for Primary Schools have been recently produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in primary schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.<\/p>  <p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle (2015) also places a clear emphasis on overall student health and well-being. This Framework is underpinned by eight principles, one of which is \"Well-being\". It also has eight key skills which are to be embedded in every new Junior Cycle subject and short course including the key skills of \"Managing Myself\" and \"Staying Well\". In addition, the 24 'Statements of Learning' that a student should experience during their Junior Cycle programme involve the student taking action to safeguard and promote their own well-being and that of others.<\/p>  <p>  One of the innovative features of the Junior Cycle Framework is the introduction of short courses that schools can choose to implement. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has developed a new short course in SPHE, which may be delivered for certification purposes and will involve an increase in the time allocation for SPHE at Junior Cycle up to 100 hours over the three year cycle. The new short course is now available to implement in post-primary schools, should they wish to do so, as part of their Junior Cycle programme. It includes strands such as \"Minding Myself and Others\" and \"My Mental Health\", and deals with issues such as mental health and mental ill-health, dealing with tough times, loss and bereavement.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also working with the Department of Health to promote participation by primary and post-primary schools in the 'Health Promoting Schools' initiative, which is supported by the Department of Health. This European-wide programme aims to strengthen schools' capacity to be a healthy setting for learning and working by focusing at whole-school level on all the conditions that affect health and well-being.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800078#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Eligibility","counter":1407,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800078#WRW00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1408,"qnumday":531,"qnumall":"[44019\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800078#WRW00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will review a decision by Student Universal Support Ireland to refuse an application for a grant from a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1185","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1409,"content":"<p>As part of a comprehensive customer service and communications strategy provided by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI), to ensure that all necessary avenues are open to applicants to receive the information they need, a dedicated email and phone line service is provided by SUSI for Oireachtas members.

Particularly in relation to possible anticipated behavioural difficulties, it is more appropriate to wait until the child begins school in order to see how they have been able to engage in the classroom.<\/p>  <p>  In considering applications for SNA support from post primary schools the NCSE will take into account the importance of the requirement to allocate necessary care supports with the right of a child to acquire personal independence skills.<\/p>  <p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools, once allocated, is then a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.<\/p>  <p>  All schools were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2015\/16 school year by 18th March 2015.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual student for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more students indirectly than could be seen individually.

The Tyres Working Group was, and continues to be, an open and transparent arrangement through which stakeholders have an opportunity to shape the future of the tyre sector in Ireland. However, the Independent Tyre Wholesalers and Retailers Association (ITWRA) withdrew from the Group shortly after I announced my decision to establish a full PRI for tyres and waste tyres in January 2015. My Department has been in occasional contact with the organisation since their decision to withdraw. The ITWRA continue to receive all Tyres Working Group related correspondence and on several occasions I have urged them to re-join the process and to embrace the opportunity to influence the shape of the new structures.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the adoption of the current 2007 Regulations, my Department made it very clear that this was the last opportunity for the tyre industry to embrace environmental compliance and take responsibility for the waste it produces. It stated that if the required improvement did not happen a full Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) model would be introduced. The Producer Responsibility Initiative report on Tyres and Waste Tyres published in November 2013 looked at the operation of the system introduced in 2007 and found:<\/p>  <p>- A non-compliance rate with the Tyre Regulations of 46%,<\/p>  <p>- A lack of consistent and accurate data on tyres,<\/p>  <p>- The system was not tracking data flows well, and<\/p>  <p>- Between 25% and 50% of waste tyres were not accounted for.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, this system, which has resulted in between 15&ndash;20 million tyres being dumped illegally around our country, is failing to provide a proper waste management system for tyres and cannot be allowed to continue. The tyre industry is now being asked to do what operators in other areas such as WEEE, packaging, batteries, and farm plastics have been doing for years; that is, to take responsibility for managing the waste that they produce. Economic operators who are in compliance with the Regulations have nothing to fear from the new structures.<\/p>  <p>  The model that is being introduced will formalise a charge that tyre retailers already apply to purchases of new tyres by consumers and ensure that the fee consumers pay actually goes towards its stated purpose, which is to support the environmental treatment of waste tyres. This charge varies across the country from around &euro;1.75 to as much as &euro;3.50 per tyre. As things stand, the consumer, in effect, pays twice &ndash; first, when they purchase new tyres and then, again, through their taxation when local authorities remove illegal tyre stockpiles across the country. The new system is therefore very positive from the perspective of the consumer. <\/p>  <p>Repak ELT, which has already replaced TRACS as the sole compliance scheme for tyres as of 1 November 2015, already has almost 200 members and the model that I am developing, which mirrors arrangements in place in 20 other EU Member States, will, I am confident, enjoy the full support of all members of the European Tyre and Rubber Manufacturers Association,   who make up approximately 50% of the Irish tyre market.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, I urge both the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA) and the Irish Tyre Wholesalers &amp;amp; Retailers Association (ITWRA) to re-join the process and re-engage with my Department in finalising the details for the new regulatory regime.  In addition, my Department and Repak ELT continue to engage with representatives from the farming, construction and haulage sectors on the new arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800080#WRY04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Provision","counter":1558,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800080#WRY05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1559,"qnumday":589,"qnumall":"[44193\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800080#WRY05100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of local authority housing unit builds completed by county in 2015 to date, in tabular form.","asker":"1022","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1560,"qnumday":590,"qnumall":"[44194\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800080#WRY05200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of local authority housing units builds commenced but not competed by county in 2015 to date, in tabular form.","asker":"1022","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1561,"qnumday":592,"qnumall":"[44196\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800080#WRY05300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of new social housing units and the scheme under which they have been delivered, in 2015 to date, in tabular form.","asker":"1022","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1562,"qnumday":593,"qnumall":"[44197\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800080#WRY05400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of local authority units that will be built and commenced by county in 2016, in tabular form.","asker":"1022","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1563,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 589, 590, 592 and 593 together.<\/p><p>Information on all new social housing units constructed and acquired in respect of all local authorities and approved housing bodies is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: . <\/p><p>In addition, information supplied to my Department by local authorities identifies 112 construction &lsquo;starts&rsquo; over the 9 month period to the end of September 2015 in respect of local authority contracted projects; I expect projects involving further significant local authority &lsquo;starts&rsquo; to be reported in due course for Q4 2015. \u00a0Equivalent information in relation to &lsquo;starts&rsquo; in respect of Approved Housing Body projects\u00a0 in the same period is not readily available.<\/p><p>On 1 April 2015, I announced provisional funding allocations totalling &euro;1.5 billion for all local authorities, to meet the delivery target of circa 22,900 social housing units out to 2017 of the Government&rsquo;s Social Housing Strategy 2020.

In carrying out these functions, my main focus is to ensure that the victims of the Irish Famine are respectfully and appropriately remembered. In that context, I also seek to raise awareness of current food security issues worldwide.  While the Commemoration ceremony retains a degree of continuity in its format, the date and the cultural elements of the commemoration may change from year to year.

This includes additional funding to the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme, and a new investment programme for regional arts and cultural centres.  There will be significant benefits accruing for communities, artists and creative workers from many of the Ireland 2016 programmes supported by this additional funding, including at an international level.<\/p><p>I was also particularly pleased that the Government introduced a 25% increase in the ceiling for the Artists Exemption from 2015.  This important measure recognises the invaluable contribution which artists make to Irish society. <\/p><p>My Department continues to work with other Departments to promote the cultural and creative industries within the framework of the Government&rsquo;s overall objectives under the Action Plan for Jobs.<\/p><p>Finally, the place of artists in society has been a significant theme arising from the public consultation process, which I put in place for the development of Ireland's first national cultural policy, <i>Culture 2025<\/i>.  This will be reflected in the policy document which I will publish early in the New Year.<\/p><p>These measures will, I believe, provide increased support to Irish artists, as well as community groups, both emerging and established, and will underpin Government investment in arts and culture into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800084#WRCC02900","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Easter Rising Commemorations","counter":1799,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800084#WRCC02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1800,"qnumday":674,"qnumall":"[44180\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120800084#WRCC03000","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she is continuing to develop plans for the 1916 commemoration; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1801,"content":"<p>The Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme, which was launched on 31<sup><\/sup>March last, includes a rich diversity of programmes and events, complementary and additional to the formal State occasions, which will run throughout 2016 to commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures (RPS) &ndash; in this case, Kildare County Council.  Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.  <\/p><p>Grant funding of &euro;624,000 was allocated for the Structures at Risk Fund 2015<i>, <\/i>to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration and which are protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  This fund, which is administered through the local authorities, encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  Since 2011, over 130 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund.<\/p><p>My Department has a number of measures at its disposal to facilitate the restoration of major historical or cultural sites.  I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument.  Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians.  A wide range of other monuments (in the order of 130,000) are currently subject to protection under other provisions of the National Monuments Acts but my Department and the Office of Public Works do not have a direct role in their maintenance, except where, as already noted, a monument is a national monument of which I am owner or guardian.  <\/p><p>My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the Office of Public Works (OPW) in 2015 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership. <\/p><p>Finally, in October this year I announced a new &euro;2 million investment scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures in 2016.  This allocation from Capital Stimulus funding will assist with works to safeguard structures, in private and civic ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  This fund will operate on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme (BHJLS), which ran in 2014 and invested &euro;5 million nationally in our built heritage leveraging an additional &euro;10 million, and is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and create employment in the conservation and construction industries.  It will help to regenerate urban and rural areas and will come as a welcome boost to the custodians of heritage properties.<\/p><p>Well maintained historic buildings contribute positively to the vitality of our cities, towns, villages and countryside.
