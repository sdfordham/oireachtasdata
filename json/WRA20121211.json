Measures introduced to date include the creation of multi-jurisdictional court offices (14 such offices have been combined to date); centralisation of processes; review of resource allocation including redeployment to front line services; rationalisation of court venues and offices; standardisation of court procedures; and increased use of technology, including online payments and video link, to support court services.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that last year, following consultation with the Chief Justice, I established a cross agency Working Group to identify and implement efficiency measures with a specific focus on the high volume Circuit and District Courts.  The Group, which includes representatives of the judiciary, has recently reported to me on initiatives introduced to date.  These include a pre-trial procedure which is operating in the Dublin and the Midland Circuits on a pilot basis from 1 December 2012;  increased use of video links between courts and prisons; and the provision of same-day probation reports.  The amount of time Garda&iacute; spend waiting in court is also being actively managed and reduced.  An Expert Group on Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights has also been examining procedural measures with potential to speed up court proceedings and I expect that Group to report to me in the near future.<\/p><p>  The Presidents of the various courts are determined to achieve improvements in waiting times and they are working with the Courts Service to target judicial resources at the areas with longest waiting times.  It should be noted, for example, that in 2011 there were 674 weeks of Circuit Court sittings in venues outside Dublin.  This has increased to 767 weeks in 2012 and the President of the Circuit Court plans to increase capacity to 888 weeks during 2013, a 30% increase over 2011.  The additional weeks will be provided across crime, family law and civil matters.  The President of the District Court is also concentrating judicial resources in the areas of greatest need.<\/p><p>  Waiting times in the High Court have generally reduced considerably.  While the waiting time for asylum and pre-leave applications is high, the allocation of more judges and, particularly, more research support for judges has helped to reduce the waiting time for post-leave applications to four months, its lowest level in over two years.  Despite significant pressure, the waiting times in all other High Court lists have either remained the same or reduced.  The President of the High Court has introduced initiatives such as reorganising sittings of the High Court outside Dublin and arranging for additional court sittings during court recesses to reduce waiting times.  In addition, the delegation to court officials of administrative functions previously dealt with by High Court judges has increased judicial availability for trial work. <\/p><p>  The Supreme Court, however, continues to experience lengthy waiting times of up to 40 months at present.  Although considerable efforts are being made to manage this, the issue of capacity in the Supreme Court can only be fully resolved through the establishment of a Court of Civil Appeal.  The Government is committed to the holding of a Constitutional referendum on Article 34 which is necessary to achieve this and work has commenced in my Department in this regard.<\/p><p>  Finally, in the context of new work for the courts as a result of the Personal Insolvency Bill, I am introducing amendments to allow for a small new cadre of specialist judges to facilitate the speedy consideration of insolvency applications by the Circuit Court.  Rather than incurring additional costs to the Exchequer, the Government has decided that eligibility for these new judgeships will be initially confined to serving County Registrars with the necessary legal qualifications and practice experience.  This will have the effect of ensuring that the creation of this new cadre will be largely cost neutral as, if a serving County Registrar is appointed as a Specialist Judge, he or she will not be replaced thus creating the necessary extra judicial resources and maximising the contribution of these existing office holders at very little additional cost. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100078#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Joint Policing Committees","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100078#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[55484\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100078#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans for the future of joint policing committees; his view on broadening their remit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>The functions and powers of Joint Policing Committees (JPCs) are set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides for a Committee in each local authority area.

I am fully aware of course of the many issues of concern which have been raised in the public domain surrounding the circumstances of Father Molloy&rsquo;s death and the context in which some form of inquiry has been considered desirable.  But what needs to be considered first and foremost at present is that the matters at   the heart of the Garda examination relate to potential criminal liability and, in that context, possible charges. I sympathise greatly with Father Molloy's family and understand that the officers carrying out the examination are continuing to keep the family updated on progress.    However, the best form of justice for the family would be for anyone who has any criminal liability in relation to Father Molloy's tragic death to be brought to account through facing charges.  It would therefore be deeply inappropriate to do anything which could prejudice the possibility of that happening. It is also of crucial importance that the Garda&iacute; receive the fullest co-operation from any individual who can provide any information of relevance to the enquires being conducted.<\/p><p>  In any case where criminal behaviour is suspected it is only through a Garda investigation, and where evidence of criminal wrongdoing is available, through the submission of a file by the Garda&iacute; to the Director of Public Prosecutions, that persons can be brought fully to account before the Courts.

The Court highlighted the absence of a clear legislative framework for the collection and storage of data, and the lack of clarity as to the scope, extent and restrictions of the common law powers of the police to retain and disclose caution data. The Court also noted that the limited filtering arrangements made no distinction on the basis of the nature of the offence, the disposal in the case, the time which has elapsed since the offence took place or the relevance of the data to the employment sought.  The cumulative effect of these and other shortcomings was that the Court was not satisfied that there were sufficient safeguards in the system for retention and disclosure of criminal record data to ensure that data relating to the applicant&rsquo;s private life have not been disclosed in violation of her right to respect for her private life.<\/p><p>  The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill will provide a clear legislative framework for disclosure.

The Diversion Programme operates in accordance with Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, and under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner.  The aim of the Diversion Programme is to deal with juveniles who offend, by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the offender away from the courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending.  The programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and it pays regard to the needs of the victims of youth offending.  It is supported by the Garda Youth Diversion Projects. <\/p><p>  The work of the Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers under the Diversion Programme is supported by the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) through the funding and oversight of 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) across the country.  I wish to inform the Deputy that I continue to maintain responsibility for the diversion and community aspects of the work of IYJS, while my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has responsibility for the Children Detention Schools in Oberstown.  I will consult closely with my Ministerial colleague and with the Garda Commissioner in the continuing development of programmes to tackle youth crime.<\/p><p>  The programme has shown to be successful in diverting young offenders away from crime by offering guidance and support to the young people and their families.  I am committed to continuing the Diversion Programme this is reflected in the 2013 budget which remains similar to 2012.  Other Departments do not have a direct role in the delivery of the Diversion Programme, but they can support it indirectly by the provision of services to children in the groups most at risk.  The focus of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is on harmonising policy issues that affect children in areas such as early childhood care and education, youth justice, child welfare and protection, children and young people's participation, research on children and young people, youth work and cross-cutting initiatives for children.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service and the Irish Youth Justice Service contribute to this work by membership, where appropriate, of various structures under the umbrella of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs including Children Services Committees and the National Children's Strategy Implementation Group.

I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review process.  In this context a comprehensive review of venues has recently been completed, the purpose of which was to establish a general framework within which venues could be considered for closure taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced.<\/p><p>  The Service has advised that the identification of venues as part of the review process does not conclusively mean that the identified venues will close.  I am informed that no decision will be taken on an individual venue without prior consultation with local stakeholders and I understand that this consultation will be undertaken at an early stage in the assessment process so that all views can be fully reflected in the decision making process.  It should be noted that the final decision will be a matter for the Courts Service Board.  Under the statute I have no role or function in the matter.  It should be noted that since the Courts Service was established in 1999, 151 court venues have been closed.  I am informed that a total of 16 venues have been closed since March 2011, in the following locations: Enniscorthy,  Athenry, Ballymote, Borrisokane, Boyle, Castlecomer, Castleisland, Castletownbere, Claremorris, Ennistymon, Kiltimagh, New Ross, Portarlington, Roscrea, Shannon, and Templemore.<\/p><p>  The Courts Service has informed me that decisions to close a particular venue are generally taken due to its poor condition, some of which present a health and safety risk which would cost a great deal to rectify. The absence of holding cells in a number of cases is also a significant factor.  The need to operate more efficiently, particularly with regard to freeing up judicial, staff and Garda time currently spent travelling to multiple locations, is also a consideration.

It is important to remember that while some Garda stations are listed for revised opening hours from 24 hour stations, they will remain as functioning Garda stations on a 24 hour basis. The full list of these details is available in the Policing Plan which is available in the Oireachtas Library.<\/p><p>  While it is difficult to estimate precise savings arising from the closures, as these will vary from station to station, there will be some savings on utilities, maintenance and cost avoidance.  The objective of the closures, however, is not minor savings but significant improvements in efficiency.  The Commissioner has concluded that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front-line if particular stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained or if the public opening hours of other stations could be reduced at off-peak times. In making that decision he has reiterated the commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to providing a professional and effective service to the community. Each Divisional Officer with responsibility for a Division that will be affected by this decision has been tasked with developing a comprehensive consultation strategy together with a tailored implementation plan that will meet the particular needs of their Division.<\/p><p>  The intention will be that at all times optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.

This role is critical notwithstanding that children living in the Direct Provision system are not in the care of the State.  All children live in a family context and their parents\/guardians have primary responsibility for their care and welfare.  It should also be noted that RIA does not accommodate unaccompanied minors: they are in the care of the HSE.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the Direct Provision system, children are protected in a number of ways - primarily through RIA's Child Protection policy; its House Rules; its requirement that all centre staff are Garda vetted; and through the coordination role of a dedicated unit in RIA.<\/p><p><br \/>  RIA's Child Protection Policy is based on the HSE's &quot;Children First - National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children&quot;.  This policy requires, inter alia, that children must be supervised by their parents\/guardians at all times and that children are not permitted to be left alone overnight.  It also provides that each centre has a designated Child Protection liaison officer who is responsible for following a referral procedure should he or she suspect that a child welfare incident has occurred. Management of accommodation centres are obliged to ensure that all staff working in the centre are aware of, and adhere to, RIA's Child Protection Policy. The HSE has provided 'Keeping Safe' child protection training to each centre's designated officers and other staff members.<\/p><p><br \/>  The RIA House Rules set out information for residents and staff in respect of child protection and the responsibilities of all parties.  A copy of these Rules, as well as its Child Protection Policy, is available on RIA's website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  Staff of centres under contract to RIA are Garda vetted.

In this respect, RIA is liaising with the HSE to update its Child Protection Policy in line with the recent revisions to the HSE's &#8220;Children First&#8221; published in 2011.  This will involve the re-training of the designated Child Protection liaison officers across all its centres.

Applications are dealt with by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which was established under the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995.  Under section 16 of that Act, where a judicial office stands vacant or before a vacancy in a judicial office arises, the Board submits to me, as Minister for Justice, the names of those recommended for appointment.  The Government then decides the nomination.  Section 17 of the same Act provides that these procedures do not apply where a serving judge is to be appointed.<\/p><p>My Department is engaged in a review of the appointment procedure including consideration of the following issues: the need to ensure and protect the principle of judicial independence; eligibility for appointment; composition of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board; the appointments process; accountability in respect of its functioning; and promoting equality and diversity.<\/p><p><br \/>  I hope to be in a position to consider this further in the course of 2013.  Any proposal to introduce a new system of appointments would require amendments to the current legislation and would, of course, be a matter for consideration by Government in the first instance.<\/p><p><br \/>  Article 35.4.1<b><\/b>of the Constitution provides that a member of the judiciary can only be removed from their position<i> &quot;for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only upon resolutions passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann calling for his removal<\/i>'.  The tenure of Circuit and District Judges is similarly protected by statute.  No judge has been so removed in the history of the State.<\/p><p><br \/>  However, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to legislate to establish a Judicial Council in order to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints against judges.  This commitment is being given expression in the form of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.  As well as providing for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board that will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, the proposed Bill aims to provide a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct in the form of a Judicial Conduct Committee, which will have lay representation.<\/p><p><br \/>  In November 2011, the Chief Justice announced that the judiciary had agreed to establish an Interim Judicial Council, pending the publication and enactment of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.  A sub-committee of the Board of the Interim Judicial Council was subsequently established to consider the 'General Scheme for a Judicial Council Bill', a version of which had been published by the previous Government in August 2010.  This sub-committee has already provided observations, which are the subject of ongoing consideration.  Recent developments will also be taken into account in the collaborative drafting process between my Department and the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General.

This fee is set by regulations made by the Minister for Justice and Equality with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The fee was first introduced in 2006 and was then set at &euro;100. It was increased to &euro;150 in 2008 and has remained at that level until the latest increase came into effect on 19 November, 2012.<\/p><p>  The introduction of the registration fee in May, 2006 resulted from a policy decision that the fee income was required for the ongoing development of immigration services (both in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). Our migrant population have made a valuable contribution to the economic, cultural and social life of Ireland and will continue to do so. However, I believe that it is not unreasonable to ask those who benefit from the immigration system to make a reasonable contribution to the cost of services and particularly so in a time when we are seeking to reduce public expenditure.  It is common practice throughout Europe to charge a fee for immigration services; in some instances these may be set at a level above the estimated direct administrative cost of the service based on the value of the service.  By comparison with many jurisdictions the current registration fee represents very good value.<\/p><p>  I am very conscious of the need to maintain and develop good service levels to customers. In this regard the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is undertaking a number of projects with the aim of developing and improving immigration services.  These include the introduction of a new common format EU Residence Permit for non-nationals which will replace the current registration certificate. It will provide the user with a more secure immigration document including individual biometrics indicators protected by a sophisticated encryption system and showing the holders&rsquo; immigration status in the State. This high quality secure document will be easily recognisable for employers and Government agencies.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, INIS as part of its reform of in-country aspects of immigration services, is developing a range of measures including on line application and appointment systems for certain services. Such a service is badly needed, but it does cost money to implement. The nature of immigration requirements such as registration necessitates, to a very great extent, the personal attendance of the applicant. At certain times of the year this can give rise to long queues and significant delays. A self-selecting on-line system will help to greatly alleviate these difficulties and the increased registration fee income will be used to meet a portion of the cost involved in this and other developments.<\/p><p>  Other projects being progressed are proposals for the civilianisation of certain port of entry functions at Dublin Airport. For this purpose, a trial is underway at Dublin airport to test the feasibility of a new model for delivery of immigration services at ports of entry to the State by using a combination of civilian staff and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I refer the Deputy to my answer to D&aacute;il Question No. 171 of 4th October, 2012 which sets out the latest position in respect of this project.<\/p><p>  The fee increase itself will be used to defray some of the costs of providing and developing these services to migrants.<\/p><p>  While there is no specific requirement to do so, advance notice of the fee increase was placed on the INIS website and displayed in the Public Office in Burgh Quay. It is an unavoidable consequence that people seeking to register will fall on either side of the fee increase introduction.<\/p><p>  For the sake of completeness, I should point out that in recognition of the circumstances of certain categories of person, there are specific exemptions from paying the registration fee set out in the regulations; these are the following: UN Convention Refugees; Family members of such refugees who have been admitted to the State in accordance with section  18 of the Refugee Act 1996; Persons who are under 18 years of age at the time of registration; Spouses, civil partners, widows and widowers of Irish citizens; Spouses and Dependants of EU nationals who receive a residence permit under EU Directive 38\/04; Programme Refugees, as defined by section 24 of the Refugee Act, 1996; Persons subject to arrangements for victims of human trafficking.  The above categories of non-nationals exempted from the fee payment are almost 20% of the total numbers registering. Last year alone, this amounted to 21,443 persons and &euro;3.2 million in fees waived.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100079#WRB05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Seeker Accommodation","counter":82,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100080#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":83,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[54474\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100080#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to address the concerns set out in the recent Irish Refugee Council report on conditions in State-funded accommodation for those seeking asylum.","asker":"984","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":84,"content":"<p>The Irish Refugee Council (IRC) Report, which was launched in September, summarises many of the criticisms which have been made of the Direct Provision system since its inception over 12 years ago, concentrating specifically on issues relating to children. The report makes a number of recommendations for change to the direct provision system.  Some of the recommendations - such as allowing asylum seekers work after 12 months, reinstating child benefit, allowing residents to choose and prepare meals themselves - are at odds with long standing Government policy in dealing with the issue of asylum, a key pillar of which is the Direct Provision system. I, and previous Ministers for Justice and Equality, have explained in response to previous D&aacute;il Questions how the normal structures dealing with homelessness could not cope when the number of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland increased dramatically, and how the Direct Provision system was the only realistic accommodation solution.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to children living in a safe environment, the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department, charged with running the Direct Provision system, takes the issue of child welfare, and the protection of residents generally, very seriously.  All staff in centres must be Garda vetted and comply with RIA's Children Protection policy.  One recommendation in the IRC report refers to the need for accommodation centres to be in good condition and that heating, hot water and cleanliness should be guaranteed.  This recommendation is, in fact, a condition to be met by all contracted to provide accommodation. RIA has in place contractual obligations in this regard, backed up by an inspection system which has been described in answers to previous D&aacute;il Questions.<\/p><p><br \/>  The report recommends that RIA should consult with families in relation to their religious and cultural needs before being dispersed to an accommodation centre.  RIA does not, and will not, designate centres as being specifically for one ethnic or cultural group.  The key objective for RIA is the provision of accommodation and coordination of services to asylum seekers who would otherwise be homeless. The system must operate within the inevitable constraint that RIA can only accommodate persons in centres where suitable vacancies exist.  RIA will always consult management in accommodation centres who have knowledge of local services and who will advise newly arrived persons of cultural and religious facilities in the area.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to the issue of space generally, including the sharing of bedrooms and toilet facilities, there are a number of things to be said. Firstly, in sourcing accommodation RIA must ensure that the basic legal conditions, in terms of capacity and toilet and bathroom facilities, are met.  Secondly, in relation to room sharing, where it comes to RIA's attention that accommodation is not suitable for a family where, for example, its size has increased, alternative accommodation in another centre is offered.  In some cases, this offer is not accepted and families prefer to stay in a centre. Thirdly, in relation to families having to share bathrooms, a majority of families living in the system have sole access to their own bathroom and toilet facilities. Whilst the nature of Direct Provision is such that en suite facilities are not guaranteed, RIA will continue to seek over time to increase the percentage of families having access to non-shared bathroom\/toilet facilities.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to the recommendation regarding education, in addition to all asylum seeker children being able to avail of mainstream primary and secondary education, they may also avail of the Department of Social Protection's Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance. Further supports are provided to families through the Community Welfare service in the form of Exceptional Needs Payments (ENP's) to address once-off needs, including funding child-related activities. Children in pre-school year also avail of free placements in pre-schools under the Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme. Pre-schools are available on-site at some of the larger centres but the choice of pre-school under the scheme is a matter for the individual parents to decide.  In relation to the recommendation regarding homework space, all family centres with school going children are asked to set aside a quiet space where children can do their homework under parental supervision.<\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of play spaces for children, the Direct Provision system is roughly analogous to other types of accommodation where children would reside, be it houses with gardens or apartment buildings. Some centres have on-site playgrounds and some do not. Children in centres can access recreational facilities available in the locality in which they are living.   Centre management work with local schools, community groups, sports clubs and NGOs to link children and families into community initiatives, sports and other activities to ensure access to the best available package of services. Many centres will, for example, facilitate parties and will also facilitate NGOs who organise outings etc.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Direct Provision system has been subject to criticism since its inception, and every effort is made to improve the system.  RIA welcomes scrutiny in this regard. But it important also to acknowledge that no asylum seeker who has sought international protection from this State has ever been left homeless; that residents get nourishment on a par with, and in some cases superior to, that available  to the general population; that they receive a health service on the same basis as Irish citizens; and that children are provided with primary and secondary education in the local community on the same basis as the children of Irish citizens.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to the broader asylum issue, particularly the complexity and length of the associated processes, my efforts are concentrated on<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b>speeding up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill which I plan to progress in 2013 provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State. This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements. This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100080#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Releases","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100080#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[54468\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100080#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to place on a statutory footing, clear and transparent criteria for release of prisoners through remission, temporary release and parole, as well as provision of the disclosure of reasons to prisoners for all decisions taken and the remedy to appeal any decision taken.","asker":"1028","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[54467\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100080#WRC00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to introduce a single piece of legislation dealing with the matters of remission, temporary release and parole law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1028","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":88,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 100 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  The power bestowed on the Minister for Justice and Equality  to grant remission and temporary release is clearly set out in existing legislative instruments.   Rule 59 of the 2007 prison rules provides that a prisoner is eligible by good conduct to earn a remission of sentence not exceeding one quarter. Rule 59(2) allows for the discretionary granting of remission in excess of one quarter but not exceeding one third where a prisoner has shown good conduct by engaging in authorised structured activity<b><\/b>and as a result is less likely to offend and better able to reintegrate into the community.  The legislative basis for making decisions on temporary release is fully set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.<\/p><p><br \/>  The legislation sets out clearly the purpose of temporary release, the situations in which it may be granted and the criteria to apply  to decisions to grant temporary release.  Candidates for temporary release are identified by a number of different means but primarily on the recommendation of the Prison Governor or the therapeutic services in the prisons. The prisoner, their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. Recommendations are also made to me in relation to long term sentence prisoners by the Parole Board. Each application is considered on its individual merits and evaluated using the following criteria as outlined in the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003: the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates; the sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposed; the period of the sentence served by the person; the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released; the person's previous criminal record; the risk of the person failing to return to prison at the expiration of the period of temporary release; the conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary release; any report or recommendation made by the Governor, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a Probation Officer, or any other person whom the Minister considers may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary release; the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release; the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release; the likelihood that a period of temporary release might accelerate the person's reintegration into society or improve his prospects of obtaining employment.<\/p><p><br \/>  I announced my intention last year to enact legislation to place the interim Parole Board on a statutory footing which I believe will help to strengthen the Board and improve its functions.

Funding in this case was provided from Dormant Accounts monies under the Multi-Annual Investment Programme as announced in Budget 2005.   This funding was provided over five years for disability groups and organisations operating at national \/ regional level who provided details of once-off  projects which showed an innovative, efficient and cost-effective approach to service provision for people with disabilities and which had the capacity to be main streamed in the future.

Other grant funding was provided by my Department to Disability organisations and groups over this period for example to, People with Disabilities in Ireland (PwDI) and Vantastic to assist them to provide services to PWDs.

Such decision making is also guided by, among other things, international law and Supreme and High Court Judgments. The ultimate decision will be to make a Deportation Order or to grant Leave to Remain in the State for a specified period and subject to stated conditions.<\/p><p><br \/>  The consideration of cases under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) is a resource intensive process. It is not, however, possible to provide an average waiting time for the processing of such cases primarily because no two cases will be the same in terms of their nature or complexity. An indication of the complexities involved is outlined in my reply to Parliamentary Question Number 450 of 27th November which is appended below.<\/p><p><br \/>  However, I am anxious that cases are processed as quickly as possible and to this end, additional staff members have been deployed to this area of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in recent years and substantial investment has been made in the development of technology required to support the processing of such cases.   Additionally, the current multi-layered approach to the processing of cases of asylum origin means that persons who claim asylum, and have their claims refused, almost invariably proceed to lodge an application for Subsidiary Protection and if this is also refused, their ultimate position in the State must then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. This multi-layered approach is clearly not resource efficient, nor applicant friendly, and that is why I am providing for a single-procedure based approach in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I plan to progress in 2013. This proposed single-procedure will require applicants to advance, at the outset, all reasons, protection or otherwise, behind their request to stay in the State. As a result, the days of the multi-layered approach to dealing with such cases will cease.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, I might add that I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in processing a cohort of repatriation cases thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the Direct Provision system. I would expect to see significant dividends from this initiative in the coming months.<blockquote><i>Extract from PQ No. 540 of 27th November, 2012<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>The processing of cases at the repatriation stage is a complex one with obligations to adhere to both domestic and international law and to make decisions in accordance with the UN Convention on Human Rights.   The process can be a lengthy one often punctuated with judicial reviews taken by the applicants at various stages including at deportation stage.  Accordingly, not all cases fit neatly into particular categories.  For example, in the case of families, one member of the family may have lodged a judicial review which in turn may mean that the remainder of the family may not be processed until its outcome is determined.   In addition, some applicants may also be party to an application under EU Treaty Rights or through marriage to an Irish citizen or may have been granted leave to remain as a result of these applications.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide figures in respect of the remainder of the case load without engaging in a very detailed exercise which could not be justified as it would divert resources from case processing.  <\/i><\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100080#WRC02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Orders","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100080#WRC02650"},{"type":"question","counter":120,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[54357\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100080#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when he proposes to provide for the commencement of the Section 15 the Fines Act 2000 dealing with the payment of fines by instalments; his plans to deduct fines by instalments from State payments such as social welfare or wages made to a convicted person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":121,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government recently approved the drafting of the Fines (Amendment) Bill 2012, the Scheme of which is available on my Department's website (www.justice.ie).

Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served. It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.<\/p><p>  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty. The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.<\/p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. <\/p><p>  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.<\/p><p>  I believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.<\/p><p>  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law. In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public. My intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided. I am also taking the opportunity to introduce some general improvements to bail law to improve the overall working of the bail system.<\/p><p>  I will bring proposals to Government on the matter in the near future.<\/p><p>  In relation to the statistics requested by the Deputy. the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.

Ireland also requested information on any actions taken or plans to begin a process of reintegration for those in detention following the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka in May 2009, or information on any plans to begin legal proceedings in accordance with due process against those in detention. Finally, Ireland recommended that the Government of Sri Lanka take steps to ensure that all detainees are afforded a fair trial within a reasonable time period.<\/p><p>  There has been a significant development in the case in the past few days where his lawyers informed the person&rsquo;s family that the Sri Lankan authorities would formally charge him on Monday 10 December 2012.

The Directive provides for the reinforcement and harmonisation of the statutory audit function throughout the EU.  It clarifies the duties of statutory auditors and provides for their independence and ethical standards; introduces a requirement for external quality assurance; provides for public oversight of the audit profession, including third country auditors, and improved cooperation between oversight bodies in the EU. It also provides a basis for international cooperation between regulators in the EU and in third countries. It also requires listed companies to set up an audit committee with clear functions to perform.<\/p><p>  By means of S.I. No. 220 of 20th May, 2010, effect was given to those aspects of Directive 2006\/43\/EC not already provided for in Company Law.  <\/p><p>  In relation to financial regulatory practices, the Central Bank Reform Act 2010,  replaced the previously related bodies, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, with a single unitary body, the Central Bank of Ireland (the Bank) and provided for new powers to be exercised by the Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers. <\/p><p>  Following on from the Central Bank Reform Act, 2010, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill was published in July 2011. The bill enhances the Central Bank&rsquo;s regulatory powers, drawing on the lessons of the recent past in Ireland and abroad, and strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.  The bill also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice. The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 is expected to be enacted in the first quarter of 2013.<\/p><p>  During 2011, the Bank updated its action plan for strengthening supervision of credit institutions across a comprehensive range of areas. As part of its supervisory work, the Bank launched PRISM (Probability Risk and Impact System), its new risk assessment framework which establishes a new adaptive approach for supervisory engagement with regulated firms.<\/p><p>  The Bank published a revised Consumer Protection Code in October 2011.

Failure to adhere to the terms and conditions of the licence may lead to proceedings under the Central Bank&rsquo;s Administrative Sanctions Procedures, which enable the Central Bank to sanction and fine regulated entities for breaches of regulatory requirements.  Since 1 December 2011, licensed moneylenders are also subject to a fitness and probity regime. The Central Bank undertook a themed inspection of licensed moneylenders in 2010. The main findings were that, overall there was a high level of compliance among firms and that consumers were charged in accordance with moneylenders&rsquo; authorised APRs and costs of credit. The Central Bank carried out another themed inspection of moneylenders recently and is currently finalising reports. <\/p><p>  Interest rates charged are not regulated by the Central Bank so each institution determines the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors, including risk.

Furthermore, the Cabinet handbook requires a statement on the likely effects of the decision sought on equality and persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion to be included in Memoranda to Government.  Consequently, Government does consider each of these important issues at an individual policy or programme level. I would also remind the Deputy that the State and its bodies take the provisions of equality legislation into account in the development and delivery of its policies and services.<\/p><p>  In addition, a distributional analysis of proposed budget measures is performed each year based on various income levels for the different categories of income earners, for example single individuals, married one-earner couples with no children and married one-earner couples with children.  A distributional analysis which models the impacts on disposable income by income decile using SWITCH, the ESRI Tax-Benefit model, is also undertaken in evaluating various budgetary options.  Illustrative examples are contained in the Budget 2013 document.<\/p><p>  With regard to Regulatory Impact Analysis, although it can potentially benefit all policy areas\/regulations, it is not compulsory to apply RIA to the Finance Bill. Generally speaking, the revenue measures I introduced as part of Budget 2013 will be given legislative effect through the forth coming Finance Bill.  As detailed in the guidelines the publication of a RIA may not be appropriate in the case of tax law\/regulations or the imposition of charges because of their sensitivity and the need to guard against possible evasion or avoidance.<\/p><p>  Nonetheless, the Revenue Commissioners have an ongoing focus on minimising the administrative burden on business and have recently reported to Government that they have reduced the burden by 25%, saving business over &euro;85 million a year.  Furthermore the latest World Bank report shows that Ireland continues to be the easiest country in the EU in which to pay business taxes.<\/p><p>  The primary objective of Budget 2013 was to reduce further the deficit in our public finances in line with our commitments, since it is not sustainable to continue running such large deficits.  The measures introduced within the Budget are deemed necessary in order to reduce further the deficit in the public finances and so as to ensure continued adherence to fiscal targets set as part of the EU\/IMF Programme. <\/p><p>  The Government has sought to implement the measures required to reduce the deficit in a manner that was as fair and equitable as possible and in a manner that would protect the emerging economic recovery.  While this is a difficult task and one which has required that difficult decisions be made by Government, I am satisfied that we are implementing the necessary adjustments in such a manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100084#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":261,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100084#WRG01150"},{"type":"question","counter":262,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[55565\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100084#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has made an external appointment of an economist to head up his Departments Budget and Economic Policy Division.","asker":"1066","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":263,"content":"<p>To date, no individual has been appointed to the Role of Chief Economist in my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100084#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts","counter":264,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100084#WRG01350"},{"type":"question","counter":265,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[55599\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100084#WRG01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide the following information in relation to IT consultants and IT external resources contracted to undertake IT related work for the Revenue Commissioners, the total number and names of companies working on such projects in the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011; the number of persons supplied by these companies to work on such projects in the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011; the amount paid to each company for these services in the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011; the invoicing contract payment mechanism used, if it is by hour, by project, by person or by a combination of these mechanisms; the verification mechanisms in place to ensure that the invoicing\/contract payment mechanisms reflect work actually carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":266,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total number and names of companies working on IT related work in the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 along with details of the amounts paid to the companies, and the payment basis used, are set out in the following tables.

The position is that in general, individuals whose income is taxed under the PAYE system are not required to submit a tax return annually because by and large it is not necessary.  As the Deputy will be aware, the PAYE system successfully operates to deduct the correct amount of tax in a seamless way from the vast bulk of PAYE employees and pensioners, and their taxable income is reported to Revenue by the employer\/pension provider after the end of the tax year.  In addition, I am advised that the current practice of the Revenue Commissioners is to issue annual returns to specific groups of PAYE taxpayers whom they regard as potentially higher risk cases.  To my mind, this is an efficient and appropriate approach to this matter.  The alternative would require up to 2 million people to prepare and submit tax returns for no obvious benefit, and I would be concerned about the administrative and cost burden on both taxpayers and Revenue if the law was changed to make it mandatory for all PAYE employees to file an annual tax return.<\/p><p>  Regarding State pensioners, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the majority of taxpayers do report details of their State pension entitlements to Revenue, even though they are not obliged to file an annual tax return but, in any event, Revenue now receives information on pensions paid by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  This data exchange allows for the automatic deduction of tax by employers and pension providers on these pensions in appropriate cases.<\/p><p>  Finally, mandatory tax returns would be unlikely to remove the need for means testing, given that means and income are not necessarily the same. However, the Revenue Commissioners further advise that they are currently working with one Government Department and one public sector agency, both of whom conduct means-testing for State benefits to develop an interface that will allow those organisations get a full picture of all income returned to Revenue by the person concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100084#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100084#WRG02000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"F&Aacute;S Training Programmes","counter":273,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100084#WRG01950"},{"type":"question","counter":274,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[55594\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100084#WRG02000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will arrange for F&Aacute;S to offer language courses to unemployed persons in Tallaght, Dublin 24; if he appreciates the importance of such courses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":275,"content":"<p>I am informed by F&Aacute;S that their Training Services in Tallaght focus on delivering vocational training and do not deliver programmes which solely focus on language skills.<\/p><p>  I understand that students at third level currently have access to a wide range of foreign language courses that can be taken as core subjects or in combination with a range of other disciplines.

One of its features is that the State Junior Certificate examination will be replaced, in a phased manner over the next eight years, by a new school-based approach to assessment in line with best practice internationally.  The Framework includes a number of measures to support and quality assure standards for the school based assessment across the three years of junior cycle.  The Junior Certificate is no longer a high stakes examination, unlike the GCSE in England and Wales, as the vast majority of Junior Certificate students progress on to senior cycle and present for the Leaving Certificate examination at the end of senior cycle.<\/p><p>  The State Examinations Commission will provide final assessment papers and marking schemes for subjects until the new school-based system of assessment is established.  For English, Irish and mathematics they will continue in the interim to also mark the examination papers.  The NCCA is developing an Assessment and Moderation Toolkit that teachers, students and parents can use to support the new emphasis on school-based assessment.  A comprehensive professional development service will be provided from 2013\/2014 for teachers of each subject as the new specifications for the Framework are phased in from 2014-2017.  The CPD will cover new approaches to teaching and learning but particular attention will be given to assessment modes which include both assessment for learning and assessment of learning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100084#WRG02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Recognition","counter":288,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100084#WRG02950"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[55087\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100084#WRG03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will report on the progress made to date on the move towards permanent recognition of a school (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"975","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":290,"content":"<p>In the case of  the school, referred to by the Deputy, provisional recognition was initially awarded to the school in 2008 and has been extended year on year since.

The Guidelines, which are being launched shortly, were developed by a Working Group with representation from Teacher Education Section\/Inspectorate, SPHE Support Service, National Psychological Service (NEPS) all from this Department along with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive\/National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP).  The NOSP and the DES funded their development.<\/p><p>  The Guidelines were developed following a process of wide consultation with key education partners and are informed by the findings of the consultation process and recent research.  The Guidelines provide practical guidance on how post-primary schools can promote mental health and well-being and school connectedness in an integrated way, which are critical to young people's success in school and in life. The Guidelines also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. Information is also provided in the Guidelines relating to accessing support from external agencies and support services.<\/p><p>  The Guidelines are for all members of the school community, boards of management and in-school management teams who play a central leadership role in mental health promotion. They will also be useful for parents' associations, student councils, health and other personnel who are seeking an understanding of how to work in and with schools.<\/p><p>  The key to successful implementation of these Guidelines lies in taking a coordinated whole-school approach. This involves building and integrating school self-evaluation processes, implementing the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, developing the whole-school guidance plan, adopting the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support, and building effective inter-agency relationships.<\/p><p>  The Guidelines draw together the various elements that provide for effective student support and build on the significant work already taking place in schools.

The aim of the Action Pan for Jobs is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of Pathways to Work is to ensure that as many of those jobs as possible go to those who are currently unemployed.  The Government&rsquo;s approach is a national one across all regions and there are no plans to set up Regional Task Forces.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan contains over 270 individual actions to be delivered in 2012, spanning all Government Departments and 36 State agencies.  The 270 actions are broken down further into Quarterly deliverables or &ldquo;measures&rdquo; which are reported on at the end of each Quarter.  Approximately 60% of the measures in the Action Plan for Jobs are for delivery by my Department or its agencies.  To the end of the third Quarter this year, around 130 measures had been implemented by my Department and its agencies, giving a delivery rate of approximately 97%.  <\/p><p>  Some significant objectives have been realised, including the establishment of a Microfinance Fund for small business, the introduction of a Partial Credit Guarantee scheme, new supports for first time exporters, the launch of a new Women-In-Business Programme, the simplification and extension of the Employer&rsquo;s PRSI Exemption Scheme, the launch of a National Broadband Plan, the piloting of a Health Innovation Hub, and work being undertaken to develop sectors such as Cloud Computing, Digital Games, Manufacturing, and the Green Economy.<\/p><p>  So far this year, the IDA has announced investments with the potential to create more than 9,000 further jobs as these projects come on stream.  In the first eight months of this year, a total of 7,094 job commitments over the next three years, linked to Enterprise Ireland approvals to client companies, were secured. <\/p><p>  Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of the Government&rsquo;s plans for jobs and growth.  On 21 November, I announced that primary legislation will be drafted to dissolve the existing County and City Enterprise Boards and create an enhanced national micro enterprise support model, delivered through Local Enterprise Offices to be established in each Local Authority office.  <\/p><p>  The labour market activation measures outlined in Pathways to Work include over 85,000 job placements and work experience places to be delivered this year by the Department of Social Protection, and over 450,000 training and education places to be delivered by the Department of Education and Skills.  The Pathways to Work initiative has an objective of ensuring that at least 75,000 of those currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015.  It also aims to reduce the average time spent on the Live Register from 21 months, to less than 12 months by the end of 2015.<\/p><p>  We will continue to do all we can to facilitate the return to work of those who have lost their jobs.

I repeated this assurance personally to the person concerned when I met him and a delegation from the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and SIPTU.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will note that the Government did not oppose Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Private Member&rsquo;s Bill as it concurs with our objectives - to ensure that outcome of the High Court case will not arise again. <\/p><p>  The issue raised by the High Court judgement is one which has important policy and legal implications in the area of Employment Permits and also in terms of Employment Rights.  The question that arises for policy makers is to what extent such workers should be dissuaded from working illegally in Ireland by virtue of there being a statutory offence to do so, versus, to what extent should certain employment rights protect vulnerable migrants who find themselves unwittingly in such employment positions.  My Department has received preliminary legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General counselling that the judgement raises matters that are particularly complex.  These matters are currently receiving priority attention with a view to identifying the best way in which the legislation may be amended. <\/p><p>  It is my firm intention to amend the Employment Permits legislation in a precise manner so as to ensure that an employer may not benefit from the illegality of the contract of employment where they are found culpable in not ensuring a valid employment permit was in place for the employee concerned.  To this end, I hope to be in a position to propose the necessary provisions in a new Employment Permits Bill, currently being drafted and which is anticipated to be introduced in the first quarter of next year.  I believe that this would be the most appropriate method of dealing with such a technically specific matter.  Decisions on the legal options will be made in light of further legal advice and in consultation with other Government departments.

It does not mean that unscrupulous employers can employ unauthorised third country nationals without running the risk of significant legal consequences.  I would emphasise that an employer who engages in this type of activity is open to prosecution under the Employment Permits legislation and could be found guilty of an offence and liable on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;250,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both.

The manufacturing process is under continual assessment, as long as the Certificate and certification agreement remains in place; this ensures consistency of production with the conditions of the Certificate issued.  The Clause does not infer that a specific unit &ldquo;continues to be assessed&rdquo; for its lifetime.  <\/p><p>  Part 4 Section 4.4 is a general statement about the expected lifespan of a product.

The Act also prohibits traders from engaging in misleading commercial practices and\/or prescribed prohibited practices as defined by the legislation.

As a result, ordinary employees can build entitlement towards the full range of social welfare benefits.

His average earnings were calculated having regard to his earnings in the year ended 31 December 2011, the latest available P60.

The income from his P60 was used in his FIS assessment as this gave a more representative view of his net income over a longer period of time resulting in him qualifying for a more favourable rate of FIS.   Based on his P60, the net weekly income of the person concerned was assessed at &euro;256, which for a family with two children qualifies him for a weekly FIS rate of &euro;208.00 for 52 weeks from 30th August 2012 to 28th   August 2012.  <\/p><p>  From the information submitted with your question, it appears that the income of the person concerned changed again from October 2012.

This internship position, reference: 710310 was for a Marketing Executive.   The advert went live on the JobBridge website on 21<sup>st<\/sup>   August 2012. Our records indicate that nobody has been selected by the company to start this internship. This was communicated via email to an official of UNITE and Deputy Joe Higgins, in the respective email responses from the JobBridge Central Unit. UNITE was invited to contact the JobBridge unit in the event of any further queries or concerns in this regard and that staff in the unit would assist further.  My Department has not to date received a response to the email correspondence sent to UNITE and Deputy Higgins on this matter. <\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, UNITE and the Deputy were also advised that Chartered Accountants Ireland submitted an additional five internship vacancies but these were rejected by the JobBridge team as they did not meet the Scheme&#8217;s quality criteria. <\/p><p><br \/>  The terms and conditions for participation in JobBridge are stringent to ensure that strong systems and controls are in place.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In order to protect the Intern and to ensure the integrity of the JobBridge Scheme a variety of control measures and criteria have been introduced. These ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; that it provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the Intern.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Firstly, the Standard Agreement signed and agreed to by both the Intern and the host organisation upon commencement clearly states the terms of the internship; including the expected working hours, which can range from 30 &#8211; 40 hours (maximum) per week and the specific learning outcomes the intern will gain over the course of their internship.<\/p><p><br \/>  Secondly, to ensure that both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme, the Department of Social Protection are involved in the on-going monitoring of internships. This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and the conducting of random monitoring site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the internship. I am delighted to advise that 97% of monitoring visits conducted to-date were of a satisfactory nature. Remedial action has been taken in cases where the visit was deemed not to be of a satisfactory nature<\/p><p><br \/>  Consequently, it is worth noting that participation in the Scheme is voluntary and an intern may contact the JobBridge Team at any stage of their internship for advice and support<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100089#WRM04800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Appeals","counter":549,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100089#WRM04900"},{"type":"question","counter":550,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[55270\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100089#WRM05000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision will issue in respect of an appeal for jobseeker's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 6; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1027","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":551,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an Appeals Officer having fully considered all the available evidence disallowed the appeal of the person concerned by way of summary decision.

Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.  The recent Budget announcement has no impact on the level of statutory redundancy payable to employees who are being made redundant.<\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all their eligible employees.  An employer who pays statutory redundancy payments to their employees is currently entitled to a rebate of a portion of that payment from the State.  Where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department that it is unable to pay the statutory redundancy to its eligible employees the Department will make lump sum payments directly to those employees and will seek to recover the debt from the employer.  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).<\/p><p>  Significant and increasing amounts have been paid out in redundancy rebates to employers from the SIF in recent years.  While the SIF is constituted primarily from employer contributions, the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution is also significant.  One of the factors which influenced the Government&rsquo;s decisions to revise the rebate rate last year and now to remove the rebate was the increasing cost of rebates in recent years.  I am very concerned about the deficit in the SIF.  In terms of redundancy rebate payments to employers, &euro;152.2 million was paid out in 2006; &euro;167.4 million in 2007; &euro;161.8 million in 2008; &euro;247.9 million in 2009; &euro;373.2 million in 2010 and &euro;185.3 million in 2011.  The amounts paid out in lump sums to employees have also increased.<\/p><p>  As a result of the changes announced in Budget 2013 no rebate will be payable to employers in cases where the date of dismissal by reason of redundancy occurs on or after 1 January 2013.  The 15% rebate will continue to apply to those cases on hand and those which will be received in the coming months where the date of dismissal is on or between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012.

Indeed, in the context of reduced resources and the current economic climate, the key challenge is to prioritise and reduce the cost of service delivery, without compromising on the delivery of services to the public and to employees.<\/p><p>  To date, my Department has moved its entire payroll and payment processing function to the Killarney Shared Service.

We are currently reviewing the business processes and services provided at those sites and examining options around external service delivery.  The overall objective will of course be to continue delivering a quality service to our customers at these sites.<\/p><p>  It might also be noted that across the heritage services for which this Department is responsible, the Department already outsources and uses external service providers for technical advice, engineering services and some architectural services and this has proved very cost effective.  In the context of the staffing gaps and expertise gaps arising in the Department in recent times, including the need to refocus and prioritise work, we are examining further options and possible alternative delivery mechanisms in order to achieve cost savings and to have prompt access as required to specific technical skills.

The NERP option was chosen because it provided both an environmentally ambitious and a cost-effective compliance route for Ireland. The ESB and other national operators made a commitment to achieve emission limits for SO<sub>2<\/sub> and NO<sub>x<\/sub> from existing plants that were significantly more ambitious than the minimum requirements of the LCPD.

The only effective way to combat organised crime is by disrupting and prosecuting those involved in its operations, and especially the drugs trade which is at the heart of much of its profits.  There have been extensive Garda operations launched against gangs as well as significant drug seizures in recent months and weeks with drugs seizures estimated at &euro;90.4m for the first nine months of this year.<\/p><p>  We shouldn't underestimate the difficulties the Garda&iacute; face in trying to prevent gangland killings and related crimes and in bringing the perpetrators to justice.  These crimes are carefully planned and are carried out by people who are very familiar with criminal and forensic investigation techniques.  Moreover, despite the clear risk to themselves, members of gangs will not generally cooperate with Garda investigations.<\/p><p>  It would be wrong to characterise this as a budgetary matter.  There has been gangland violence for some time in Ireland, and the number of murders was in fact higher when Garda numbers were higher than they are now.  It is also unrealistic to expect that the Commissioner would devote his entire resources, to individually protecting people who are routinely trying to avoid the Garda&iacute; so that they can continue to engage in criminal activity.  Such an approach could only come at the expense of ordinary Garda activity to protect the community generally.  We should also remember that week in week out the Garda&iacute; are successfully bringing people involved in gangland activities before the Courts, securing convictions and that a substantial number are presently serving their sentences in prison.<\/p><p>  There is already very strong anti-gangland legislation in place.  As Minister I will continue to pursue important improvements to our overall legislative architecture.  In this regard, the legislative priority for combating crime is the publication and enactment of a new Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill.  This Bill represents a major step forward in the fight against serious crime.  It will lead to the establishment, for the first time, of a national DNA database in Ireland.  It will give the Garda&iacute; access to intelligence on a scale and of a quality that was not previously been available in this country.<\/p><p>  Finally I have made it clear to the Garda Commissioner that, if he feels there are other measures which might be taken in this area, then I will look at that very positively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100094#WRR03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":767,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100095#WRS00150"},{"type":"question","counter":768,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[55138\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100095#WRS00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the date on which legislation will be introduced to allow charities to make their financial accounts information public; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":769,"content":"<p>The Charities Act 2009 was enacted with the objective of strengthening the regulation of charitable organisations and increasing their transparency and accountability in order to maintain and enhance public confidence in the sector.

A full list of these charities is available to the public at www.revenue.ie. Many charities are companies limited by guarantee and, as such, are also subject to the provisions of company law and are generally required to provide financial information to the Companies Registration Office under the Companies Acts. This information can then be accessed by the public. Such charities would also potentially be subject to scrutiny by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Charities that take the form of a trust are subject to the provisions of trust law. And, of course, any business entity is subject to general criminal and fraud legislation.  Finally, it is of course open to charities themselves to make such information available in line with existing legislative provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100095#WRS00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":770,"content":"<p>Question No. 321 answered with Question No. 61.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":771,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100095#WRS00450"},{"type":"question","counter":772,"qnumday":322,"qnumall":"[55150\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100095#WRS00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding an application for a permanent residence card in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":773,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his earlier Parliamentary Question No. 188 of 15 November, 2012, which relates to the same person.

The provision of a gross budget of &euro;333.8 million for the Prisons Vote includes a capital allocation of &euro;24 million which will allow construction work on the much needed new prison in Cork to commence in 2013, as well as other essential refurbishment and construction works in Mountjoy and Limerick Prisons.<\/p><p>  The Prison Service is continuing with a refurbishment and in-cell sanitation project in Mountjoy Prison. The Refurbishment of the C and B wings have been completed resulting in 317 cells in the prison having in-cell sanitation (almost 60% of the total prison) and a significantly improved physical environment. A tender for the refurbishment of the prison's A wing is currently under evaluation and a contract is expected to be placed before the end of this year. The project will take 9 months to complete. The Prison Service is developing its plans for the modernisation of the D wing together with a range of supporting facilities for the prison such as workshops, kitchens laundry etc. It is expected that this final phase in the renewal of Mountjoy prison will go to tender in July 2013 and that the entire programme will be completed in April 2015.<\/p><p>  The new facility in Cork will be built on a site immediately adjacent to the existing prison and will house 275 prisoners and have a maximum capacity of  310 prisoners.

Construction of the new prison will take approximately 2 years and, allowing for commissioning of systems etc.,  it is expected that the new prison will be operational by September 2015.  In addition, the Irish Prison Service is preparing plans for the demolition of the early 19th century A and B wings of Limerick Prison and their replacement with modern cellular accommodation on a site adjacent to the prison. The new development  will include full in-cell sanitation, showers and a range of ancillary facilities. Following the necessary approval, planning and tender processes, it is hoped that construction will commence in August\/September  2013 with completion\/commissioning in June\/July early 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100095#WRS02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":804,"content":"<p>Question No. 333 answered with Question No. 71.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services","counter":805,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100095#WRS02750"},{"type":"question","counter":806,"qnumday":334,"qnumall":"[55435\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100095#WRS02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 237 of 4 December 2012, if he will provide a list of all new services across his Department that have been tested for external service delivery since March 2011.","asker":"1008","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":807,"content":"<p>My Department is committed to achieving a focused and integrated approach to external service delivery of non-core processes with the objective of reducing cost and focusing staff on priority areas as agreed by the Government last July.

The purpose of the discussion document is to facilitate a public consultation process. Chapter 5 sets out four broad approaches to legislative policy on prostitution, for discussion.  On its publication, the discussion document was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.

There are differing and genuinely held views on the appropriate legislative response to prostitution.  The consultation process must be and be seen to be objective, transparent, open-minded and fair.   For further background, I am appending the text of my statement of 22 June last when publishing the discussion document.<\/p><p><br \/>  Shatter Announces Publication of Discussion Document on the Future Direction of Legislation on Prostitution<\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence today published a discussion document on the future direction of legislation on prostitution. Publication of the discussion document follows the Minister&#8217;s announcement that he would be arranging a public consultation process as part of the current review of prostitution legislation. Announcing publication of the discussion document, Minister Shatter said:<\/p><p><br \/>  &quot;The criminal law in this area is being reviewed primarily because of the changed nature of prostitution in Ireland. Prostitution was once mainly a street-based phenomenon. That is no longer the case. The organisation of prostitution is now much more sophisticated, highly mobile and is easily facilitated by the use of mobile phones and the internet.<\/p><p><br \/>  There is, of course, already a clear consensus on the great evils of child prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. However, I am aware that there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution. While there is a significant amount of criminal legislation in this area already, there is always scope for change and improvement. It is important to review the law periodically to ensure it is up to date and comprehensively responds to altered circumstances.&quot;<\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister added that:\u00a0  &quot;Prostitution is an issue which affects individuals, communities and society as a whole. It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course. Public debate should therefore, be open to the widest possible audience and I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so. It is for that reason I have decided on a consultation process before charting the way forward.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department will hold a conference in the autumn to discuss the document. The widest possible participation will be encouraged in order that we have an open and transparent discussion on all aspects of this very important issue.  \u00a0<\/p><p><br \/>  This discussion document will now be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. Interested groups and members of the public, I expect, will be invited to make submissions to the Committee which will hold such hearings as it deems appropriate. I am asking Mr. David Stanton T.D., Chairman of the Joint Committee, that it publish its report and recommendations by the 30th November 2012 and that the report be furnished to me together with any submissions received. I expect it is likely that the Committee&#8217;s report will also be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and that a debate on it will subsequently take place in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad. The report received by me from the Joint Oireachtas Committee will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary new legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course.  \u00a0<\/p><p><br \/>  I look forward to the results of the consultation process.&quot;  \u00a0<\/p><p><br \/>  The discussion document is attached below and will be made available on the Department&#8217;s website,\u00a0<i>\u00a0<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  This discussion document does not favour any particular approach but simply tries to assist reflection.

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.   On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.<\/p><p><br \/>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the new Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.   <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  An average of 38% of the prison population attended educational classes in 2011.  The development of vocational training programmes in recent years means that there are now over 100 workshops capable of catering for in excess of 1,000 prisoners each day.  Returns at the end of November 2012 show that approximately 24% of the prison population were engaged in vocational training programmes.

The owner of the vessel has consistently said that the paperwork supplied and the expert employed to survey the vessel at the time of purchase indicated that there was no problem with the stability of the vessel. I understand that vessel in question<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  failed a stability test by the Marine Survey Office (MSO) of the Department of Transport in 2009.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The failures in the stability of the fishing vessel were determined after its purchase by the new Irish owner.  The reality that these failures were not detected at the time of purchase by the new owner is a private matter between the owners and the sellers of the vessel and the relevant experts involved in surveying and certifying the vessel, none of which are employed by the State or were acting on behalf of the State.  The State does not have responsibility for the failures in this private business transaction, no matter how unfortunate the case may be. I am sympathetic to the very unfortunate situation that the owner finds himself in but it is not due to any failure on the part of the State and there are no remedies open to me to address the situation in which the vessel owner finds himself.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has no function in this safety matter, other than that the Sea Fishing Boat Licensing Authority must ensure that a vessel has a Fishing Vessel Safety Certificate prior to licensing.  The Authority is not empowered to vary or indeed waive the legal safety requirements set down by the Maritime Safety Directorate of the Department of Transport.<\/p><p><br \/>  To resolve the stability problems of his vessel, I understand that the owner lengthened his vessel by 6 metres. As the vessel was larger, the owner requires additional capacity to licence the vessel. Capacity is a privately owned tradeable asset and my Department has no direct role in that private market.  In February 2011, in order to licence the vessel without purchasing the additional capacity required, the owner made an application for &#8216;safety tonnage&#8217; to the Registrar General of Fishing Boats. I understand that the Registrar is awaiting certification of the modifications to the vessel from the Marine Survey Office before a decision is made in relation to the safety tonnage application.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The owner previously made a request to my Department to be granted a scallop authorisation and effort allocation in order to allow the owner to participate in the scallop fisheries<i>. <\/i> Under the national policy for the fishing fleet, vessels permitted to participate in the scallop fishery are ring fenced within the fleet and only vessels with the necessary scallop entitlement in their sea fishing boat licence are permitted to participate in that fishery.  The vessel in question is registered in the Beamer segment of the Irish Fishing Fleet and does not have the necessary track record to be licensed in the scallop sub-segments of the fleet.  The owner&#8217;s proposal would require that the vessel would be licensed in the Polyvalent (scallop sub segment) or Specific (scallop sub segment) segments. There is no scope in the national policy to transfer from the Beamer segment to the Polyvalent or Specific segments, other than by providing 100% capacity from those segments with the required scallop track record.  This capacity is a privately owned tradeable asset on the open market and must be provided at a ratio of 1:1 as part of the licensing process.    <\/p><p><br \/>  Fleet policy, including policy on segmentation of the fleet, is set by me under section 3(2) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, as amended by section 99 of the Sea Fisheries Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  I am precluded by that Act from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case or group of cases with which the Licensing Authority is or may be concerned.  It is not an option, therefore, for me to amend national policy on segmentation of the fleet for the purpose of assisting the owner in moving to another segment of the fleet, no matter how sympathetic I may be to his situation. The same situation applies in relation to requests from the owner to move to the Refrigerated Sea Water Segment Pelagic segment of the fleet.<\/p><p><br \/>  More recently, the owner of the vessel has expressed a desire to decommission his vessel.  Decommissioning of fishing vessels is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1198\/2006   (EFF Regulation) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 498\/2007 which provides for rules implementing schemes co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund. Article 23 of the EFF Regulation provides for the European Fisheries Fund to contribute to financing of the permanent cessation of fishing activities of fishing vessels, provided that such cessation forms part of a Fishing Effort Adjustment Plan prepared by the Member State and approved by the Commission as part of the Member State&#8217;s Operational Programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  There is at present no decommissioning scheme in operation. The last decommissioning scheme for vessels was undertaken in 2008 and implemented the fleet restructuring objectives set out in the National Strategic Plan for the Fisheries Sector 2007-2013, prepared in accordance with Article 15 of the EFF Regulation and which was submitted to and adopted by the Commission.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The 2008 Decommissioning Scheme required that a vessel be registered\/licensed, comply with all relevant legislation, be capable of putting to sea at the time of application and have carried out fishing activity for at least 75 days at sea in both of two periods of 12 months preceding 31 December 2007, or have carried out a fishing activity for at least 150 days at sea in the 12 month period preceding 31 December 2007.  The Scheme sought to remove active fishing vessels and their fishing capacity from the fleet register to reduce fishing effort in certain whitefish fisheries and thereby improve the viability of the fisheries for other active vessels.  I understand that the vessel in question has not been licensed since 30 September 2009 and is therefore not an active vessel. Should a new decommissioning scheme be introduced at a future date with similar eligibility requirements, the vessel would not qualify under its present circumstances.  <\/p><p><br \/>  A new decommissioning scheme for any category of vessels or more generally could only be considered where a strong case has been made by the fishing industry representative bodies and that case was considered valid and the most appropriate use of scarce funds available for the development of the seafood sector, including the limited co-funding available from the European Fisheries Fund.  It is likely that a revised Fishing Effort Adjustment Plan would be required and this would need to be approved by the European Commission.  I have no plans at this time to introduce such a scheme which would in any event have to target a category or categories of vessels based on a range of broad and transparent criteria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100096#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services","counter":1019,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100096#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1020,"qnumday":408,"qnumall":"[55424\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100096#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 237 of 4 December 2012, if he will provide a list of all new services across his Department that have been tested for external service delivery since March 2011.","asker":"1008","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1021,"content":"<p>In line with Government policy, the Department has committed to evaluating all new services regarding their suitability for external delivery, but no such services have been introduced since March 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100096#WRY00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":1022,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100096#WRY00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1023,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[55460\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100096#WRY01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"c&eacute;n uair a &iacute;ocfar an t-airgead faoi sc&eacute;im na limist&eacute;ar faoi mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste, disadvantage area scheme, do 2012 le feirmeoir (sonra&iacute; tugtha); agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1024,"content":"<p>Fuarthas iarratas faoi Sc&eacute;im na Limist&eacute;ar faoi Mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste 2012 &oacute;n duine ainmnithe an 14 Bealtaine 2012.

However, since the beginning of 2012 the EU, in partnership with the G20, has supported an international market information system (AMIS) to provide transparency in relation to food prices.  They have also supported the creation of a Rapid Response Forum, which has senior officials from all over the world in constant contact to react to challenging situations such as the global crop failures that occurred during 2012.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The cooperation between governments has led to fewer trade-distorting reactions like the export bans witnessed in 2010.  The poor harvests this summer led to rapid price increases for key food commodities, but the increases quickly stabilised.  Rice prices are lower now than a year ago, while wheat, maize and soya have increased between 14% and 23%.  Prices for all of these commodities are still very high by historical standards but the price increases experienced so far in 2012 have not led to major market shocks. The latest market monitor, published by AMIS this month, shows a tightening of wheat and maize stocks, but a good supply of rice and soya beans. It also states that Markets stabilized in recent weeks as forecasts for 2012\/13 balances of AMIS crops became more definite<i>.  <\/i>The FAO food price index for 2012 has remained below the 2011 figure despite the poorer harvests this year.    <\/p><p><br \/>  Weather both at home and abroad and the consequent effects on price volatility and input prices meant a more difficult time for Irish farmers after a couple of relatively positive years. The latest input and output figures from the CSO (issued 7 December 2012) showed a 10% drop in operating surplus for the agriculture sector.  In particular, the sector had to bear an increase in intermediate consumption of 6.9% or &#8364;335.7m, half of which was accounted for by additional expenditure on feedingstuffs.  High world prices for key food commodities affect Irish farmers, whose incomes will decline by over 20% in 2012.  However, the sector remains healthy despite the temporary setbacks this year and is well placed to bounce back in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100096#WRY01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare Issues","counter":1031,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100096#WRY01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1032,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[55505\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100096#WRY01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to review procedures to ensure the welfare of animals particularly stray horses who regularly have to be herded by the Garda&iacute; in the Dublin mid-west area of Clondalkin, Rathcoole and Saggart and other surrounding areas; if the Animal Health and Welfare Bill will apply to the stabling of loose horses to keep them safe until the authorities deal with them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1033,"content":"<p>Matters relating to stray or abandoned horses in urban and rural areas come within the scope of the Control of Horses Act, 1996 under which Local Authorities have been given extensive powers.

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established in early 2013.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.  It has also been decided that due to its particular relevance domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services will also be included within the Agency's responsibilities.  The Government has further decided that the new Agency will assume responsibility for the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  These two organisations currently operate under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  <\/p><p>  The Family Support Agency, under my Department, operates the Family Resource Centre Programme.  The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit.  The programme funds 106 family resource centres throughout the country.  It emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.  Funding of over &euro;15m was provided to the Family Support Agency in respect of this programme in 2012.<\/p><p>  It is my intention that the work of the new agency will include a particular focus on the provision of services that could help prevent problems arising for a family, that would identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and that would assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  Therefore, in addition to child welfare and protection services there will be an emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  <\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputies that the focus of the new Agency will build on the excellent work undertaken by the Family Support Agency over the last decade.

With this in mind, the current Programme for Government  includes a specific commitment to put the draft standards developed by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by HIQA.  These draft standards outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services.  A public consultation process has recently been completed by HIQA on the draft standards document and it is now in the process of being finalised and submitted to the Board of the Authority. The final agreed standards will then be forwarded to my Department for approval with an anticipated publication date in January 2013.  It is expected that the new regulatory system which will allow for a robust registration and inspection of Residential Centres should be up and running by mid 2013.<\/p><p>  Work is also continuing in my Department on both the 'Registration and Inspection' regulations and the 'Care and Welfare' regulations required to bring the standards into law.

My Department is continuing discussions with HIQA to determine the longer term staffing and resource requirements and these will be considered further in the context of the Department's 2013 estimates.

Many of the provisions set out in the Directive are mandatory.  The Directive will be transposed into Irish law by year end and will take effect from 1 January, 2013.  I would like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the comments of European Environment Commissioner Potocnik who has said that the European Union will, once the Directive is transposed, have the highest standards of experimental animal welfare in the world.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Safeguard Clauses set out in this Directive covers exceptional circumstances in which Member States may, on scientifically justifiable grounds, provisionally authorise applications for derogations relating to a number of restrictions set out in the Directive including authorisation of procedures involving severe pain, suffering or distress that is likely to be long lasting and cannot be ameliorated.  Under Article 55(3), such exceptional provisional measures could, for example, be required to deal with an unexpected outbreak of a life threatening or debilitating clinical condition in humans or an outbreak of an highly infectious pathogenic disease.  The Safeguard Clauses would also allow for emergency measures in the event of a natural disaster that resulted in, for example, the contamination of land and livestock.  It will only be possible to introduce any such provisional measure by way of Ministerial Order after consultation with the Irish Medicines Board (the Competent Authority for the purposes of the Directive) and any such measure will be subject to EU Member State and Commission scrutiny and approval.  The European Commission, assisted by an Advisory Committee (composed of Member State representatives and chaired by the Commission) must, subsequently, authorise or disallow any such provisional authorisation.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is clear from the Directive that the replacement, refinement and reduction of animal testing is at the core of this legislation and I strongly endorse this objective.  Nevertheless, and even if difficult to foresee, it is my considered view that it is both reasonable and correct to make provision for exceptional emergency situations that might arise, if only to ensure that the necessary legislative tools are available to deal with such an eventuality.  The Directive provides Member States with the legislative tools needed to respond in an effective way to such situations. Not to incorporate such tools in our transposition of the Directive might prove to be most regrettable if fate were to take a hand.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department sought the views of the public and interested parties in July, 2009 on the proposed Directive.  These views informed Ireland&#8217;s position as negotiations on the proposed Directive progressed at EU level.  My Department again sought the views of the public and interested parties in October, 2011 after the adoption of the Directive.  Officials of my Department have met with stakeholder groups including animal welfare groups in relation to the Directive's provisions.  My Department has met with consultants of the Irish Anti Vivisection Society and with Research and Development establishments in this area.  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has also had meetings with stakeholders to inform them of the requirements which will apply from 1 January 2013 and has updated its website with relevant information.<\/p><p><br \/>  I appreciate the time and effort devoted by individuals and stakeholder groups in this regard. The submissions received in response to the first public consultation were particularly welcome as the Directive was still under discussion at that stage.  The second public consultation, of necessity, had a different focus given that the Directive was already finalised at that stage.  The responses to the second public consultation are, consequently, primarily focused on the nuts and bolts of the transposition process itself and are of particular assistance to the Department in this regard.<\/p><p><br \/>  On the matter of scrutiny of the Directive, in July 2009, my Department provided an information note to the <i>Joint Committee on European Scrutiny<\/i>  on the then proposed Directive and indicated that the transposition of the Directive would be done by Statutory Instrument in order to ensure that this transposition would be implemented within the allowed timeframe.  Failure to do so could delay the considerably enhanced protections the new Directive provides for animals - a circumstance which animal protection organisations would, quite correctly, take issue with.  It could also result in EU infringement proceedings against the State during the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is important to transpose the considerably enhanced protections afforded to animals in the Directive without delay.  The Joint Committee, after consideration of the proposed Directive noted that the aim of the proposal is to improve the existing 1986 Directive.  The Committee also recognised the scope allowed in the Directive for Member States to decide on practical transposition measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100096#WRBB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":1191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100096#WRBB02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1192,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[55188\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100096#WRBB02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will review the decision to have the home help assistance removed from a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and, if he does not intend to do so, if he will ask for an assessment of the person's needs to be carried out to determine the assistance assistance they may need.","asker":"993","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1193,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100096#WRBB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Blood Transfusion Service","counter":1194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100096#WRBB02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1195,"qnumday":469,"qnumall":"[55202\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100096#WRBB03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of vacant positions on the Board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service; the steps he is taking to fill these positions and the type of expertise he plans to bring to the board by such appointments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1196,"content":"<p>There are 6 vacancies on the Board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS).

This reflects well on the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the figures show that murder had decreased by 8% and assault offences were down by 9.7%.

In excess of &euro;90m of drugs were seized in the first nine months of the year, including the largest inland seizure of cocaine in Ireland.  Other seizures are taking place on a continuous basis.  <\/p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that in recent years considerable progress has been made within the Force in the deployment of modern technological support in the fight against organised crime.

The owner of the vessel has consistently said that the paperwork supplied and the expert employed to survey the vessel at the time of purchase indicated that there was no problem with the stability of the vessel. I understand that vessel in question<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  failed a stability test by the Marine Survey Office (MSO) of the Department of Transport in 2009.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The failures in the stability of the fishing vessel were determined after its purchase by the new Irish owner.  The reality that these failures were not detected at the time of purchase by the new owner is a private matter between the owners and the sellers of the vessel and the relevant experts involved in surveying and certifying the vessel, none of which are employed by the State or were acting on behalf of the State.  The State does not have responsibility for the failures in this private business transaction, no matter how unfortunate the case may be. I am sympathetic to the very unfortunate situation that the owner finds himself in but it is not due to any failure on the part of the State and there are no remedies open to me to address the situation in which the vessel owner finds himself.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has no function in this safety matter, other than that the Sea Fishing Boat Licensing Authority must ensure that a vessel has a Fishing Vessel Safety Certificate prior to licensing.  The Authority is not empowered to vary or indeed waive the legal safety requirements set down by the Maritime Safety Directorate of the Department of Transport.<\/p><p><br \/>  To resolve the stability problems of his vessel, I understand that the owner lengthened his vessel by 6 metres. As the vessel was larger, the owner requires additional capacity to licence the vessel. Capacity is a privately owned tradeable asset and my Department has no direct role in that private market.  In February 2011, in order to licence the vessel without purchasing the additional capacity required, the owner made an application for &#8216;safety tonnage&#8217; to the Registrar General of Fishing Boats. I understand that the Registrar is awaiting certification of the modifications to the vessel from the Marine Survey Office before a decision is made in relation to the safety tonnage application.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The owner previously made a request to my Department to be granted a scallop authorisation and effort allocation in order to allow the owner to participate in the scallop fisheries<i>. <\/i> Under the national policy for the fishing fleet, vessels permitted to participate in the scallop fishery are ring fenced within the fleet and only vessels with the necessary scallop entitlement in their sea fishing boat licence are permitted to participate in that fishery.  The vessel in question is registered in the Beamer segment of the Irish Fishing Fleet and does not have the necessary track record to be licensed in the scallop sub-segments of the fleet.  The owner&#8217;s proposal would require that the vessel would be licensed in the Polyvalent (scallop sub segment) or Specific (scallop sub segment) segments. There is no scope in the national policy to transfer from the Beamer segment to the Polyvalent or Specific segments, other than by providing 100% capacity from those segments with the required scallop track record.  This capacity is a privately owned tradeable asset on the open market and must be provided at a ratio of 1:1 as part of the licensing process.    <\/p><p><br \/>  Fleet policy, including policy on segmentation of the fleet, is set by me under section 3(2) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, as amended by section 99 of the Sea Fisheries Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  I am precluded by that Act from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case or group of cases with which the Licensing Authority is or may be concerned.  It is not an option, therefore, for me to amend national policy on segmentation of the fleet for the purpose of assisting the owner in moving to another segment of the fleet, no matter how sympathetic I may be to his situation. The same situation applies in relation to requests from the owner to move to the Refrigerated Sea Water Segment Pelagic segment of the fleet.<\/p><p><br \/>  More recently, the owner of the vessel has expressed a desire to decommission his vessel.  Decommissioning of fishing vessels is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1198\/2006   (EFF Regulation) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 498\/2007 which provides for rules implementing schemes co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund. Article 23 of the EFF Regulation provides for the European Fisheries Fund to contribute to financing of the permanent cessation of fishing activities of fishing vessels, provided that such cessation forms part of a Fishing Effort Adjustment Plan prepared by the Member State and approved by the Commission as part of the Member State&#8217;s Operational Programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  There is at present no decommissioning scheme in operation. The last decommissioning scheme for vessels was undertaken in 2008 and implemented the fleet restructuring objectives set out in the National Strategic Plan for the Fisheries Sector 2007-2013, prepared in accordance with Article 15 of the EFF Regulation and which was submitted to and adopted by the Commission.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The 2008 Decommissioning Scheme required that a vessel be registered\/licensed, comply with all relevant legislation, be capable of putting to sea at the time of application and have carried out fishing activity for at least 75 days at sea in both of two periods of 12 months preceding 31 December 2007, or have carried out a fishing activity for at least 150 days at sea in the 12 month period preceding 31 December 2007.  The Scheme sought to remove active fishing vessels and their fishing capacity from the fleet register to reduce fishing effort in certain whitefish fisheries and thereby improve the viability of the fisheries for other active vessels.  I understand that the vessel in question has not been licensed since 30 September 2009 and is therefore not an active vessel. Should a new decommissioning scheme be introduced at a future date with similar eligibility requirements, the vessel would not qualify under its present circumstances.  <\/p><p><br \/>  A new decommissioning scheme for any category of vessels or more generally could only be considered where a strong case has been made by the fishing industry representative bodies and that case was considered valid and the most appropriate use of scarce funds available for the development of the seafood sector, including the limited co-funding available from the European Fisheries Fund.  It is likely that a revised Fishing Effort Adjustment Plan would be required and this would need to be approved by the European Commission.  I have no plans at this time to introduce such a scheme which would in any event have to target a category or categories of vessels based on a range of broad and transparent criteria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100097#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services","counter":1614,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100097#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1615,"qnumday":408,"qnumall":"[55424\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100097#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 237 of 4 December 2012, if he will provide a list of all new services across his Department that have been tested for external service delivery since March 2011.","asker":"1008","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1616,"content":"<p>In line with Government policy, the Department has committed to evaluating all new services regarding their suitability for external delivery, but no such services have been introduced since March 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100097#WRY00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":1617,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100097#WRY00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1618,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[55460\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100097#WRY01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"c&eacute;n uair a &iacute;ocfar an t-airgead faoi sc&eacute;im na limist&eacute;ar faoi mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste, disadvantage area scheme, do 2012 le feirmeoir (sonra&iacute; tugtha); agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1619,"content":"<p>Fuarthas iarratas faoi Sc&eacute;im na Limist&eacute;ar faoi Mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste 2012 &oacute;n duine ainmnithe an 14 Bealtaine 2012.

However, since the beginning of 2012 the EU, in partnership with the G20, has supported an international market information system (AMIS) to provide transparency in relation to food prices.  They have also supported the creation of a Rapid Response Forum, which has senior officials from all over the world in constant contact to react to challenging situations such as the global crop failures that occurred during 2012.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The cooperation between governments has led to fewer trade-distorting reactions like the export bans witnessed in 2010.  The poor harvests this summer led to rapid price increases for key food commodities, but the increases quickly stabilised.  Rice prices are lower now than a year ago, while wheat, maize and soya have increased between 14% and 23%.  Prices for all of these commodities are still very high by historical standards but the price increases experienced so far in 2012 have not led to major market shocks. The latest market monitor, published by AMIS this month, shows a tightening of wheat and maize stocks, but a good supply of rice and soya beans. It also states that Markets stabilized in recent weeks as forecasts for 2012\/13 balances of AMIS crops became more definite<i>.  <\/i>The FAO food price index for 2012 has remained below the 2011 figure despite the poorer harvests this year.    <\/p><p><br \/>  Weather both at home and abroad and the consequent effects on price volatility and input prices meant a more difficult time for Irish farmers after a couple of relatively positive years. The latest input and output figures from the CSO (issued 7 December 2012) showed a 10% drop in operating surplus for the agriculture sector.  In particular, the sector had to bear an increase in intermediate consumption of 6.9% or &#8364;335.7m, half of which was accounted for by additional expenditure on feedingstuffs.  High world prices for key food commodities affect Irish farmers, whose incomes will decline by over 20% in 2012.  However, the sector remains healthy despite the temporary setbacks this year and is well placed to bounce back in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100097#WRY01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare Issues","counter":1626,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100097#WRY01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1627,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[55505\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100097#WRY01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to review procedures to ensure the welfare of animals particularly stray horses who regularly have to be herded by the Garda&iacute; in the Dublin mid-west area of Clondalkin, Rathcoole and Saggart and other surrounding areas; if the Animal Health and Welfare Bill will apply to the stabling of loose horses to keep them safe until the authorities deal with them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1628,"content":"<p>Matters relating to stray or abandoned horses in urban and rural areas come within the scope of the Control of Horses Act, 1996 under which Local Authorities have been given extensive powers.

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established in early 2013.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.  It has also been decided that due to its particular relevance domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services will also be included within the Agency's responsibilities.  The Government has further decided that the new Agency will assume responsibility for the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  These two organisations currently operate under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  <\/p><p>  The Family Support Agency, under my Department, operates the Family Resource Centre Programme.  The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit.  The programme funds 106 family resource centres throughout the country.  It emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.  Funding of over &euro;15m was provided to the Family Support Agency in respect of this programme in 2012.<\/p><p>  It is my intention that the work of the new agency will include a particular focus on the provision of services that could help prevent problems arising for a family, that would identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and that would assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  Therefore, in addition to child welfare and protection services there will be an emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  <\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputies that the focus of the new Agency will build on the excellent work undertaken by the Family Support Agency over the last decade.

With this in mind, the current Programme for Government  includes a specific commitment to put the draft standards developed by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by HIQA.  These draft standards outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services.  A public consultation process has recently been completed by HIQA on the draft standards document and it is now in the process of being finalised and submitted to the Board of the Authority. The final agreed standards will then be forwarded to my Department for approval with an anticipated publication date in January 2013.  It is expected that the new regulatory system which will allow for a robust registration and inspection of Residential Centres should be up and running by mid 2013.<\/p><p>  Work is also continuing in my Department on both the 'Registration and Inspection' regulations and the 'Care and Welfare' regulations required to bring the standards into law.

My Department is continuing discussions with HIQA to determine the longer term staffing and resource requirements and these will be considered further in the context of the Department's 2013 estimates.

Many of the provisions set out in the Directive are mandatory.  The Directive will be transposed into Irish law by year end and will take effect from 1 January, 2013.  I would like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the comments of European Environment Commissioner Potocnik who has said that the European Union will, once the Directive is transposed, have the highest standards of experimental animal welfare in the world.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Safeguard Clauses set out in this Directive covers exceptional circumstances in which Member States may, on scientifically justifiable grounds, provisionally authorise applications for derogations relating to a number of restrictions set out in the Directive including authorisation of procedures involving severe pain, suffering or distress that is likely to be long lasting and cannot be ameliorated.  Under Article 55(3), such exceptional provisional measures could, for example, be required to deal with an unexpected outbreak of a life threatening or debilitating clinical condition in humans or an outbreak of an highly infectious pathogenic disease.  The Safeguard Clauses would also allow for emergency measures in the event of a natural disaster that resulted in, for example, the contamination of land and livestock.  It will only be possible to introduce any such provisional measure by way of Ministerial Order after consultation with the Irish Medicines Board (the Competent Authority for the purposes of the Directive) and any such measure will be subject to EU Member State and Commission scrutiny and approval.  The European Commission, assisted by an Advisory Committee (composed of Member State representatives and chaired by the Commission) must, subsequently, authorise or disallow any such provisional authorisation.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is clear from the Directive that the replacement, refinement and reduction of animal testing is at the core of this legislation and I strongly endorse this objective.  Nevertheless, and even if difficult to foresee, it is my considered view that it is both reasonable and correct to make provision for exceptional emergency situations that might arise, if only to ensure that the necessary legislative tools are available to deal with such an eventuality.  The Directive provides Member States with the legislative tools needed to respond in an effective way to such situations. Not to incorporate such tools in our transposition of the Directive might prove to be most regrettable if fate were to take a hand.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department sought the views of the public and interested parties in July, 2009 on the proposed Directive.  These views informed Ireland&#8217;s position as negotiations on the proposed Directive progressed at EU level.  My Department again sought the views of the public and interested parties in October, 2011 after the adoption of the Directive.  Officials of my Department have met with stakeholder groups including animal welfare groups in relation to the Directive's provisions.  My Department has met with consultants of the Irish Anti Vivisection Society and with Research and Development establishments in this area.  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has also had meetings with stakeholders to inform them of the requirements which will apply from 1 January 2013 and has updated its website with relevant information.<\/p><p><br \/>  I appreciate the time and effort devoted by individuals and stakeholder groups in this regard. The submissions received in response to the first public consultation were particularly welcome as the Directive was still under discussion at that stage.  The second public consultation, of necessity, had a different focus given that the Directive was already finalised at that stage.  The responses to the second public consultation are, consequently, primarily focused on the nuts and bolts of the transposition process itself and are of particular assistance to the Department in this regard.<\/p><p><br \/>  On the matter of scrutiny of the Directive, in July 2009, my Department provided an information note to the <i>Joint Committee on European Scrutiny<\/i>  on the then proposed Directive and indicated that the transposition of the Directive would be done by Statutory Instrument in order to ensure that this transposition would be implemented within the allowed timeframe.  Failure to do so could delay the considerably enhanced protections the new Directive provides for animals - a circumstance which animal protection organisations would, quite correctly, take issue with.  It could also result in EU infringement proceedings against the State during the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is important to transpose the considerably enhanced protections afforded to animals in the Directive without delay.  The Joint Committee, after consideration of the proposed Directive noted that the aim of the proposal is to improve the existing 1986 Directive.  The Committee also recognised the scope allowed in the Directive for Member States to decide on practical transposition measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100097#WRBB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":1786,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100097#WRBB02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1787,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[55188\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100097#WRBB02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will review the decision to have the home help assistance removed from a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and, if he does not intend to do so, if he will ask for an assessment of the person's needs to be carried out to determine the assistance assistance they may need.","asker":"993","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1788,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100097#WRBB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Blood Transfusion Service","counter":1789,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100097#WRBB02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1790,"qnumday":469,"qnumall":"[55202\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100097#WRBB03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of vacant positions on the Board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service; the steps he is taking to fill these positions and the type of expertise he plans to bring to the board by such appointments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1791,"content":"<p>There are 6 vacancies on the Board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS).

The owner of the vessel has consistently said that the paperwork supplied and the expert employed to survey the vessel at the time of purchase indicated that there was no problem with the stability of the vessel. I understand that vessel in question<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  failed a stability test by the Marine Survey Office (MSO) of the Department of Transport in 2009.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The failures in the stability of the fishing vessel were determined after its purchase by the new Irish owner.  The reality that these failures were not detected at the time of purchase by the new owner is a private matter between the owners and the sellers of the vessel and the relevant experts involved in surveying and certifying the vessel, none of which are employed by the State or were acting on behalf of the State.  The State does not have responsibility for the failures in this private business transaction, no matter how unfortunate the case may be. I am sympathetic to the very unfortunate situation that the owner finds himself in but it is not due to any failure on the part of the State and there are no remedies open to me to address the situation in which the vessel owner finds himself.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has no function in this safety matter, other than that the Sea Fishing Boat Licensing Authority must ensure that a vessel has a Fishing Vessel Safety Certificate prior to licensing.  The Authority is not empowered to vary or indeed waive the legal safety requirements set down by the Maritime Safety Directorate of the Department of Transport.<\/p><p><br \/>  To resolve the stability problems of his vessel, I understand that the owner lengthened his vessel by 6 metres. As the vessel was larger, the owner requires additional capacity to licence the vessel. Capacity is a privately owned tradeable asset and my Department has no direct role in that private market.  In February 2011, in order to licence the vessel without purchasing the additional capacity required, the owner made an application for &#8216;safety tonnage&#8217; to the Registrar General of Fishing Boats. I understand that the Registrar is awaiting certification of the modifications to the vessel from the Marine Survey Office before a decision is made in relation to the safety tonnage application.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The owner previously made a request to my Department to be granted a scallop authorisation and effort allocation in order to allow the owner to participate in the scallop fisheries<i>. <\/i> Under the national policy for the fishing fleet, vessels permitted to participate in the scallop fishery are ring fenced within the fleet and only vessels with the necessary scallop entitlement in their sea fishing boat licence are permitted to participate in that fishery.  The vessel in question is registered in the Beamer segment of the Irish Fishing Fleet and does not have the necessary track record to be licensed in the scallop sub-segments of the fleet.  The owner&#8217;s proposal would require that the vessel would be licensed in the Polyvalent (scallop sub segment) or Specific (scallop sub segment) segments. There is no scope in the national policy to transfer from the Beamer segment to the Polyvalent or Specific segments, other than by providing 100% capacity from those segments with the required scallop track record.  This capacity is a privately owned tradeable asset on the open market and must be provided at a ratio of 1:1 as part of the licensing process.    <\/p><p><br \/>  Fleet policy, including policy on segmentation of the fleet, is set by me under section 3(2) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, as amended by section 99 of the Sea Fisheries Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  I am precluded by that Act from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case or group of cases with which the Licensing Authority is or may be concerned.  It is not an option, therefore, for me to amend national policy on segmentation of the fleet for the purpose of assisting the owner in moving to another segment of the fleet, no matter how sympathetic I may be to his situation. The same situation applies in relation to requests from the owner to move to the Refrigerated Sea Water Segment Pelagic segment of the fleet.<\/p><p><br \/>  More recently, the owner of the vessel has expressed a desire to decommission his vessel.  Decommissioning of fishing vessels is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1198\/2006   (EFF Regulation) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 498\/2007 which provides for rules implementing schemes co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund. Article 23 of the EFF Regulation provides for the European Fisheries Fund to contribute to financing of the permanent cessation of fishing activities of fishing vessels, provided that such cessation forms part of a Fishing Effort Adjustment Plan prepared by the Member State and approved by the Commission as part of the Member State&#8217;s Operational Programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  There is at present no decommissioning scheme in operation. The last decommissioning scheme for vessels was undertaken in 2008 and implemented the fleet restructuring objectives set out in the National Strategic Plan for the Fisheries Sector 2007-2013, prepared in accordance with Article 15 of the EFF Regulation and which was submitted to and adopted by the Commission.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The 2008 Decommissioning Scheme required that a vessel be registered\/licensed, comply with all relevant legislation, be capable of putting to sea at the time of application and have carried out fishing activity for at least 75 days at sea in both of two periods of 12 months preceding 31 December 2007, or have carried out a fishing activity for at least 150 days at sea in the 12 month period preceding 31 December 2007.  The Scheme sought to remove active fishing vessels and their fishing capacity from the fleet register to reduce fishing effort in certain whitefish fisheries and thereby improve the viability of the fisheries for other active vessels.  I understand that the vessel in question has not been licensed since 30 September 2009 and is therefore not an active vessel. Should a new decommissioning scheme be introduced at a future date with similar eligibility requirements, the vessel would not qualify under its present circumstances.  <\/p><p><br \/>  A new decommissioning scheme for any category of vessels or more generally could only be considered where a strong case has been made by the fishing industry representative bodies and that case was considered valid and the most appropriate use of scarce funds available for the development of the seafood sector, including the limited co-funding available from the European Fisheries Fund.  It is likely that a revised Fishing Effort Adjustment Plan would be required and this would need to be approved by the European Commission.  I have no plans at this time to introduce such a scheme which would in any event have to target a category or categories of vessels based on a range of broad and transparent criteria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100101#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services","counter":2157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100101#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":2158,"qnumday":408,"qnumall":"[55424\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100101#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 237 of 4 December 2012, if he will provide a list of all new services across his Department that have been tested for external service delivery since March 2011.","asker":"1008","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2159,"content":"<p>In line with Government policy, the Department has committed to evaluating all new services regarding their suitability for external delivery, but no such services have been introduced since March 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100101#WRY00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":2160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100101#WRY00950"},{"type":"question","counter":2161,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[55460\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100101#WRY01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"c&eacute;n uair a &iacute;ocfar an t-airgead faoi sc&eacute;im na limist&eacute;ar faoi mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste, disadvantage area scheme, do 2012 le feirmeoir (sonra&iacute; tugtha); agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2162,"content":"<p>Fuarthas iarratas faoi Sc&eacute;im na Limist&eacute;ar faoi Mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste 2012 &oacute;n duine ainmnithe an 14 Bealtaine 2012.

However, since the beginning of 2012 the EU, in partnership with the G20, has supported an international market information system (AMIS) to provide transparency in relation to food prices.  They have also supported the creation of a Rapid Response Forum, which has senior officials from all over the world in constant contact to react to challenging situations such as the global crop failures that occurred during 2012.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The cooperation between governments has led to fewer trade-distorting reactions like the export bans witnessed in 2010.  The poor harvests this summer led to rapid price increases for key food commodities, but the increases quickly stabilised.  Rice prices are lower now than a year ago, while wheat, maize and soya have increased between 14% and 23%.  Prices for all of these commodities are still very high by historical standards but the price increases experienced so far in 2012 have not led to major market shocks. The latest market monitor, published by AMIS this month, shows a tightening of wheat and maize stocks, but a good supply of rice and soya beans. It also states that Markets stabilized in recent weeks as forecasts for 2012\/13 balances of AMIS crops became more definite<i>.  <\/i>The FAO food price index for 2012 has remained below the 2011 figure despite the poorer harvests this year.    <\/p><p><br \/>  Weather both at home and abroad and the consequent effects on price volatility and input prices meant a more difficult time for Irish farmers after a couple of relatively positive years. The latest input and output figures from the CSO (issued 7 December 2012) showed a 10% drop in operating surplus for the agriculture sector.  In particular, the sector had to bear an increase in intermediate consumption of 6.9% or &#8364;335.7m, half of which was accounted for by additional expenditure on feedingstuffs.  High world prices for key food commodities affect Irish farmers, whose incomes will decline by over 20% in 2012.  However, the sector remains healthy despite the temporary setbacks this year and is well placed to bounce back in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100101#WRY01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare Issues","counter":2169,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100101#WRY01550"},{"type":"question","counter":2170,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[55505\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100101#WRY01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to review procedures to ensure the welfare of animals particularly stray horses who regularly have to be herded by the Garda&iacute; in the Dublin mid-west area of Clondalkin, Rathcoole and Saggart and other surrounding areas; if the Animal Health and Welfare Bill will apply to the stabling of loose horses to keep them safe until the authorities deal with them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2171,"content":"<p>Matters relating to stray or abandoned horses in urban and rural areas come within the scope of the Control of Horses Act, 1996 under which Local Authorities have been given extensive powers.

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established in early 2013.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.  It has also been decided that due to its particular relevance domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services will also be included within the Agency's responsibilities.  The Government has further decided that the new Agency will assume responsibility for the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  These two organisations currently operate under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  <\/p><p>  The Family Support Agency, under my Department, operates the Family Resource Centre Programme.  The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit.  The programme funds 106 family resource centres throughout the country.  It emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.  Funding of over &euro;15m was provided to the Family Support Agency in respect of this programme in 2012.<\/p><p>  It is my intention that the work of the new agency will include a particular focus on the provision of services that could help prevent problems arising for a family, that would identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and that would assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  Therefore, in addition to child welfare and protection services there will be an emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  <\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputies that the focus of the new Agency will build on the excellent work undertaken by the Family Support Agency over the last decade.

With this in mind, the current Programme for Government  includes a specific commitment to put the draft standards developed by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by HIQA.  These draft standards outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services.  A public consultation process has recently been completed by HIQA on the draft standards document and it is now in the process of being finalised and submitted to the Board of the Authority. The final agreed standards will then be forwarded to my Department for approval with an anticipated publication date in January 2013.  It is expected that the new regulatory system which will allow for a robust registration and inspection of Residential Centres should be up and running by mid 2013.<\/p><p>  Work is also continuing in my Department on both the 'Registration and Inspection' regulations and the 'Care and Welfare' regulations required to bring the standards into law.  These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned from similar regulations for nursing homes.  My Department has also been in active engagement with HIQA on the level of resources and staffing needed.  10 posts which will enable the Authority commence preparatory work for the registration and inspection regime have already been approved.  My Department is continuing discussions with HIQA to determine the longer term staffing and resource requirements and these will be considered further in the context of the Department's 2013 estimates.

The Directive strongly promotes the principles of the three Rs (replacement of the use of animals to the greatest extent possible with alternative testing methods, refinement of scientific procedures to improve animal welfare and reduction in numbers of animals used).  Significant changes in this regard are requirements to perform project evaluations including harm benefit analysis prior to authorisation of projects using animals and higher standards of care and accommodation.  Many of the provisions set out in the Directive are mandatory.  The Directive will be transposed into Irish law by year end and will take effect from 1 January, 2013.  I would like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the comments of European Environment Commissioner Potocnik who has said that the European Union will, once the Directive is transposed, have the highest standards of experimental animal welfare in the world.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Safeguard Clauses set out in this Directive covers exceptional circumstances in which Member States may, on scientifically justifiable grounds, provisionally authorise applications for derogations relating to a number of restrictions set out in the Directive including authorisation of procedures involving severe pain, suffering or distress that is likely to be long lasting and cannot be ameliorated.  Under Article 55(3), such exceptional provisional measures could, for example, be required to deal with an unexpected outbreak of a life threatening or debilitating clinical condition in humans or an outbreak of an highly infectious pathogenic disease.  The Safeguard Clauses would also allow for emergency measures in the event of a natural disaster that resulted in, for example, the contamination of land and livestock.  It will only be possible to introduce any such provisional measure by way of Ministerial Order after consultation with the Irish Medicines Board (the Competent Authority for the purposes of the Directive) and any such measure will be subject to EU Member State and Commission scrutiny and approval.  The European Commission, assisted by an Advisory Committee (composed of Member State representatives and chaired by the Commission) must, subsequently, authorise or disallow any such provisional authorisation.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is clear from the Directive that the replacement, refinement and reduction of animal testing is at the core of this legislation and I strongly endorse this objective.  Nevertheless, and even if difficult to foresee, it is my considered view that it is both reasonable and correct to make provision for exceptional emergency situations that might arise, if only to ensure that the necessary legislative tools are available to deal with such an eventuality.  The Directive provides Member States with the legislative tools needed to respond in an effective way to such situations. Not to incorporate such tools in our transposition of the Directive might prove to be most regrettable if fate were to take a hand.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department sought the views of the public and interested parties in July, 2009 on the proposed Directive.  These views informed Ireland&#8217;s position as negotiations on the proposed Directive progressed at EU level.  My Department again sought the views of the public and interested parties in October, 2011 after the adoption of the Directive.  Officials of my Department have met with stakeholder groups including animal welfare groups in relation to the Directive's provisions.  My Department has met with consultants of the Irish Anti Vivisection Society and with Research and Development establishments in this area.  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has also had meetings with stakeholders to inform them of the requirements which will apply from 1 January 2013 and has updated its website with relevant information.<\/p><p><br \/>  I appreciate the time and effort devoted by individuals and stakeholder groups in this regard. The submissions received in response to the first public consultation were particularly welcome as the Directive was still under discussion at that stage.  The second public consultation, of necessity, had a different focus given that the Directive was already finalised at that stage.  The responses to the second public consultation are, consequently, primarily focused on the nuts and bolts of the transposition process itself and are of particular assistance to the Department in this regard.<\/p><p><br \/>  On the matter of scrutiny of the Directive, in July 2009, my Department provided an information note to the <i>Joint Committee on European Scrutiny<\/i>  on the then proposed Directive and indicated that the transposition of the Directive would be done by Statutory Instrument in order to ensure that this transposition would be implemented within the allowed timeframe.  Failure to do so could delay the considerably enhanced protections the new Directive provides for animals - a circumstance which animal protection organisations would, quite correctly, take issue with.  It could also result in EU infringement proceedings against the State during the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is important to transpose the considerably enhanced protections afforded to animals in the Directive without delay.  The Joint Committee, after consideration of the proposed Directive noted that the aim of the proposal is to improve the existing 1986 Directive.  The Committee also recognised the scope allowed in the Directive for Member States to decide on practical transposition measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100104#WRBB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":2329,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100104#WRBB02750"},{"type":"question","counter":2330,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[55188\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100104#WRBB02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will review the decision to have the home help assistance removed from a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and, if he does not intend to do so, if he will ask for an assessment of the person's needs to be carried out to determine the assistance assistance they may need.","asker":"993","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2331,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100104#WRBB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Blood Transfusion Service","counter":2332,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100104#WRBB02950"},{"type":"question","counter":2333,"qnumday":469,"qnumall":"[55202\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121100104#WRBB03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of vacant positions on the Board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service; the steps he is taking to fill these positions and the type of expertise he plans to bring to the board by such appointments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2334,"content":"<p>There are 6 vacancies on the Board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS).
