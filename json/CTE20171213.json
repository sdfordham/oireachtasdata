It is already the responsibility of the Legislature to legislate and, therefore, it is not  necessary to replace the wording.  The Citizens' Assembly has recommended, that the replacement wording be that the Legislature would legislate and to put that into the Constitution.  I think that would be confusing, it is unnecessary and all of the legal advice has suggested the same.  Putting any other kind of wording back into the Constitution would simply brings us back to what I view as an inappropriate dealing with the issue by way of the Constitution.

Article 40.3.3&deg;, when passed in 1983, established Ireland as a beacon of human rights in this area.  It took decisions on this life and death issue away from the political and judicial elites and has led to a situation where Ireland consistently has the best medical practice.  Only today, we have news from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists which reminds us that Ireland is one of the safest places in the world in which to have a baby.  Our figures are even better than those for Britain.  We have seen how in country after country, when this issue was given over to politicians, there was a steady liberalisation of the law.  Therefore, we are not just talking about a limited abortion regime but about an increasingly liberal one.  In repealing the eighth amendment <i>simpliciter<\/i>the people would be invited to trust that politicians would not continually liberalise the abortion regime more and more until we had a law similar to that in Britain, where four times as many abortions take place per year, <i>per capita<\/i>, according to the figures available to us.

It is essential that we make the decision as clear cut as possible.  Many of the difficulties, as advised by the people from whom we heard, arose from the fact that this issue was dealt with in the Constitution in the first place.  We heard evidence from health professionals that the eighth amendment was an impediment in doing their job and offering a full range of health care services to women.  For that reason, while I am not sure if a seconder is required, we will certainly second the amendment in favour of repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>.  We had discussions about the numbers of Irish women who travelled to England and I came to the conclusion that it was not possible to determine the numbers and that neither was it possible, therefore, to determine the actual rate of abortion for this country.

Figures published by Maternal Death Enquiry Ireland show that maternal deaths in Ireland are extremely rare and that the rate is marginally ahead of rates in the United Kingdom.

Provision for gestational time limits for the termination of pregnancies be guided by the best available medical evidence and be provided for in legislation &ndash; any assessment in relation to the termination of pregnancy where the life or the health of the woman is at risk be made by no fewer than two specialist physicians.<\/blockquote> <p>I would like to explain the genesis of this motion.  As a committee, we were tasked with looking at the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  Some 72% of members of the assembly voted to recommend that &quot;a distinction should not be drawn between the physical and mental health of the woman&quot;.  That is why this motion mentions physical and mental health.  I understand that termination of pregnancy where the life of the woman is at risk was dealt with in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  This motion seeks to bring everything together.  I realise that members have concerns about health risks.  We heard extensively at this committee about individual cases in which the level of risk can be very low in the morning, but the woman's life can be in danger by the evening.  In order to deal with that, this motion provides that where the life or the health of the woman is at risk, this determination shall be made by no fewer than two specialist physicians.  The 2013 Act provides for a determination to be made by two or three physicians.  This committee has not heard of any case that has happened up to now in which a second or third physician has not been available to sign off on it.<\/p><p>I promise I will not go on all day.  It is important for members to understand what we mean by risk to the health of the woman.  Severe hypertension - blood pressure - can be difficult to control in the case of a pregnant woman.  It is often the case that when high blood pressure kicks in around the 20th or 22nd week, it gets to a point where the only way to rectify the problem is to deliver the child.  Severe hypertension, which is difficult to control, is often associated with kidney disease in the woman that is likely to deteriorate in pregnancy.  The outcome for the woman in such circumstances is often a stroke.<\/p><p>I would like members to think of a woman who has one, two or three children at home - I have three at home - and is going to have a fourth child, but who has hypertension at 23 weeks and faces the possibility of being rendered disabled and unable to communicate for the rest of her young life.  Often, diabetes can be more difficult to control during pregnancy.  There are also clotting disorders.  On its own, a clot in a leg is not a major problem, but if it becomes a pulmonary embolism, that is, a clot in the lung, it can pose a serious risk of stroke during the pregnancy if the pregnancy is not terminated.<\/p><p> Members may have concerns regarding gestational time limits.  The motion reads: \"Provision for gestational time limits for the termination of pregnancies be guided by the best available medical evidence and be provided for in legislation\".  I cannot understand how anyone could have any issue with that, given that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists comprises the experts in this field.<\/p><p> Generally, the issue of gestational age limits only applies to late diagnoses of foetal abnormality, for example, anencephaly, due to scanning being unavailable, which we have addressed in the ancillary recommendations.  If viability is reached, it is not regarded as an abortion, but a pre-term delivery.  Doctors always make every effort to save the baby's life.  Viability now sits at approximately 23 weeks.  Although survival rates are low at that gestational level and disability rates in survivors are high, we have maintained the lives of people born at 23 weeks.<\/p><p> I wish to reassure members that the health risk to the mother would be defined by two doctors and the gestational limits would be set by the doctors' governing or ethical bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#H03800","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I have a difficulty with how the motion is worded.  I have a formal proposal to make.  I do not agree that a single motion should deal with both life and health.  The committee has received evidence stating that simply being pregnant creates a risk to one's health, so it is important that we have the correct wording.  I would like to see the phrase \"substantial risk to health\" used.<\/p> <p>  My formal proposal is that motion 3 be subdivided into parts A and B, with part A reading: \"That the committee recommends that termination of pregnancy be lawful where the life of the mother is at risk.\"  It takes into account the existence of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 and that this issue is catered for.

From the evidence presented during the hearings and having regard to the rapidity with which a woman's health can deteriorate in a situation such as has been set out, what may well not be a serious risk at a particular time may be a progressive risk, with its progress rapid, so that by the time the risk is determined as being serious and action is taken - if it is presumed that the seriousness of the risk will determine at all times what happens - it may be too late to save either mother or baby.<\/p> <p>  We have had this debate and I respect the point made by my colleague, but it is important that we remember something.  If we recall the evidence that we heard, cases were referred to in which there was a rapid decline in the health of the mother.

This is despite the fact that the ground has shifted in this area.  When we heard evidence about mental health, we were reminded that there was no evidence associating abortion with improvements in mental health for women and that there was some evidence of a low to moderate increased risk to women's mental health in certain cases.  That has led to calls for a change to the approach in Britain, even among those who support abortion as a right generally, so as not to link abortion with mental health as a ground.  That was not challenged before this committee.<\/p><p>Linking mental health with physical health, in effect, seeks to bring in abortion on demand under the pretext of a therapeutic intervention.  <\/p><p> On the question of physical health, we have heard no evidence at this committee that the health of any woman was compromised by the requirements of the settled law of Ireland.  That is a fact.  We have heard no evidence that any doctor was ever pursued by the criminal law for having made an appropriate therapeutic intervention that resulted in the loss of the life of an unborn child.  The reason for that is as follows.  Under the settled law of Ireland the threat to a woman's life does not have to be imminent.  Several times Deputy Durkan has mentioned cases where people have died.  I would like to hear what he is talking about because the settled law of Ireland has not compromised anybody's life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#J01300","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I urge the Senator to direct all his comments through the Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#K00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I will make two final points about the two specialist physicians requirement.

That is a chilling reminder of how this law can easily be abused.<\/p> <p>  Second, references to best available medical evidence is a euphemism.  The people, who this committee considers vectors of the best available medical evidence, spoke in terms of requiring abortion on request.  In fact, their evidence always operated to reject distinctions between health grounds and a more general dealing with abortion on the grounds of a request.  In one particularly chilling case we heard doctors speak in a very blas&eacute; fashion about late term abortions and that we should not be distracted by late term abortions of children even for a trivial reason like a cleft palate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#K00300","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Please stick to the point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#K00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I urge the rejection of these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#K00500","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and call Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#K00600","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I reject the two statements about mental health being a ground for abortion on demand and that no woman's life has been at risk because of the current law.

Sometimes these matters only come to light after the 12-week period.  I hope the up to 12-week provision captures most of the women who might find themselves in this situation because of their socio-economic status.  However, it does not mean that their socio-economic status will not affect them in their 14th or 15th week of pregnancy.  They may find themselves on the street at any stage of their pregnancy.  Their parents may have put them out of the family home because of the pregnancy.  Perhaps the pregnant woman is unable to access supports or the father of her unborn child may have abandoned her.  Loads of socio-economic stuff can come up after the 12th week of pregnancy.  I hope that we could incorporate socio-economic under the health ground like other jurisdictions do.  A vote on Deputy O'Connell's motion will totally rule out our consideration of socio-economic as a health ground.  Can we address the matter?<\/p> <p>  I know that the socio-economic reason is recognised as a ground later on.  I feel people are a little fearful to name socio-economic as a ground.

There have been substantial and evidence-based claims that this is not an evidence-based ground for abortion.  Certainly, there was evidence from psychiatric experts before this committee which appears to distance the majority of the psychiatric medical profession from this whole business of providing for abortion on the grounds of a threat of suicide.<\/p> <p>  While I accept that the committee's apparent will to see abortion legalised as a matter of right on demand will make the issue moot anyway, I support Deputy Mattie McGrath's proposal that we reject this use of suicide as a ground.<\/p> <p>  I should note in passing as well that a small, but significant, number of children have died as a result of this invocation of a threat to life.

In relation to the GP-led service, I have no major difficulty with including a reference to a medical doctor but the reason the motion is drafted in this way is in recognition and acceptance of the fact that people are ordering medical abortion pills online.  As Deputy Kelleher stated, they are being delivered by An Post in this jurisdiction.  That is happening and the evidence we have is that this could pose a risk to the life or health of the woman who is taking it and who, because of the current legal status, may be afraid to seek help if it is needed.  By making it a GP-led service there will be medical oversight by qualified persons, which we are not.  I am not a qualified person so I am reluctant to stray too far into the medical aspects of the issue.  It is a matter for the Minister for Health to prepare legislation and for the consultants and doctors working in this area to deal with that in more detail.  The reason we use the phrase \"without restriction as to reason\" is that we have issues around rape and incest and other such complexities.  Perhaps it is possible to legislate but it would be extremely difficult.  I tend to think it is almost impossible to legislate based on the evidence that has been put before the committee.<\/p> <p>  The reason we say \"up to a limit of 12 weeks\" is based on the evidence that was given to the committee and I went on to the Women on Web website where it states that it is available up to 12 weeks.  I assume that what is on the website is put up there by the doctors running it.

I think it is a very sensitive issue and we need to be careful.  If we put a 12-week limit on a request for an abortion in the case of rape or incest we may well be excluding a whole cohort of women.  We are going through a period now where Women&rsquo;s Aid have 16 days of drawing our attention to the question of domestic violence and we are seeing programmes on the television in the home.  The Rape Crisis Centre gave a presentation recently in Dublin City Council.  There is a whole cohort of women who live in abusive relationships who are scared to come forward to look after their own health while they are caught in that abuse and while they are caught in that trap.  It may take more than 12 weeks for them to get out of that space.  It could be 16 weeks or 18 weeks.  If we limit access to 12 weeks then we are doing some of the most vulnerable, done down, badly treated women in society a huge disservice.  That includes women who are victims of incest who get pregnant as a result.  Again, we are looking at an extremely difficult situation to get out of both mentally, physically and financially and it may be that they are the ones who are in need of the late abortions more than anything else.

The incorporation of the line suggested by Deputy O'Connell into the motion, to the effect that it would be done in a clinical context determined by law and licensing practices, could perhaps cover the medical abortion pill.  I think that would cover it all.  My understanding is that it is safe to take the abortion pill up to ten or 12 weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#Q02000","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#Q02100","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I will read the question when the remaining members have spoken, namely, Deputies Louise O'Reilly and Catherine Murphy and Senator Mullen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#Q02200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in we will not be voting against the motion but neither are we in a position to support it.

I take the point that is being made.  The witnesses from Holland were quite useful in this regard.  In their jurisdiction, they have a 12-week limit but they drew attention, in particular, to the fact that those who tend to present later, where there has been rape or incest, for example, tend to be younger.  The delegates from Holland outlined how they dealt with a combination of factors, as in a rape accompanied by distress and mental health issues or, perhaps, a physical health issue where somebody very young is involved.  One can proceed by separating the two factors but I am concerned that we are trying to capture everything in one measure.  I am not opposed to it but I would rather see us dealing with each separately.

I do not believe I have ever done it.<\/p> <p>  To me, this is a very distressing proposal.  Motion 18 does not state \"in view of the difficulties with regulating the online purchase of abortion pills\".  The substance is \"because it is difficult to legislate for termination of pregnancy for reasons of rape or incest\".  I get why many good people are conflicted about those cases.  They are very heart-rending and difficult but there is something reminiscent of the judgment of Solomon about proposing that, since they are so complex to deal with, we should therefore propose that a much wider category of unborn children may be legally killed.  If one examines the law in Britain, one notes that the vast majority of Britain's staggering number of abortions per year, which is nearly 200,000, take place in the period up to 12 weeks, as I understand it.<\/p> <p>  At meetings of this committee, we never examined the size of an unborn child at 12 weeks, or just under.  As far as I know, we never looked at any images of an abortion.  I believe Deputy Mattie McGrath invited people to inform themselves at some level but the committee did not do so.  I do not even know whether the people proposing this could tell us or discuss in detail the size or developmental stage of the little creature whose legal right to exist is proposed to be dismissed here.  There is no difference between a surgical abortion and a medical abortion considering the impact on the unborn baby.  We have what I would regard as a really distressing proposal.  It is harder to imagine a better example of how politicians can lose sight of the humanity of unborn children through this whole process.  As I have said before, if one asks people the situations in which one can take away the right of unborn children, the answer seems to be, \"more and more, actually.\"<\/p> <p>  This is a very disturbing proposal.  It is for abortion on demand.  Having no restriction as to reason effectively means that if a person asks for an abortion, she gets it.  I am not clear from the wording whether it is intended that the general practitioner would prescribe the pills or whether they would have to be taken in a general practitioner's surgery but I do know there is no child under 12 weeks in the womb who would have the right to the protection of the law if the Irish people were to take this on board.  It is a staggering proposal and I urge people to reconsider it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#R01100","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>We are in danger of straying and staying here until Christmas, the way we are going.  I have just a couple of points.  People are confused about why we are here.  We are not drafting legislation; we are issuing guidance to the Oireachtas to draft legislation.  The idea that some people raised, namely, that our vote on this would be misinterpreted as a statement that there should be terminations in cases of rape only up to 12 weeks, does not reflect what anybody is saying.  A way of dealing with this is to take the vote on the Citizens' Assembly recommendation first.  I would imagine that it will be carried on its own.  It does not imply a restriction regarding any limit in cases of rape.  We should then consider the motion on the period of 12 weeks without any restrictions as to reason.  For some, a termination will be because of rape.  For others, there will be other reasons.  So be it; that is the motion.  That will deal with the matter so we will not just be cutting off access to terminations in cases of rape at 12 weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#R01200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I have outlined our position and the rationale that underpins it but I want to be very clear that this will not hinder us from supporting the final report.

We are not drafting legislation here.  These are simply recommendations.  I take the point that the Citizens' Assembly recommendation deals with the matter.  However, I have been approached by parents who have asked me to try to get this through without gestational limits.  This is why the recommendation was put forward.  The idea is to show compassion to people who have been through the experience.  They want to know that the gestational limits will not apply to them.<\/p> <p>  Having listened to the evidence of all witnesses I believe those provisions that put the woman and family at the centre of a case of desperation or a crisis pregnancy are absolutely the way to go.  The choice that a person might make in such a circumstance will be difficult.  It would not be easy and it would not be done without consulting many medical experts.  I assume we all understand that in the context of the motion.<\/p> <p>  I wish we lived in a society that really cared for those who suffer disadvantage and disability and those who are most vulnerable, but we do not.  We have not even ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities yet.<\/p> <p>  Recently, we watched the terrible tragedy of carers and the situation that they are left in for years.  Often this abides for their entire lives.  They are neglected by the State and not given proper respite care.  There is extraordinary disadvantage for people in society.

He said people with disabilities are a category of people and that we are looking to introduce abortion because they are a category of people.  What he says is true: people with disabilities are a category of people.  They also want access to bodily autonomy.  People with disability need access.<\/p> <p>  We look at all the different situations.  We have heard so many times that there are as many situations as there are pregnancies that end up in a given situation.  Perhaps a woman is in a family where there are already children with disability.  Perhaps she has several children or none.  Perhaps she has no support or resources.  Bringing a child that has a severe anomaly into the world can bring a major pressure on the family and a person's health.  I believe that we need to remove the gestational limits in respect of severe or significant foetal abnormalities, as we have done with all the other health grounds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#U01400","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I have to go to help with a quorum.

I would like to think that my career demonstrates a consistent vision of seeking to protect human dignity and seeking a society that goes the extra mile in terms of dispersal of public funds and so on.  This means reaching out and supporting people with disability in particular.  If Deputy Smith's comments were in any way directed at me, I would like to show her my record sometime.<\/p> <p>  I wish to comment on the business of the recommendation on a child with a significant abnormality.  We spoke a good deal about children with Down's syndrome.  Of course, they are only one category of children with disability or abnormality, but they are children who are particularly well-known and loved in Ireland.  We did not hear evidence on it, but eventually we got evidence about how in Britain over 90% of children who are scanned and found to have Down's syndrome are aborted.  I believe the figure is the same in Netherlands.  The corresponding figure is up to 97% or 98% in Denmark, with only four children being born.  From my perspective, any child with a foetal abnormality deserves extra love, care and protection from society.  The test of a civilised society is how it treats its most vulnerable members.  It is a really tragic development if there is a whole category of human beings who, because they are more vulnerable than the rest of us, are singled out to ensure they have fewer rights at any stage of pregnancy.<\/p><p>That is the journey that has been taken in the western world.  We heard Dr. Thompson invite us to disregard the fact that in certain cases children with something as minor as a cleft palate might be aborted up to birth, which is the law in Britain.  It was chilling testimony.  However, it does not matter if it is severe or not so severe because what the child needs is protection and what the family needs is support.  I, therefore, oppose this sincerely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#U01700","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1513173600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the committee recommend that the termination of pregnancy should be lawful without gestational limits in cases of significant foetal abnormality.\"<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 5; N\u00edl, 15.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Question declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V00200","aye":["1259","1226","1297","1404","1367"],"nay":["1354","1391","1336","1322","1331","1389","1229","1347","1401","1315","1280","1302","1325","1394","1231"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1513173600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Staon: Senator Catherine Noone.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>The next matter to be considered is whether the committee recommends that termination of pregnancy be lawful where the unborn child has a significant foetal abnormality that is not likely to result in death before or shortly after birth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V00500","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"vote","time":1513173600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the committee recommend that termination of pregnancy be lawful where the unborn child has a significant foetal abormality that is not likely to result in death before or shortly after birth.\"<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 5; N\u00edl, 15.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Question declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V00700","aye":["1259","1226","1297","1404","1367"],"nay":["1354","1391","1336","1322","1331","1389","1229","1347","1401","1315","1280","1302","1325","1394","1231"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1513173600,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Staon: Senator Catherine Noone.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":377,"content":"<p>We now move on to reason 12.

I struggle to understand how people can separate a woman's health from her socio-economic status or her living conditions, whether poverty, domestic violence, homelessness, prostitution or otherwise.  Her socio-economic circumstances are one of the main reasons a woman will seek to access abortion and 70% of the Citizens' Assembly voted in favour of allowing it.  If termination is not permitted on socio-economic grounds, this would highlight to me that access to abortion remains a class issue.  Although we will cater for many women up to 12 weeks, many women will not be able to access a doctor or perhaps not even know they are pregnant until that time has elapsed.  I worked with hundreds of people in addiction for years.  Some of the women did not have periods for years due to the damage to their body.  However, they became pregnant and nearly six months had elapsed before they realised it.  Given how a woman's social situation impacts on her health, this should be allowed as a ground to access abortion.  Women from more affluent areas who do not not meet the requirements or do not get to the doctor or find out that they are pregnant before the 12 weeks have elapsed will still be able to travel.  If we deny women the right to an abortion on socio-economic grounds, we are saying that we do not care about women who are in less favourable conditions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V01000","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":379,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V01100","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I have one more point.

It did not arise from the guidance of the chairperson, Ms Justice Laffoy.  It came from the body of the floor at the Citizens' Assembly where 72% were in favour of it.  This recognises and reiterates the consistent evidence we heard over the past three months from various witnesses, the latest being those from the Netherlands.  When I asked what weight they would give to what we call socio-economic grounds - I think they called them social reasons - they kind of looked at me as if I was nuts because, to them, of course it was a big reason.  It was obviously a clear reason to them.  I am not interpreting anything from their looks but the attitude was almost why would one not consider a person's social and economic background.  Senator Ruane touches on something really important here.  If we recognise that abortion is a reality for women already in Ireland, except we export it, we also have to recognise that so many more women did not have access to it because of their class situation.  This is a class issue.  Some 92% of terminations happen in the first 12 weeks.  The pill can deal with it, which is a great step forward.  In future laws, perhaps we can recognise it.  However, it would be great if the committee would take on board the evidence and the recommendation from the Citizens' Assembly and have that as a reason to be put to the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V01300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>What this issue has in common with the previous one about abortion for children with significant foetal abnormalities is that the committee will not recommend them here today.

There is a difference between being prosecuted and being convicted.  There is a difference between being convicted and being punished.  I make all of those points because I do not know if Deputy Kelleher was referring to all in the room when he said we all know what we want.  I want to make it clear that I oppose this agenda to decriminalise abortion.  The reason I do so is not because I ever want to see any woman targeted by the law but because the law exists not just to punish its breaches.  It exists also to deter people from doing something that is harmful to themselves and others.  What people seem to be saying here is, in the context where the committee is proposing to look for abortion effectively on demand - I do not need to say effectively but abortion on demand up to 12 weeks - is that any doctor who does it outside of a licensed clinical setting would be prosecuted.  However, it seems to be the view that there would be no criminal sanction for any woman who would ever try at any stage of pregnancy, or no breach of the criminal law I should say.  Even in Britain, which effectively has abortion on demand and late-term abortion on demand, abortion remains a criminal offence.<\/p><p>It is not prosecuted where some of the A, B, C, D and E grounds are met.  This would be a charter for rogue doctors.  This turns a blind eye to the fact that those who procure abortions for themselves end the life of an innocent child and, in many cases, cause hurt or potential hurt to themselves.<\/p><p> People seem to think that this is the only way in which one can prevent women from being fearful about going for medical care - I have heard this view canvassed - if they have procured an abortion pill and taken it.  However, it is possible to have laws in this country which guarantee that a person who seeks medical assistance will not be criminalised by reason of any offence which the person discloses to have committed in the course of seeking that medical care and it would be bad public policy to decriminalise abortion.  What I am saying to some degree makes no sense in the context of a committee that wants abortion but I draw the committee's attention to the British situation where it remains a criminal offence.  If one wants to even maintain the fig leaf of a desire to keep abortions to as few as possible, one certainly does not start by decriminalising it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#Y05700","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I would be very much in favour of decriminalising abortion.

It is very much appreciated.  We are very active at EU level and it is great to be able to bring disability issues to the fore, even if it has meant braving the cold to come here.  It has been freezing cold for the past week or so.  I am sure I am not the only one who has daydreamed in the past few weeks about jetting off to the warmer climate of one of the other EU member states.  If I wanted to, when I leave here and head into another cold and chilly wind, I could turn on my phone and book a flight.  I could book a house in another country such as Cyprus where I hear the temperature is about 20 degrees Celsius, which would be lovely.  I would able to daydream to my heart's content and it would not really matter if it was a dive, as it would still be sunny.  I would be able to apply for a job and even do interviews.  I could have a whole other life in an EU member state at the drop of a hat if I was to jump on a plane tomorrow.  I could pack up my life and go.<\/p><p>I could apply for a job, do interviews and set up a whole different life in an EU member state at the drop of a hat and jump on a plane tomorrow.  I could pack up my life and go.  I am sure I am not the only person who has thought of that in the last few weeks, especially when there were threats of having to hit the doorsteps again, who was dreaming of warmer climates.  Then the question arises about what happens if a person goes out and is caught up on his or her phone, does not realise there is a patch of ice, slips, falls and is injured.  If that person then has a disability, having perhaps injured his or her spine, lost vision, or has any range of disabilities, then what happens?  That person then falls within the 80 million people with disabilities across Europe who face systematic barriers and blockages to the enjoyment of their rights, entitlements and the fundamental freedoms that every EU citizen is entitled to but they are blocked from enjoying.  How does a person then go on a website to book flights that are not accessible?  What happens if transport is not accessible when that person arrives or is maybe only accessible at one or two stops?  What if those stops do not align with the housing that that person can live in?  What if the housing is not accessible or there are no accessible jobs?  This is about removing the barriers for people with disabilities to be able to enjoy the rights and entitlements that they are already entitled to by virtue of being EU citizens.  That is what I am here today to speak about.<\/p><p> I know the committee has my written submission.  I will speak to the content of that.  I will not be departing from it but I will be shifting it around a little because I am conscious it was written for reading and not to be spoken.  If anyone wants me to explain anything, by all means, do not hesitate to ask.  I will focus on some of the key elements.  I will look at the aims and values that underline the EU.  Linked to that, I will speak about the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Then I will explain that that is now part of the legal framework of the EU since the EU ratified it.  I will then speak about what is required to implement that and some of the key measures, instruments and initiatives to implement the UNCRPD, as it is often referred to.  Finally, I will address Brexit because it is obviously a huge topic for the EU and for Ireland.<\/p><p> I will start with the aims and values of the EU.  As I set out in the submission, this is to build on the submission of the European Anti-Poverty Network which was submitted to this committee too and to supplement that with disability-specific material.  The founding aims in the treaties of the EU are to further peace and the well-being of all persons across the EU and to deliver on the values that the EU holds dear.  Those values, which are set out in the treaties, are things like human dignity, equality, human rights and non-discrimination.  The question is then how we deliver on all of those.  As I set out, we unfortunately see that there has been a growth in poverty, social exclusion and inequality across the EU.  There is a disconnect between the values and aims and what is actually being delivered.  That leads me then to the United Nations convention.  It is international law which the EU, as a legal entity, has ratified, so it has committed to meeting those legal obligations.  What are the obligations?  It is a roadmap and direction on how to meet and respect the rights of persons with disabilities.  In doing so, one will be meeting the fundamental aims of human rights and respect and dignity of the EU.  It is all interlinked.<\/p><p> I will address some of the key ways of going about actually implementing that.  I could be here for a week if I were to set out all the different policies, strategies and legislation so I will just flag one or two.  The main one is the European disability strategy.  This is currently running from 2010 to 2020 and discussions have already started about what the next strategy is going to be for 2020 onwards.  That is really key to today's discussion on the future of Europe.  It is the strategy for how the EU will go about implementing the UNCRPD.  It is that simple.  The DFI led a delegation just last week over to a very special event which took place in the European Parliament.  It was called the European Parliament of Persons with Disabilities.  We led a delegation of 11 people to participate in that and it was focused on the disability strategy and the importance of delivering on people's rights and entitlements.  The key message from that was that one had to make sure to strive to implement the UNCRPD.  It is a legal obligation that we have now committed to.  The message was also that one had to make sure that there were resources and funding to facilitate implementation.  Crucially, it has to be monitored.  This relates to an approach to how we do things in public service.  I refer the committee to the submission where I said that the implementation has to be systemic, comprehensive and look at what the causes of issues are, what the blockages are, how we grab it by the root, sort it, deal with it and tackle the issues facing people with disabilities.<\/p><p> Another key instrument that I am sure the committee is familiar with is the European Pillar of Social Rights.  This was proclaimed by the institutions in November.  I will not dwell on it except to say that it has been proclaimed and it explicitly mentions the inclusion of people with disabilities, which is very much welcome.  Even where it is not explicitly mentioned, the language and terminology would be incorporated throughout.  That was referred to when it was proclaimed by the institutions as really being at the core of the values of the EU, of seeking inclusivity and improving the living conditions of persons across the EU.<\/p><p> With regard to implementation, I would also highlight funding which is the big, bad, evil thing that can send people scared and running.  Where does one get the finances from?  This is a very broad-reaching topic.  We know that the EU already has a whole array of funding mechanisms and that it already gives funding out.  That could be for infrastructure, transport, but I will not go into it since there is a whole array that the EU funds and supports.  One of the biggest things, for example, would be the European structural and investment funds.  Unfortunately, we have seen that, throughout the recession and the economic crisis, austerity has been implemented across Europe.  It has hit all people across Europe but people with disabilities have felt it particularly acutely.  There have been cuts to social and health services and community-based services right across the board.  This is really about the funding mechanisms that already exist.  To be compliant with the commitments that the EU has made to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we need to incorporate the inclusion and accessibility for persons with disabilities into the existing mechanisms.  An example of this is the European structural and investment funds.  A number of years ago - the year evades me - the funds were used to support, construct and maintain big institutional settings for persons with disabilities.<\/p><p>The European Union took action by inserting a requirement that the funds be used to support people to live in the community, in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Difficulties, UNCRPD.  However, it was, unfortunately, found by the UN committee which monitors how the European Union complies with the convention that some of the funds were nevertheless being used in ways that were not necessarily in line with it.  The committee has advised that in the future the European Union must ensure it monitors how the funds are being used and make their usage reliant on compliance with the UNCRPD and, if necessary, withdraw or recall funds or put an end to funding if they are not being expended in a compliant manner.  That could have a huge tangible effect on the lives of persons with disabilities.<\/p><p> The European semester process, on which I will not go into too much detail, involves a set structure whereby the European Union monitors how economic policies are implemented across member states and seeks to co-ordinate them.  In particular, it resulted from the economic downturn and seeks to ensure more stable and sustainable organisation and economic policies.  It also has effects in terms of social and environmental factors.  It is a key mechanism which can be used to incentivise and guide member states on how they can reach obligations linked with the EU legal framework.  For example, country-specific recommendations may be issued on how a particular country is incorporating accessibility and inclusion in that regard.  Bigger steps are also needed, but these are things that can be tagged on and included in the existing mechanisms and which could make a huge difference to the way member states think about providing for people with disabilities and have a knock-on effect on people's lives.<\/p><p> I highlight the matter of Brexit.  It is a huge issue for Ireland, but I wish to flag some key aspects that are particularly relevant for people with disabilities.  The United Kingdom is a huge source of funding for the European Union and its contribution will be lost when it leaves the Union.  What will happen thereafter?  We cannot allow the level of funding for disability and social inclusion initiatives to drop.  It was reiterated in the European Parliament last week that it was a key matter and that funding levels could not drop when the funding arrangements changed.  Planning to counteract the lack of funding must be carried out now.<\/p><p> There are other more specific and tangible ways Brexit could impact on people with disabilities.  A lot of work has been done on this issue by other Oireachtas committees such as the Joint Committee on Health and the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, but I wish to flag items such as the cross-border health care directive.  People in the European Union have a right to avail of health care services in other EU countries.  How will Brexit affect those living in Ireland and the United Kingdom who have disabilities, in particular in the Border region between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland?  The position of social and health care workers who live on one side of the Border and who cross it on a daily basis for work has been well documented, but if these workers are supporting people with disabilities or working in the sector, it could have a huge impact on the supports available to people with disabilities.  What will the impact be for a person with a disability arising from very mundane daily things such as having to travel an extra distance to the closest shop or post office?  Will there be accessible transport to the nearest hub, town or city?  What impact will it have on their income and capacity to participate in the community?  These are the key issues<\/p><p> The announcement on Ireland's role in the Brexit negotiations was very welcome and significant because how Ireland and people with disabilities here will be affected will set a precedent across the European Union for how smaller member states and their citizens will be treated in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona O'Donovan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Donovan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#C00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":698,"content":"<p>It is ironic that representatives of many Irish disability rights organisations are giving evidence to the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Trade which is meeting in the committee room next door.

We have signed it, but we have not ratified it.  All the other EU member states have signed and ratified it.  It is a bit of a misnomer, but it means that they have undertaken the obligations.  How it is actually happening in other countries is a very good question, if I may say so.  The honest answer, from our experience at EU level, is that it varies.  There is a process to implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  Realistically, certain countries are prioritising certain aspects, rather than saying that they are going to solve every problem today and then nothing will have to be done.  That is not how it works.  We cannot set a timeframe with the UNCRPD, meet that timeframe in two years and be done with it.  It is an ongoing process.  Yes, the other EU member states are certainly working towards it, but equally there will be different stages of compliance.  There may be areas where member states will be particularly advanced, while in other areas they are working on catching up.  That is in keeping with the UNCRPD being an ongoing process.  Things will change, new laws will come in, and everything must then be found to be compliant.  It does not have such a definitive deadline for implementation.  There will have to be an ongoing implementation, an ongoing incorporation of people with disabilities into policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona O'Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":703,"content":"<p>I call Senator John Dolan.

Some of these issues have effects from Dingle to Brussels.  Perhaps it will be possible to come back to this issue in the new year.<\/p> <p>  I should say at the outset that I was in a position last week, as chief executive of the Disability Federation of Ireland, to lead a delegation of 11 Irish parliamentarians to the European Parliament for the European Day of Persons with Disabilities.  Some 750 people with disabilities came from across Europe , and we had a very strong delegation.  I am delighted to say that Mr. Gary Carney, who is in the Gallery today, was one of the members of that delegation.<\/p> <p>  We discussed Europe and the world.  That issue has been taken up already by Deputy O'Keeffe.  We discussed the European Parliament elections in 2019, and the participation of people with disabilities in the election process, which is an issue right here in Ireland that we hope to address.  We also discussed the next European Union disability strategy which will follow the current one.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, I would like to thank Ms Fiona O'Donovan for her presentation.  On the third page of her opening statement, she quotes Article 3 of the Treaty of the European Union: \"The Union's aim is to promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples.\"  She notes that Article 2 sets out a number of values, including respect, human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, etc.<\/p> <p>  Think of how hard it was to arrive at a European Union.  It took two horrendous wars.  Countless thousands and millions of people were slaughtered.  Others became refugees or were made homeless.  A little more than ten years after that war, the European Union came together.  We have the values and the statements.  We have the history of what it took to pull Europe together.  We have the European Union, which is, as Ms O'Donovan has mentioned, a very novel and precious entity in the world.  There is no other part of the world that has a regional entity like the EU.  We can complain about the EU, but there is nothing else comparable anywhere.  We may think about disabled people in Africa and other places.  Over the past ten years, the EU and its agencies took a particular approach to the economic crisis, which was one word starting with the letter A: austerity.  Given that background, does Ms O'Donovan think that the EU is in a good place at this point or does it need to shift its mindset to be a Union for all its people?  She mentioned 80 million with disabilities in the EU, with that number set to increase to 100 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#D00400","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I thank Ms O'Donovan very much for coming in here today.  I would like to raise one very important issue which she spoke about.  A man whom I have great respect for in his ministerial role is the Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection, Deputy Finian McGrath.  One thing I like about politics is that there can be a strong difference of opinion.  I respect the Minister of State's view on this issue, but I do not agree with it.  Those present might even have a difference of opinion on this issue, namely, congregated settings.  One size does not fit all.  For example, in County Kerry we have what I would call a centre of excellence, St. Mary of the Angels in Beaufort.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the background.  For many years a very nice farmer and his wife owned a beautiful farm.  They had a daughter who became a nun.  They wanted to do something special with their farm, so they gave it up on the condition that whatever was built there would be for the betterment of people with physical or intellectual disabilities.  For many years, it was run as an excellent facility that grew with the demand in County Kerry.  A school was built there.  It is now on a slippery slope.  The facility is not accepting any more residents, because since June 2011 there has been a policy, over which I would draw a big question mark, against congregated settings.<\/p> <p>  I fully agree with the Minister of State when he says that he does not want people to be in a facility if it does not allow them to get the most out of their potential.  If I had a family member with an intellectual or a physical disability, I would not want him or her put away somewhere, as it might be called, if I thought that by living in the community, he or she would have a better way of life and better outcomes, or that he or she could develop personally.<\/p> <p>  I know many people with different types of disabilities.  I always say that it seems to be the case that a person with a disability has a fierce and great ability in some other way.  It could be some other physical attribute such as sport, or they could be very intellectually smart.  I took an ambassador from here down to Kerry to visit a school, and he asked a number of questions.  The person who answered the most difficult questions in the classroom that day was a student who happened to have a special needs assistant sitting alongside him.  I met that young person and discussed our visit with him.  That young person could blind anybody else when it came to ability.  At the same time, he had other needs that we will call, with a question mark, a disability.<\/p> <p>  I will return to St. Mary of the Angels and the reasons I am against the policy of depopulating congregated settings.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, there is a category of person who, because of the severity of their intellectual or physical disability, will need to be in what I would call a centre of excellence.  I would call St. Mary of the Angels a centre of excellence because it has a lifetime of experience of dealing with people with special needs.  Thankfully, over the years people have engaged in massive voluntary fundraising for the service.  Those were people who supported the work being done there, the Beaufort community down into the Black Valley, all of mid-Kerry, and the parents and relatives of family and friends who benefited from the service, from staying there and from going to school there. They supported it financially and organised fundraising events.  Every week there would have been a fundraising event for St. Mary of the Angels, which is now under St. John of God Order, and all the time it has provided a great service.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, with natural progression, we will all die.  As residents in St. Mary of the Angels have died, their spaces have not been replaced.  I appreciate the efforts being made and the policy of buying properties in the community and placing people in those, but that is not always the best place for every category of person.  There are people who benefit from that and from being part of the community in a limited or in as full a way as they can to gain the most out of it for themselves.  However, there are would-be parents of the future who, unfortunately and sadly, may have children with profound disabilities who would benefit from having a centre of excellence in their locality.  I am concerned that St. Mary of the Angels, as we know it today, will shut down over a period of time because, effectively, it is not taking in people.  I believe that policy is wrong.  I am not saying it is wrong to bring other people back out of settings to live in the community.  Of course, that is right and it is a great policy, but it is not one that benefits every person with a disability.<\/p><p> I have debated this issue with the Minister of State.  I was grateful that when I asked him to come to Kerry and visit places such as St. Mary of the Angels, he did so.  He is coming back to Kerry in January and I welcome that.  I welcome his engagement and the work he has done in his portfolio.  I am not being critical but I have a difference on opinion on this issue.  Some disability association groups would disagree with my view but they could not argue with my meaning this in the best possible way in that holding on to centres of excellence around the country is good for the future and we should not let them be closed by stealth.<\/p><p> I liked the analogy Ms O'Donovan made at the start of her presentation about a person being able to drop sticks here tomorrow if he or she wanted to and go to anywhere in the world he or she would like, but a person with a disability cannot do that as there are many other factors that have to be taken into account.  I welcome and very much acknowledge the work Ms O'Donovan's group does.  The same issues face people with disabilities whether they are based in Holland, Berlin, Ballinskelligs or any other part of the world.  If one is a wheelchair user or has any type of disability, one will have the same problems.  We need the same advocates for such people, namely, ourselves as politicians and excellent groups such as the Disability Federation of Ireland which does the work that it does, and we must all pull together at all times.  We must admit that services have improved dramatically over the years.  We will always have to strive for more and better conditions.  The resources given to people are most welcome and they have improved, but we will always have to fight for more.  It has been very beneficial that the representatives of this group to come here today and Ms O'Donovan now has the opportunity to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#D00500","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513173600,"counter":707,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman kindly for that.  I will respond first to Senator Dolan's question regarding austerity and what needs to change.  The best answer I can give to that question is the message that came through from last week's proceedings in Brussels which was a very strong call that austerity needs to end and investment needs to be put into supports, services and community-based supports and services for people with disabilities.  Without investment it cannot develop.  As I said, austerity has been felt most profoundly by persons with disabilities and other groups who would have be particularly marginalised from society.  A key point to remember is that people with disabilities are people and, by their nature, they are diverse.  They are immigrants with disabilities and women, children, men and the range of human existence of persons with disabilities.  In terms of austerity, however, the tide needs to change.  People with disabilities and the services supporting them cannot take any more cuts and they need investment.  The people and the citizens of Europe need investment.  The focus has been very strongly on economic policies and economic stability - this has been the topic of a submission made in numerous fora - and that is understandable and must be recognised.  As I said in my submission paper, the EU has demonstrated that it can act with determination and resolve, but that now needs to shift and be focused on, showing the same determination to improving the lives of the citizens of the EU.  It is not just about the economics.  As I said in the submission paper, it is not just about fixing the economic crisis.  The question is how this crisis impacted on the lives of persons in the EU.  The only way to change that around is to start to invest in improving the lives of persons with disabilities and the wider EU citizenship.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the question raised by the Chairman.  Certainly decongregation is a key issue in Ireland now.  It is referred to as the institutionalisation at EU level and this is part of a disconnect.  It is like trying to translate the lingo from the EU to the national and even to the local.  I appreciate the Chairman raising it here in the Irish context. <\/p> <p>  I would not presume to comment on the specifics of the local service in the community but I will speak more generally on the issue.  Decongregation is a policy based on research on the lived experiences and the wills and preferences of people with disabilities.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD - I believe it is Article 19 which focuses on community-based services - specifically calls for people to be given a choice as to where they want to live, how they want to live their lives and to give support to community-based services.  I certainly understand a concern around losing a centre of excellence but the question is what actually is the concern there.  What is the root issue.  Does it go more fundamentally to a fear of losing the excellence, the supports and the knowledge, which is what having community-based services is all about?  It is about ensuring that people with disabilities can live and be part of the community and have that expertise to hand in a form appropriate to their needs locally, in their local health centres, local primary care centres or wherever it is, and in this way not losing the excellence but applying it in a different way to support people to live in the community.<\/p><p>In terms of the fundraising and its importance to the community, that would be replicated throughout the country.  That would be true of many support organisations.<\/p><p> It is a question of recognising that excellence can be provided in a different way and to give the choice and support.

I am very honoured to speak to the committee which I congratulate on its deep engagement on the future of Europe.  I understand it has carried out extensive public consultation on this important topic and look forward to hearing some of its insights during our discussion.<\/p> <p>  Education and culture are high on the political agenda in the European Union.  At the recent social summit in Gothenburg, Sweden, Europe&rsquo;s political leaders held an exchange of views on education and culture.  I am proud that the debate built on an ambitious vision set out by the European Commission.  In our policy document, our communication on Strengthening European Identity through Education and Culture, we set out our ambition for a Europe capable of harnessing the full potential of education and culture, to build resilience, promote social fairness and active citizenship and strengthen European identity in all its diversity.  We want to work towards a Europe where learning, studying and conducting research will not be blocked by borders, where skilled and independent citizens will find or create fulfilling jobs, contribute to growth and innovation and feel empowered to shape communities and where people will share a strong sense of European identity and feel connected to our common cultural heritage.  <\/p> <p>  What does this mean in practice?  The communication calls for a European education area enabling the mutual recognition of higher education and school-leaving diplomas and study periods abroad.  It suggests we improve co-operation between universities and the mobility of students with the support of an EU student card.  It proposes steps to help member states boost the levels of skills, including basic skills, language skills and digital and entrepreneurial skills, as well as transversal skills and competences, and to promote lifelong learning.  All of this, whether it is mobility and recognition, skills development or support for teachers and educators, needs to be based on solid funding.  Hence, the communication recognises that to reach these goals, the future Erasmus+ programme will need to be substantially bigger than the current one.  It also reaffirms the European Union&rsquo;s commitment to safeguarding our common values and cultural heritage with continued support for the cultural and creative sectors.  We want to develop a strong European agenda for culture to help us to uphold European identity and diversity.  All children and young people should have the opportunity to realise their full potential and positively contribute to society.  However, the reality shows that the talents of millions of young people are lost each year.  Poorer students are three times more likely to be low performers than their wealthier peers.  We all need to do more to overcome these challenges and the European Union is willing to play its part.  I am pleased to announce that I will be hosting the first European education summit in Brussels on 25 January 2018 to follow up on the ambitions we have set out.  The summit will bring together Ministers, academics, stakeholders and civil society representatives in order to work towards a high-level political consensus on tackling inequality in and through education.  We must join forces to address underachievement in basic skills, to make education systems more inclusive and ensure they will benefit from smart investment.  We must develop a clear picture of what skills are needed for the decades to come.  <\/p> <p>  I count on the active participation of Irish authorities and Ireland has plenty of experiences to share.  In the past decade this country has undertaken unprecedented national efforts to modernise its education sector, despite going through a very difficult period.  During the recent economic crisis and the subsequent structural adjustment it sheltered education from major and far-reaching fiscal consolidation measures.  Ireland has also greatly improved in providing basic skills and combating early school leaving and inequalities, as well as in promoting participation in pre-school education.  It is one of the leading countries in Europe in tertiary attainment and has put forward a set of fairly ambitious goals for the future.  It is investing in education with a new impetus in terms of public spending in the sector and a very promising 2018 budget for education and training.  It also intends to focus more on educational infrastructure and higher capital expenditure, in particular with a view to attracting talent from elsewhere in Europe and the rest of the world.  However, a number of challenges remain.  They include the inclusion of disadvantaged students, the affordability of and access to child care, the long-term financial sustainability of third level education and the ongoing reform of the further education and training sector.  The European Commission stands ready to help Irish authorities in their efforts to make Ireland's education system one of the best in Europe.  <\/p> <p>  In the field of youth the European Commission is preparing a review of the EU youth strategy, the framework for youth policy co-operation.  The proposals we will outline before the summer will be based on young people's and youth stakeholders' input, as well as on the evaluation of the current strategy.  One priority is already clear for me: we need to reach out to many more young people to make sure our youth will have opportunities to engage and be heard in the democratic process, no matter where they are or what their background is.  <\/p> <p>  Another youth-related matter that has been high on our agenda this year is the European Solidarity Corps.  Since its launch, more than 43,000 young people have registered, showing their enthusiasm for solidarity and a willingness to volunteer or work to support others.  I expect the corps to get its own legal basis and budget next year following the agreement of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  <\/p> <p>  Throughout 2017 we celebrated the 30th anniversary of Erasmus, a unique programme which has given 9 million people, among them tens of thousands of Irish people, the opportunity to study, train, teach and volunteer abroad, providing them with the skills and outlook needed to thrive in life.  With more than 900 events and a huge involvement in social media and the press, the campaign reached more than 90 million European citizens, well beyond those already benefiting from the programme.  This year was also an opportunity to take stock and develop a common vision for the future of the programme.  My priority is to reach out to many more people from a wider range of backgrounds.  I also want to strengthen the mobility of school pupils, for example.  As I said at the beginning, if the future Erasmus+ is going to support our political objectives effectively, it will need to be beefed up.  The President of the European Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, and the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Antonio Tajani, have called for a substantial budget increase to make sure the future programme will be nine times more ambitious.  During the final EU-level event of the 30th anniversary campaign in Brussels the Erasmus+ generation declaration was presented.  The declaration contains 30 recommendations from the community of those who have benefited from the programme on how to make Erasmus+ a bigger programme, with a bigger impact on the future of Europe.  <\/p> <p>  In the area of sport we focus on promoting physical activity and grassroots sport.  The third edition of the European Week of Sport which took place in September attracted 12 million participants.  With its first edition having taken place only three years ago, I am pleased to see how much the idea has spread and how fast it has been adopted by member states and the sport family.  This year, together with my fellow Commissioners Phil Hogan who is in charge of agriculture and Vytenis Andriukaitis who is responsible for health, I launched a new initiative to promote healthy lifestyles across policy areas such as sport, education, food marketing, innovation and research.  Sport is very much about joy and physical well-being, but it also has a bigger role because it helps to build communities.<\/p><p>It is something I saw in Ireland first-hand when I met with leaders of the GAA in Croke Park and attended an All-Ireland hurling final just over two years ago.  To highlight the role of sport in communities, I launched the #BeInclusive EU sport awards which recognises organisations using sport to increase social inclusion for disadvantaged groups.  I was honoured to hand out the first awards at the end of November.  <\/p><p> We have just launched the European year of cultural heritage.  I want to place children and young people at the heart of this initiative.  By encouraging them to discover and engage with Europe&rsquo;s cultural heritage through a wide range of activities and programmes we can enable them to become guardians of our cultural heritage and to use it to build the Europe of tomorrow.  That is why the educational value of cultural heritage will be emphasised throughout the year.  The European year of cultural heritage is not a Brussels event, far from it.  We want people to explore and connect with heritage close to where they are.  That is why we will see a series of initiatives and events at European, national, regional and local levels.  At national level, the year is managed by national co-ordinators appointed by all 28 member states and I am pleased to say Ireland is enthusiastically represented by the Heritage Council.  I heard quite a bit about what is planned in Ireland throughout the year.  This morning, I attended the Creative Ireland forum where I launched the European year of cultural heritage in this country.  I trust that Ireland will make a success of the year.  <\/p><p> Deep structural changes are affecting our societies and economies at a time when many people also cope with the breakdown of social connections and families.  The policy fields I am responsible for, education, culture, youth and sport, have a crucial role in creating the resilience we need to overcome these challenges.  They can empower people, enabling them to lead independent, fulfilling lives and build inclusive, fair societies.  It is therefore heartening to see these policy areas at the top of Europe's political agenda.  Let us work together to ensure they stay there.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tibor Navracsics","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner.  I am sorry he is here when there is legislation going through the House and various committees are sitting, which means attendance is a bit low.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate the Commissioner on the 30 years of the Erasmus programme.  It has been a wonderful programme.  The Commissioner pointed out that in Ireland our students have benefited well from it.  It is a tremendous programme but, as it moves forward, I would like to see it expand into the areas of apprenticeship in addition to academic study.  We have to offer those seeking technical skills the opportunity to study abroad and learn the language of the country they are working in.  I would like to see more work done on that.  Coming from a teaching background, one of the things I feel is vitally important is that a teacher of language should actually train for a period in the country of the language they hope to teach.  For example, one should train for a year in France if one wants to teach French or in Germany if one wants to teach German.  I would like to see an Erasmus programme that extends to those who deliver academic programmes whether at primary, second or third level.  I would like to see an opportunity for that.  Perhaps a teacher who goes to France for a year to work and teach French in France could be replaced by a French teacher coming to Ireland to work and teach English in an Irish school.  We need to look at that.  One of the concerns we have as a result of Brexit is that there are almost 1.8 million people in the northern part of the country who have an entitlement to carry an Irish passport and as such are entitled to full European citizenship.  In the event of Brexit being completed, access to Erasmus for those people will become an extremely important issue.  While they will technically be in a third country, they are separated from their country of choice by geography.  We must maintain access to Erasmus programmes for Irish passport carriers living and working or studying in the North of Ireland because by right they are Irish citizens.  <\/p> <p>  Dr. Navracsics has responsibility for the area of education.  I have become increasingly concerned in recent years by the level of focus on statistics.  Statistics are useful for establishing whether a programme has been successful or unsuccessful.  I worked in further education and I came through second-chance education, having returned to college in my late 30s.  One of the things that concerns me is that when I returned to college in my 30s, the focus was on getting me in and getting me settled.  Nobody ever questioned whether I would take an examination or not.  The focus was on getting adults back engaging in the system.  I became a teacher when I qualified and over the 25 years I was teaching the focus shifted to verifiable statistical information, for example, how many students started the course, how many modules they took and how many modules they passed.  The success or failure of the programme was based on statistics.  Whether we like it or not, for some people who return to education surviving the year in the system is sufficient.  We must go back and look at the social side of education as well as the statistical side.  I would like the Commissioner to try to put some money or grant aid aside to get away from the statistics and look at community based education or education for the sake of learning rather than education for the sake of examination qualifications.  <\/p> <p>  The Commissioner mentioned the area of sport in his presentation.  Sport and sporting activity is extremely important.  There was a study carried out by some students from Kinsale Community School on the availability of sporting facilities in the country which showed the east-west divide in Ireland is stark.  A school in the eastern half of the country is likely to have its own gymnasium and other sporting facilities.  However, the further west one goes, the likelihood of finding these facilities in abundance is limited unless the school is a very new school or the parents have funded a gymnasium.  Let us face it, gymnasiums are not high on the list for parents when it comes to education.  They would rather put the money into other parts of education.  This might sound like the pot calling the kettle black because I am a rather large man but one of the problems we have in Europe is the growing rates of obesity.  Unless we get our children involved in sporting activities at a very young age the problem will be exacerbated over time.  Perhaps through the good offices of the Commissioner, we could look at how we could assist countries that have limited access to sporting facilities to start developing them within their regions.  <\/p> <p>  I am delighted to see that culture has not been left out of the event and that the Commissioner's focus is not on the big ticket events but on small towns and villages where everybody can get involved.  We had a tremendous year in 2016 where every town, village and townland in the country became involved in the remembrance of the revolution.  We are now coming into 2018 which is the centenary of women getting the vote.  That will be a major cultural issue for Ireland and something to be celebrated.  One hopes it will be celebrated in every village and townland in the country.  Any assistance the Commissioner can give in that area would be very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Commissioner for taking the time to come here.  It is always good to get Commissioners over from Europe to know they are alive and well.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#J00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":716,"content":"<p>Before we proceed to our next speaker I welcome Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin, Chair of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, to the meeting today.

If there is Brexit and the North is outside the European Union, there will be hundreds of thousands of Irish citizens who hold Irish passports and, by virtue of that, are European citizens but who, regrettably, will live outside the territory of the European Union.  Their rights must be vindicated.  In his area of competence, with education being the main area, how will Mr. Navracsics ensure that their rights will be respected fully and that there will be no loss of rights for those people?<\/p> <p>  In his speech the European Commissioner spoke about wanting to develop a strong European agenda for culture to help us uphold European identity and diversity.  That is very important, and protecting diversity and identity becomes even more important in the context of Brexit and a rise of the far right in some parts of Europe.  The Brexit talks are moving into the second phase and there will now be substantial talks on a potential free trade agreement between Britain and the European Union.  Is it possible to have a free trade agreement between Britain and the European Union that would allow for the free movement of goods and services but would curtail the movement of people?  If one wishes to have free movement of goods and services there must be free movement of people.  I expect that will be a thorny issue in the negotiations, given that it was a big issue in the referendum in Britain.  It was hyped up by some far right politicians in Britain but it was an issue.  If one wishes to protect the rights of citizens and people's identity as well as ensuring diversity, the free movement of people is important, especially in countries with which we have free trade agreements which resemble the customs union and Single Market, if that is what emerges.<\/p> <p>  I wish to contest one part of the European Commissioner's statement.  He said that during the most recent economic crisis education was sheltered from major and far-reaching fiscal consolidation measures in this State.  That is not quite true.  I will forward to him information on the difference between what was invested in education before the crash and what was invested in it after the crash.  He will see the substantial difference.  He might also be aware that third level fees were increased substantially on two occasions due to the economic crash.  Unfortunately, education was not protected as much as the European Commissioner might have been informed it was.  I make that point to provide information and clarity.<\/p> <p>  We are discussing the future of Europe.  While education is the remit of the European Commissioner I wish to refer to some aspects of the broader issues of reform of the European Union.  There has been a clash at the heart of the European project for many years, probably since its inception, between those who want what could be argued to be a more federal Europe or united states of Europe and those who want a more democratic and social Europe.  I am on the side of those who want a more democratic and social Europe.  Mr. Martin Schulz recently said he wants greater and deeper integration, a more federal Europe.  He is entitled to his opinion.  All opinions can be sincerely held and people are entitled to state their positions, but can Mr. Navracsics share his personal view on that debate and clash?  Does he agree that many Europeans are worried and concerned about a European federal super state?  Would he agree that this was, in part, one of the drivers of Brexit and that if we wish to ensure the integrity of the European project we must be careful to be in tune at all times with what the people want, not what politicians who might operate in silos or bubbles in Europe or people in the Commission might see as being in the best interests of European citizens?  We must listen to people's voices on what they want.  What is the European Commissioner's view on that?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the European Commissioner's area of education, if I am arguing for a more social Europe it means I am seeking a stronger focus on citizens' rights and investment in public services, which would include the rights of citizens in education.  In what areas would Mr. Navracsics seek improvement?  He spoke about an increase in his overall budget for education, which would be welcome.  However, in terms of the rights of citizens across Europe and in the context of reforming Europe, and these hearings are about reforming Europe and the future of Europe, what would be his vision for education and its place within a reformed European Union project, whatever the nature of that reform?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#K00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I welcome the European Commissioner and the officials.  We had an opportunity to meet briefly earlier.  Mr. Navracsics mentioned the European Week of Sport.  I attended the signing of the first European Week of Sport with the partners on behalf of Special Olympics Europe Eurasia.  I am still a volunteer with that organisation and the organisation was delighted to participate in the first European Week of Sport and on subsequent occasions.  I offer my congratulations on that.  It is always good to see horizons being pushed out on so many different levels.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make some comments in the context of my role as chairman of the committee on education and skills.  Our thinking is very much in line with the European Commissioner's in terms of the work programme and some of the reports we have produced.  The Education and Training Monitor from the European Commission has been very helpful in focusing our minds.  One of the areas mentioned, and it was mentioned in the European Commissioner's opening address, is the value of alternative pathways and vocational routes.  Our committee held a hearing on apprenticeships earlier this year and we sent our findings to the Minister.  We hope they will be taken on board.  One of the main reasons for having that meeting and developing the report is that we feel there is a view that attendance at university is almost obligatory to succeed and to have a successful career.  Apprenticeships are often seen as the poor relation to university courses.  We must do what we can to develop a parity of esteem in that regard.  Only two weeks ago our committee dealt with the legislation to provide for technological universities in Ireland, to ensure our institutes of technology would have parity of esteem and be able to attract funding and the students they require.  That is very important.  In fact, there was a non-partisan approach by all members of the committee to progress that Bill.  The recognition of its importance meant there was a willingness to consider alternative views and to progress the legislation as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  The committee also met the Irish team that competed in WorldSkills Abu Dhabi 2017.  Its members won seven medallions for excellence.  I and the committee members were very impressed by the calibre of the Irish delegation and its exceptional achievements on the world stage.  However, there is no national stage or competition in Ireland.<\/p><p>That is somewhat lacking.  The Commissioner may be familiar with the young scientist and technology exhibition held in Ireland every January which has been an incredible success.  It has opened up science to students.  I have suggested a similar event be run to showcase the importance of apprenticeships and skills training as an alternative to university courses.  I am interested in hearing his views on that matter.  In his opening contribution he referred to students developing resilience, which is hugely important.  We made a report to the Minister with 20 recommendations related to positive mental health in education at primary, second and third level and to non-formal and informal education.  It is of crucial importance to all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#K00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I am sorry., but I have to step out to deal with a situation.

The Commissioner plans to host a European education summit, which is welcome, to improve co-operation in providing for the mobility of students.  The implications of Brexit are a major concern for us.  Some 12,000 Irish students are studying in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Last week's news was positive in having a softer Brexit than anticipated, but it is still a major concern.  Our universities are under a great deal of pressure and the Central Applications Office process would have to change completely if we had to absorb another 12,000 students, apart from the need from a European perspective to give students, lecturers and so on the mobility to study or work abroad.<\/p> <p>  The basic skills of Irish students in maths and science are high according to the Education and Training Monitor and relatively unaffected by socioeconomic background, which is positive, but there is a risk that other subjects such as the humanities may suffer as a result of the emphasis placed on maths and science.  That debate has started strongly in the past 12 months and I am interested in hearing the Commissioner's views on it.<\/p> <p>  Ireland compares well in meeting education targets for early school leaving rates.  However, there are still many inequalities in participation and access.  That is a key problem for us at every level.  It has been suggested limiting the number of students who participate in tertiary education is a failing and needs to be addressed.  Does the Commissioner agree that this causes a points race and that there is an an over-emphasis on academic achievement?  There is a risk that other parts of a student's development such as resilience are being ignored.  Sometimes students accept courses to which they may not be entirely suited, but they are more desirable to do because they require higher points.  That can contribute to a higher dropout rate.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the Commissioner.

I will deal with similar questions in thematic groups.  <\/p> <p>  I will address first the role of skills in education, apprenticeship programmes and the mobility of apprentices because clearly that is one of the lines we would like to follow in the future.  It is obvious from the statistical data that we have to do more to make the education systems more skills oriented and transform them from being the traditionally one-sided knowledge oriented system into a more practical and skills oriented system, while availing of all of the opportunities and other forms of education to reach that goal.  That is why we encourage member states to enrich their forms of education in lifelong learning and provide for greater investment in informal and non-formal education and use all of these opportunities to promote social inclusion.  In our experience education is one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, policy tools for social inclusion.  That is why we have chosen the accessibility of education systems as a main topic for this year's Education and Training Monitor.  There is a direct correlation between life opportunities and access to education systems.  That means, from the point of view of the cohesion of future societies, accessibility of education systems can be an important societal factor.  That is why we support projects to make cross-border apprenticeship and apprenticeship mobility programmes more common.  <\/p> <p>  The European Solidarity Corps, ESC, was launched a year ago.  Volunteering is a well known aspect of the corps.  We have 43,000 applicants for it, most of whom are interested in volunteering schemes which are a successor to the European voluntary service programme.  However, at the same time, we are working on the apprenticeship and occupation-led elements of the ESC which will offer new opportunities for cross-border apprenticeship programmes.  It is a work in progress, but I hope that in the near future we can launch the first apprenticeship programmes and projects under the framework of the ESC.  However, there are existing opportunities for cross-border apprenticeship activities within the Erasmus programme.  There is an opportunity to establish apprenticeship consortia among companies through public private partnerships comprising public authorities and private companies.<\/p><p>They, too, can have cross-border apprenticeship programmes.  International companies have a huge advantage in this area in that they can organise cross-border apprenticeship programmes within the framework of a company.  We would like to develop the apprenticeship programmes of Erasmus+ in the future.  Thus far, we have run programmes with 600,000 apprentices, which is quite large number, but we are still in the initial phase of cross-border activities in apprenticeship programmes.  I agree that if we want to harness the potential of competitiveness of European economies we must put more emphasis on cross-border apprenticeship programmes because they equip people with not only relevant technical skills but language skills, which is important from the point of view of the Single Market.  <\/p><p>  On Brexit, there is a lot of uncertainty about the post-Brexit environment but as far as I know the education, research and innovation family in the United Kingdom is committed to retaining these programmes.  It depends on the official position of the UK delegation and the EU delegation in the negotiations.  I will do everything to protect the interests of young people with Irish passports or citizenship either side of the Border who wish to be participate in Erasmus+ programmes.  I cannot imagine any scenario which would exclude Irish citizens from Erasmus+ irrespective of where they live.  This programme is linked to citizenship, not location.  I would like to protect all the achievements of the Erasmus programmes but, again, this is dependent on the position taken by the delegations.  I agree that we must emphasis the social profile of education.  The dominant position is to look at education performance exclusively through data and statistics, including through the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, and the Education and Training Monitor.  We tried to soften the statistical side of measuring education and performance through the Education and Training Monitor and making accessibility a factor.  The accessibility of our education system cannot be expressed by figures alone.  However, there is another danger because statistical based data can indicate a very technocratic profile of education.  If one travels too far from the soft side, the result can be a subjective evaluation of the educational systems, which is very difficult even at European level because, while we are above national front-lines, we all have our national affiliations.  For example, I am Hungarian and I am more biased to central European countries.  I am more sensitive to their problems and Ireland would be more sensitive to the Irish problem, Brexit and so on.  We have to find a good compromise between these two points of the evaluation and we are working on that.   <\/p><p> Again, there is a strong correlation between the quality and level of education and the level of competitiveness of the future societies.  The higher the quality and level of education today the higher will be our level of competitiveness tomorrow.  There is general consensus among Education Ministers on the Education Council that education is the most important issue in the world.  It is good that we have that strong consensus and we are all friends but equally important is that we convince Finance Ministers and Prime Ministers that education is the most important issue.  This is the most important thing we can do today for tomorrow.  If we want to tackle future unemployment and the issues of future competitiveness, social cohesion, solidarity and so on we must invest more in education and strive to raise the level of tertiary education and early school-leaving.  We have to do our best to strengthen the social profile of the education institutions because that is the best way to tackle future challenges of these societies.  I believe Ireland is on the right path.  I accept that there are difficulties and problems but I know from my comprehensive knowledge of education policy in Europe that there is no member state without problems in education.  Education is probably the biggest issue in every EU member state but in the rankings of the education systems Ireland performs very well.  It is important to bear that in mind.  I appreciate Ireland's efforts and its results in this area.<\/p><p> On sport, we have to do more in the area of grassroots sports.  It is for this reason I opened the sports chapters of Erasmus+ exclusively to grassroots sports.  I believe grassroots sports has a social function.  It is not only about leisure time activities and wellbeing, it is about community, friendship and human relations.  I would like to support and fund grassroots sports activities further in the future because the health and the core of the wellbeing of contemporary societies are at local level.  If our local communities are powerful and strong, based on solidarity, we will have no problems at regional or national levels, or at European level.  I would like to increase funding to grassroots sports activities to help them in social inclusion and to help them build sport facilities and make them more accessible.  We can do more in rural development policy and regional development policy to help local communities to build their sports facilities to serve the interests of the local communities.  <\/p><p> On the European Year of Cultural Heritage, this is not a Brussels exercise.  We will hold few flagship events in Brussels but those events will serve local communities.<\/p><p> For instance, we are going to have a conference of the European capitals of culture and a workshop of the owners of the European heritage label.  The topic of those events will be the ways in which we can best serve the interests of local communities.  The only sustainable European scenario is a bottom-up European scenario.  There is no top-down scenario which will be successful.  European institutions simply cannot force their image or their plans on local communities.  Just the opposite; we must invent our Europe at local level.  We have to build up the European community from below.  We have to base our future European community on the diversity of the local communities, and the European Year of Culture and Heritage is just the first step in this journey and in this enterprise. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tibor Navracsics","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I should say by way of introduction, that as a member of the Seanad, I am not a member of any political party.  I was elected as an independent Senator on the issue of disability inclusion, and it is on that issue that I wish to focus.  We have a saying in Irish, and I am sure the Commissioner will tell me the equivalent saying in Hungarian; \"Tosach maith, leath na hoibre.\"  A good start is half the work.  Education is a cornerstone, and the Commissioner has recognised that in what he has said.<\/p> <p>  I apologise for not being here at the start of this meeting.  I was at a meeting of the Committee for Transport, Tourism and Sport which was looking at accessible transport for people with disabilities.  I met with the cabinet of the Commissioner for Transport last week, so there is a European angle to these issues as well.  Transport can facilitate participation in education, as well as in cultural activities, sport and other activities.<\/p> <p>  My apologies for not being here, but I have read the Commission's opening statement.  The committee will let me be tetchy or touchy by saying I do not see the word \"disability\" used once in it.  Mr. Navracsics spoke about disadvantaged students.  The witnesses might respond that the inclusion of people with disabilities is implied, that the EU has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which is certainly a very significant thing, and that there is a European Union disability strategy.  I would still make the point that mentioning people with disabilities is critical.  The President of the European Parliament, Mr. Antonio Tajani, along with the president of the European Disability Forum, Mr. Yannis Vardakastanis, opened a European Parliament of Persons with Disabilities in the European Parliament last Wednesday, as Mr. Navracsics will be aware.  Some 750 people with disabilities from right across the Union were present.  I was honoured to lead an Irish delegation of 11 people.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Navracsics' brief includes education and culture.  In a word, my big issue is changing culture.  One example is the tendency to presume that things are okay for disabled people, or, when a disability issue is raised, for people to say that they have never thought about it.  In this domain it is important to very specifically reference the 80 million Europeans with disabilities, a number which is heading towards 100 million.  They are not all in the first flush of life.  Within that group, a minority are children and young people going to school.  We want them to take part in Erasmus Plus.  We want them to be jetting around Europe, and, along with their able-bodied peers, to come home talking about the time they had and the possibilities before them. <\/p> <p>  Mr. Navracsics's statement says that he is pleased to announce that he will be hosting the first European Education Summit in Brussels.  I hope that that becomes an opportunity to underline this issue.  The statement talks about working towards a high-level political consensus on tackling inequality through education.  People with disabilities need access to education.  Everybody does, but it is life and death to them.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Navracsics has graciously said that Ireland has plenty of experience to share, and it is a fair point.  Over the past decade this country has undertaken unprecedented national efforts to modernise its education sector, despite the difficulties we have had.  We have done more than modernise it.  We actually did away with the notion that children with disabilities would be educated in separate special schools.  That is not just modernising, it is changing culture and changing thinking.  It is now accepted that all children will go to regular local schools with their brothers and sisters, and we will bring whatever supports are needed in around them.  Of course there are there issues with getting that right and moving it on, and we need to deal with those.  Ireland does have a story to tell about how it has made these changes.  The world has not collapsed in Ireland as a result.<\/p> <p>  We now come to a different challenge, one which needs to be thought about sooner rather than later.  Following education is the issue of employment.  That needs to be thought about when education is being changed.  The White Paper on the Future of Europe sets out five options.  In this country, several civil society organisations and a coalition including Social Justice Ireland would say that it needs a sixth one, a sustainable Europe for its citizens, in order to copper-fasten sustainability and social involvement.<\/p> <p>  I am looking for thoughtfulness and reassurances.  I suppose I am playing on the word \"culture\".  There is a cultural shift needed.  I routinely travel from east to west and from north to south and I see that there are many Europes in Europe.  I think the witnesses understand what I mean.  There are many challenges.  Ireland is not in the worst position by far.  However, as a disabled person, I do not have an Irish perspective as opposed to a Hungarian one or Romanian one.  I have a sense of the needs of all disabled people, and that is I suggest is important to bring into this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#N00200","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1513173600,"counter":728,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":729,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for his presence here this afternoon, and for outlining his vision of education from a European perspective.  I observed Mr. Navracsics's presence in the plenary session a short time ago, when he listened to some of the debate regarding the European Council meeting taking place tomorrow and on Friday.  I think he got a flavour of the Irish concerns around Brexit.  In a previous life I was Minister of State with responsibility for Lifelong Learning, Youth Work and School Transport at the then Department of Education and Science.  It was a very rewarding position.  I have attended meetings of the Council of Ministers, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, and so forth.  The reason the position was very rewarding is that I got to meet individuals who had prospered from participation in further education and training or lifelong learning.   I saw how the individual flourished, and how they then made a contribution to their family, their community, their society and indeed to the economy as a whole.<\/p> <p>  Senator Dolan mentioned the issue of disability.  I wish to mention the issue of adult literacy, bringing our discussion right back to basics.  I am of the view that many people are still excluded from fully participating in society because of inadequate literacy skills, including computer literacy.  These people are becoming more and more excluded from playing a full role in our society and participating in the digital economy.   I assume this is a priority for the European Commission, but I must ask Mr. Navracsics how are we doing across the EU with regard to adult literacy.  I believe many people are feeling more and more socially excluded because of their lack of basic skills.  Bringing our concern right back to basics, I would like to think that this has to be a priority as well.  I hope that the European Union is improving as a whole in that regard.<\/p><p>I thank Deputy Haughey.  Before I call on Commissioner Navracsics, I wish to thank Senator Leyden for his valuable help.

I took part in several workshops and conferences in the European Parliament talking about opportunities for people with disabilities in ERASMUS.  It is a difficult issue because they need something special and ERASMUS Plus is a big one-fit-for-all project.  However, we have almost 600 participants with special needs and disabilities from Ireland in ERASMUS.  It is not a big number but it is a good start.<\/p> <p>  We have to make the whole system more sensitive to individual needs.  One of the avenues of thinking about the future of ERASMUS is making it more sensitive in that direction by combining it with travel opportunities, creating more opportunities for accessibility and to open the traditional modes of mobility to people with disability.  However, that is in the future unfortunately.  The Irish cultural shift has been mentioned, but there are many member states where this shift has not been made.  In Hungary, there are serious government efforts to introduce integrated schools and make them universal.  However, the general pattern is still specialised schools in towns, smaller settlements and villages because of tradition and bad responses.  It is difficult to understand.  The Spanish model is one of the most successful, with really integrated schools.  I do not know the committee's opinion on that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tibor Navracsics"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":732,"content":"<p>I am more familiar with the very strong system in Portugal which has changed its laws and closed down specialised schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#O00300","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513173600,"counter":733,"content":"<p>I see, it must be similar to the Spanish model of integrated schools.

I usually raise it when we talk about digital skills, which is one of the eternal topics of discussion about future skills and opportunities.  However, while we emphasise the importance of digital skills, we must not forget traditional literacy skills.  One fifth of European citizens have serious problems with reading and one quarter with numeracy.  We are progressing very fast to the digital world, but we are neglecting the fundamentals of those contemporary skills.  What we can do is keep an eye on these traditional skills and raise these issues regularly because it is not only a problem of competitiveness but one of social inclusion.  We urge the member states to take care of those skills as well and not to neglect the traditional aspects of education.  <\/p> <p>  Lifelong learning can of course help in tackling these problems.  However, we have to reform the structures of our member states for lifelong learning as well.  It is too institutionally orientated and sometimes too rigid.
