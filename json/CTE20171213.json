It is already the responsibility of the Legislature to legislate and, therefore, it is not  necessary to replace the wording.  The Citizens' Assembly has recommended, that the replacement wording be that the Legislature would legislate and to put that into the Constitution.  I think that would be confusing, it is unnecessary and all of the legal advice has suggested the same.  Putting any other kind of wording back into the Constitution would simply brings us back to what I view as an inappropriate dealing with the issue by way of the Constitution.

Article 40.3.3&deg;, when passed in 1983, established Ireland as a beacon of human rights in this area.  It took decisions on this life and death issue away from the political and judicial elites and has led to a situation where Ireland consistently has the best medical practice.  Only today, we have news from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists which reminds us that Ireland is one of the safest places in the world in which to have a baby.  Our figures are even better than those for Britain.  We have seen how in country after country, when this issue was given over to politicians, there was a steady liberalisation of the law.  Therefore, we are not just talking about a limited abortion regime but about an increasingly liberal one.  In repealing the eighth amendment <i>simpliciter<\/i>the people would be invited to trust that politicians would not continually liberalise the abortion regime more and more until we had a law similar to that in Britain, where four times as many abortions take place per year, <i>per capita<\/i>, according to the figures available to us.

It is essential that we make the decision as clear cut as possible.  Many of the difficulties, as advised by the people from whom we heard, arose from the fact that this issue was dealt with in the Constitution in the first place.  We heard evidence from health professionals that the eighth amendment was an impediment in doing their job and offering a full range of health care services to women.  For that reason, while I am not sure if a seconder is required, we will certainly second the amendment in favour of repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>.  We had discussions about the numbers of Irish women who travelled to England and I came to the conclusion that it was not possible to determine the numbers and that neither was it possible, therefore, to determine the actual rate of abortion for this country.

Figures published by Maternal Death Enquiry Ireland show that maternal deaths in Ireland are extremely rare and that the rate is marginally ahead of rates in the United Kingdom.

Provision for gestational time limits for the termination of pregnancies be guided by the best available medical evidence and be provided for in legislation &ndash; any assessment in relation to the termination of pregnancy where the life or the health of the woman is at risk be made by no fewer than two specialist physicians.<\/blockquote> <p>I would like to explain the genesis of this motion.  As a committee, we were tasked with looking at the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  Some 72% of members of the assembly voted to recommend that &quot;a distinction should not be drawn between the physical and mental health of the woman&quot;.  That is why this motion mentions physical and mental health.  I understand that termination of pregnancy where the life of the woman is at risk was dealt with in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  This motion seeks to bring everything together.  I realise that members have concerns about health risks.  We heard extensively at this committee about individual cases in which the level of risk can be very low in the morning, but the woman's life can be in danger by the evening.  In order to deal with that, this motion provides that where the life or the health of the woman is at risk, this determination shall be made by no fewer than two specialist physicians.  The 2013 Act provides for a determination to be made by two or three physicians.  This committee has not heard of any case that has happened up to now in which a second or third physician has not been available to sign off on it.<\/p><p>I promise I will not go on all day.  It is important for members to understand what we mean by risk to the health of the woman.  Severe hypertension - blood pressure - can be difficult to control in the case of a pregnant woman.  It is often the case that when high blood pressure kicks in around the 20th or 22nd week, it gets to a point where the only way to rectify the problem is to deliver the child.  Severe hypertension, which is difficult to control, is often associated with kidney disease in the woman that is likely to deteriorate in pregnancy.  The outcome for the woman in such circumstances is often a stroke.<\/p><p>I would like members to think of a woman who has one, two or three children at home - I have three at home - and is going to have a fourth child, but who has hypertension at 23 weeks and faces the possibility of being rendered disabled and unable to communicate for the rest of her young life.  Often, diabetes can be more difficult to control during pregnancy.  There are also clotting disorders.  On its own, a clot in a leg is not a major problem, but if it becomes a pulmonary embolism, that is, a clot in the lung, it can pose a serious risk of stroke during the pregnancy if the pregnancy is not terminated.<\/p><p> Members may have concerns regarding gestational time limits.  The motion reads: \"Provision for gestational time limits for the termination of pregnancies be guided by the best available medical evidence and be provided for in legislation\".  I cannot understand how anyone could have any issue with that, given that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists comprises the experts in this field.<\/p><p> Generally, the issue of gestational age limits only applies to late diagnoses of foetal abnormality, for example, anencephaly, due to scanning being unavailable, which we have addressed in the ancillary recommendations.  If viability is reached, it is not regarded as an abortion, but a pre-term delivery.  Doctors always make every effort to save the baby's life.  Viability now sits at approximately 23 weeks.  Although survival rates are low at that gestational level and disability rates in survivors are high, we have maintained the lives of people born at 23 weeks.<\/p><p> I wish to reassure members that the health risk to the mother would be defined by two doctors and the gestational limits would be set by the doctors' governing or ethical bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#H03800","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I have a difficulty with how the motion is worded.  I have a formal proposal to make.  I do not agree that a single motion should deal with both life and health.  The committee has received evidence stating that simply being pregnant creates a risk to one's health, so it is important that we have the correct wording.  I would like to see the phrase \"substantial risk to health\" used.<\/p> <p>  My formal proposal is that motion 3 be subdivided into parts A and B, with part A reading: \"That the committee recommends that termination of pregnancy be lawful where the life of the mother is at risk.\"  It takes into account the existence of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 and that this issue is catered for.

From the evidence presented during the hearings and having regard to the rapidity with which a woman's health can deteriorate in a situation such as has been set out, what may well not be a serious risk at a particular time may be a progressive risk, with its progress rapid, so that by the time the risk is determined as being serious and action is taken - if it is presumed that the seriousness of the risk will determine at all times what happens - it may be too late to save either mother or baby.<\/p> <p>  We have had this debate and I respect the point made by my colleague, but it is important that we remember something.  If we recall the evidence that we heard, cases were referred to in which there was a rapid decline in the health of the mother.

This is despite the fact that the ground has shifted in this area.  When we heard evidence about mental health, we were reminded that there was no evidence associating abortion with improvements in mental health for women and that there was some evidence of a low to moderate increased risk to women's mental health in certain cases.  That has led to calls for a change to the approach in Britain, even among those who support abortion as a right generally, so as not to link abortion with mental health as a ground.  That was not challenged before this committee.<\/p><p>Linking mental health with physical health, in effect, seeks to bring in abortion on demand under the pretext of a therapeutic intervention.  <\/p><p> On the question of physical health, we have heard no evidence at this committee that the health of any woman was compromised by the requirements of the settled law of Ireland.  That is a fact.  We have heard no evidence that any doctor was ever pursued by the criminal law for having made an appropriate therapeutic intervention that resulted in the loss of the life of an unborn child.  The reason for that is as follows.  Under the settled law of Ireland the threat to a woman's life does not have to be imminent.  Several times Deputy Durkan has mentioned cases where people have died.  I would like to hear what he is talking about because the settled law of Ireland has not compromised anybody's life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#J01300","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I urge the Senator to direct all his comments through the Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#K00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I will make two final points about the two specialist physicians requirement.

That is a chilling reminder of how this law can easily be abused.<\/p> <p>  Second, references to best available medical evidence is a euphemism.  The people, who this committee considers vectors of the best available medical evidence, spoke in terms of requiring abortion on request.  In fact, their evidence always operated to reject distinctions between health grounds and a more general dealing with abortion on the grounds of a request.  In one particularly chilling case we heard doctors speak in a very blas&eacute; fashion about late term abortions and that we should not be distracted by late term abortions of children even for a trivial reason like a cleft palate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#K00300","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Please stick to the point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#K00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I urge the rejection of these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#K00500","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and call Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#K00600","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I reject the two statements about mental health being a ground for abortion on demand and that no woman's life has been at risk because of the current law.

Sometimes these matters only come to light after the 12-week period.  I hope the up to 12-week provision captures most of the women who might find themselves in this situation because of their socio-economic status.  However, it does not mean that their socio-economic status will not affect them in their 14th or 15th week of pregnancy.  They may find themselves on the street at any stage of their pregnancy.  Their parents may have put them out of the family home because of the pregnancy.  Perhaps the pregnant woman is unable to access supports or the father of her unborn child may have abandoned her.  Loads of socio-economic stuff can come up after the 12th week of pregnancy.  I hope that we could incorporate socio-economic under the health ground like other jurisdictions do.  A vote on Deputy O'Connell's motion will totally rule out our consideration of socio-economic as a health ground.  Can we address the matter?<\/p> <p>  I know that the socio-economic reason is recognised as a ground later on.  I feel people are a little fearful to name socio-economic as a ground.

There have been substantial and evidence-based claims that this is not an evidence-based ground for abortion.  Certainly, there was evidence from psychiatric experts before this committee which appears to distance the majority of the psychiatric medical profession from this whole business of providing for abortion on the grounds of a threat of suicide.<\/p> <p>  While I accept that the committee's apparent will to see abortion legalised as a matter of right on demand will make the issue moot anyway, I support Deputy Mattie McGrath's proposal that we reject this use of suicide as a ground.<\/p> <p>  I should note in passing as well that a small, but significant, number of children have died as a result of this invocation of a threat to life.

In relation to the GP-led service, I have no major difficulty with including a reference to a medical doctor but the reason the motion is drafted in this way is in recognition and acceptance of the fact that people are ordering medical abortion pills online.  As Deputy Kelleher stated, they are being delivered by An Post in this jurisdiction.  That is happening and the evidence we have is that this could pose a risk to the life or health of the woman who is taking it and who, because of the current legal status, may be afraid to seek help if it is needed.  By making it a GP-led service there will be medical oversight by qualified persons, which we are not.  I am not a qualified person so I am reluctant to stray too far into the medical aspects of the issue.  It is a matter for the Minister for Health to prepare legislation and for the consultants and doctors working in this area to deal with that in more detail.  The reason we use the phrase \"without restriction as to reason\" is that we have issues around rape and incest and other such complexities.  Perhaps it is possible to legislate but it would be extremely difficult.  I tend to think it is almost impossible to legislate based on the evidence that has been put before the committee.<\/p> <p>  The reason we say \"up to a limit of 12 weeks\" is based on the evidence that was given to the committee and I went on to the Women on Web website where it states that it is available up to 12 weeks.  I assume that what is on the website is put up there by the doctors running it.

I think it is a very sensitive issue and we need to be careful.  If we put a 12-week limit on a request for an abortion in the case of rape or incest we may well be excluding a whole cohort of women.  We are going through a period now where Women&rsquo;s Aid have 16 days of drawing our attention to the question of domestic violence and we are seeing programmes on the television in the home.  The Rape Crisis Centre gave a presentation recently in Dublin City Council.  There is a whole cohort of women who live in abusive relationships who are scared to come forward to look after their own health while they are caught in that abuse and while they are caught in that trap.  It may take more than 12 weeks for them to get out of that space.  It could be 16 weeks or 18 weeks.  If we limit access to 12 weeks then we are doing some of the most vulnerable, done down, badly treated women in society a huge disservice.  That includes women who are victims of incest who get pregnant as a result.  Again, we are looking at an extremely difficult situation to get out of both mentally, physically and financially and it may be that they are the ones who are in need of the late abortions more than anything else.  We are conflating two things about the use of the abortion pill up to 12 weeks and the very serious nature of rape and incest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#Q01600","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>We have already agreed that a provision for gestational time limits for termination of pregnancy would be guided by the best available medical evidence and provided for in legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#Q01700","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Yes, except we are dealing with the rape section now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#Q01800","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>We are voting on the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly also, so they are not mutually exclusive.

It is also important to address the fact that abortion pills are widely available and unregulated with no medical oversight.

I take the point that is being made.  The witnesses from Holland were quite useful in this regard.  In their jurisdiction, they have a 12-week limit but they drew attention, in particular, to the fact that those who tend to present later, where there has been rape or incest, for example, tend to be younger.  The delegates from Holland outlined how they dealt with a combination of factors, as in a rape accompanied by distress and mental health issues or, perhaps, a physical health issue where somebody very young is involved.  One can proceed by separating the two factors but I am concerned that we are trying to capture everything in one measure.

I do not believe I have ever done it.<\/p> <p>  To me, this is a very distressing proposal.  Motion 18 does not state \"in view of the difficulties with regulating the online purchase of abortion pills\".  The substance is \"because it is difficult to legislate for termination of pregnancy for reasons of rape or incest\".  I get why many good people are conflicted about those cases.  They are very heart-rending and difficult but there is something reminiscent of the judgment of Solomon about proposing that, since they are so complex to deal with, we should therefore propose that a much wider category of unborn children may be legally killed.  If one examines the law in Britain, one notes that the vast majority of Britain's staggering number of abortions per year, which is nearly 200,000, take place in the period up to 12 weeks, as I understand it.<\/p> <p>  At meetings of this committee, we never examined the size of an unborn child at 12 weeks, or just under.  As far as I know, we never looked at any images of an abortion.  I believe Deputy Mattie McGrath invited people to inform themselves at some level but the committee did not do so.  I do not even know whether the people proposing this could tell us or discuss in detail the size or developmental stage of the little creature whose legal right to exist is proposed to be dismissed here.  There is no difference between a surgical abortion and a medical abortion considering the impact on the unborn baby.  We have what I would regard as a really distressing proposal.  It is harder to imagine a better example of how politicians can lose sight of the humanity of unborn children through this whole process.  As I have said before, if one asks people the situations in which one can take away the right of unborn children, the answer seems to be, \"more and more, actually.\"<\/p> <p>  This is a very disturbing proposal.  It is for abortion on demand.  Having no restriction as to reason effectively means that if a person asks for an abortion, she gets it.  I am not clear from the wording whether it is intended that the general practitioner would prescribe the pills or whether they would have to be taken in a general practitioner's surgery but I do know there is no child under 12 weeks in the womb who would have the right to the protection of the law if the Irish people were to take this on board.  It is a staggering proposal and I urge people to reconsider it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#R01100","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":266,"content":"<p>We are in danger of straying and staying here until Christmas, the way we are going.  I have just a couple of points.  People are confused about why we are here.  We are not drafting legislation; we are issuing guidance to the Oireachtas to draft legislation.  The idea that some people raised, namely, that our vote on this would be misinterpreted as a statement that there should be terminations in cases of rape only up to 12 weeks, does not reflect what anybody is saying.  A way of dealing with this is to take the vote on the Citizens' Assembly recommendation first.  I would imagine that it will be carried on its own.  It does not imply a restriction regarding any limit in cases of rape.  We should then consider the motion on the period of 12 weeks without any restrictions as to reason.  For some, a termination will be because of rape.  For others, there will be other reasons.  So be it; that is the motion.  That will deal with the matter so we will not just be cutting off access to terminations in cases of rape at 12 weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#R01200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I have outlined our position and the rationale that underpins it but I want to be very clear that this will not hinder us from supporting the final report.

We are not drafting legislation here.  These are simply recommendations.  I take the point that the Citizens' Assembly recommendation deals with the matter.  However, I have been approached by parents who have asked me to try to get this through without gestational limits.  This is why the recommendation was put forward.  The idea is to show compassion to people who have been through the experience.  They want to know that the gestational limits will not apply to them.<\/p> <p>  Having listened to the evidence of all witnesses I believe those provisions that put the woman and family at the centre of a case of desperation or a crisis pregnancy are absolutely the way to go.  The choice that a person might make in such a circumstance will be difficult.  It would not be easy and it would not be done without consulting many medical experts.  I assume we all understand that in the context of the motion.<\/p> <p>  I wish we lived in a society that really cared for those who suffer disadvantage and disability and those who are most vulnerable, but we do not.  We have not even ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities yet.<\/p> <p>  Recently, we watched the terrible tragedy of carers and the situation that they are left in for years.  Often this abides for their entire lives.  They are neglected by the State and not given proper respite care.  There is extraordinary disadvantage for people in society.

He said people with disabilities are a category of people and that we are looking to introduce abortion because they are a category of people.  What he says is true: people with disabilities are a category of people.  They also want access to bodily autonomy.  People with disability need access.<\/p> <p>  We look at all the different situations.  We have heard so many times that there are as many situations as there are pregnancies that end up in a given situation.  Perhaps a woman is in a family where there are already children with disability.  Perhaps she has several children or none.  Perhaps she has no support or resources.  Bringing a child that has a severe anomaly into the world can bring a major pressure on the family and a person's health.  I believe that we need to remove the gestational limits in respect of severe or significant foetal abnormalities, as we have done with all the other health grounds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#U01400","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I have to go to help with a quorum.

I would like to think that my career demonstrates a consistent vision of seeking to protect human dignity and seeking a society that goes the extra mile in terms of dispersal of public funds and so on.  This means reaching out and supporting people with disability in particular.  If Deputy Smith's comments were in any way directed at me, I would like to show her my record sometime.<\/p> <p>  I wish to comment on the business of the recommendation on a child with a significant abnormality.  We spoke a good deal about children with Down's syndrome.  Of course, they are only one category of children with disability or abnormality, but they are children who are particularly well-known and loved in Ireland.  We did not hear evidence on it, but eventually we got evidence about how in Britain over 90% of children who are scanned and found to have Down's syndrome are aborted.  I believe the figure is the same in Netherlands.  The corresponding figure is up to 97% or 98% in Denmark, with only four children being born.  From my perspective, any child with a foetal abnormality deserves extra love, care and protection from society.  The test of a civilised society is how it treats its most vulnerable members.  It is a really tragic development if there is a whole category of human beings who, because they are more vulnerable than the rest of us, are singled out to ensure they have fewer rights at any stage of pregnancy.<\/p><p>That is the journey that has been taken in the western world.  We heard Dr. Thompson invite us to disregard the fact that in certain cases children with something as minor as a cleft palate might be aborted up to birth, which is the law in Britain.  It was chilling testimony.  However, it does not matter if it is severe or not so severe because what the child needs is protection and what the family needs is support.  I, therefore, oppose this sincerely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#U01700","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1513173600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the committee recommend that the termination of pregnancy should be lawful without gestational limits in cases of significant foetal abnormality.\"<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 5; N\u00edl, 15.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Question declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V00200","aye":["1259","1226","1297","1404","1367"],"nay":["1354","1391","1336","1322","1331","1389","1229","1347","1401","1315","1280","1302","1325","1394","1231"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1513173600,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Staon: Senator Catherine Noone.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>The next matter to be considered is whether the committee recommends that termination of pregnancy be lawful where the unborn child has a significant foetal abnormality that is not likely to result in death before or shortly after birth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V00500","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"vote","time":1513173600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the committee recommend that termination of pregnancy be lawful where the unborn child has a significant foetal abormality that is not likely to result in death before or shortly after birth.\"<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 5; N\u00edl, 15.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Question declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V00700","aye":["1259","1226","1297","1404","1367"],"nay":["1354","1391","1336","1322","1331","1389","1229","1347","1401","1315","1280","1302","1325","1394","1231"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1513173600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Staon: Senator Catherine Noone.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>We now move on to reason 12.

I struggle to understand how people can separate a woman's health from her socio-economic status or her living conditions, whether poverty, domestic violence, homelessness, prostitution or otherwise.  Her socio-economic circumstances are one of the main reasons a woman will seek to access abortion and 70% of the Citizens' Assembly voted in favour of allowing it.  If termination is not permitted on socio-economic grounds, this would highlight to me that access to abortion remains a class issue.  Although we will cater for many women up to 12 weeks, many women will not be able to access a doctor or perhaps not even know they are pregnant until that time has elapsed.  I worked with hundreds of people in addiction for years.  Some of the women did not have periods for years due to the damage to their body.  However, they became pregnant and nearly six months had elapsed before they realised it.  Given how a woman's social situation impacts on her health, this should be allowed as a ground to access abortion.  Women from more affluent areas who do not not meet the requirements or do not get to the doctor or find out that they are pregnant before the 12 weeks have elapsed will still be able to travel.  If we deny women the right to an abortion on socio-economic grounds, we are saying that we do not care about women who are in less favourable conditions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V01000","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V01100","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I have one more point.

It did not arise from the guidance of the chairperson, Ms Justice Laffoy.  It came from the body of the floor at the Citizens' Assembly where 72% were in favour of it.  This recognises and reiterates the consistent evidence we heard over the past three months from various witnesses, the latest being those from the Netherlands.  When I asked what weight they would give to what we call socio-economic grounds - I think they called them social reasons - they kind of looked at me as if I was nuts because, to them, of course it was a big reason.  It was obviously a clear reason to them.  I am not interpreting anything from their looks but the attitude was almost why would one not consider a person's social and economic background.  Senator Ruane touches on something really important here.  If we recognise that abortion is a reality for women already in Ireland, except we export it, we also have to recognise that so many more women did not have access to it because of their class situation.  This is a class issue.  Some 92% of terminations happen in the first 12 weeks.  The pill can deal with it, which is a great step forward.  In future laws, perhaps we can recognise it.  However, it would be great if the committee would take on board the evidence and the recommendation from the Citizens' Assembly and have that as a reason to be put to the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V01300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>What this issue has in common with the previous one about abortion for children with significant foetal abnormalities is that the committee will not recommend them here today.

In that sense, it is important to make that point.  However, I agree with the speakers putting forward the motion.

There is a difference between being prosecuted and being convicted.  There is a difference between being convicted and being punished.  I make all of those points because I do not know if Deputy Kelleher was referring to all in the room when he said we all know what we want.  I want to make it clear that I oppose this agenda to decriminalise abortion.  The reason I do so is not because I ever want to see any woman targeted by the law but because the law exists not just to punish its breaches.  It exists also to deter people from doing something that is harmful to themselves and others.  What people seem to be saying here is, in the context where the committee is proposing to look for abortion effectively on demand - I do not need to say effectively but abortion on demand up to 12 weeks - is that any doctor who does it outside of a licensed clinical setting would be prosecuted.  However, it seems to be the view that there would be no criminal sanction for any woman who would ever try at any stage of pregnancy, or no breach of the criminal law I should say.  Even in Britain, which effectively has abortion on demand and late-term abortion on demand, abortion remains a criminal offence.<\/p><p>It is not prosecuted where some of the A, B, C, D and E grounds are met.  This would be a charter for rogue doctors.  This turns a blind eye to the fact that those who procure abortions for themselves end the life of an innocent child and, in many cases, cause hurt or potential hurt to themselves.<\/p><p> People seem to think that this is the only way in which one can prevent women from being fearful about going for medical care - I have heard this view canvassed - if they have procured an abortion pill and taken it.  However, it is possible to have laws in this country which guarantee that a person who seeks medical assistance will not be criminalised by reason of any offence which the person discloses to have committed in the course of seeking that medical care and it would be bad public policy to decriminalise abortion.  What I am saying to some degree makes no sense in the context of a committee that wants abortion but I draw the committee's attention to the British situation where it remains a criminal offence.  If one wants to even maintain the fig leaf of a desire to keep abortions to as few as possible, one certainly does not start by decriminalising it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#Y05700","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I would be very much in favour of decriminalising abortion.

It is amazing that Senator Mullen's colleague, Deputy McGrath, is actually leaving here to go and talk about social media whereas in actual fact it is all to do with communications.  It was one of the main parts that was missing through all of the presentations here.  What has been put here is not underlying our cloaking an abortion regime.  It is actually trying to protect the future education of our children.  It is a protection for society going forward.  It is to enhance the mobility for parents, educators and the Department of Health is what we are looking for here.
