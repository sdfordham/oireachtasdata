It is already the responsibility of the Legislature to legislate and, therefore, it is not  necessary to replace the wording.  The Citizens' Assembly has recommended, that the replacement wording be that the Legislature would legislate and to put that into the Constitution.  I think that would be confusing, it is unnecessary and all of the legal advice has suggested the same.  Putting any other kind of wording back into the Constitution would simply brings us back to what I view as an inappropriate dealing with the issue by way of the Constitution.

Article 40.3.3&deg;, when passed in 1983, established Ireland as a beacon of human rights in this area.  It took decisions on this life and death issue away from the political and judicial elites and has led to a situation where Ireland consistently has the best medical practice.  Only today, we have news from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists which reminds us that Ireland is one of the safest places in the world in which to have a baby.  Our figures are even better than those for Britain.  We have seen how in country after country, when this issue was given over to politicians, there was a steady liberalisation of the law.  Therefore, we are not just talking about a limited abortion regime but about an increasingly liberal one.  In repealing the eighth amendment <i>simpliciter<\/i>the people would be invited to trust that politicians would not continually liberalise the abortion regime more and more until we had a law similar to that in Britain, where four times as many abortions take place per year, <i>per capita<\/i>, according to the figures available to us.

It is essential that we make the decision as clear cut as possible.  Many of the difficulties, as advised by the people from whom we heard, arose from the fact that this issue was dealt with in the Constitution in the first place.  We heard evidence from health professionals that the eighth amendment was an impediment in doing their job and offering a full range of health care services to women.  For that reason, while I am not sure if a seconder is required, we will certainly second the amendment in favour of repeal <i>simpliciter<\/i>.  We had discussions about the numbers of Irish women who travelled to England and I came to the conclusion that it was not possible to determine the numbers and that neither was it possible, therefore, to determine the actual rate of abortion for this country.

Figures published by Maternal Death Enquiry Ireland show that maternal deaths in Ireland are extremely rare and that the rate is marginally ahead of rates in the United Kingdom.

Provision for gestational time limits for the termination of pregnancies be guided by the best available medical evidence and be provided for in legislation &ndash; any assessment in relation to the termination of pregnancy where the life or the health of the woman is at risk be made by no fewer than two specialist physicians.<\/blockquote> <p>I would like to explain the genesis of this motion.  As a committee, we were tasked with looking at the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  Some 72% of members of the assembly voted to recommend that &quot;a distinction should not be drawn between the physical and mental health of the woman&quot;.  That is why this motion mentions physical and mental health.  I understand that termination of pregnancy where the life of the woman is at risk was dealt with in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  This motion seeks to bring everything together.  I realise that members have concerns about health risks.  We heard extensively at this committee about individual cases in which the level of risk can be very low in the morning, but the woman's life can be in danger by the evening.  In order to deal with that, this motion provides that where the life or the health of the woman is at risk, this determination shall be made by no fewer than two specialist physicians.  The 2013 Act provides for a determination to be made by two or three physicians.  This committee has not heard of any case that has happened up to now in which a second or third physician has not been available to sign off on it.<\/p><p>I promise I will not go on all day.  It is important for members to understand what we mean by risk to the health of the woman.  Severe hypertension - blood pressure - can be difficult to control in the case of a pregnant woman.  It is often the case that when high blood pressure kicks in around the 20th or 22nd week, it gets to a point where the only way to rectify the problem is to deliver the child.  Severe hypertension, which is difficult to control, is often associated with kidney disease in the woman that is likely to deteriorate in pregnancy.  The outcome for the woman in such circumstances is often a stroke.<\/p><p>I would like members to think of a woman who has one, two or three children at home - I have three at home - and is going to have a fourth child, but who has hypertension at 23 weeks and faces the possibility of being rendered disabled and unable to communicate for the rest of her young life.  Often, diabetes can be more difficult to control during pregnancy.  There are also clotting disorders.  On its own, a clot in a leg is not a major problem, but if it becomes a pulmonary embolism, that is, a clot in the lung, it can pose a serious risk of stroke during the pregnancy if the pregnancy is not terminated.<\/p><p> Members may have concerns regarding gestational time limits.  The motion reads: \"Provision for gestational time limits for the termination of pregnancies be guided by the best available medical evidence and be provided for in legislation\".  I cannot understand how anyone could have any issue with that, given that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists comprises the experts in this field.<\/p><p> Generally, the issue of gestational age limits only applies to late diagnoses of foetal abnormality, for example, anencephaly, due to scanning being unavailable, which we have addressed in the ancillary recommendations.  If viability is reached, it is not regarded as an abortion, but a pre-term delivery.  Doctors always make every effort to save the baby's life.  Viability now sits at approximately 23 weeks.  Although survival rates are low at that gestational level and disability rates in survivors are high, we have maintained the lives of people born at 23 weeks.<\/p><p> I wish to reassure members that the health risk to the mother would be defined by two doctors and the gestational limits would be set by the doctors' governing or ethical bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#H03800","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I have a difficulty with how the motion is worded.  I have a formal proposal to make.  I do not agree that a single motion should deal with both life and health.  The committee has received evidence stating that simply being pregnant creates a risk to one's health, so it is important that we have the correct wording.  I would like to see the phrase \"substantial risk to health\" used.<\/p> <p>  My formal proposal is that motion 3 be subdivided into parts A and B, with part A reading: \"That the committee recommends that termination of pregnancy be lawful where the life of the mother is at risk.\"  It takes into account the existence of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 and that this issue is catered for.

From the evidence presented during the hearings and having regard to the rapidity with which a woman's health can deteriorate in a situation such as has been set out, what may well not be a serious risk at a particular time may be a progressive risk, with its progress rapid, so that by the time the risk is determined as being serious and action is taken - if it is presumed that the seriousness of the risk will determine at all times what happens - it may be too late to save either mother or baby.<\/p> <p>  We have had this debate and I respect the point made by my colleague, but it is important that we remember something.  If we recall the evidence that we heard, cases were referred to in which there was a rapid decline in the health of the mother.

This is despite the fact that the ground has shifted in this area.  When we heard evidence about mental health, we were reminded that there was no evidence associating abortion with improvements in mental health for women and that there was some evidence of a low to moderate increased risk to women's mental health in certain cases.  That has led to calls for a change to the approach in Britain, even among those who support abortion as a right generally, so as not to link abortion with mental health as a ground.  That was not challenged before this committee.<\/p><p>Linking mental health with physical health, in effect, seeks to bring in abortion on demand under the pretext of a therapeutic intervention.  <\/p><p> On the question of physical health, we have heard no evidence at this committee that the health of any woman was compromised by the requirements of the settled law of Ireland.  That is a fact.  We have heard no evidence that any doctor was ever pursued by the criminal law for having made an appropriate therapeutic intervention that resulted in the loss of the life of an unborn child.  The reason for that is as follows.  Under the settled law of Ireland the threat to a woman's life does not have to be imminent.  Several times Deputy Durkan has mentioned cases where people have died.  I would like to hear what he is talking about because the settled law of Ireland has not compromised anybody's life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#J01300","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I urge the Senator to direct all his comments through the Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#K00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I will make two final points about the two specialist physicians requirement.

That is a chilling reminder of how this law can easily be abused.<\/p> <p>  Second, references to best available medical evidence is a euphemism.  The people, who this committee considers vectors of the best available medical evidence, spoke in terms of requiring abortion on request.  In fact, their evidence always operated to reject distinctions between health grounds and a more general dealing with abortion on the grounds of a request.  In one particularly chilling case we heard doctors speak in a very blas&eacute; fashion about late term abortions and that we should not be distracted by late term abortions of children even for a trivial reason like a cleft palate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#K00300","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Please stick to the point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#K00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I urge the rejection of these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#K00500","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and call Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#K00600","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I reject the two statements about mental health being a ground for abortion on demand and that no woman's life has been at risk because of the current law.

Sometimes these matters only come to light after the 12-week period.  I hope the up to 12-week provision captures most of the women who might find themselves in this situation because of their socio-economic status.  However, it does not mean that their socio-economic status will not affect them in their 14th or 15th week of pregnancy.  They may find themselves on the street at any stage of their pregnancy.  Their parents may have put them out of the family home because of the pregnancy.  Perhaps the pregnant woman is unable to access supports or the father of her unborn child may have abandoned her.  Loads of socio-economic stuff can come up after the 12th week of pregnancy.  I hope that we could incorporate socio-economic under the health ground like other jurisdictions do.  A vote on Deputy O'Connell's motion will totally rule out our consideration of socio-economic as a health ground.  Can we address the matter?<\/p> <p>  I know that the socio-economic reason is recognised as a ground later on.  I feel people are a little fearful to name socio-economic as a ground.

There have been substantial and evidence-based claims that this is not an evidence-based ground for abortion.  Certainly, there was evidence from psychiatric experts before this committee which appears to distance the majority of the psychiatric medical profession from this whole business of providing for abortion on the grounds of a threat of suicide.<\/p> <p>  While I accept that the committee's apparent will to see abortion legalised as a matter of right on demand will make the issue moot anyway, I support Deputy Mattie McGrath's proposal that we reject this use of suicide as a ground.<\/p> <p>  I should note in passing as well that a small, but significant, number of children have died as a result of this invocation of a threat to life.

In relation to the GP-led service, I have no major difficulty with including a reference to a medical doctor but the reason the motion is drafted in this way is in recognition and acceptance of the fact that people are ordering medical abortion pills online.  As Deputy Kelleher stated, they are being delivered by An Post in this jurisdiction.  That is happening and the evidence we have is that this could pose a risk to the life or health of the woman who is taking it and who, because of the current legal status, may be afraid to seek help if it is needed.  By making it a GP-led service there will be medical oversight by qualified persons, which we are not.  I am not a qualified person so I am reluctant to stray too far into the medical aspects of the issue.  It is a matter for the Minister for Health to prepare legislation and for the consultants and doctors working in this area to deal with that in more detail.  The reason we use the phrase \"without restriction as to reason\" is that we have issues around rape and incest and other such complexities.  Perhaps it is possible to legislate but it would be extremely difficult.  I tend to think it is almost impossible to legislate based on the evidence that has been put before the committee.<\/p> <p>  The reason we say \"up to a limit of 12 weeks\" is based on the evidence that was given to the committee and I went on to the Women on Web website where it states that it is available up to 12 weeks.  I assume that what is on the website is put up there by the doctors running it.

I think it is a very sensitive issue and we need to be careful.  If we put a 12-week limit on a request for an abortion in the case of rape or incest we may well be excluding a whole cohort of women.  We are going through a period now where Women&rsquo;s Aid have 16 days of drawing our attention to the question of domestic violence and we are seeing programmes on the television in the home.  The Rape Crisis Centre gave a presentation recently in Dublin City Council.  There is a whole cohort of women who live in abusive relationships who are scared to come forward to look after their own health while they are caught in that abuse and while they are caught in that trap.  It may take more than 12 weeks for them to get out of that space.  It could be 16 weeks or 18 weeks.  If we limit access to 12 weeks then we are doing some of the most vulnerable, done down, badly treated women in society a huge disservice.  That includes women who are victims of incest who get pregnant as a result.  Again, we are looking at an extremely difficult situation to get out of both mentally, physically and financially and it may be that they are the ones who are in need of the late abortions more than anything else.

The incorporation of the line suggested by Deputy O'Connell into the motion, to the effect that it would be done in a clinical context determined by law and licensing practices, could perhaps cover the medical abortion pill.  I think that would cover it all.  My understanding is that it is safe to take the abortion pill up to ten or 12 weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#Q02000","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#Q02100","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I will read the question when the remaining members have spoken, namely, Deputies Louise O'Reilly and Catherine Murphy and Senator Mullen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#Q02200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in we will not be voting against the motion but neither are we in a position to support it.

I take the point that is being made.  The witnesses from Holland were quite useful in this regard.  In their jurisdiction, they have a 12-week limit but they drew attention, in particular, to the fact that those who tend to present later, where there has been rape or incest, for example, tend to be younger.  The delegates from Holland outlined how they dealt with a combination of factors, as in a rape accompanied by distress and mental health issues or, perhaps, a physical health issue where somebody very young is involved.  One can proceed by separating the two factors but I am concerned that we are trying to capture everything in one measure.  I am not opposed to it but I would rather see us dealing with each separately.

I do not believe I have ever done it.<\/p> <p>  To me, this is a very distressing proposal.  Motion 18 does not state \"in view of the difficulties with regulating the online purchase of abortion pills\".  The substance is \"because it is difficult to legislate for termination of pregnancy for reasons of rape or incest\".  I get why many good people are conflicted about those cases.  They are very heart-rending and difficult but there is something reminiscent of the judgment of Solomon about proposing that, since they are so complex to deal with, we should therefore propose that a much wider category of unborn children may be legally killed.  If one examines the law in Britain, one notes that the vast majority of Britain's staggering number of abortions per year, which is nearly 200,000, take place in the period up to 12 weeks, as I understand it.<\/p> <p>  At meetings of this committee, we never examined the size of an unborn child at 12 weeks, or just under.  As far as I know, we never looked at any images of an abortion.  I believe Deputy Mattie McGrath invited people to inform themselves at some level but the committee did not do so.  I do not even know whether the people proposing this could tell us or discuss in detail the size or developmental stage of the little creature whose legal right to exist is proposed to be dismissed here.  There is no difference between a surgical abortion and a medical abortion considering the impact on the unborn baby.  We have what I would regard as a really distressing proposal.  It is harder to imagine a better example of how politicians can lose sight of the humanity of unborn children through this whole process.  As I have said before, if one asks people the situations in which one can take away the right of unborn children, the answer seems to be, \"more and more, actually.\"<\/p> <p>  This is a very disturbing proposal.  It is for abortion on demand.  Having no restriction as to reason effectively means that if a person asks for an abortion, she gets it.  I am not clear from the wording whether it is intended that the general practitioner would prescribe the pills or whether they would have to be taken in a general practitioner's surgery but I do know there is no child under 12 weeks in the womb who would have the right to the protection of the law if the Irish people were to take this on board.  It is a staggering proposal and I urge people to reconsider it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#R01100","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>We are in danger of straying and staying here until Christmas, the way we are going.  I have just a couple of points.  People are confused about why we are here.  We are not drafting legislation; we are issuing guidance to the Oireachtas to draft legislation.  The idea that some people raised, namely, that our vote on this would be misinterpreted as a statement that there should be terminations in cases of rape only up to 12 weeks, does not reflect what anybody is saying.  A way of dealing with this is to take the vote on the Citizens' Assembly recommendation first.  I would imagine that it will be carried on its own.  It does not imply a restriction regarding any limit in cases of rape.  We should then consider the motion on the period of 12 weeks without any restrictions as to reason.  For some, a termination will be because of rape.  For others, there will be other reasons.  So be it; that is the motion.  That will deal with the matter so we will not just be cutting off access to terminations in cases of rape at 12 weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#R01200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I have outlined our position and the rationale that underpins it but I want to be very clear that this will not hinder us from supporting the final report.

We are not drafting legislation here.  These are simply recommendations.  I take the point that the Citizens' Assembly recommendation deals with the matter.  However, I have been approached by parents who have asked me to try to get this through without gestational limits.  This is why the recommendation was put forward.  The idea is to show compassion to people who have been through the experience.  They want to know that the gestational limits will not apply to them.<\/p> <p>  Having listened to the evidence of all witnesses I believe those provisions that put the woman and family at the centre of a case of desperation or a crisis pregnancy are absolutely the way to go.  The choice that a person might make in such a circumstance will be difficult.  It would not be easy and it would not be done without consulting many medical experts.  I assume we all understand that in the context of the motion.<\/p> <p>  I wish we lived in a society that really cared for those who suffer disadvantage and disability and those who are most vulnerable, but we do not.  We have not even ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities yet.<\/p> <p>  Recently, we watched the terrible tragedy of carers and the situation that they are left in for years.  Often this abides for their entire lives.  They are neglected by the State and not given proper respite care.  There is extraordinary disadvantage for people in society.

He said people with disabilities are a category of people and that we are looking to introduce abortion because they are a category of people.  What he says is true: people with disabilities are a category of people.  They also want access to bodily autonomy.  People with disability need access.<\/p> <p>  We look at all the different situations.  We have heard so many times that there are as many situations as there are pregnancies that end up in a given situation.  Perhaps a woman is in a family where there are already children with disability.  Perhaps she has several children or none.  Perhaps she has no support or resources.  Bringing a child that has a severe anomaly into the world can bring a major pressure on the family and a person's health.  I believe that we need to remove the gestational limits in respect of severe or significant foetal abnormalities, as we have done with all the other health grounds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#U01400","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I have to go to help with a quorum.

I would like to think that my career demonstrates a consistent vision of seeking to protect human dignity and seeking a society that goes the extra mile in terms of dispersal of public funds and so on.  This means reaching out and supporting people with disability in particular.  If Deputy Smith's comments were in any way directed at me, I would like to show her my record sometime.<\/p> <p>  I wish to comment on the business of the recommendation on a child with a significant abnormality.  We spoke a good deal about children with Down's syndrome.  Of course, they are only one category of children with disability or abnormality, but they are children who are particularly well-known and loved in Ireland.  We did not hear evidence on it, but eventually we got evidence about how in Britain over 90% of children who are scanned and found to have Down's syndrome are aborted.  I believe the figure is the same in Netherlands.  The corresponding figure is up to 97% or 98% in Denmark, with only four children being born.  From my perspective, any child with a foetal abnormality deserves extra love, care and protection from society.  The test of a civilised society is how it treats its most vulnerable members.  It is a really tragic development if there is a whole category of human beings who, because they are more vulnerable than the rest of us, are singled out to ensure they have fewer rights at any stage of pregnancy.<\/p><p>That is the journey that has been taken in the western world.  We heard Dr. Thompson invite us to disregard the fact that in certain cases children with something as minor as a cleft palate might be aborted up to birth, which is the law in Britain.  It was chilling testimony.  However, it does not matter if it is severe or not so severe because what the child needs is protection and what the family needs is support.  I, therefore, oppose this sincerely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#U01700","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1513173600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the committee recommend that the termination of pregnancy should be lawful without gestational limits in cases of significant foetal abnormality.\"<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 5; N\u00edl, 15.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Question declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V00200","aye":["1259","1226","1297","1404","1367"],"nay":["1354","1391","1336","1322","1331","1389","1229","1347","1401","1315","1280","1302","1325","1394","1231"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1513173600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Staon: Senator Catherine Noone.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>The next matter to be considered is whether the committee recommends that termination of pregnancy be lawful where the unborn child has a significant foetal abnormality that is not likely to result in death before or shortly after birth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V00500","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"vote","time":1513173600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the committee recommend that termination of pregnancy be lawful where the unborn child has a significant foetal abormality that is not likely to result in death before or shortly after birth.\"<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 5; N\u00edl, 15.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Question declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V00700","aye":["1259","1226","1297","1404","1367"],"nay":["1354","1391","1336","1322","1331","1389","1229","1347","1401","1315","1280","1302","1325","1394","1231"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1513173600,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Staon: Senator Catherine Noone.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":377,"content":"<p>We now move on to reason 12.

I struggle to understand how people can separate a woman's health from her socio-economic status or her living conditions, whether poverty, domestic violence, homelessness, prostitution or otherwise.  Her socio-economic circumstances are one of the main reasons a woman will seek to access abortion and 70% of the Citizens' Assembly voted in favour of allowing it.  If termination is not permitted on socio-economic grounds, this would highlight to me that access to abortion remains a class issue.  Although we will cater for many women up to 12 weeks, many women will not be able to access a doctor or perhaps not even know they are pregnant until that time has elapsed.  I worked with hundreds of people in addiction for years.  Some of the women did not have periods for years due to the damage to their body.  However, they became pregnant and nearly six months had elapsed before they realised it.  Given how a woman's social situation impacts on her health, this should be allowed as a ground to access abortion.  Women from more affluent areas who do not not meet the requirements or do not get to the doctor or find out that they are pregnant before the 12 weeks have elapsed will still be able to travel.  If we deny women the right to an abortion on socio-economic grounds, we are saying that we do not care about women who are in less favourable conditions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V01000","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":379,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V01100","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I have one more point.

It did not arise from the guidance of the chairperson, Ms Justice Laffoy.  It came from the body of the floor at the Citizens' Assembly where 72% were in favour of it.  This recognises and reiterates the consistent evidence we heard over the past three months from various witnesses, the latest being those from the Netherlands.  When I asked what weight they would give to what we call socio-economic grounds - I think they called them social reasons - they kind of looked at me as if I was nuts because, to them, of course it was a big reason.  It was obviously a clear reason to them.  I am not interpreting anything from their looks but the attitude was almost why would one not consider a person's social and economic background.  Senator Ruane touches on something really important here.  If we recognise that abortion is a reality for women already in Ireland, except we export it, we also have to recognise that so many more women did not have access to it because of their class situation.  This is a class issue.  Some 92% of terminations happen in the first 12 weeks.  The pill can deal with it, which is a great step forward.  In future laws, perhaps we can recognise it.  However, it would be great if the committee would take on board the evidence and the recommendation from the Citizens' Assembly and have that as a reason to be put to the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#V01300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>What this issue has in common with the previous one about abortion for children with significant foetal abnormalities is that the committee will not recommend them here today.

There is a difference between being prosecuted and being convicted.  There is a difference between being convicted and being punished.  I make all of those points because I do not know if Deputy Kelleher was referring to all in the room when he said we all know what we want.  I want to make it clear that I oppose this agenda to decriminalise abortion.  The reason I do so is not because I ever want to see any woman targeted by the law but because the law exists not just to punish its breaches.  It exists also to deter people from doing something that is harmful to themselves and others.  What people seem to be saying here is, in the context where the committee is proposing to look for abortion effectively on demand - I do not need to say effectively but abortion on demand up to 12 weeks - is that any doctor who does it outside of a licensed clinical setting would be prosecuted.  However, it seems to be the view that there would be no criminal sanction for any woman who would ever try at any stage of pregnancy, or no breach of the criminal law I should say.  Even in Britain, which effectively has abortion on demand and late-term abortion on demand, abortion remains a criminal offence.<\/p><p>It is not prosecuted where some of the A, B, C, D and E grounds are met.  This would be a charter for rogue doctors.  This turns a blind eye to the fact that those who procure abortions for themselves end the life of an innocent child and, in many cases, cause hurt or potential hurt to themselves.<\/p><p> People seem to think that this is the only way in which one can prevent women from being fearful about going for medical care - I have heard this view canvassed - if they have procured an abortion pill and taken it.  However, it is possible to have laws in this country which guarantee that a person who seeks medical assistance will not be criminalised by reason of any offence which the person discloses to have committed in the course of seeking that medical care and it would be bad public policy to decriminalise abortion.  What I am saying to some degree makes no sense in the context of a committee that wants abortion but I draw the committee's attention to the British situation where it remains a criminal offence.  If one wants to even maintain the fig leaf of a desire to keep abortions to as few as possible, one certainly does not start by decriminalising it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017121300002#Y05700","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I would be very much in favour of decriminalising abortion.

It is very much appreciated.  We are very active at EU level and it is great to be able to bring disability issues to the fore, even if it has meant braving the cold to come here.  It has been freezing cold for the past week or so.  I am sure I am not the only one who has daydreamed in the past few weeks about jetting off to the warmer climate of one of the other EU member states.  If I wanted to, when I leave here and head into another cold and chilly wind, I could turn on my phone and book a flight.  I could book a house in another country such as Cyprus where I hear the temperature is about 20 degrees Celsius, which would be lovely.  I would able to daydream to my heart's content and it would not really matter if it was a dive, as it would still be sunny.  I would be able to apply for a job and even do interviews.  I could have a whole other life in an EU member state at the drop of a hat if I was to jump on a plane tomorrow.  I could pack up my life and go.<\/p><p>I could apply for a job, do interviews and set up a whole different life in an EU member state at the drop of a hat and jump on a plane tomorrow.  I could pack up my life and go.  I am sure I am not the only person who has thought of that in the last few weeks, especially when there were threats of having to hit the doorsteps again, who was dreaming of warmer climates.  Then the question arises about what happens if a person goes out and is caught up on his or her phone, does not realise there is a patch of ice, slips, falls and is injured.  If that person then has a disability, having perhaps injured his or her spine, lost vision, or has any range of disabilities, then what happens?  That person then falls within the 80 million people with disabilities across Europe who face systematic barriers and blockages to the enjoyment of their rights, entitlements and the fundamental freedoms that every EU citizen is entitled to but they are blocked from enjoying.  How does a person then go on a website to book flights that are not accessible?  What happens if transport is not accessible when that person arrives or is maybe only accessible at one or two stops?  What if those stops do not align with the housing that that person can live in?  What if the housing is not accessible or there are no accessible jobs?  This is about removing the barriers for people with disabilities to be able to enjoy the rights and entitlements that they are already entitled to by virtue of being EU citizens.  That is what I am here today to speak about.<\/p><p> I know the committee has my written submission.  I will speak to the content of that.  I will not be departing from it but I will be shifting it around a little because I am conscious it was written for reading and not to be spoken.  If anyone wants me to explain anything, by all means, do not hesitate to ask.  I will focus on some of the key elements.  I will look at the aims and values that underline the EU.  Linked to that, I will speak about the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Then I will explain that that is now part of the legal framework of the EU since the EU ratified it.  I will then speak about what is required to implement that and some of the key measures, instruments and initiatives to implement the UNCRPD, as it is often referred to.  Finally, I will address Brexit because it is obviously a huge topic for the EU and for Ireland.<\/p><p> I will start with the aims and values of the EU.  As I set out in the submission, this is to build on the submission of the European Anti-Poverty Network which was submitted to this committee too and to supplement that with disability-specific material.  The founding aims in the treaties of the EU are to further peace and the well-being of all persons across the EU and to deliver on the values that the EU holds dear.  Those values, which are set out in the treaties, are things like human dignity, equality, human rights and non-discrimination.  The question is then how we deliver on all of those.  As I set out, we unfortunately see that there has been a growth in poverty, social exclusion and inequality across the EU.  There is a disconnect between the values and aims and what is actually being delivered.  That leads me then to the United Nations convention.  It is international law which the EU, as a legal entity, has ratified, so it has committed to meeting those legal obligations.  What are the obligations?  It is a roadmap and direction on how to meet and respect the rights of persons with disabilities.  In doing so, one will be meeting the fundamental aims of human rights and respect and dignity of the EU.  It is all interlinked.<\/p><p> I will address some of the key ways of going about actually implementing that.  I could be here for a week if I were to set out all the different policies, strategies and legislation so I will just flag one or two.  The main one is the European disability strategy.  This is currently running from 2010 to 2020 and discussions have already started about what the next strategy is going to be for 2020 onwards.  That is really key to today's discussion on the future of Europe.  It is the strategy for how the EU will go about implementing the UNCRPD.  It is that simple.  The DFI led a delegation just last week over to a very special event which took place in the European Parliament.  It was called the European Parliament of Persons with Disabilities.  We led a delegation of 11 people to participate in that and it was focused on the disability strategy and the importance of delivering on people's rights and entitlements.  The key message from that was that one had to make sure to strive to implement the UNCRPD.  It is a legal obligation that we have now committed to.  The message was also that one had to make sure that there were resources and funding to facilitate implementation.  Crucially, it has to be monitored.  This relates to an approach to how we do things in public service.  I refer the committee to the submission where I said that the implementation has to be systemic, comprehensive and look at what the causes of issues are, what the blockages are, how we grab it by the root, sort it, deal with it and tackle the issues facing people with disabilities.<\/p><p> Another key instrument that I am sure the committee is familiar with is the European Pillar of Social Rights.  This was proclaimed by the institutions in November.  I will not dwell on it except to say that it has been proclaimed and it explicitly mentions the inclusion of people with disabilities, which is very much welcome.  Even where it is not explicitly mentioned, the language and terminology would be incorporated throughout.  That was referred to when it was proclaimed by the institutions as really being at the core of the values of the EU, of seeking inclusivity and improving the living conditions of persons across the EU.<\/p><p> With regard to implementation, I would also highlight funding which is the big, bad, evil thing that can send people scared and running.  Where does one get the finances from?  This is a very broad-reaching topic.  We know that the EU already has a whole array of funding mechanisms and that it already gives funding out.  That could be for infrastructure, transport, but I will not go into it since there is a whole array that the EU funds and supports.  One of the biggest things, for example, would be the European structural and investment funds.  Unfortunately, we have seen that, throughout the recession and the economic crisis, austerity has been implemented across Europe.  It has hit all people across Europe but people with disabilities have felt it particularly acutely.  There have been cuts to social and health services and community-based services right across the board.  This is really about the funding mechanisms that already exist.  To be compliant with the commitments that the EU has made to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we need to incorporate the inclusion and accessibility for persons with disabilities into the existing mechanisms.  An example of this is the European structural and investment funds.  A number of years ago - the year evades me - the funds were used to support, construct and maintain big institutional settings for persons with disabilities.<\/p><p>The European Union took action by inserting a requirement that the funds be used to support people to live in the community, in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Difficulties, UNCRPD.  However, it was, unfortunately, found by the UN committee which monitors how the European Union complies with the convention that some of the funds were nevertheless being used in ways that were not necessarily in line with it.  The committee has advised that in the future the European Union must ensure it monitors how the funds are being used and make their usage reliant on compliance with the UNCRPD and, if necessary, withdraw or recall funds or put an end to funding if they are not being expended in a compliant manner.  That could have a huge tangible effect on the lives of persons with disabilities.<\/p><p> The European semester process, on which I will not go into too much detail, involves a set structure whereby the European Union monitors how economic policies are implemented across member states and seeks to co-ordinate them.  In particular, it resulted from the economic downturn and seeks to ensure more stable and sustainable organisation and economic policies.  It also has effects in terms of social and environmental factors.  It is a key mechanism which can be used to incentivise and guide member states on how they can reach obligations linked with the EU legal framework.  For example, country-specific recommendations may be issued on how a particular country is incorporating accessibility and inclusion in that regard.  Bigger steps are also needed, but these are things that can be tagged on and included in the existing mechanisms and which could make a huge difference to the way member states think about providing for people with disabilities and have a knock-on effect on people's lives.<\/p><p> I highlight the matter of Brexit.  It is a huge issue for Ireland, but I wish to flag some key aspects that are particularly relevant for people with disabilities.  The United Kingdom is a huge source of funding for the European Union and its contribution will be lost when it leaves the Union.  What will happen thereafter?  We cannot allow the level of funding for disability and social inclusion initiatives to drop.  It was reiterated in the European Parliament last week that it was a key matter and that funding levels could not drop when the funding arrangements changed.  Planning to counteract the lack of funding must be carried out now.<\/p><p> There are other more specific and tangible ways Brexit could impact on people with disabilities.  A lot of work has been done on this issue by other Oireachtas committees such as the Joint Committee on Health and the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, but I wish to flag items such as the cross-border health care directive.  People in the European Union have a right to avail of health care services in other EU countries.  How will Brexit affect those living in Ireland and the United Kingdom who have disabilities, in particular in the Border region between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland?  The position of social and health care workers who live on one side of the Border and who cross it on a daily basis for work has been well documented, but if these workers are supporting people with disabilities or working in the sector, it could have a huge impact on the supports available to people with disabilities.  What will the impact be for a person with a disability arising from very mundane daily things such as having to travel an extra distance to the closest shop or post office?  Will there be accessible transport to the nearest hub, town or city?  What impact will it have on their income and capacity to participate in the community?  These are the key issues<\/p><p> The announcement on Ireland's role in the Brexit negotiations was very welcome and significant because how Ireland and people with disabilities here will be affected will set a precedent across the European Union for how smaller member states and their citizens will be treated in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona O'Donovan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Donovan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#C00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":698,"content":"<p>It is ironic that representatives of many Irish disability rights organisations are giving evidence to the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Trade which is meeting in the committee room next door.

We have signed it, but we have not ratified it.  All the other EU member states have signed and ratified it.  It is a bit of a misnomer, but it means that they have undertaken the obligations.  How it is actually happening in other countries is a very good question, if I may say so.  The honest answer, from our experience at EU level, is that it varies.  There is a process to implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  Realistically, certain countries are prioritising certain aspects, rather than saying that they are going to solve every problem today and then nothing will have to be done.  That is not how it works.  We cannot set a timeframe with the UNCRPD, meet that timeframe in two years and be done with it.  It is an ongoing process.  Yes, the other EU member states are certainly working towards it, but equally there will be different stages of compliance.  There may be areas where member states will be particularly advanced, while in other areas they are working on catching up.  That is in keeping with the UNCRPD being an ongoing process.  Things will change, new laws will come in, and everything must then be found to be compliant.  It does not have such a definitive deadline for implementation.  There will have to be an ongoing implementation, an ongoing incorporation of people with disabilities into policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona O'Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":703,"content":"<p>I call Senator John Dolan.

Some of these issues have effects from Dingle to Brussels.  Perhaps it will be possible to come back to this issue in the new year.<\/p> <p>  I should say at the outset that I was in a position last week, as chief executive of the Disability Federation of Ireland, to lead a delegation of 11 Irish parliamentarians to the European Parliament for the European Day of Persons with Disabilities.  Some 750 people with disabilities came from across Europe , and we had a very strong delegation.  I am delighted to say that Mr. Gary Carney, who is in the Gallery today, was one of the members of that delegation.<\/p> <p>  We discussed Europe and the world.  That issue has been taken up already by Deputy O'Keeffe.  We discussed the European Parliament elections in 2019, and the participation of people with disabilities in the election process, which is an issue right here in Ireland that we hope to address.  We also discussed the next European Union disability strategy which will follow the current one.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, I would like to thank Ms Fiona O'Donovan for her presentation.  On the third page of her opening statement, she quotes Article 3 of the Treaty of the European Union: \"The Union's aim is to promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples.\"  She notes that Article 2 sets out a number of values, including respect, human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, etc.<\/p> <p>  Think of how hard it was to arrive at a European Union.  It took two horrendous wars.  Countless thousands and millions of people were slaughtered.  Others became refugees or were made homeless.  A little more than ten years after that war, the European Union came together.  We have the values and the statements.  We have the history of what it took to pull Europe together.  We have the European Union, which is, as Ms O'Donovan has mentioned, a very novel and precious entity in the world.  There is no other part of the world that has a regional entity like the EU.  We can complain about the EU, but there is nothing else comparable anywhere.  We may think about disabled people in Africa and other places.  Over the past ten years, the EU and its agencies took a particular approach to the economic crisis, which was one word starting with the letter A: austerity.  Given that background, does Ms O'Donovan think that the EU is in a good place at this point or does it need to shift its mindset to be a Union for all its people?  She mentioned 80 million with disabilities in the EU, with that number set to increase to 100 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#D00400","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I thank Ms O'Donovan very much for coming in here today.  I would like to raise one very important issue which she spoke about.  A man whom I have great respect for in his ministerial role is the Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection, Deputy Finian McGrath.  One thing I like about politics is that there can be a strong difference of opinion.  I respect the Minister of State's view on this issue, but I do not agree with it.  Those present might even have a difference of opinion on this issue, namely, congregated settings.  One size does not fit all.  For example, in County Kerry we have what I would call a centre of excellence, St. Mary of the Angels in Beaufort.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the background.  For many years a very nice farmer and his wife owned a beautiful farm.  They had a daughter who became a nun.  They wanted to do something special with their farm, so they gave it up on the condition that whatever was built there would be for the betterment of people with physical or intellectual disabilities.  For many years, it was run as an excellent facility that grew with the demand in County Kerry.  A school was built there.  It is now on a slippery slope.  The facility is not accepting any more residents, because since June 2011 there has been a policy, over which I would draw a big question mark, against congregated settings.<\/p> <p>  I fully agree with the Minister of State when he says that he does not want people to be in a facility if it does not allow them to get the most out of their potential.  If I had a family member with an intellectual or a physical disability, I would not want him or her put away somewhere, as it might be called, if I thought that by living in the community, he or she would have a better way of life and better outcomes, or that he or she could develop personally.<\/p> <p>  I know many people with different types of disabilities.  I always say that it seems to be the case that a person with a disability has a fierce and great ability in some other way.  It could be some other physical attribute such as sport, or they could be very intellectually smart.  I took an ambassador from here down to Kerry to visit a school, and he asked a number of questions.  The person who answered the most difficult questions in the classroom that day was a student who happened to have a special needs assistant sitting alongside him.  I met that young person and discussed our visit with him.  That young person could blind anybody else when it came to ability.  At the same time, he had other needs that we will call, with a question mark, a disability.<\/p> <p>  I will return to St. Mary of the Angels and the reasons I am against the policy of depopulating congregated settings.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, there is a category of person who, because of the severity of their intellectual or physical disability, will need to be in what I would call a centre of excellence.  I would call St. Mary of the Angels a centre of excellence because it has a lifetime of experience of dealing with people with special needs.  Thankfully, over the years people have engaged in massive voluntary fundraising for the service.  Those were people who supported the work being done there, the Beaufort community down into the Black Valley, all of mid-Kerry, and the parents and relatives of family and friends who benefited from the service, from staying there and from going to school there. They supported it financially and organised fundraising events.  Every week there would have been a fundraising event for St. Mary of the Angels, which is now under St. John of God Order, and all the time it has provided a great service.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, with natural progression, we will all die.  As residents in St. Mary of the Angels have died, their spaces have not been replaced.  I appreciate the efforts being made and the policy of buying properties in the community and placing people in those, but that is not always the best place for every category of person.  There are people who benefit from that and from being part of the community in a limited or in as full a way as they can to gain the most out of it for themselves.  However, there are would-be parents of the future who, unfortunately and sadly, may have children with profound disabilities who would benefit from having a centre of excellence in their locality.  I am concerned that St. Mary of the Angels, as we know it today, will shut down over a period of time because, effectively, it is not taking in people.  I believe that policy is wrong.  I am not saying it is wrong to bring other people back out of settings to live in the community.  Of course, that is right and it is a great policy, but it is not one that benefits every person with a disability.<\/p><p> I have debated this issue with the Minister of State.  I was grateful that when I asked him to come to Kerry and visit places such as St. Mary of the Angels, he did so.  He is coming back to Kerry in January and I welcome that.  I welcome his engagement and the work he has done in his portfolio.  I am not being critical but I have a difference on opinion on this issue.  Some disability association groups would disagree with my view but they could not argue with my meaning this in the best possible way in that holding on to centres of excellence around the country is good for the future and we should not let them be closed by stealth.<\/p><p> I liked the analogy Ms O'Donovan made at the start of her presentation about a person being able to drop sticks here tomorrow if he or she wanted to and go to anywhere in the world he or she would like, but a person with a disability cannot do that as there are many other factors that have to be taken into account.  I welcome and very much acknowledge the work Ms O'Donovan's group does.  The same issues face people with disabilities whether they are based in Holland, Berlin, Ballinskelligs or any other part of the world.  If one is a wheelchair user or has any type of disability, one will have the same problems.  We need the same advocates for such people, namely, ourselves as politicians and excellent groups such as the Disability Federation of Ireland which does the work that it does, and we must all pull together at all times.  We must admit that services have improved dramatically over the years.  We will always have to strive for more and better conditions.  The resources given to people are most welcome and they have improved, but we will always have to fight for more.  It has been very beneficial that the representatives of this group to come here today and Ms O'Donovan now has the opportunity to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#D00500","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513173600,"counter":707,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman kindly for that.  I will respond first to Senator Dolan's question regarding austerity and what needs to change.  The best answer I can give to that question is the message that came through from last week's proceedings in Brussels which was a very strong call that austerity needs to end and investment needs to be put into supports, services and community-based supports and services for people with disabilities.  Without investment it cannot develop.  As I said, austerity has been felt most profoundly by persons with disabilities and other groups who would have be particularly marginalised from society.  A key point to remember is that people with disabilities are people and, by their nature, they are diverse.  They are immigrants with disabilities and women, children, men and the range of human existence of persons with disabilities.  In terms of austerity, however, the tide needs to change.  People with disabilities and the services supporting them cannot take any more cuts and they need investment.  The people and the citizens of Europe need investment.  The focus has been very strongly on economic policies and economic stability - this has been the topic of a submission made in numerous fora - and that is understandable and must be recognised.  As I said in my submission paper, the EU has demonstrated that it can act with determination and resolve, but that now needs to shift and be focused on, showing the same determination to improving the lives of the citizens of the EU.  It is not just about the economics.  As I said in the submission paper, it is not just about fixing the economic crisis.  The question is how this crisis impacted on the lives of persons in the EU.  The only way to change that around is to start to invest in improving the lives of persons with disabilities and the wider EU citizenship.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the question raised by the Chairman.  Certainly decongregation is a key issue in Ireland now.  It is referred to as the institutionalisation at EU level and this is part of a disconnect.  It is like trying to translate the lingo from the EU to the national and even to the local.  I appreciate the Chairman raising it here in the Irish context. <\/p> <p>  I would not presume to comment on the specifics of the local service in the community but I will speak more generally on the issue.  Decongregation is a policy based on research on the lived experiences and the wills and preferences of people with disabilities.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD - I believe it is Article 19 which focuses on community-based services - specifically calls for people to be given a choice as to where they want to live, how they want to live their lives and to give support to community-based services.  I certainly understand a concern around losing a centre of excellence but the question is what actually is the concern there.  What is the root issue.  Does it go more fundamentally to a fear of losing the excellence, the supports and the knowledge, which is what having community-based services is all about?  It is about ensuring that people with disabilities can live and be part of the community and have that expertise to hand in a form appropriate to their needs locally, in their local health centres, local primary care centres or wherever it is, and in this way not losing the excellence but applying it in a different way to support people to live in the community.<\/p><p>In terms of the fundraising and its importance to the community, that would be replicated throughout the country.  That would be true of many support organisations.<\/p><p> It is a question of recognising that excellence can be provided in a different way and to give the choice and support.

I am very honoured to speak to the committee which I congratulate on its deep engagement on the future of Europe.  I understand it has carried out extensive public consultation on this important topic and look forward to hearing some of its insights during our discussion.<\/p> <p>  Education and culture are high on the political agenda in the European Union.  At the recent social summit in Gothenburg, Sweden, Europe&rsquo;s political leaders held an exchange of views on education and culture.  I am proud that the debate built on an ambitious vision set out by the European Commission.  In our policy document, our communication on Strengthening European Identity through Education and Culture, we set out our ambition for a Europe capable of harnessing the full potential of education and culture, to build resilience, promote social fairness and active citizenship and strengthen European identity in all its diversity.  We want to work towards a Europe where learning, studying and conducting research will not be blocked by borders, where skilled and independent citizens will find or create fulfilling jobs, contribute to growth and innovation and feel empowered to shape communities and where people will share a strong sense of European identity and feel connected to our common cultural heritage.  <\/p> <p>  What does this mean in practice?  The communication calls for a European education area enabling the mutual recognition of higher education and school-leaving diplomas and study periods abroad.  It suggests we improve co-operation between universities and the mobility of students with the support of an EU student card.  It proposes steps to help member states boost the levels of skills, including basic skills, language skills and digital and entrepreneurial skills, as well as transversal skills and competences, and to promote lifelong learning.  All of this, whether it is mobility and recognition, skills development or support for teachers and educators, needs to be based on solid funding.  Hence, the communication recognises that to reach these goals, the future Erasmus+ programme will need to be substantially bigger than the current one.  It also reaffirms the European Union&rsquo;s commitment to safeguarding our common values and cultural heritage with continued support for the cultural and creative sectors.  We want to develop a strong European agenda for culture to help us to uphold European identity and diversity.  All children and young people should have the opportunity to realise their full potential and positively contribute to society.  However, the reality shows that the talents of millions of young people are lost each year.  Poorer students are three times more likely to be low performers than their wealthier peers.  We all need to do more to overcome these challenges and the European Union is willing to play its part.  I am pleased to announce that I will be hosting the first European education summit in Brussels on 25 January 2018 to follow up on the ambitions we have set out.  The summit will bring together Ministers, academics, stakeholders and civil society representatives in order to work towards a high-level political consensus on tackling inequality in and through education.  We must join forces to address underachievement in basic skills, to make education systems more inclusive and ensure they will benefit from smart investment.  We must develop a clear picture of what skills are needed for the decades to come.  <\/p> <p>  I count on the active participation of Irish authorities and Ireland has plenty of experiences to share.  In the past decade this country has undertaken unprecedented national efforts to modernise its education sector, despite going through a very difficult period.  During the recent economic crisis and the subsequent structural adjustment it sheltered education from major and far-reaching fiscal consolidation measures.  Ireland has also greatly improved in providing basic skills and combating early school leaving and inequalities, as well as in promoting participation in pre-school education.  It is one of the leading countries in Europe in tertiary attainment and has put forward a set of fairly ambitious goals for the future.  It is investing in education with a new impetus in terms of public spending in the sector and a very promising 2018 budget for education and training.  It also intends to focus more on educational infrastructure and higher capital expenditure, in particular with a view to attracting talent from elsewhere in Europe and the rest of the world.  However, a number of challenges remain.  They include the inclusion of disadvantaged students, the affordability of and access to child care, the long-term financial sustainability of third level education and the ongoing reform of the further education and training sector.  The European Commission stands ready to help Irish authorities in their efforts to make Ireland's education system one of the best in Europe.  <\/p> <p>  In the field of youth the European Commission is preparing a review of the EU youth strategy, the framework for youth policy co-operation.  The proposals we will outline before the summer will be based on young people's and youth stakeholders' input, as well as on the evaluation of the current strategy.  One priority is already clear for me: we need to reach out to many more young people to make sure our youth will have opportunities to engage and be heard in the democratic process, no matter where they are or what their background is.  <\/p> <p>  Another youth-related matter that has been high on our agenda this year is the European Solidarity Corps.  Since its launch, more than 43,000 young people have registered, showing their enthusiasm for solidarity and a willingness to volunteer or work to support others.  I expect the corps to get its own legal basis and budget next year following the agreement of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  <\/p> <p>  Throughout 2017 we celebrated the 30th anniversary of Erasmus, a unique programme which has given 9 million people, among them tens of thousands of Irish people, the opportunity to study, train, teach and volunteer abroad, providing them with the skills and outlook needed to thrive in life.  With more than 900 events and a huge involvement in social media and the press, the campaign reached more than 90 million European citizens, well beyond those already benefiting from the programme.  This year was also an opportunity to take stock and develop a common vision for the future of the programme.  My priority is to reach out to many more people from a wider range of backgrounds.  I also want to strengthen the mobility of school pupils, for example.  As I said at the beginning, if the future Erasmus+ is going to support our political objectives effectively, it will need to be beefed up.  The President of the European Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, and the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Antonio Tajani, have called for a substantial budget increase to make sure the future programme will be nine times more ambitious.  During the final EU-level event of the 30th anniversary campaign in Brussels the Erasmus+ generation declaration was presented.  The declaration contains 30 recommendations from the community of those who have benefited from the programme on how to make Erasmus+ a bigger programme, with a bigger impact on the future of Europe.  <\/p> <p>  In the area of sport we focus on promoting physical activity and grassroots sport.  The third edition of the European Week of Sport which took place in September attracted 12 million participants.  With its first edition having taken place only three years ago, I am pleased to see how much the idea has spread and how fast it has been adopted by member states and the sport family.  This year, together with my fellow Commissioners Phil Hogan who is in charge of agriculture and Vytenis Andriukaitis who is responsible for health, I launched a new initiative to promote healthy lifestyles across policy areas such as sport, education, food marketing, innovation and research.  Sport is very much about joy and physical well-being, but it also has a bigger role because it helps to build communities.<\/p><p>It is something I saw in Ireland first-hand when I met with leaders of the GAA in Croke Park and attended an All-Ireland hurling final just over two years ago.  To highlight the role of sport in communities, I launched the #BeInclusive EU sport awards which recognises organisations using sport to increase social inclusion for disadvantaged groups.  I was honoured to hand out the first awards at the end of November.  <\/p><p> We have just launched the European year of cultural heritage.  I want to place children and young people at the heart of this initiative.  By encouraging them to discover and engage with Europe&rsquo;s cultural heritage through a wide range of activities and programmes we can enable them to become guardians of our cultural heritage and to use it to build the Europe of tomorrow.  That is why the educational value of cultural heritage will be emphasised throughout the year.  The European year of cultural heritage is not a Brussels event, far from it.  We want people to explore and connect with heritage close to where they are.  That is why we will see a series of initiatives and events at European, national, regional and local levels.  At national level, the year is managed by national co-ordinators appointed by all 28 member states and I am pleased to say Ireland is enthusiastically represented by the Heritage Council.  I heard quite a bit about what is planned in Ireland throughout the year.  This morning, I attended the Creative Ireland forum where I launched the European year of cultural heritage in this country.  I trust that Ireland will make a success of the year.  <\/p><p> Deep structural changes are affecting our societies and economies at a time when many people also cope with the breakdown of social connections and families.  The policy fields I am responsible for, education, culture, youth and sport, have a crucial role in creating the resilience we need to overcome these challenges.  They can empower people, enabling them to lead independent, fulfilling lives and build inclusive, fair societies.  It is therefore heartening to see these policy areas at the top of Europe's political agenda.  Let us work together to ensure they stay there.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tibor Navracsics","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner.  I am sorry he is here when there is legislation going through the House and various committees are sitting, which means attendance is a bit low.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate the Commissioner on the 30 years of the Erasmus programme.  It has been a wonderful programme.  The Commissioner pointed out that in Ireland our students have benefited well from it.  It is a tremendous programme but, as it moves forward, I would like to see it expand into the areas of apprenticeship in addition to academic study.  We have to offer those seeking technical skills the opportunity to study abroad and learn the language of the country they are working in.  I would like to see more work done on that.  Coming from a teaching background, one of the things I feel is vitally important is that a teacher of language should actually train for a period in the country of the language they hope to teach.  For example, one should train for a year in France if one wants to teach French or in Germany if one wants to teach German.  I would like to see an Erasmus programme that extends to those who deliver academic programmes whether at primary, second or third level.  I would like to see an opportunity for that.  Perhaps a teacher who goes to France for a year to work and teach French in France could be replaced by a French teacher coming to Ireland to work and teach English in an Irish school.  We need to look at that.  One of the concerns we have as a result of Brexit is that there are almost 1.8 million people in the northern part of the country who have an entitlement to carry an Irish passport and as such are entitled to full European citizenship.  In the event of Brexit being completed, access to Erasmus for those people will become an extremely important issue.  While they will technically be in a third country, they are separated from their country of choice by geography.  We must maintain access to Erasmus programmes for Irish passport carriers living and working or studying in the North of Ireland because by right they are Irish citizens.  <\/p> <p>  Dr. Navracsics has responsibility for the area of education.  I have become increasingly concerned in recent years by the level of focus on statistics.  Statistics are useful for establishing whether a programme has been successful or unsuccessful.  I worked in further education and I came through second-chance education, having returned to college in my late 30s.  One of the things that concerns me is that when I returned to college in my 30s, the focus was on getting me in and getting me settled.  Nobody ever questioned whether I would take an examination or not.  The focus was on getting adults back engaging in the system.  I became a teacher when I qualified and over the 25 years I was teaching the focus shifted to verifiable statistical information, for example, how many students started the course, how many modules they took and how many modules they passed.  The success or failure of the programme was based on statistics.  Whether we like it or not, for some people who return to education surviving the year in the system is sufficient.  We must go back and look at the social side of education as well as the statistical side.  I would like the Commissioner to try to put some money or grant aid aside to get away from the statistics and look at community based education or education for the sake of learning rather than education for the sake of examination qualifications.  <\/p> <p>  The Commissioner mentioned the area of sport in his presentation.  Sport and sporting activity is extremely important.  There was a study carried out by some students from Kinsale Community School on the availability of sporting facilities in the country which showed the east-west divide in Ireland is stark.  A school in the eastern half of the country is likely to have its own gymnasium and other sporting facilities.  However, the further west one goes, the likelihood of finding these facilities in abundance is limited unless the school is a very new school or the parents have funded a gymnasium.  Let us face it, gymnasiums are not high on the list for parents when it comes to education.  They would rather put the money into other parts of education.  This might sound like the pot calling the kettle black because I am a rather large man but one of the problems we have in Europe is the growing rates of obesity.  Unless we get our children involved in sporting activities at a very young age the problem will be exacerbated over time.  Perhaps through the good offices of the Commissioner, we could look at how we could assist countries that have limited access to sporting facilities to start developing them within their regions.  <\/p> <p>  I am delighted to see that culture has not been left out of the event and that the Commissioner's focus is not on the big ticket events but on small towns and villages where everybody can get involved.  We had a tremendous year in 2016 where every town, village and townland in the country became involved in the remembrance of the revolution.  We are now coming into 2018 which is the centenary of women getting the vote.  That will be a major cultural issue for Ireland and something to be celebrated.  One hopes it will be celebrated in every village and townland in the country.  Any assistance the Commissioner can give in that area would be very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Commissioner for taking the time to come here.  It is always good to get Commissioners over from Europe to know they are alive and well.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#J00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":716,"content":"<p>Before we proceed to our next speaker I welcome Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin, Chair of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, to the meeting today.

If there is Brexit and the North is outside the European Union, there will be hundreds of thousands of Irish citizens who hold Irish passports and, by virtue of that, are European citizens but who, regrettably, will live outside the territory of the European Union.  Their rights must be vindicated.  In his area of competence, with education being the main area, how will Mr. Navracsics ensure that their rights will be respected fully and that there will be no loss of rights for those people?<\/p> <p>  In his speech the European Commissioner spoke about wanting to develop a strong European agenda for culture to help us uphold European identity and diversity.  That is very important, and protecting diversity and identity becomes even more important in the context of Brexit and a rise of the far right in some parts of Europe.  The Brexit talks are moving into the second phase and there will now be substantial talks on a potential free trade agreement between Britain and the European Union.  Is it possible to have a free trade agreement between Britain and the European Union that would allow for the free movement of goods and services but would curtail the movement of people?  If one wishes to have free movement of goods and services there must be free movement of people.  I expect that will be a thorny issue in the negotiations, given that it was a big issue in the referendum in Britain.  It was hyped up by some far right politicians in Britain but it was an issue.  If one wishes to protect the rights of citizens and people's identity as well as ensuring diversity, the free movement of people is important, especially in countries with which we have free trade agreements which resemble the customs union and Single Market, if that is what emerges.<\/p> <p>  I wish to contest one part of the European Commissioner's statement.  He said that during the most recent economic crisis education was sheltered from major and far-reaching fiscal consolidation measures in this State.  That is not quite true.  I will forward to him information on the difference between what was invested in education before the crash and what was invested in it after the crash.  He will see the substantial difference.  He might also be aware that third level fees were increased substantially on two occasions due to the economic crash.  Unfortunately, education was not protected as much as the European Commissioner might have been informed it was.  I make that point to provide information and clarity.<\/p> <p>  We are discussing the future of Europe.  While education is the remit of the European Commissioner I wish to refer to some aspects of the broader issues of reform of the European Union.  There has been a clash at the heart of the European project for many years, probably since its inception, between those who want what could be argued to be a more federal Europe or united states of Europe and those who want a more democratic and social Europe.  I am on the side of those who want a more democratic and social Europe.  Mr. Martin Schulz recently said he wants greater and deeper integration, a more federal Europe.  He is entitled to his opinion.  All opinions can be sincerely held and people are entitled to state their positions, but can Mr. Navracsics share his personal view on that debate and clash?  Does he agree that many Europeans are worried and concerned about a European federal super state?  Would he agree that this was, in part, one of the drivers of Brexit and that if we wish to ensure the integrity of the European project we must be careful to be in tune at all times with what the people want, not what politicians who might operate in silos or bubbles in Europe or people in the Commission might see as being in the best interests of European citizens?  We must listen to people's voices on what they want.  What is the European Commissioner's view on that?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the European Commissioner's area of education, if I am arguing for a more social Europe it means I am seeking a stronger focus on citizens' rights and investment in public services, which would include the rights of citizens in education.  In what areas would Mr. Navracsics seek improvement?  He spoke about an increase in his overall budget for education, which would be welcome.  However, in terms of the rights of citizens across Europe and in the context of reforming Europe, and these hearings are about reforming Europe and the future of Europe, what would be his vision for education and its place within a reformed European Union project, whatever the nature of that reform?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#K00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I welcome the European Commissioner and the officials.  We had an opportunity to meet briefly earlier.  Mr. Navracsics mentioned the European Week of Sport.  I attended the signing of the first European Week of Sport with the partners on behalf of Special Olympics Europe Eurasia.  I am still a volunteer with that organisation and the organisation was delighted to participate in the first European Week of Sport and on subsequent occasions.  I offer my congratulations on that.  It is always good to see horizons being pushed out on so many different levels.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make some comments in the context of my role as chairman of the committee on education and skills.  Our thinking is very much in line with the European Commissioner's in terms of the work programme and some of the reports we have produced.  The Education and Training Monitor from the European Commission has been very helpful in focusing our minds.  One of the areas mentioned, and it was mentioned in the European Commissioner's opening address, is the value of alternative pathways and vocational routes.  Our committee held a hearing on apprenticeships earlier this year and we sent our findings to the Minister.  We hope they will be taken on board.  One of the main reasons for having that meeting and developing the report is that we feel there is a view that attendance at university is almost obligatory to succeed and to have a successful career.  Apprenticeships are often seen as the poor relation to university courses.  We must do what we can to develop a parity of esteem in that regard.  Only two weeks ago our committee dealt with the legislation to provide for technological universities in Ireland, to ensure our institutes of technology would have parity of esteem and be able to attract funding and the students they require.  That is very important.  In fact, there was a non-partisan approach by all members of the committee to progress that Bill.  The recognition of its importance meant there was a willingness to consider alternative views and to progress the legislation as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  The committee also met the Irish team that competed in WorldSkills Abu Dhabi 2017.  Its members won seven medallions for excellence.  I and the committee members were very impressed by the calibre of the Irish delegation and its exceptional achievements on the world stage.  However, there is no national stage or competition in Ireland.<\/p><p>That is somewhat lacking.  The Commissioner may be familiar with the young scientist and technology exhibition held in Ireland every January which has been an incredible success.  It has opened up science to students.  I have suggested a similar event be run to showcase the importance of apprenticeships and skills training as an alternative to university courses.  I am interested in hearing his views on that matter.  In his opening contribution he referred to students developing resilience, which is hugely important.  We made a report to the Minister with 20 recommendations related to positive mental health in education at primary, second and third level and to non-formal and informal education.  It is of crucial importance to all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#K00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I am sorry., but I have to step out to deal with a situation.

The Commissioner plans to host a European education summit, which is welcome, to improve co-operation in providing for the mobility of students.  The implications of Brexit are a major concern for us.  Some 12,000 Irish students are studying in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Last week's news was positive in having a softer Brexit than anticipated, but it is still a major concern.  Our universities are under a great deal of pressure and the Central Applications Office process would have to change completely if we had to absorb another 12,000 students, apart from the need from a European perspective to give students, lecturers and so on the mobility to study or work abroad.<\/p> <p>  The basic skills of Irish students in maths and science are high according to the Education and Training Monitor and relatively unaffected by socioeconomic background, which is positive, but there is a risk that other subjects such as the humanities may suffer as a result of the emphasis placed on maths and science.  That debate has started strongly in the past 12 months and I am interested in hearing the Commissioner's views on it.<\/p> <p>  Ireland compares well in meeting education targets for early school leaving rates.  However, there are still many inequalities in participation and access.  That is a key problem for us at every level.  It has been suggested limiting the number of students who participate in tertiary education is a failing and needs to be addressed.  Does the Commissioner agree that this causes a points race and that there is an an over-emphasis on academic achievement?  There is a risk that other parts of a student's development such as resilience are being ignored.  Sometimes students accept courses to which they may not be entirely suited, but they are more desirable to do because they require higher points.  That can contribute to a higher dropout rate.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the Commissioner.

I will deal with similar questions in thematic groups.  <\/p> <p>  I will address first the role of skills in education, apprenticeship programmes and the mobility of apprentices because clearly that is one of the lines we would like to follow in the future.  It is obvious from the statistical data that we have to do more to make the education systems more skills oriented and transform them from being the traditionally one-sided knowledge oriented system into a more practical and skills oriented system, while availing of all of the opportunities and other forms of education to reach that goal.  That is why we encourage member states to enrich their forms of education in lifelong learning and provide for greater investment in informal and non-formal education and use all of these opportunities to promote social inclusion.  In our experience education is one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, policy tools for social inclusion.  That is why we have chosen the accessibility of education systems as a main topic for this year's Education and Training Monitor.  There is a direct correlation between life opportunities and access to education systems.  That means, from the point of view of the cohesion of future societies, accessibility of education systems can be an important societal factor.  That is why we support projects to make cross-border apprenticeship and apprenticeship mobility programmes more common.  <\/p> <p>  The European Solidarity Corps, ESC, was launched a year ago.  Volunteering is a well known aspect of the corps.  We have 43,000 applicants for it, most of whom are interested in volunteering schemes which are a successor to the European voluntary service programme.  However, at the same time, we are working on the apprenticeship and occupation-led elements of the ESC which will offer new opportunities for cross-border apprenticeship programmes.  It is a work in progress, but I hope that in the near future we can launch the first apprenticeship programmes and projects under the framework of the ESC.  However, there are existing opportunities for cross-border apprenticeship activities within the Erasmus programme.  There is an opportunity to establish apprenticeship consortia among companies through public private partnerships comprising public authorities and private companies.<\/p><p>They, too, can have cross-border apprenticeship programmes.  International companies have a huge advantage in this area in that they can organise cross-border apprenticeship programmes within the framework of a company.  We would like to develop the apprenticeship programmes of Erasmus+ in the future.  Thus far, we have run programmes with 600,000 apprentices, which is quite large number, but we are still in the initial phase of cross-border activities in apprenticeship programmes.  I agree that if we want to harness the potential of competitiveness of European economies we must put more emphasis on cross-border apprenticeship programmes because they equip people with not only relevant technical skills but language skills, which is important from the point of view of the Single Market.  <\/p><p>  On Brexit, there is a lot of uncertainty about the post-Brexit environment but as far as I know the education, research and innovation family in the United Kingdom is committed to retaining these programmes.  It depends on the official position of the UK delegation and the EU delegation in the negotiations.  I will do everything to protect the interests of young people with Irish passports or citizenship either side of the Border who wish to be participate in Erasmus+ programmes.  I cannot imagine any scenario which would exclude Irish citizens from Erasmus+ irrespective of where they live.  This programme is linked to citizenship, not location.  I would like to protect all the achievements of the Erasmus programmes but, again, this is dependent on the position taken by the delegations.  I agree that we must emphasis the social profile of education.  The dominant position is to look at education performance exclusively through data and statistics, including through the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, and the Education and Training Monitor.  We tried to soften the statistical side of measuring education and performance through the Education and Training Monitor and making accessibility a factor.  The accessibility of our education system cannot be expressed by figures alone.  However, there is another danger because statistical based data can indicate a very technocratic profile of education.  If one travels too far from the soft side, the result can be a subjective evaluation of the educational systems, which is very difficult even at European level because, while we are above national front-lines, we all have our national affiliations.  For example, I am Hungarian and I am more biased to central European countries.  I am more sensitive to their problems and Ireland would be more sensitive to the Irish problem, Brexit and so on.  We have to find a good compromise between these two points of the evaluation and we are working on that.   <\/p><p> Again, there is a strong correlation between the quality and level of education and the level of competitiveness of the future societies.  The higher the quality and level of education today the higher will be our level of competitiveness tomorrow.  There is general consensus among Education Ministers on the Education Council that education is the most important issue in the world.  It is good that we have that strong consensus and we are all friends but equally important is that we convince Finance Ministers and Prime Ministers that education is the most important issue.  This is the most important thing we can do today for tomorrow.  If we want to tackle future unemployment and the issues of future competitiveness, social cohesion, solidarity and so on we must invest more in education and strive to raise the level of tertiary education and early school-leaving.  We have to do our best to strengthen the social profile of the education institutions because that is the best way to tackle future challenges of these societies.  I believe Ireland is on the right path.  I accept that there are difficulties and problems but I know from my comprehensive knowledge of education policy in Europe that there is no member state without problems in education.  Education is probably the biggest issue in every EU member state but in the rankings of the education systems Ireland performs very well.  It is important to bear that in mind.  I appreciate Ireland's efforts and its results in this area.<\/p><p> On sport, we have to do more in the area of grassroots sports.  It is for this reason I opened the sports chapters of Erasmus+ exclusively to grassroots sports.  I believe grassroots sports has a social function.  It is not only about leisure time activities and wellbeing, it is about community, friendship and human relations.  I would like to support and fund grassroots sports activities further in the future because the health and the core of the wellbeing of contemporary societies are at local level.  If our local communities are powerful and strong, based on solidarity, we will have no problems at regional or national levels, or at European level.  I would like to increase funding to grassroots sports activities to help them in social inclusion and to help them build sport facilities and make them more accessible.  We can do more in rural development policy and regional development policy to help local communities to build their sports facilities to serve the interests of the local communities.  <\/p><p> On the European Year of Cultural Heritage, this is not a Brussels exercise.  We will hold few flagship events in Brussels but those events will serve local communities.<\/p><p> For instance, we are going to have a conference of the European capitals of culture and a workshop of the owners of the European heritage label.  The topic of those events will be the ways in which we can best serve the interests of local communities.  The only sustainable European scenario is a bottom-up European scenario.  There is no top-down scenario which will be successful.  European institutions simply cannot force their image or their plans on local communities.  Just the opposite; we must invent our Europe at local level.  We have to build up the European community from below.  We have to base our future European community on the diversity of the local communities, and the European Year of Culture and Heritage is just the first step in this journey and in this enterprise. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tibor Navracsics","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I should say by way of introduction, that as a member of the Seanad, I am not a member of any political party.  I was elected as an independent Senator on the issue of disability inclusion, and it is on that issue that I wish to focus.  We have a saying in Irish, and I am sure the Commissioner will tell me the equivalent saying in Hungarian; \"Tosach maith, leath na hoibre.\"  A good start is half the work.  Education is a cornerstone, and the Commissioner has recognised that in what he has said.<\/p> <p>  I apologise for not being here at the start of this meeting.  I was at a meeting of the Committee for Transport, Tourism and Sport which was looking at accessible transport for people with disabilities.  I met with the cabinet of the Commissioner for Transport last week, so there is a European angle to these issues as well.  Transport can facilitate participation in education, as well as in cultural activities, sport and other activities.<\/p> <p>  My apologies for not being here, but I have read the Commission's opening statement.  The committee will let me be tetchy or touchy by saying I do not see the word \"disability\" used once in it.  Mr. Navracsics spoke about disadvantaged students.  The witnesses might respond that the inclusion of people with disabilities is implied, that the EU has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which is certainly a very significant thing, and that there is a European Union disability strategy.  I would still make the point that mentioning people with disabilities is critical.  The President of the European Parliament, Mr. Antonio Tajani, along with the president of the European Disability Forum, Mr. Yannis Vardakastanis, opened a European Parliament of Persons with Disabilities in the European Parliament last Wednesday, as Mr. Navracsics will be aware.  Some 750 people with disabilities from right across the Union were present.  I was honoured to lead an Irish delegation of 11 people.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Navracsics' brief includes education and culture.  In a word, my big issue is changing culture.  One example is the tendency to presume that things are okay for disabled people, or, when a disability issue is raised, for people to say that they have never thought about it.  In this domain it is important to very specifically reference the 80 million Europeans with disabilities, a number which is heading towards 100 million.  They are not all in the first flush of life.  Within that group, a minority are children and young people going to school.  We want them to take part in Erasmus Plus.  We want them to be jetting around Europe, and, along with their able-bodied peers, to come home talking about the time they had and the possibilities before them. <\/p> <p>  Mr. Navracsics's statement says that he is pleased to announce that he will be hosting the first European Education Summit in Brussels.  I hope that that becomes an opportunity to underline this issue.  The statement talks about working towards a high-level political consensus on tackling inequality through education.  People with disabilities need access to education.  Everybody does, but it is life and death to them.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Navracsics has graciously said that Ireland has plenty of experience to share, and it is a fair point.  Over the past decade this country has undertaken unprecedented national efforts to modernise its education sector, despite the difficulties we have had.  We have done more than modernise it.  We actually did away with the notion that children with disabilities would be educated in separate special schools.  That is not just modernising, it is changing culture and changing thinking.  It is now accepted that all children will go to regular local schools with their brothers and sisters, and we will bring whatever supports are needed in around them.  Of course there are there issues with getting that right and moving it on, and we need to deal with those.  Ireland does have a story to tell about how it has made these changes.  The world has not collapsed in Ireland as a result.<\/p> <p>  We now come to a different challenge, one which needs to be thought about sooner rather than later.  Following education is the issue of employment.  That needs to be thought about when education is being changed.  The White Paper on the Future of Europe sets out five options.  In this country, several civil society organisations and a coalition including Social Justice Ireland would say that it needs a sixth one, a sustainable Europe for its citizens, in order to copper-fasten sustainability and social involvement.<\/p> <p>  I am looking for thoughtfulness and reassurances.  I suppose I am playing on the word \"culture\".  There is a cultural shift needed.  I routinely travel from east to west and from north to south and I see that there are many Europes in Europe.  I think the witnesses understand what I mean.  There are many challenges.  Ireland is not in the worst position by far.  However, as a disabled person, I do not have an Irish perspective as opposed to a Hungarian one or Romanian one.  I have a sense of the needs of all disabled people, and that is I suggest is important to bring into this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017121300002#N00200","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1513173600,"counter":728,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1513173600,"counter":729,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for his presence here this afternoon, and for outlining his vision of education from a European perspective.  I observed Mr. Navracsics's presence in the plenary session a short time ago, when he listened to some of the debate regarding the European Council meeting taking place tomorrow and on Friday.  I think he got a flavour of the Irish concerns around Brexit.  In a previous life I was Minister of State with responsibility for Lifelong Learning, Youth Work and School Transport at the then Department of Education and Science.  It was a very rewarding position.  I have attended meetings of the Council of Ministers, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, and so forth.  The reason the position was very rewarding is that I got to meet individuals who had prospered from participation in further education and training or lifelong learning.   I saw how the individual flourished, and how they then made a contribution to their family, their community, their society and indeed to the economy as a whole.<\/p> <p>  Senator Dolan mentioned the issue of disability.  I wish to mention the issue of adult literacy, bringing our discussion right back to basics.  I am of the view that many people are still excluded from fully participating in society because of inadequate literacy skills, including computer literacy.  These people are becoming more and more excluded from playing a full role in our society and participating in the digital economy.   I assume this is a priority for the European Commission, but I must ask Mr. Navracsics how are we doing across the EU with regard to adult literacy.  I believe many people are feeling more and more socially excluded because of their lack of basic skills.  Bringing our concern right back to basics, I would like to think that this has to be a priority as well.  I hope that the European Union is improving as a whole in that regard.<\/p><p>I thank Deputy Haughey.  Before I call on Commissioner Navracsics, I wish to thank Senator Leyden for his valuable help.

It is a difficult issue because they need something special and ERASMUS Plus is a big one-fit-for-all project.  However, we have almost 600 participants with special needs and disabilities from Ireland in ERASMUS.  It is not a big number but it is a good start.<\/p> <p>  We have to make the whole system more sensitive to individual needs.  One of the avenues of thinking about the future of ERASMUS is making it more sensitive in that direction by combining it with travel opportunities, creating more opportunities for accessibility and to open the traditional modes of mobility to people with disability.  However, that is in the future unfortunately.  The Irish cultural shift has been mentioned, but there are many member states where this shift has not been made.  In Hungary, there are serious government efforts to introduce integrated schools and make them universal.  However, the general pattern is still specialised schools in towns, smaller settlements and villages because of tradition and bad responses.  It is difficult to understand.

One fifth of European citizens have serious problems with reading and one quarter with numeracy.  We are progressing very fast to the digital world, but we are neglecting the fundamentals of those contemporary skills.

I am joined by Mr. Paddy Barrett, assistant principal in the national human resources unit.<\/p> <p>  I will begin by thanking the Chairman and the committee for inviting us here today to discuss a range of issues concerning the consultant contract.  The invitation follows on from the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme, which aired on 21 November 2017, about the level of private practice being carried out by hospital consultants and the effect this is having on public patients.<\/p> <p>  A key objective of the consultant contract of 2008 was, and still is, to improve access for public patients to public hospital care.  It should be noted that at the time, this new contract represented a fundamental change from previous contracts and was the largest redesign of the consultants&rsquo; contract for 30 years.  It specifically included a framework developed to protect the position of public patients and provided for increased availability of senior clinical decision makers.  Revised work practices under the new contract, the extended working day, the appointment of clinical directors, in conjunction with other developments such as clinical care programmes, have allowed greater flexibility in meeting the challenges facing the health system.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of different types of contract, which allow consultants to work in different ways.  The monitoring of public-private mix is an ongoing part of implementation of the consultant contract.  If we look at the system as a whole, the data from September 2017 show that the public-private mix at a system level stands at 82% public for elective inpatient work and at almost 86% for day-case work.  National performance has been consistent at this level.  These rates are also consistent with the typical 80:20 split provided for in the consultant contract.  The framework for the regulation of a consultant's private practice is contained in section 20 of the contract.  It provides that the public to private practice ratio is to be implemented through the clinical directorate structure.  It also gives the employer of the consultant full authority to take all necessary steps to ensure a consultant's practice shall not exceed the agreed ratio of public to private practice. <\/p> <p>  The Health Service Executive, HSE, therefore, has responsibility for ensuring consultant compliance with their contracts.  Responsibility for reporting individual consultant compliance lies with the hospital groups.  The main reason for this is to ensure local accountability.  Hospitals know their consultants and the work they deliver.  However, it is clear that the arrangements that are in place, or enforcement of these, are not robust enough to deliver compliance in all circumstances.  As a result, some consultants have engaged in private practice activity at levels that exceed the levels provided for in their contracts.  This may arise in respect of the level of private activity undertaken on-site or they engage in significant levels of off-site private practice although their contract does not provide for this.  The Department of Health is working closely with the HSE to find a solution to ensure compliance is monitored more effectively and, more importantly, that breaches are dealt with appropriately.  <\/p> <p>  The need to get delivery of real change under the revised contractual arrangements for the benefit of public patients has been the subject of engagement between the Department and the HSE over the years.  The benefits provided for in the 2008 contract regarding greater consultant availability were further strengthened and enhanced in an agreement reached between the parties at the Workplace Relations Commission in September 2012.  Following further engagement with the Department, the director general of the HSE issued clear instructions to relevant health sector management in October 2012.  These instructions reaffirmed the need for individual hospitals and hospital groups to ensure full compliance with the terms of consultant contracts.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of more recent developments, directly after the airing of the RT&Eacute; programme, members will be aware the Minister for Health was strong in his condemnation of the practices reported.  He asked the HSE to ensure that more robust measures are in place in 2018 to make sure all consultants comply with their contractual obligations.  There had already been a number of engagements this year between the Department and the HSE in this context.  In September, in response to a letter from the Secretary General of the Department, the director general confirmed that consultant contract compliance is an agenda item at the monthly performance meetings held by the HSE acute hospitals division with the hospital groups.  The national director for that division, Mr. Liam Woods, is here today and he can speak further about that process.<\/p> <p>  In line with the Minister&rsquo;s requirements, on 1 December the Secretary General of the Department of Health wrote to the director general of the HSE, repeating that it is essential that robust arrangements are put in place to monitor actively compliance with the provisions of the contract and to ensure that corrective action is taken where breaches are identified.  A comprehensive framework, at both national and local level, has been requested to see that this is done.  The Department has also sought confirmation of the steps being taken by the HSE to investigate the apparent contract breaches by individual consultants.  <\/p> <p>  The Department will shortly be engaging further with the HSE in response to some broader issues the HSE has raised concerning oversight of the contract, including the impact of the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 and the need for hospitals to collect private patient income.  However, the HSE has already been advised that those issues do not affect the implementation of measures required to ensure robust governance and monitoring of compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to consultants engaging in private practice, with remedial action pursued where required.  The matter of consultant compliance with their contracts is also being discussed in the context of the High Court legal cases that are in train.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister has established an independent expert review group to examine the impact of separating private practice from the public hospital system.  The removal of private practice from public hospitals was one of the key recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  This group will conclude its work by the end of next summer.  <\/p> <p>  I trust this information has been of some assistance.  My colleague and I will endeavour to answer questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":747,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cody.

I am joined by my colleagues Ms Colette Cowan, chief executive officer of the University of Limerick hospital group and Ms Angela Fitzgerald, deputy director of the acute division.<\/p> <p>  The recent \"Prime Time\" programme examined the issue of private practice in the public hospital system and identified a number of unnamed individuals who allegedly were not meeting their contractual obligations.  The issues raised are concerning for patients, their relatives and the wider public.  Our hospital level data show that with a small number of exceptions, individual hospitals are compliant with public-private mix requirements.  In fact, the proportion of public patients treated is higher than the required level.  This suggests that the issues raised in the programme are about individual practice rather than whole system non-compliance issues. <\/p> <p>  I propose to move on to the next section on fulfilling commitments.  Consultant duties in a hospital encompass three distinct elements, namely, health care provision, education and research.  I will move on to discuss the types of contract under heading two of my statement.  Type A contracts are for consultants treating public patients only while type B contract doctors can treat private patients within public hospitals.  Type B* doctors were employed pre-2008, which is the latest contract date, and transferred to the new contract and they are allowed to have off&ndash;site practice.  Type C doctors are allowed to have off-site practice and their private practice limits within a public hospital are also prescribed.  <\/p> <p>  Nationally within the acute system, there are 6%, or 169 consultants holding type A contracts, while two thirds or 1,789, contract holders are on type B contracts while 28% hold types B*, C, or pre-2008 contracts.<\/p><p>For the committee's information, there are 364 consultants who are holders of pre-2008 contracts.  That contract is colloquially known as the Buckley contract.<\/p><p> The oversight arrangements have been outlined.  They are designed as points of reference with a view to ensuring accountability, recognition of joint appointments and cross-hospital work arrangements, and guidance regarding detailed calculation of compliance.  There is a detailed guidance note, which can be made available to the committee, for hospital groups and hospitals to implement the contract.  We can return to this issue later if the committee so requires.<\/p><p> Current compliance was referenced in the Department of Health's opening statement.  Some 82% of inpatient work and 85.8% of day-case work is public.  Thus, at a national level the overall hospital system in is compliance.  Clearly there is a challenge around individual compliance within that, which we will come to discuss.  For those sites where more than 30% of work consists of private practice, there are relevant factors to be considered, including the impact of paediatric and maternity, historical bed designation and the absence of private services in locations.<\/p><p> I refer to interventions in cases of non-compliance.  The HSE's performance management process has highlighted issues or areas of potential non-compliance, and has, where it has been deemed appropriate, intervened to examine and address such non-compliance through independent review or internal audit.  Two examples of such reviews took place in the University of Limerick Hospitals Group and St. Vincent's University Hospital Group.  The findings from such review processes serve to inform improvements in internal controls.<\/p><p> I refer to structural challenges in overseeing the contract.  I mention the decision by way of legislation to de-designate private beds.  The 364 holders of Buckley contracts are entitled to practice in beds that were designated private.  That designation situation changed in 2013.  That does not mean that those contracts become unmanageable.  However, the expression \"designated bed\" has been removed from the legal framework but still resides within the contract.  There is no mechanism to allow the HSE to determine if consultants have billed and been paid for all patients recorded as private on hospital systems.  None of the consultant contracts makes provision for the monitoring of off-site practice and private patient income accounts for 12% of total acute hospital funding.<\/p><p> I will take the issue of the potential displacement of public work as read.  There is a lot of content on this topic.  In our submission we have flagged some of the factors that are more generally pushing the hospital system.  These include the growth in emergency attendances; an increase in attendances by the over-75 age cohort; bed-days lost to delayed discharges, typically accounting for around 550 beds; beds closed due to staff shortages; and consultant manpower shortages.  By comparison with OECD, Health at a Glance comparators, and other analysis, we would need at least another 2,000 consultants to reach a middle level across OECD comparators.  One of the core issues facing our system is that we do not have enough consultants in certain key specialties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":753,"content":"<p>I welcome our delegates.  I assume they have all seen the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme.  The first question that must be asked is this whether the delegates surprised when they saw the programme or whether they were shocked, or both?  Did they have any inkling that this type of activity and practice was being carried out?  The witnesses have referred to the fact that it was limited.  However, what \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" would suggest that it is not as limited as we are trying to suggest here.  There may be reasons our delegates suggest differently.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the perverse incentives that are now in the public health system, and the funding of same, we have been talking about the issue of stretched targets for a very long time.  Mr. Woods stated that the decision by way of legislation to effectively de-designate private beds - 2013 legislation - was aimed at optimising private income and supporting the delivery of accelerated income targets.  That change came about primarily because of the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendations.  In doing that, do the delegates agree there is now a perversion at the heart of the funding of public hospital systems?  In other words, there is an incentive for public hospitals to put private patients in beds ahead of public patients.  That filters down to the involvement of consultants.  Due to this perversion at the heart of the system, it is very difficult for hospital managers, and those managing budgets, to confront consultants who are pushing private patients through the public hospital system.<\/p> <p>  Everybody working in the system tells me that there are no stretched targets in it.  Everybody around this committee table looks at the accounts and knows that at the heart of it there is an incentive to facilitate private patients ahead of public patients.  If somebody here can tell me I am wrong, I call on them to do so and to explain why I am wrong.  I believe this is at the heart of the difficulty.  It puts clinical directors and hospital managers in a very invidious position because consultants are involved in this as well and are facilitating the increased stretched budgets available to public hospitals.  I would like to hear the delegates' comments on that issue.<\/p> <p>  From what I can gather, the HSE pays an extra &euro;46,000 extra to a clinical director.  They are obviously the ones charged with the responsibility of making sure these contracts are upheld.  Has a case ever been brought to the attention of a hospital manager, a clinical director, the HSE or the Department of Health in which there was a breach of contract?  Has anybody ever picked up a phone and reported that a consultant was only working 13 hours a week, as was reported in one case?  A young person in a carpark with a clipboard and a stopwatch was able to identify it, but our amazing systems could not.  Why is that the case, in view of Ms Cody's claim that this issue on the agenda?  Ms Cody stated that the director general of the HSE issued clear instructions to relevant health sector management in October 2012.  I have also been advised that it has been on the agenda of almost every meeting.  Has it ever been raised to the point where a consultant, clinical director or hospital manager was called to account?  Is there now a situation where the HSE and the Department of Health are utterly compromised when it comes to dealing with consultant contracts?  There are a number of reasons, which I have outlined, including stretched budgets, which are now endemic in the heath system, for funding of public hospitals and the fact there was a court case which could potentially place a liability of &euro;300 million on the State over changes in contracts and working conditions for consultants over the years, the court cases flowing from that and the fact they were vindicated.  Is there a cosiness developing between the HSE, the Department of Health and consultants to delay the payment of that &euro;300 million and turn a blind eye to other issues that at the very least are unethical, immoral and potentially illegal?  I would like to hear the delegates' comments on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#E00200","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":754,"content":"<p>I apologise in advance as I need to attend a quick meeting.  I will ask my questions but will check the answers and correspond.  I hope I will be back before this meeting is finished.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the issue of stretched income targets.  I believe Ms Cowan first alerted us to them some time ago.  Reference was made to the difficulties they cause, and we attempted at that committee hearing to try to tease the issue out.   It strikes me that they are still causing difficulties, despite the HSE's insistence that it is otherwise.  What we saw on \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" was once again - RT&Eacute; one; HSE nil.  That is how these things work.  What we saw involved a very small number of consultants.  By not dealing with this, we do a grave disservice to all the consultants who work over and above their contracted hours.<\/p><p>I have had the honour and privilege of representing people who are not consultants and who see an upstairs-downstairs attitude in the HSE quite a lot of the time.  I have seen people hauled over the coals for infringements of their contracts that are minuscule in comparison with what we saw on the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme.  Will the delegates address what appears to be a culture of deference in which some people are untouchable?  They might also take this opportunity to talk about the consultants who are fulfilling their contracted hours and more.<\/p><p> In Ms Cody's statement she says the Department will shortly be engaging with the HSE in response to some broader issues the HSE has raised concerning oversight of the contract including the impact of the Health (Amendment) Act and the need for hospitals to collect private patient income.  Perhaps the HSE can come in on this, as well as Ms Cody.  When were those concerns raised?  In what format were they raised?  Who raised them and when were they discussed?  I sincerely hope they were not raised immediately following the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme.  If they were raised before that and have been on the agenda, will Ms Cody outline what exactly is being done to ensure those issues are addressed?  I am sure she will be happy to share that with us.  <\/p><p> Mr. Woods has said the HSE does not co-ordinate data nationally and that some consultants work across hospitals.  Obviously he knows they work across hospitals.  I understood the purpose of the establishment of the hospital groups was to streamline some of this.  Has anything actually been streamlined?  I strongly suspect it has not but perhaps it has.  Are there plans to streamline in that way because, having represented people who work in the health service, most of them can account for every minute they work and they do so because it is the requirement?  Yet, there seems to be a small number of people who do not do this.  As Deputy Billy Kelleher pointed out, a young fellow with a clipboard and a clicker was able to monitor the comings and goings of the staff.  Does Mr. Woods accept what we saw in the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" report as a factual account of what is happening in some instances?  Is he prepared to hold his hands up to this and will he take any steps?  If it was a porter in a hospital who had been found not to be working his or her contracted hours, I imagine the HSE would pursue him or her quite vigorously.  Will Mr. Woods outline the plans to recoup that money which people have been given for work they did not do?  <\/p><p> I apologise that I have to go, but I will be back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#E00300","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":756,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Woods start with some of those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#F00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513155600,"counter":757,"content":"<p>I will answer the earlier questions first.  I saw the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" show and we would be concerned about any of those allegations being substantive.  We are aware of the waiting lists in the public health system.  Both speakers raised the issue of stretch income and perverse incentives.  The origin of this dialogue was in the Sl&aacute;intecare committee.  I will say broadly what is happening.  The HSE is funded annually with an income target for the acute system of &euro;938 million.  Of that, &euro;620 million is for what one would think of as private charging in public hospitals or charging of patients who choose to be private in a public hospital.  That is &euro;620 million that the hospital system collectively is seeking to charge and collect on an annual basis.  The stretch income issue that was referred to in previous committee discussions was that the target was proving difficult to achieve.  The point being raised by Deputy Kelleher was whether it is giving rise to a skewed or perverse incentive within the system.  What I would say to that in the context of the current year and just dealing with the facts is that the HSE will be short in its income collection by about &euro;90 million in the current year.  Neither the HSE centrally, nor the director and I, seek to source private patients to try to grow that, which was a concern of Sl&aacute;intecare.  It does not seek for public hospitals to take measures to manage cost because there is a shortfall in income.  There is a wider point in what the Deputy is saying.  If we look at the source of private income in public hospitals, 79% of the private income arising in public hospitals is from patients coming through the emergency department or maternity services for which there is no queue.  The balance results from inpatient elective work.  It is important that we examine that closely and understand the trends in that.  The macro position is that nearly 80% of the total private work done in the public system comes through the emergency department or maternity hospitals.  There are wider policy issues that are not really for the HSE to comment on in terms of the tensions between the perversities to which the Deputy referred.  What I can say is there is an income target.  It is a difficult target to achieve.  There is a series of campaigns by insurance organisations in the health sector to, in effect, minimise claims payments of the public system.  From my point of view in terms of public patients being treated, that is not at present impacting on the financial position of the hospital groups or hospitals in such a way as to give concern to the public provision.  There are wider issues around the linking of that with some of the points Deputy Billy Kelleher made.  They are more in the policy domain.  That was the issue of stretch targets.  My colleague, Ms Colette Cowan, may wish to say more about that from a hospital group perspective in a few moments if I go through the other questions.<\/p> <p>  There are stretch targets and they are in place within the system.  They were known to be &euro;44 million in the current year but the reality is they will be more like &euro;90 million because of the way the finances are working out in the current year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":758,"content":"<p>That &euro;90 million has to be made up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#F00400","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513155600,"counter":759,"content":"<p>Yes, in previous years-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":760,"content":"<p>It was &euro;44 million but now they have to find another &euro;46 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#F00600","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513155600,"counter":761,"content":"<p>Yes, in previous years-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":762,"content":"<p>How do they find that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#F00800","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513155600,"counter":763,"content":"<p>It has been an issue in previous years and the way it is addressed is either by resource elsewhere within the HSE or by Supplementary Estimates by the Oireachtas.

Since the 2013 amendments to the legislation, the hospitals can bill privately for all beds that patients are treated in.  Prior to that it was only for beds that were designated and there was a process under the 1991 Health (Amendment) Act for that.  In reality, the hospital is not in significant control of the income it receives.  It is based on an election under the Health Act 1970 by an individual citizen, not the hospital.  It is not a pressure on the hospital at the front door.

That skews the data when we are looking at the public-private mix and equally around our income generation.  That happens every day throughout the system.

To answer the Deputy's question, there are stretched targets which are not being achieved, but we are not reducing the level of service to public patients because of it.

There is a single queue process within the entire system.  The cohort mentioned by the Deputy accounts for 20% of total activity, the limit allowed within the contract.  If one looks across the system, it is spread by hospital in small quantums across the full service.  As far as I am aware, there is no question of an individual hospital seeking to attract more elective patients to derive income.  The key challenge when it comes to elective surgery is presented by access to theatres, theatre nursing staffing levels and the volume of surgeons.  Taking orthopaedics as an example, up until recently there were five orthopaedic surgeons - there are now four - delivering the service in the Limerick area which has a population of 380,000.  The new norm in the United Kingdom is an orthopaedic surgeon per 15,000 of the population.  The key challenge is ensuring volume.  What is controlling the volume of elective work is the increasing number of patients in clinical need coming through emergency departments who need to access to a public hospital bed space.  My response to the Deputy's question about whether potential funding or the payment arrangements for hospitals are skewed is that it is not visible in the data.  Also, hospitals do not actively seek to do it.  Fundamentally, the main concern which I am sure will be reiterated by the representative associations is access to theatre time for surgeons and to bed stock for physicians.  That is the critical ingredient for us.  The points made in the Sl&aacute;intecare report about the need for investment in primary community care services are pivotal in having a flowing hospital system.  That is the biggest constraint.  I can assure the committee that the 20% of patients who do not come through emergency departments and are not maternity patients are widely distributed and that there is no sense that patients are being actively sought by hospitals in any way that is different from clinical prioritisation.<\/p> <p>  On whether there has ever been a breach of contract and consultants have been challenged in that regard, the answer is yes.  Obviously, this is a matter for the employer and the employee, but there have been such breaches.  By way of example, members may have heard on radio the day after the \"Prime Time\" programme was shown a consultant from the Mater hospital talking about the normal process there.  It includes the receipt of a monthly report, on which there is dialogue.  If there is a significant variance, there is discussion about it.  There have been such instances.  <\/p> <p>  On whether we are compromised by the court case, factors such as the court case and bed designations do not negate the potential and requirement for the HSE to manage the consultant contract like any other employment contract.  It is our duty - it is also the duty of voluntary hospitals - to manage the contract as written and signed and that is what we are doing.  There is no sense of contract management being compromised at a local level because of some of these are national issues.  Is there a cosy relationship?  I suspect there is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":771,"content":"<p>For the record, I asked questions as opposed to making statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#G00400","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513155600,"counter":772,"content":"<p>I know.  The answer to the Deputy's question is not to my knowledge.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly asked about stretched targets, an issue we have discussed.  There was also a reference to the general culture and there being an \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" culture.  That is not my impression based on my interactions with consultants.  By and large, as referenced by the Deputy, taking into account on-call duties, as well as the basic 39 hours, the majority of consultants are working a lot more hours than they have been contracted for.  There are arrangements in place covering on-call duties.  I spoke recently to a cardiologist who spent a significant amount of time in the cath lab doing international work in addition to her basic hours.  It is not unusual for that to be the case.<\/p> <p>  On the point about national data, for admitting consultants, there are data available for patient administration systems.  The information is classified as between public and private patients at the point of admission.  This system is in place in every hospital.  Above it, as referenced in section 20 of the consultant's contract, there is the hospital inpatient enquiry system which provides for a clinical classification of work.  It is basically the same information from the patient administration system summarised nationally.  The data are visible locally and nationally, as is the case in the patient administration system.  Neither of the systems was specifically designed to be a contract management system.  Therefore, for non-admitting consultants, it does not tell us anything about their practice.  For example, for anaesthetists, radiologists and laboratory personnel, the contract requires separate processes to be in place locally using local systems.  For contract holders, of whom there are 364, there is a requirement to look at bed designations in hospitals, pre-dating the 2013 Act, in terms of their use as a proxy for a volume of allowable private work.  There are data within each hospital that show the volume of work that is public and that is private.   As I said, the HSE does not know what a consultant receives by way of income from health insurers.  There is no basis for it to know that information, but we do know what the volumes of work are.  The Deputy's question about whether there is potential to streamline some of the data is interesting.  <\/p> <p>  On the hospital inpatient enquiry system, HIPE, the contract requires us to look at complexity, as well as case volume, such that if a consultant is engaged in a highly intense case which may have a complexity rating of five but a volume rating of one, that is what we have to count in the contract.  It requires us to do what is already happening, the coding of all cases in accordance with the ICD-10 coding system.  That system is perhaps one at which we could look as a further enhancement to provide information at a group and hospital level and nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":773,"content":"<p>Deputy Billy Kelleher asked about the functions of clinical directors.

We do not have a private hospital and we do not have co-location; therefore, it is quite seamless and we know where doctors are working.  We do not have to be concerned about people being off-site or working for 13 hours a week.  The clinical directors look at the HIPE data.  They meet individuals but there is a balancing act for us as an executive team.  If we enforce the rules too tightly, people will leave the service and leave us with a situation where our service disimproves because a person has resigned or left the system.  I mentioned Croom Hospital earlier.  We have five orthopaedic consultants in the region, serving 380,000 patients.  They do not just work in Croom elective hospital.  They provide a five-day fracture clinic for me at a UL Hospitals, ULH, site, and 100 patients a day could attend those clinics.  They also provide a seven-day trauma service.  These people work for extensive hours across the sites and when the public-private mix changes or moves, those people are met and spoken to.  I assure the public service and my colleagues in the Oireachtas and at this committee that we have a process in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Colette Cowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":777,"content":"<p>Ms Cowan references an important point.

We work closely with the consultant body and they are anxious that we improve the number of consultants providing a service because they are overwhelmed with the workload.

We have a common waiting list.  People are put on the list chronologically and that is observed and monitored on a monthly basis.  We report to Mr. Liam Woods on it.<\/p> <p>  There is an opportunity to look at contracts to attract good consultants to work in this country.  Of my five orthopaedic consultants, two are on the Buckley contract, which does not compel them to have a certain public-private ratio.  We dedesignated the beds in Croom Hospital under the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 which, in effect, created a gap for us around monitoring the public-private mix.  We put a performance metric on it to ensure that we stayed around 35%, to ensure that the beds would not be overused for private patients but those consultants are within the contract.  I have failed them under the 2008 contract because I did not provide co-location.  We do not have that co-located hospital that other centres may have in Dublin.  We are unique in the region but I am assured that my consultants work across the six sites.  I know where they are and that many of them work over and above requirements.  When the Deputy mentioned \"Prime Time\" and asked if we saw it and knew about it, we were well aware that this would air.  We had answered freedom of information, FOI, inquiries for weeks.  The result of that investigation, while it is important that the public is aware and assured, was great distress to my 139 consultants who work in UL Hospitals Group, whom we met to try to reassure that it was a small cohort of people that we had to manage.

We continue to attract consultants within the acute system, which is the majority, including 2,700 of approximately 3,200 consultants in the whole system.  We have approximately 60 more this year but it has become more challenging.  What we are fundamentally after when we take on highly specialised clinicians normally returning from overseas is for them to have access to the facilities they need to do the work they can do.  If we bring in interventional radiologists and neuroradiologists, we need to have spaces for them to operate in.  That is challenging.  We will need to invest in capital to support the growth in that service, which is in demand.  There has been a small but not insignificant trend of movement from the public system to being entirely in the private system and outside the public environment.  I met some young, recently-appointed consultants to assess their view of operating in the system as they have experienced it over the last two or three years.  It would be fair to reflect that their main frustration is access to beds and facilities.  Sadly, one of those then moved to the private system.  There is a challenge for us.  The Sl&aacute;intecare agenda will be very supportive in addressing that because it will free up the flow and allow better use of the current space and hopefully additional space in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":780,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Woods.  I have a few comments.  As I am from the same part of the country as Ms Cowan, I understand the difficulties involved in the mid-west.  Most consultants that I am aware of work extremely hard.  They work in excess of their hours, as Ms Cowan has said, and give service way over their contract requirements.  The issue raised on the programme is that there is a cohort of consultants who do not fulfil their contracts.  I know there is deep frustration among consultants who work hard that this is the case.  If we come back to the programme, I think the frustration among the public is that one has to wait an inordinate length of time to get into the system.  One's outpatient appointment may be six, 12 or 18 months away, before one's need is assessed.  Once one's need is assessed, one would hope that the treatment is based on need.  Many patients feel that if they go privately to see a consultant, they will skip that initial six, 12 or 18-month delay and will have their need assessed by a consultant.  They may then be admitted to a hospital in a public bed but will pay the consultant privately or they may come in through the public system and be a completely public patient.  That queue-jumping is a frustration people have.  There is a fast track.  If one goes privately, one may then be treated more quickly as a public patient or maybe as a private patient.  I have come across places where people have come into an emergency department, said they wish to be a public patient and yet end up being treated as a private patient because they have inadvertently signed a form when they did not have full knowledge of what they were signing for.  They then realise that the insurance company has been billed a substantial amount for what they thought was public care.<\/p> <p>  The frustration is that the public-private mix is not working.  As Mr. Woods and Ms Cody have referred to, the Sl&aacute;intecare report attempts to untangle private care in public hospitals.  There is a difficulty if that drives some of our consultants out of the public system and out of the country because their income will be limited if they are purely public consultants.  The delegates might address and keep in mind some of those issues.  I call Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony who will be followed by Deputy Bernard J. Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#H00600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":781,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates.

I do not know how it could have taken place.  At this committee we have raised on numerous occasions the snags that interrupt the free flow of patients through the public hospital system and nobody ever seems to be able to tell us the answers clearly.<\/p> <p>  My first question is to what extent was it visible that there was a delay.  Was a cause given for that delay in respect of public patients going through the hospitals concerned?  If this was not visible, what is the reason?  What was the role of the clinical directors?  Were they on the site or did they occasionally come on the site?  I know reference has been made to the fact they have several responsibilities.  However, there must be some means of ensuring responsibilities in a particular hospital were of a nature that would clearly identify any issues that needed to be dealt with, given that public moneys are involved.  As the Chairman knows, I have mentioned before that if we had regional authorities on-site, it would eliminate much of this and there would be local senior administration, which in turn would have to account for any snags in the system.<\/p> <p>  Was this matter brought to the attention of anybody in management before the RT&Eacute; programme was broadcast?  Could we know if it was?  If it was not brought to the attention of management, what was the reason?  Surely there must be some supervisory system within the structures of the Health Service Executive, HSE, particularly at a time when we had shortfalls and over-runs of expenditure in a number years.  We were particularly stressed by the extent to which waiting lists and overcrowding took place.  Did any of that set off alarm bells in any quarter?  Was an audit ever done?  We mentioned this before and Deputy Billy Kelleher correctly indicated that any teenager with a clipboard could figure out what was going wrong in a very short and simple time.  We have asked the question again and again and nobody seems to be able to identify precisely what the problems are in the process.  For example, if somebody is off-site for most of the week and spends one day in the public hospital, what would be the deficit in terms of availability for public health services?  What would happen and would anybody ask questions as to where the person might be?  Have the financial controllers a role in this area as well and do they accept reports?  Has anybody made a report, even before the RT&Eacute; programme?  What was done on foot of any such report?  Was it brought to the attention of authorities in different hospitals?<\/p> <p>  I am not blaming anybody but the job of this committee is to find out the facts.  It was very embarrassing to find that it took RT&Eacute; - fair dues to it and those involved did the job - to get to the bottom of some of the questions we were asking and to which we could not get answers.  It raises a very serious question as to the degree to which we can effectively carry out the job we are trying to do.  The people in hospitals are also trying to do a job.  It is very important with respect to the morale of staff who give their time fully and freely in committing to the public sector.  It is very off-putting for them to find out that a large proportion of people in some areas are off-site, doing other work, but at the same time they are on-site doing private work.<\/p> <p>  I have one or two other questions.  Do the clinical directors practice?  Have they a conflict of interest by virtue of the fact that they do practice?  Do they manage practice in such a way as to give themselves an advantage while disadvantaging patients and the public health system?  Have excuses or reasons been put forward as to why they should be off-site when they are supposed to be on-site in public hospitals?  I have a number of other questions and I can come back with them if it is possible.

The Chairman raised questions about outpatient services and points about eligibility.  It is correct to say the waiting times in many specialties to access outpatient consultations are too long.  There is work ongoing in the acute division of the HSE to create new models of care to accelerate the rate of outpatient referral and do more work with GPs and other services in the community under revised models of care; that would provide more care in the community.  We can consider individual specialties like urology and we know 35% of patients coming in need to see a urologist but the balance could be managed in some other way.  We must move to those new ways of doing care.  The Chairman's query about eligibility is more a legal policy question.  The Chairman asked if it is feasible to see a consultant privately and come into a public list.  When a patient arrives in hospital, he or she can choose whether to be public or private, and that is not a choice we make.  The Chairman clearly understands that.  That is not within the control of the HSE or the clinician.  The Chairman was referring to a policy issue.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman also asked about a patient presenting as a public patient in the accident and emergency department but finding subsequently that a billing took place, with an insurance company paying the bill on the person's behalf.  That should not happen without prior consent and the patient would, in effect, have to waive entitlements under the 1970 Act to be public.  If that did or is happening, it is not appropriate.  It is our role to ensure that is reviewed and does not happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":786,"content":"<p>Sometimes the patient declines to become a private patient or invoke private insurance.

The patient must knowingly declare that he or she wishes to negate the public entitlement.  That is required in law and we are very clear about that.  If anything else is happening, that is a concern.  It is something we looked at before and a concern was raised with us by the Department of Health some years ago that there should be no undue pressure put on patients in public hospitals to declare themselves private because they have insurance.  We do not want that and we do not seek it.  It is something we must keep on top of.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony asked why it took an RT&Eacute; programme to bring this matter to a head.  The HSE is well aware of the problem of long waiting times.  We worked with RT&Eacute; for up to two years on the provision of information and we are very aware of the kind of information being made available to the programme.  The Deputy's underlying point regards the awareness that a significant number of people are waiting longer than we would like for procedures.<\/p><p>We are aware of it.  The NTPF data which come from the HSE systems and are published monthly show that is the case.  Our response in the current year and as we move into 2018 is to seek to grow further.  I will come to the Deputy's point about the NTPF, but the specialties of ophthalmology and orthopaedics were referenced.  They are two of four or five specialties in which there is a significant number of patients who have been waiting a long time.  We will seek to grow capacity in these specialties in 2018.  To support this work, we are considering some specific proposals in the mid-west.  For example, in Nenagh proposals have been put forward regarding cataract procedures, as others were elsewhere in the country which we are considering.  Our response is to seek to provide the service, as well as an additional service because it is the true constriction.<\/p><p> As regards the robust measures mentioned by Deputy Bernard J. Durkan, I get the sense that members believe, as I do, that consultants who are outliers in terms of contract compliance need to be actively managed under the contract to be brought back into line with ratios that are appropriate at a local level and that the processes at hospital level, with the clinical director and hospital management, therefore need to be robust enough to know that we are dealing with the outliers.  The point was made by Deputy Louise O'Reilly and those involved in the programme at the start that the vast majority of consultants complied with and potentially exceeded their contractual obligations.  Therefore, there is a strong duty on us to ensure that where there is non-compliance, it is reviewed and amended and that there will be processes in place to achieve this.  I assure the committee that we are fully aware of our duties in that regard.<\/p><p> As regards temporary contract locum posts, it is the clear preference of hospitals and hospital groups to have permanently appointed consultants.  The key point in terms of the temporary posts, an issue that has previously been discussed at the committee, concerns post holders on the specialist register whom we are not developing such that they will be declared competent to work in the specialty in which they are operating.  We are working to review consultants in posts but not on the register.  That is a matter we have addressed here previously and on which we would happily bring back further information.  It is not unique to the acute system.<\/p><p> Deputy Margaret Murphy-O'Mahony asked whether there was a conflict between NTPF funding and consultants' public contract.  If I understand the question correctly, it concerns whether work we contract or which the NTPF buys in another environment for patients in public hospitals who have been waiting a long time is at odds with the consultants' public contract.  The NTPF has a rule that when it contracts care in a private facility, it does not contract with the consultant on whose list the patient has been waiting.  The NTPF's role relates directly to private hospitals in the country.  Where feasible, we have worked with it to do additional work within the public system this year and that is within the current incentive set.  We are providing more support and capacity to allow additional work to be done.  The work the NTPF contracts directly is done in private hospitals.  It tenders and contracts for that work as a separate organisation and does not------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":789,"content":"<p>It is entirely separate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#K00200","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513155600,"counter":790,"content":"<p>It is separate from the HSE, but we work jointly with the NTPF because the identification and movement of patients are matters for hospitals and clinicians locally, as is the safe return of patients, where relevant.

In my experience, the management system in the HSE is akin to a revolving door.  I have spoken previously about a particular hospital in which there have been ten managers over a period of 18 years.  When a manager becomes aware of a practice that is not appropriate and he or she moves to another job, it becomes the job of the new manager to take over the process.  Do we have continuity in monitoring in HSE hospitals?  In my experience, we have a revolving door in terms of responsibility in hospital administration in monitoring because staff are continually moving to other jobs.  Has an analysis been undertaken of the average length of time spent at senior management level in HSE administration?  The huge turnover of senior management staff in HSE hospitals is an issue that has not been looked at.  As a result, other issues are falling through the cracks.<\/p> <p>  My second question is for the departmental officials.  I am open to correction, but as I understand it, under the previous category B contract, consultants were required to work 11 three-hour sessions but under the current contract, they are required to work 39 hours and that where there are three or four consultants assigned to a particular department, each will be on-call on a one-in-three or one-in-four basis.  In an area such as dermatology it is unlikely that a consultant would be called in as often as a consultant in the areas of cardiac, orthopaedic or maternity care.  Perhaps the officials might provide data for the levels of on-call activity of consultants outside the 39-hour contract.  We have a problem in recruiting consultants, particularly in small hospitals, because they are required to work 39 hours and be on-call on a one-in-three or one-in-four basis, including at weekends.  <\/p> <p>  On admissions through emergency departments, I have heard consultants say their names have been recorded on the charts of private patients on admittance through the emergency department, even though they have never seen the patients.  What is the policy in that regard?  As I said, I have heard consultants say they do not know when a patient is admitted as a private patient and that it is often done in order that the hospital can charge private fees for a hospital bed.  What are the rules in that regard?  Is it the case that emergency departments automatically admit people as private patients?  I have come across cases of people who have been admitted to a ward as the private patient of a consultant without that consultant having been made so aware.  It is not that the consultants are claiming for the treatment of these patients but rather the hospitals claiming fees for the use of the hospital beds.<\/p> <p>  My final question is related to the many challenges we face in the health care sector.  What percentage of elective surgery work is done in the private sector, on which we are so reliant because of the lack of access to the public sector?  As mentioned by Mr. Woods, consultants who are looking for jobs want access to beds for patients, access to theatres and sufficient support staff.  For example, a hospital might have ample theatre space and support staff but be unable to improve on the level of operation throughput because of the lack of intensive care beds.  This is one area in which we face challenges.  We are also experiencing problems in recruiting because consultants are choosing to work in facilities in which there is greater backup support and thus the opportunity to do more work.  <\/p> <p>  They are some of the issues I have heard being raised by medical practitioners.<\/p><p>This has come back to me through general practitioners, GPs, too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#L00900","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":824,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  I saw most of it before I came in.  Having watched the \"Prime Time\" programme, I think we are all shocked and disappointed but not really surprised.  Two groups of people stood out for me.  Those were people who did not have private medical insurance who knew they would be waiting longer and there were reasons that they would be waiting for longer.  I assume it caused much more stress to that group of people.  The second group of people who stood out to me were those consultants who actually work in the hospitals and who do a great job.  I have been treated by consultants in University Hospital Limerick myself.  I believe they fill in the gaps in some areas where other consultants are not available.  I was particularly concerned that Croom Hospital was mentioned and that some 53% of patients were being treated through the private system.  The programme referred to one particular patient, Mary Comber, from Limerick.  That lady was on the waiting list for eye surgery for two years in University Hospital Limerick and having waited for as long as she could with her eyesight degrading, she ended up paying &euro;1,800 for an operation on one eye in the same hospital, under the same private system, and only had to wait for two months for that.  That is a crystal-clear example of the problem we have with consultants not doing work, with private patients and with people waiting for too long.<\/p> <p>  I have a small number of questions, mostly for Ms Cowan, as she was probably expecting.  The \"Prime Time\" programme also said that one consultant - I am not sure where that consultant was based - was doing just 13 hours of a 39-hour contract.  That is 33% of the time that consultant was contracted to work.  Will Ms Cowan confirm that no consultant who is paid to work with public patients in the UL Hospitals Group is working that little?  Is there any consultant who is working for less than 50% of his or her contracted hours?  I do not expect everyone to work for 39 hours every week.  Mr. Woods referred to a monthly report.  Ms Cowan stated she does it in University Hospital Limerick.  Is that conducted every month?  Arising from such a review, has she ever gone to a consultant who did not do his or her hours and tried to recoup money back from the consultant for not doing his or her hours?  If Ms Cowan has recouped money, will she tell us how much she has recouped and if she has not recouped money, will she explain why she cannot or has not done that?  If she does not have the figures to hand, she might send them on to us, and if she does, how much money does University Hospital Limerick spend annually on private consultants?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#M00200","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513155600,"counter":825,"content":"<p>I will answer Senator Colm Burke's questions first.  The notion raised with us and with which I substantially agree is that there is a fair amount of movement in hospital management.  It is clearly evidenced in management literature that stable leadership is a key component of progressing anything organisationally.  There is no question that the Senator's contention that one needs stable management over a long time is important.  It is also true that there has been quite a degree of movement.  I think the Senator is asking if we have looked at that or where the HSE going with that.  On the HR side, we have looked at age cohorts.  On the management and administration level, particularly in more senior grades, as many people left in or since 2010, there has been a lot of movement relating to the exit arrangements in place at that time and since by way of the age pyramid operating in management and administration in the HSE.  The director general has been leading out on this directly.  We recently put in, with HR doing the detailed work, a leadership academy, in effect, within the HSE, to consistently develop leadership.  In the NHS, there is a Nye Bevan institute, which is designed for that purpose, to develop consistent leadership approaches which build the right value sets and good experience with operational management and process management, with a strong focus on care and compassion.  That happened last year and this year and is important for the future.  Some of these posts are promotional.  One may find somebody moving from a smaller hospital to a larger hospital because of a promotion or because it is closer to home.  My broad experience of working in the acute system is that people broadly seek to return to where they come from, which can also cause movement.  It affects our clinical recruitment and I accept that it is a big issue.<\/p> <p>  I accept the point that admission through an emergency department to a ward without the admitting team or consultant knowing should not happen.  On the designation of the patient as private as additional to that, I accept that would be a concern for the consultant because he or she may be over-reported as doing private work or have private work happen to him or her.  There is evidence, when I look at our national level data and try to compare it locally, of cases where people come in and are recorded as private but are then not billed as private because they have indicated that they do not wish to be.

We do not know the volume.  A point was made about intensive care unit, ICU, capacity in the public system which is a critical capacity deficit for us.  We invested a little in Cork in the last year.  We are doing a little more this year in the Mater hospital.  Our national lead for that area, Dr. Michael Power, has indicated clearly and strongly that we should invest.  The contention that this can be a restriction on surgical activity within the acute system generally is entirely correct.  It is a critical area for us, as it is in the event of any mass casualty incident or any such thing.  That is an area for which we will continue to pursue investment.  To be helpful, the Health Insurance Authority publishes information on total numbers of patients treated and the total amounts of money paid by the insured population for their insurance, which is approximately &euro;2.5 billion.  The acute system, publicly, costs approximately &euro;5.3 billion.  I do not know more about the activity than that.  I agree about the point on the ICU capacity.  There were a couple of questions specific to Limerick.  One was about Croom Hospital.

We have a unique system where all our patients are treated on the sites of the six hospitals because we do not have a private hospital in the region to monitor.  I can supply the Deputy with the consultant contracts.  I think his question was how many consultants are private consultants.  Most of my consultants are category B consultants.  In effect, they work in the public hospital system and may do some off-site work for outpatients.  While a very small number were there pre-2008, the majority are on 2008 contracts.  I will share that with the Deputy, if that is helpful, in the coming days.  He also asked about monthly reports.  We take our data from the hospital in-patient enquiry, HIPE, system and it is reviewed on a monthly basis.  Those reports are aggregated and looked at.  They are not only site-specific but are across the hospital group.  As we reconfigured in 2009, all of my consultants work cross-site through the system.

There was a reference to perverse incentives.  Mr. Woods has already stated this but I will reinforce it by saying it is absolutely not the case that the generation of income should take precedence over ensuring access for public patients in the public health system.  I will refer to the rationale for the Health (Amendment) Act 2013.  In 2010, the Comptroller and Auditor General identified that for 50% of private patients, no private in-patient charge applied because they were accommodated in either a designated public bed or a non-designated bed.  The inability under the law to collect a private in-patient charge in such instances represented a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and taxpayers and represented an indirect subsidy to private health insurance companies.  The Health (Amendment) Act 2013 was implemented to address the issue identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General and provided for the charging of all private patients in public hospitals irrespective of the type of accommodation used.  Patient choice still applies to whether one is treated on a public or private basis.  That Act came into effect in 2014 and the Department carried out analysis earlier in the year on trends in public-private patient activity in the acute hospitals.  The conclusion was that while overall hospital activity continues to increase on an annual basis, the proportion of patients treated privately remains very stable.  We both referenced that in our opening statements.  The new charging regime introduced in 2014 has not had an effect on the public-private mix.<\/p> <p>  There is definitely no cosiness in the court cases that are coming up with regard to that.  The Government has made quite clear it is contesting those cases.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly asked about the broader issues on the Health (Amendment) Act.  In his opening statement, although he did not get to read it all, Mr. Woods addressed some of the issues of the effects of the designation particularly in the context of those who are still on the 1997 contract.  Issues around the monitoring of off-site private practice were mentioned.  They are some of the issues with which we are engaging.  That was raised initially earlier in the summer and we are responding to proposals made by the HSE in September, which predated the \"Prime Time\" programme.

The frequency of call depends on the size of the team.  Cardiology was referred to.  If there is a team of five cardiologists, for example, in those circumstances one's frequency of call would typically be one in five.  One of the challenges, which was referred to earlier, is that in many smaller hospitals, the number of people on a team is quite small so because of that the frequency of call is very significant.  That does not get captured as part of the 39 hours.  It is accepted as a requirement over and above it.  It means if one is in an area where one could be called in, as Mr. Woods mentioned with regard to cardiology, one could find oneself frequently having to come back to the hospital overnight and then do one's day's work.  It comes back to the number of consultants we have and the distribution of those consultants.  It is well understood and accepted that we have fewer consultants than corresponding OECD countries.  We are well down on the number of consultants per head of population.  One of the objectives for us is to grow the number of consultants we have rather than rely on junior doctors, which has been a feature.  The on-call arrangements are specified by site.  It is a contentious issue.  When I worked in St. James's Hospital, when we changed to the specialty-take model, one concern was the frequency of call would increase for some people, which means they are up overnight and back in the next morning.  The broad terms are prescribed by the contracts and the specifics are site-specific, depending on the number of people in individual teams and whether one works in a clinical directorate.  It is fair to say that when consultants are on call, they are expected to take calls from junior doctors and to come in and do post-take ward rounds.

We are happy to engage with the committee on the content of that particular programme.  However, at the outset, it is important that we advise the committee that litigation is currently before the courts in relation to the failure by the Government and the HSE to implement contractual pay increases to consultants.  Having taken legal advice on the matter we will be unable to comment on the issues or matters before the courts.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the issues which the committee wishes to discuss we highlight the following points.  The committee will be very much aware that there is no single uniform consultant contract.  Currently, there are seven clinical consultant contracts held by active working consultants.  The earlier arrangements dating from 1991 and 1997, respectively, are still held by several hundred consultants and allow those consultants to engage in off-site private practice with limits determined by the type of contract held.<\/p> <p>  Over 80% of consultants now hold a 2008 contract.  The 2008 contract was several years in the negotiating but also was predicated on co-located hospitals allowing consultants to provide care to patients in a co-located private hospital on public hospital campuses.  With a small number of exceptions, these facilities have not materialised.  That has presented a significant challenge for capacity in the public hospital system.  The contract types offered in 2008, A, B, B* and C, allowed for up to 30% of a consultant's time to be set aside for private practice depending on the contract that the consultant signed.  This in turn may have depended on the type of contract held by a consultant prior to signing the 2008 contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peadar Gilligan"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1513155600,"counter":853,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael Harty resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513155600,"counter":854,"content":"<p>The most commonly held contract is the 2008 type B contract which is held by over half of consultants.  If a consultant who currently holds a type B contract held a contract prior to signing the type B contract in 2008, that consultant will have the right to off-site private practice, and may also spend up to 30% of his or her time engaged in private practice in facilities operated by the employer.  If the consultant, who now has a type B contract, did not hold a contract prior to 2008, he or she has a right to devote 20% of his or her time to private practice in facilities operated by the employer.  It is worth noting too that if an employer cannot provide a type B consultant with facilities on the hospital campus for outpatient private practice &ldquo;the employer shall make provision for such facilities off-campus, on an interim basis, pending provision of on-campus facilities.&rdquo;  In many cases, such on-site facilities were not forthcoming.<\/p> <p>  As can be seen, the contractual landscape against which consultants operate is a complicated one.  The position of the IMO is clear: contracts must be upheld.  The \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme presented several extreme examples of alleged non-compliance with contractual obligations and suggested that this was representative of the practices of \"a significant minority\" of consultants.  It is worth remembering that there are approximately 3,000 consultants in the system, suggesting that the apparent actions of a very small number of consultants is in anyway representative of the group, as a whole, is simply not tenable.  Indeed, we note that both the Minister and the HSE, in responding to the programme, accepted that the overwhelming majority of consultants worked beyond their contractual commitment.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the mix of public and private patients in hospitals, while consultants have limited determination over who is admitted, we would point out that the Department of Health&rsquo;s own report on trends in public and private activity in public acute hospitals found that public patients accounted for approximately 83% of hospital discharges over the period 2012 to 2016.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is daily evidence that not only does the Government know that public hospitals are unable to provide timely care, but that it is willing to use public funds to pay the private sector to provide care that should be available in public hospitals, but is not, due to inadequate resourcing of the acute hospital system in Ireland.  This under-resourcing, which is the default position of the Government, results in ward bed closures, closed operating theatres, cancelled planned admissions and delayed emergency admissions, with the resultant patient hardship and staff being frustrated in their efforts to deliver timely optimal care.<\/p> <p>  Hospital management has, within the 2008 consultant contract, the ability to first notify a consultant if his or her private practice ratios are in breach of the public-private ratios set out in their contract, and to advise that these ratios must be met within six or nine months.  However, hospital management is in the invidious position of simultaneously having to advise consultants if they exceed their allowed private public ratio, while at the same time needing to maximise funding for the hospital received from private patients and their insurers.  Each year, the HSE sets each hospital a target for private practice income to be generated.  The HSE&rsquo;s very own service plan for 2016 requires that acute hospitals' private income receipts vary from the planned target by no more than 5%.  Approval was given by the HSE, and the Minister, to promote the generation and collection of private charges income.<\/p> <p>  Let us be clear, the inconvenient truth is that private practice in public hospitals helps to pay for the delivery of care to public patients.  Yet again due to the lack of capacity in the acute hospital system it is not uncommon for a public patient to be in a designated private bed due to clinical need which has income loss implications for the public hospital and in turn implications for funding of care in the hospital.  In excess of 44% of the population of Ireland hold private health insurance and as such can opt to be treated as a private patient in hospital.  Consultants cannot deny a patient an emergency admission to hospital because he or she holds private insurance and so the consultant's ability to control his or her public-private mix is challenged by the number of patients he or she admits on call as emergencies who elect to use private health insurance for that admission.  Typically consultants are unaware, and rightly so, that a patient under their care as an emergency admission is a private patient until such time as he or she is made aware of this by hospital management in order that the hospital can then bill the patient&rsquo;s insurer for his or her hospital stay and generate much needed funds.   <\/p> <p>  At present, we in the public health service are experiencing a recruitment crisis when it comes to consultants.  We simply do not have enough consultants and are struggling to recruit new highly trained colleagues into consultant posts.  The National Task Force on Medical Staffing from 2003 suggested that we would need 4,400 consultants to deliver specialist medical care today.  However, we have just over 3,000 approved consultant posts, of which 200 are filled on a temporary basis only, and an indeterminate number, approximately 400, are either vacant or otherwise filled on an unclear basis.  We are not recruiting consultants in sufficient numbers to deliver a specialist medical service or to meet required replacement rates.  In 2016, eight advertised consultant posts received no applicants; a further 22 posts received just one applicant and 21 posts received just two applicants. Overall, 66 advertised posts received five or fewer applicants.<\/p> <p>  Most damningly, perhaps, figures produced by the Public Appointments Service, which runs recruitment campaigns on behalf of the HSE, show it was &ldquo;unable to identify a suitable candidate&rdquo; for 22 of the 84 posts that were advertised in 2016.  If we propose to have a health service delivered by suitably qualified medical specialists this cannot be allowed to continue.  Using financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation and other devices health service management has driven down the pay of consultants.  We are not competitive internationally and the recruitment figures would suggest we have given up even trying to compete.  <\/p> <p>  With all due respect to the makers of the programme, to focus on the alleged actions of a tiny number of unidentified doctors is to miss the much larger point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peadar Gilligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":855,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Gilligan and call Dr. Ryan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#P00500","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513155600,"counter":856,"content":"<p>The Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, welcomes the opportunity to attend the committee's discussion on the recent \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme.  With regard to contractual obligations, the IHCA wishes to be absolutely clear that its consistent stance is that consultants must abide by the conditions of their employment as outlined in the various consultant contracts.  If consultants who do not fulfil their contractual hours, it must be clearly understood that any such consultants are not representative of the profession.<\/p><p>The agreed administrative procedures for dealing with such matters are clearly provided for in various consultant contracts.  The Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, is of the view that such matters should and must be addressed through the contract mechanism by hospital management.<\/p><p> In reality, the vast majority of consultants work well in excess of their contracted hours and this has been confirmed over the days since the programme was aired by the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and by Mr. Liam Woods, HSE national director of acute hospitals.  As a consequence of our commitment, in the past decade the IHCA and its members, in collaboration with health service management, have delivered significantly increased productivity in the acute hospital system at a time of extraordinary cuts to health sector funding.  It is worth considering that while acute hospital budgets were cut steeply compared with 2008, the total number of inpatient and day-case patients treated has increased by approximately 275,000, or by 22%.  In other words, consultants have been instrumental in dramatically increasing productivity in the health sector.  Over this same decade, when our population expanded by 12%, and the cohort aged 65 years and over increased by one third, the number of inpatient acute public hospital beds was reduced by more than 1,400.  The result is that our hospitals are almost continuously full with patients.  OECD data confirms that they operate at 95% occupancy, which is way above the OECD average of 77%.  The OECD average is recommended so as to prioritise consistent safe patient care and to guard against resistant and cross-infections.<\/p><p> As a direct result of the lack of hospital beds, the average hospital stay in Ireland, at 6.2 days, is much shorter than the OECD average of 8.2 days.  Ireland hospitalises far fewer patients - 139 per 1,000 - on an annual basis than the average OECD country of 169 people per 1,000 of population.  That is because of the overwhelming shortage of beds in Ireland.  Department of Health data confirms that hospital consultants make up less than 2.5% of the overall public health service work force, which contrasts with 4% in the National Health Service in the United Kingdom.  In Scotland, which is equivalent to our size and which has a population that is just 13% greater than Ireland&rsquo;s, there are more than 5,000 hospital consultants, compared with approximately 2,600 permanent consultants in post in Ireland.  There are significantly fewer hospital consultants in Ireland on a comparable population basis.<\/p><p> The association is emphatic that the paucity of hospital beds and the shortages of hospital consultants are the fundamental causes of waiting lists for patients in Ireland.  Department of Health data confirm that currently 80% of acute hospital admissions are emergencies and the volume of elective surgery performed in acute public hospitals has progressively declined over the past decade.  Accordingly, hospital admission in Ireland is increasingly only feasible for patients with emergency medical and surgical conditions due to the shortage of beds in our system.  This is exacerbated year-on-year because of demographic trends with our ageing society.  Against the backdrop of an under-resourced and understaffed public health system, the association continues to recommend to its members that they report to their relevant clinical director so that they can work in teams with their clinical colleagues to an agreed practice plan.  This is important to provide the best possible patient care during daytime hours and as part of organised on-call services at weekends.  The IHCA is strongly of the opinion that the vast majority of consultants work in accordance with an agreed practice plan and are more than fulfilling their contractual hours.<\/p><p> The 2008 contract delegated certain clinical governance roles in the acute hospitals and mental health services to clinical directors.  Frequently, however, clinical directors encounter significant difficulty in fulfilling their role, as they have not been provided with the necessary support staff and infrastructure.  It should be clearly understood that consultants who do not fulfil their contractual hours are not representative of the profession.  There are agreed administrative procedures for dealing with such matters, which are clearly outlined in the contract.  The IHCA is available to engage with hospital management, as necessary, on such matters.  With regard to the ratio of public and private patients in public hospitals, it was agreed in the 2008 contract that the ratio should not exceed 80:20, with a provision allowing some consultants a 70:30 ratio.  These ratio provisions were incorporated in the 2008 contract, with a clear reference to the Government policy of that time in 2008 that co-located private hospitals would be built on public hospital sites.  The Government policy committed to putting in place an additional 1,000 such co-located private hospital beds, and furthermore the 2008 contract explicitly permits hospital consultants to treat patients in co-located hospitals.  However, in 2011 the co-location policy was abandoned by the then Government, and as a result the additional 1,000 acute hospital beds in co-located private hospitals have not been commissioned.  The concomitant closure of a further 1,400 inpatient beds in our acute hospitals has clearly driven the waiting lists to their current levels.<\/p><p> Crucially, it is widely acknowledged that the methods used to measure public to private ratios are both inaccurate and unreliable.  This was identified as a problem in an independent management report commissioned by the HSE in 2007 during the contract negotiations.  In 2011, the IHCA and senior HSE management agreed that those serious flaws in the systems and methodology needed to be rectified, but that has not happened as yet.  The annual revenue from private patients in public hospitals amounts to more than &euro;600 million, or some 15% of the public acute hospital funding.  This may be higher in some hospitals.  The revenue private patients bring to the public hospital is an essential source of funding.  One should bear in mind that without this revenue our public hospitals would collapse.  Public acute hospitals could not deliver the current level of service to the public without this revenue, let alone hope to expand or improve the clinical service that we aspire to deliver to patients.<\/p><p> Health service management and consultants were blamed in a recent RT&Eacute; programme when the proportion of private patients admitted to public hospitals apparently exceeded 20%.  We know from Department of Health data that over 80% of patients admitted to acute hospitals are emergencies.  Given that more than 45% of the population holds private insurance, and more than 50% of patients in the over 40 age group hold such insurance, the proportion of private patients attending a public hospital may exceed 20% as a routine.  Under these circumstances, blaming hospitals and consultants whenever the ratio of private patients exceeds 20% is not a reasonable stance to adopt.  In effect, such hospitals are blamed for providing care to the cohort of patients who present for care, and which reflects the demographic composition and insurance status of the patients in their catchment area.  Neither consultants nor hospital management has any control over such matters.<\/p><p> The demand for patient care is increasing due to demographic factors.  A recent ESRI study projected a 37% increase in the need for inpatient and day-case capacity by 2030.  In real terms, this means our current 10,000 bed capacity must be increased to approximately 14,000 beds.  In contrast, there are growing public hospital capacity deficits due to the cumulative lack of investment in hospital infrastructure and equipment over the past decade.  This is the root cause of the unacceptable waiting lists in Irish health care.  It is a distraction from the reality of the effects of long-standing underfunding to blame hospitals and their consultants for current waiting lists when they are, in effect, being prevented from providing care.  With regard to elective waiting lists, patients should be treated exclusively based on clinical need.  Waiting lists are the norm in the hospital where I work and in the vast majority of other public hospitals.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":858,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for the presentations.  Representatives of the HSE and the Department attended a previous session this morning.  This emanated from an RT&Eacute; programme.  I assume the witnesses have seen it and are aware of its contents.  It is not just about that as the matter has been discussed at this committee for some time.  It concerns stretched budgets and the perverse incentivisation at the heart of the public hospital system, which has been referenced by Dr. Ryan.  More than &euro;600 million every year comes from treating private patients through the public hospital system.  It has been correctly pointed out that if that was not there, the public hospital system would collapse.<\/p><p>However, the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme focused on several issues that are of critical importance.  Both contributions referred to the 80:20 split provided for in consultant contracts, but what we are talking about goes beyond that.  The issue concerns the commitment of a small number of consultants who do not seem to be performing their full contractual duties.  We are not just addressing the 80:20 split across the system, but also individuals within that who are not performing their contractual obligations.  As referred to by Dr. Gilligan, there is also the bigger picture in terms of court cases on the broader issues.  However, we are just talking about the issues highlighted by \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\".<\/p><p> With that in mind, what is the process for bringing a case where a consultant is not performing their contractual obligations to the attention of the clinical director, the hospital manager or the HSE?  Is there a process?  Does someone pick up a phone and say that a certain consultant is not performing, since he or she is only doing 13 or 14 hours a week instead of 33 hours?  Is there a process in place?  Has there ever been a consultant who was disciplined because he or she did not perform his or her contractual obligations?<\/p><p> The reason I ask is that there are 685,000 people on waiting lists.  I can assure the delegates that I am not blaming any consultant, or the consultant bodies represented here.  Primarily a lack of capacity across the public health system, both in physical infrastructure and personnel, is the reason for the 685,000 people on waiting lists.  However, the delegates can understand that if one was among the 685,00 people on a waiting list, one would be extremely angry to think that a consultant was not carrying out his or her full public duties under his or her contractual obligations.  One would be extremely angry if one was waiting for a long period of time while at the same time we are sending people to Belfast for cataract operations and people are applying for treatment abroad schemes under the cross-border directive.  There is an obligation on everybody to ensure that there is as much fairness in the system as possible, accepting the limited capacity, and that all consultants fulfil their contractual obligations.<\/p><p> Both submissions referred to the issue of recruitment.  In all the manpower planning assessments over the years it is accepted that we are short of at least 2,000 consultants.  There are changing demographics and an increasing population to consider.  The situation is not going to improve in the short to medium term.  There will be high demand.  Reference was made to the fact that we cannot get suitable candidates for vacant posts.  In 2013, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association said that the type C contract would be able to attract consultants to posts if it was available more frequently.  It would improve the ability of the country to recruit.  Is that a factual situation, or is it an aspirational view on the part of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association or the Irish Medical Organisation?<\/p><p> That brings me on to the next question.  If we cannot recruit, we face huge difficulty in addressing the problems that are out there, including the 685,000 people we can identify who are on some form of waiting list, although there are probably more we cannot identify.  What do we need to do to attract consultants?  I assume that turning a blind eye to contractual obligations is not one of the solutions to the problem of retaining and attracting consultants.  In the witnesses' view, what would be required to attract consultants?  There is a remunerative element.  Let us be under no illusions.  I said this when the cuts were originally brought in.  We compete in an international environment.  We do not necessarily compete against Germany, France and the Nordic countries.  We compete primarily with English-speaking nations to retain our consultants.  That is the market that we are in.  I would like to get some views on what we need to do.<\/p><p> The role of clinical directors was also raised this morning.  They are paid an extra &euro;46,000.  Let us be honest, given the responsibility involved in being a clinical director, one can certainly argue that these remunerative arrangements are required.  However, the directors are meant to be at the heart of the delivery of health care, managing the organisation of consultants and the seamless flow through public hospital systems.  Is this role working in the way that was envisaged, that is, primarily to ensure consultants were involved in the management process and had a say in how hospitals worked?  Equally, it was intended that they would uphold their contractual obligations, and that through the clinical director there would be seamless interaction between the management and the clinicians.  They are actually overseeing the enforcement of the public-private partnership.<\/p><p> Reference was made to co-location.  Of course, that was a change of policy.  There was a policy until the election of 2011, and with many other proposals, it was changed fundamentally.  Some of those proposals have not happened, and will not happen because there have further changes.  However, the Sl&aacute;intecare report is the template that has now been accepted by the vast majority of people, although admittedly there are some deficiencies in it.  If we do not fund its proposals, it will be just like any other report that has been drafted.  It will remain on a shelf and will have no impact on patients and the health system in general.  Do the delegates accept that the Sl&aacute;intecare report's recommendations are the right way to go about addressing the challenges facing the public health system?  At the heart of the Sl&aacute;intecare report is a recommendation that we would disentangle the private from the public system.

There are bad apples in every walk of life, but everyone is not the same and all consultants are not like that.  Why did it take an RT&Eacute; programme to highlight the problems?

I might deal with Deputy Kate O'Connell's question about beds first.  <\/p> <p>  It is clear when one looks at the hospital system, with only 10,000 beds in it, that we do not have enough beds for the population.  We have about half the OECD average.  As an association, we compare the figure in Ireland to the OECD average.  What we are comparing in that regard is mediocre rather than the best solutions around Europe.  There is no attempt to achieve excellence here.  If we were to achieve excellence and have a superb health care system as in France, Germany or Holland, we would have almost double the number of beds.  As we have so few, hospitals are continuously full.  They are at 97% all the time.  Patients are discharged very quickly from hospital and there is no room to squeeze extra capacity out of existing hospitals.  Even with the absence of extra capacity, we are not hospitalising very many people in Ireland compared to other European countries.  We hospitalise approximately 25% less than the OECD average.  If we compare Ireland to Germany, France and the Netherlands, we hospitalise about 30% or 40% less.  <\/p> <p>  We do not have a particularly hospital-centric system.  However, we are stuck because the population is increasing and ageing.  The demographics show that increasing numbers of 60 and 70 year olds will drive the need for hospital care.  The ESRI stated recently that in the next decade we would need to increase hospital capacity by 37%.  If we have 10,000 hospital beds now, we will need an extra 3,500 to 4,000 by 2030.  That is the core problem in the health care system and it is what leads to waiting lists.  The lack of capacity makes it difficult for people to work in hospitals and makes them unattractive to consultants.  There is obviously a problem with remuneration, while there is a huge problem with capacity, particularly where surgeons are unable to gain access to theatres because there are not enough hospital beds, operating theatres and ICU beds.<\/p> <p>  What has to be accepted is that 50% of the population have private insurance in the 40 to 80 year old age group.  The reality in Ireland today is that there is a dual funding model health care system.  That is where we are.  The word \"perverse\" has been used about this model, but it is difficult to characterise the behaviour of 50% of the population as perverse.  That thought process is a problem.  If one accepts what the ESRI states about the need to increase hospital bed capacity by 37% and OECD comparisons which suggest we need even more hospital beds than that number, these matters were not recognised in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Consequently, it would drive health care costs significantly in the next decade if we were to provide for that hospital bed capacity.  It may very well be that the Sl&aacute;intecare report was under-costed.  There are problems with Sl&aacute;intecare in recognising that ours is actually a dual-funding model and recognising the need to increase capacity dramatically and somehow figure out how we will fund it in the next ten to 15 years.<\/p> <p>  All of this makes it difficult to recruit consultants as there are not enough facilities available.  It makes it particularly difficult for clinical directors who are the people who make everything hang together.  If the clinical director spends all of his or her time trying to patch a broken system, it is very difficult to hold him or her to account when things go wrong.  I have a great deal of sympathy for clinical directors, given the role they fulfil in Irish medicine in just trying to get things to work.  <\/p> <p>  I hope I have answered the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":866,"content":"<p>Perhaps I missed it, but did Dr. Ryan say whether it had been quantified how many consultants were acting outside the terms of the contract, either in a positive or a negative way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#S00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513155600,"counter":867,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked if there was a consequence.

Let us deal with the OECD data again.  A publication was highlighted in the media from 2016 which looked at outcomes in the health care system.  Importantly, we are all living longer and in the past ten or 15 years our life expectancy has increased by approximately five years.  The OECD commented that the Irish health care system seemed to be particularly good at dealing with life-threatening problems but had a problem in dealing with commonplace issues which generated waiting lists.  As such, the lack of capacity and consultants generates waiting lists.  There are very few consultants who are not working in excess of their contracted hours.  Those who work in excess of them manage to prop up the whole system, given that we have far fewer consultants than most other OECD countries.  As late as last week, there was another OECD document looking at the proportion of specialists in each country.  We have the lowest number of specialists in Ireland as a proportion of the overall number of doctors compared to every other OCED country.  Only 40% of doctors here are specialists, whereas 60% are generalists.

The Irish Medical Organisation is aware of consultants having regular meetings with their management to be advised as to their public-private ratio and their adherence to same.  It is worth repeating that 83% of patients seen in public hospitals are in fact public patients.  The Deputy made the point that public hospitals should be for public patients.  I put it to him that public hospitals should be for patients.  I thank the Deputy for acknowledging that primarily the issue for the system is the lack of capacity within it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to consultants fulfilling their contractual obligations, as per contract law all employees should fulfil their contractual obligations.  Equally, the employer has a role with regard to fulfilling its obligations under the contract.  On the Deputy's second question about recruitment and whether the offering of type C contracts would help in this regard, the reason we have a problem with recruitment to consultant posts in Ireland is that it is unfair.  By that I mean, since 2012 consultants appointed are remunerated at a lesser level than their pre-existing colleagues who are also paid at a lower level than their contracts stipulated.  For both of these reasons, we have a huge problem recruiting.  There is an issue of trust at senior doctor level with regard to their employer and the lack thereof because of the fact that the contract has not been honoured, the cuts superimposed on the failure to honour that contract and the disparity in payment depending on when the appointment was taken up.  Those issues need to be addressed in order that we can recruit to consultant posts.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the clinical director question and whether the role is working, my response is that the role can work and work very well.  We have seen examples of this throughout the country.  The challenge, as acknowledged and stated by our colleagues in the IHCA, is that this role is not supported to the extent it should be.  For example, they do not have the business managers that they need and they do not have support within the management structures of the hospital and as well as being clinically busy individuals, they also take on this management role.  The role needs to be more supported than is currently the case.<\/p> <p>  On Sl&aacute;intecare and the untangling of private and public care, as already stated just because a patient has private health insurance does not mean he or she should be disadvantaged.  Equally patients without it should not be disadvantaged.  To address this, we need adequate capacity within the system.  On a daily basis, as an emergency medicine consultant I am in the fortunate position that whether a patient is private or public makes no difference to me in terms of the care I deliver.  I deliver care on the basis of a patient's clinical need.  I would want a system that allows this to be the case.  Sadly, in that same role I see patients who are disadvantaged by the system and the under-resourcing of the system.  We know from a recent survey of in excess of 11,000 patients and their experience of the hospital system in Ireland that only 30% of them managed to get through the emergency department and into a ward bed within the six-hour limit that has been set.  That is a national disgrace.  Across the water in the NHS 95% of patients can expect to be either admitted or discharged from the emergency department within four hours.  The NHS also has capacity issues but not to the extent that we do.  It is a huge frustration to consultants and senior doctors in the system that we do not have the resources that we need to provide care in the way we would wish to provide it.  <\/p> <p>  On Deputy Kate O'Connell's questions, from the \"Prime Time\" programme we know that three doctors allegedly were behaving in a manner whereby they were not fulfilling their contracts.  As explained in our opening statement, there are different types of contracts.  There are doctors who are on part-time contracts and doctors who have rest entitlements given the onerous nature of their work.  We know of only three doctors who it is alleged were not fulfilling their contracts.  The experience of the IMO is that our consultant members are working well in excess of their contractual requirements.  We sometimes become aware of this because their employers are failing in their delivery of the entitlement of a consultant, for example, with regard to on-call work and entitlements with regard to rest relating to that.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony asked why it took an RT&Eacute; programme to highlight this issue.  With regard to the issue of, for example, a patient having to wait for a protracted period and having to make an out-of-pocket payment for the delivery of care, this is an issue of which, as doctors working in the Irish health system, we have been aware and by which we are disturbed in reality.  It should not be the case that because a patient does not have health insurance or is not in a position to pay for his or her care that such care is significantly delayed.  That patients with hip osteoarthritis, which is a very painful condition, are on waiting lists for two years should be a matter of national shame and should be addressed but this requires resourcing of the system.  The Deputy asked about temporary contracts as compared with full-time contracts and their implication for delivery of service.  There are excellent doctors employed as consultants on a temporary basis in the Irish system.  The challenge for them is that given the temporary nature of their contracts, they will largely concentrate on service delivery as opposed to the strategic development of their service, which is an absolute requirement to try to move things forward.  It is not a position in which most of those doctors wish to find themselves.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the conflict created by the National Treatment Purchase Fund in comparison with the public system, it has always been the IMO position that funding allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund should be used to provide for care in the public system.  We should not a situation whereby we are paying private institutions to provide care in the public system because of an under-resourcing of that system.  We would like to be in a position to provide that care to public patients within the public system and, as previously stated, to all patients.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked why such practices occur, on which our colleagues on the IHCA touched.  It is hugely frustrating for a consultant with many years of training, having made a huge personal and family sacrifice, to arrive at the level of expertise he or she is at and find themselves unable to access clinics and theatre space and time.  That frustration may sometimes be evidenced in the manner that we saw.  That should not be the case but it may sometimes be so evidenced.  We need to have a system wherein consultants are fully employed and have available to them the required operating theatres, outpatient clinics and beds to admit patients on the basis of clinical need.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peadar Gilligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":874,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Gilligan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#T00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":875,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their opening statements and I apologise for my coming and goings but I had to follow up on a number of matters.

There is no doubt about that.  The frustration generated by the \"Prime Time\" programme and shown by the committee and the public is that it seemed to indicate that public patients were disadvantaged because of some consultants not fulfilling their contract and in respect of the private-public mix in our hospitals.  There is a perception that if one has private health insurance, one may have an advantage in getting treatment more speedily in public hospitals.  All members know medicine is a very unpredictable profession.  Anything can walk through the door and there is no such thing as always or never.  Things change very rapidly and it is a very difficult discipline in which to work, in particular in accident and emergency departments, but it is an unpredictable profession throughout the system.  A time limit cannot be put on a doctor's work because things can go out of control and doctors quite often work to try to stabilise patients and deliver a proper service.  It is an unpredictable profession.<\/p> <p>  Whatever one may think of Sl&aacute;intecare, its purpose was to reform the health service and to make the system work.  It sends the health system in the right direction.  There are many moving parts and much sequencing and phasing involved.  There was an effort to cost what was being proposed and that is open to review.  However, the Sl&aacute;intecare proposal is that health care should be delivered based on need, not the ability to pay and that there should be a separation of public and private medicine in public hospitals.  I take heed of Mr. Gilligan's comment that a patient should be treated regardless whether he or she has insurance and Sl&aacute;intecare proposes that the provision of care in public hospitals should not be influenced by whether one has health insurance.  There are private hospitals that can supply elective private care but if one turns up to an emergency department it should not matter whether one is a public or private patient.<\/p> <p>  There have been zig-zag policy changes in the health service and we have moved from co-location and universal health insurance.  Sl&aacute;intecare proposes to clean the sheet and have a coherent ten-year plan for the health service and that is what we are trying to deliver.  The purpose of Sl&aacute;intecare is to ensure there is a ten-year plan whereby one can add year on year, know exactly what is happening and have multi-year rather than single-year budgets.

Long waiting lists are not new.  Ten years ago, people were waiting two, three, four or five years for hip operations.  I know that because I dealt with such people.

Is it a lack of theatre space throughout the system?  There are theatres in the country that have never been used.  I know of clean air theatres in one hospital that have never been used, despite being the most expensive and up to date in the world.  I cannot understand why we lack theatre space when it is possible to have theatre space readily available.<\/p><p>Some consultants have told us in meetings of similar committees that fewer hospital beds is the answer.  I do not agree with that but the question that arises is that although beds, corridors and waiting lists are full, is there space available in closed wards in some of our hospitals?

If it is not a priority, why not and how can it be done?<\/p><p>All members recognise the hugely important job and responsibility placed on all deliverers of health services and that, as the Chairman correctly stated, once a patient gets into the system, it works extremely well.  The problem is how to navigate the maze before the patient gets into the system.  Several years ago there was a concerted effort, of which consultants were at the forefront, to get rid of politicians who were allegedly clogging up the health system and creating problems.  It was said that it would be far better to get rid of those redneck politicians and have the system dealt with by the professionals.  The result of that was not as was anticipated.  The system has become considerably worse.  I made reference in passing to my previous proposals that the HSE as it is now constituted is not going to do the job and requires a regional structure, which we do not have.  Such regional structures must be made up of politicians and professionals and there must be accountability at local level such that everybody knows what is and is not happening.<\/p><p>My final question is to ask what percentage of the professionals interviewed for the RT&Eacute; programme were compliant with their contract?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#U00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":879,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Bernard J.

Durkan on the waiting list problem, yes it has been ongoing for several years.  However, it is becoming significantly worse and is a multi-factoral problem involving demographics, our ageing population and people living longer and the incidence of chronic disease.  Many patients are referred into the acute system because services in the community are so poor.  Some of those patients could be dealt with in the community, which would require funding of GP contract and other community services.<br\/><br\/>Additionally, the lack of consultant posts and our inability to recruit consultants will continue to have a detrimental and negative impact on waiting lists.  It is unsustainable to have increased demand and fewer and fewer doctors operating in the system.  We earlier touched on recruitment problems and I wish to make the additional point that the recruitment issue not only affects the current cohort of consultants but also our trainees and <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">non-consultant hospital doctor<\/font>s, NCHDs, who are looking at this and deciding to go away, not for training or fellowships as has been the case in the past and as our colleagues in the IHCA outlined, but permanently, with no plans to come back to work in the system.<br\/><br\/>Shortage of bed capacity is a fact.  We have lost 1,400 beds in our acute hospitals at a time when more beds are needed.  I have mentioned that GP services and the lack of community care facilities also contribute to the long waiting lists.<\/p><p>While people accepted that there was a waiting list problem, the idea was that we would try to sort out that problem.  Instead we have a situation where the population demographics have caught up with us and we have not sorted out the problem.  All the other issues that have happened in the health service have made it worse.  That is what is happening.<\/p><p> On the Chairman's comments on value for money, there are very few medical professionals working in the system and they provide value for money, given the work that they do.  People have accepted that consultants work over and above their contractual duties.  An IMO survey of its consultant members has shown that, on average, a consultant will work up to 20 additional hours per week.  It is not unusual and is in fact the norm to see consultants doing rounds on Saturdays and Sundays in hospitals.  The HSE hospital activity shows that private patients are not displacing public patients on waiting lists.  The waiting list issue is one of funding and capacity.  On the issue of theatres, it is all very well to have a physical room but if there are not staff and the resources to fund the staffing required for that room, the medical professionals and the bed or ICU bed that will be required for that patient afterwards, these physical rooms will not change anything.  The Chairman is right that wards were closed down and there are physical rooms and wards present.

Deputies Billy Kelleher and Kate O'Connell raised questions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>deference to consultants and what can be done to address the recruitment crisis.  On deference to consultants, in the past ten years in my position, I have never observed deference of the sort referred to.  I think the opposite has happened.  Certain aspects of the contract are not being adhered to by employers and, dare I say, by the State.  There are major issues, one of which is subject to a High Court hearing, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>the salary component.  Even aside from that, there are other aspects where consultants work half-days and full days on Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays when they are on call and it has taken the best part of a decade to get some hospitals to start to pay consultants in accordance with those working conditions and terms of their contract to the extent that we have consultants working eight or nine-hour days on Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays and not being paid in accordance with their contracts.  I know of no other employment in the State where that would happen and would have persisted for the best part of a decade.  That unfortunately feeds into the recruitment and retention crisis.<br\/><br\/>We have extremely mobile and highly-trained doctors, specialists who are in demand worldwide, even to the extent that 20% to 30% of graduation classes take up positions immediately after their internships in Australia, Canada etc.  They are now moving in big groups.  They are leaving a system that they see as being dysfunctional and leaving their senior colleagues without the basic resources to treat patients.  They say they will examine elsewhere and are unfortunately actually staying there in greater numbers than before.  They move from hospital to hospital and have very good career opportunities.  More importantly, they have the resources to treat their patients.  Two things are at play here, which are the lack of resources to treat patients and that contracts are not being honoured.  Remuneration, as it happens, is more attractive in other jurisdictions.<br\/><br\/>What can be done?  One basic and important thing is to honour agreements and contracts entered into with professionals.  The day an employer goes down the route of breaking a contract is when it crosses a line and nobody can trust that employer thereafter.  Unfortunately, in this case, people cannot trust the State and we are practically ten years past that breach.  The second important thing is to end the discrimination against new-entrant consultants.  They are on discriminatory salaries.  They do like-for-like work with their senior colleagues.  They are attracted abroad.  Some take up positions in public hospitals then leave and go back into the private sector or abroad.  Those are the two key components, together with, most importantly, providing them with the resources to do their work.  Doctors, surgeons and consultants get very frustrated if they cannot treat their patients.  Deputy Kelleher rightly asked about type C contracts and whether they are part of the solution.  They are part of the solution but not the full solution.  It relieves some of the frustration if one comes back into a position but has insufficient surgical operating time.  One is young, is capable and can do more, is used to operating three days a week and would like to do it in one's public hospital.  That person can do a certain amount in addition after completing his or her hours in a private hospital.  It can work effectively, especially if we have a scarcity of consultants, as we have.  Generally speaking, we have approximately half the number of consultants we need.  In some specialties, we only have one third of what we need.  It is only part of the solution.  I suggest we continue to use it but let us not rely on it being the full solution.<br\/><br\/>We surveyed our members about hours a number of years ago.  It is a little dated but the vast majority of consultants are working beyond their hours and the range, from memory, was between 5% and 50% above their hours.  I suspect it would be even higher if we surveyed them again today.  We are not counting in that the point that since the new contract came in, people are working structured, planned, half days and full days on Saturdays and Sundays when they are on call.<\/p><p>In the past the on-call status was solely to deal with emergencies, but it has now become practically a full day's work or a full weekend's work.  There is no other jurisdiction where doctors and consultants are providing that level of input and they have bigger teams and are fully resourced numbers wise.<\/p><p> I move to the issue of insufficient capacity.  The examples are country-wide.  In Galway the two orthopaedic theatres in Merlin Park hospital were closed repeatedly due to an influx of water into a clean air environment month after month for a period of years.  Inadequate resources prevent orthopaedic surgeons from operating.  There is, in effect, no elective work being done there and that will continue for months.  <\/p><p> In Limerick University Hospital until recently the isotope bone scanning equipment required to treat cancer patients was not working.  It has been replaced and the hospital is now waiting for a physicist to be appointed in order that it can be used.  The other major issue for consultants is rolling closures, whereby planned closures of theatres, as well as unexpected closures, take place owing to a lack of beds.  <\/p><p> When we surveyed our members two years ago, planned closures were running at the rate of 10% in Dublin hospitals and between 25% and 35% in hospitals nationally.  They were normal Monday to Friday working hours.  Why were they closed?  It was because of there being an insufficient number of beds.  Doctors and consultants were willing to carry out procedures.  We had an incident earlier this year in a major cancer hospital where on a Sunday evening 23 patients had procedures cancelled at approximately 8 p.m.  Some of them were repeat patients who had experienced previous cancellations.  The vast majority were cancer patients.  Again, cancellation was due to there being an insufficient numbers of beds.  The entire surgical team was available, but the cancellation happened at the last moment.<\/p><p> What we need is an investment plan for the health service similar to the one introduced for roads previously.  We need a clear, well funded plan to put in place an additional 4,000 acute hospital beds to allow us to treat patients on waiting lists and avoid ever-increasing numbers of patients on trolleys.  Looking at the figures in front of me, I note that most of the waiting list figures have doubled in the past three years or so.  The numbers of patients on trollies have more than doubled since they were declared to be a national emergency and a crisis.  The root cause of the problem is the lack of beds.  In the &euro;80 billion capital plan which is to be announced soon, if the health service is not provided for properly, the State will be condemning the population to an ever disimproving acute hospital service, not just for the decade 2018 to 2027 but for several decades to come.  If we do not act now in the face of an obvious escalating crisis, we will miss the opportunity.  I hope the State will put the necessary funding in place.<\/p><p> I was asked about the number of full-time private practice consultants.  We think it is in the region of 400 and increasing.  <\/p><p> Someone commented on the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the issue with which is that it is not a sustainable solution.  We need basic capacity in public hospitals.  While private hospitals can carry out more procedures, it is not the full solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#V01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Varley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":893,"content":"<p>For clarity, I was not suggesting necessarily that the C contract was the solution to the problem.

The Deputy is correct that there has been an increase from 2013 onwards in the number of applicants who have been recommended by the committee and approved by the HSE.  We should look at this issue in the full context.  In the NHS, throughout all of its jurisdictions, a consultant works his or her contracted hours and is free thereafter to practice privately as he or she wishes.  That is generally the practice worldwide.  We are unique in actually restricting consultants in practicing outside their contracted hours.  The key component is that consultants carry out their public contract hours and I hope they are given the resources to do so productively.  Some of the problems in the health service relate to the fact that they are not being given the resources they need to have a sufficient number of operating hours.  There has been somewhat of an increase in the number of type C applicants, but it has abated in recent times.  There was pent up demand from 2008 to 2013 and it has subsequently come at a more steady, reduced flow.  I do not see the numbers escalating significantly.  It will only happen where individuals can marry their public contracts with work off-site.  I do not have concerns in that regard and, in fact, consider it beneficial to the public at large if we have a shortage in a specialty, as we generally have, that once consultants have completed their work in public hospitals, they can work off-site privately.  In fact, their work off-site is clearly in addition and separate.  I see that private practice as separate from their work in public hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017121300002#W00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Varley"},{"type":"speech","time":1513155600,"counter":899,"content":"<p>Is there a health and safety issue?

For example, there is something as simple as the typing of letters, which can be much delayed in many hospitals because there is not the administrative support to the clinical team.  The result is the GP would not be aware of what has happened in the hospital because the letter would not be received.  It is just one area where the stripping away of staff in the context of cuts in the acute hospital system has had a very significant impact in clinical care provision and communication around that provision.

We recently surveyed our members and found that up to 60% were working up to 20 hours over the contractual commitments.  It was almost a perfect bell curve, with the contractual commitment on one end of the axis.  If the time would be captured, we would have to consider what to do with the details.

The Chairman mentioned the users of public transport services in his initial remarks.  The reason we are here is that it is often more potential than users.  I welcome the tripartite way this module has been set up, with the public transport operators coming in next, then the various responsible and regulatory bodies, followed by the committee's report to the Minister.  The committee is starting with the right people first.<\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity to present to the committee on behalf of the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI.  We all expect and live by consistency in our daily lives.  When we turn on the light in the morning it works, as does the kettle.  Similarly, when we go to the bus stop or train station, we expect them to arrive on time and to be able to bring us to our destinations.  I ask the members of the committee to think for a couple of seconds about the frustration that would build up if a person went to the bus stop or the train station to get to his or her place of work and, as he or she neared it, that person did not know whether he or she was going to be able to get on the train or bus.  That is the daily grind and the committee will hear a lot more about that this afternoon.<\/p><p>Ireland has a long-standing commitment to include people with disabilities fully.  Each and every member of this committee supports equality for people with disabilities.  However, people with disabilities need to experience this support in their efforts to have a reasonable quality of life.  They need to experience this in their day-to-day living.  We now have more than 643,000 people with disabilities in Ireland, 13.5% of the population.  That is up from just under 600,000 people in the previous census.  Public transport is what it is called and it needs to be for all of the public, including those who are part of this important demographic group.  An important point is that public transport is not an end in itself.  It is a vital connector of people to services and opportunities.  A person does not go on a journey just to go to the end and then turn back.  He or she goes on the journey to get someplace and to engage in some way or other.  Public transport has a huge role in promoting health and well-being as well as access to training and employment.  Those are just two critical areas but we can think of many others.<\/p><p>People with disabilities live in families and, thankfully, more and more are part of and want to stay in the community.  This is a very critical element.  Without accessible public transport, the person with a disability is being left outside and left behind.  The Government is committed in its Programme for a Partnership Government to the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  This has implications for transport.  The convention states in Article 9 on accessibility:<\/p><blockquote>To enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas. <\/blockquote> <p>That is important.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 emphasises the public sector duty where it states:<\/p><blockquote>A public body shall, in the performance of its functions, have regard to the need to:<br \/><br \/>[1.] eliminate discrimination,<br \/><br \/>[2.] promote equality of opportunity and treatment of its staff and the persons to whom it provides services, and<br \/><br \/>[3.] protect the human rights of its members, staff and the persons to whom it provides services.<\/blockquote> <p>In my time with the DFI I have had the privilege of engaging with hundreds of organisations dedicated to assisting people with disabilities and speaking to and hearing from people with disabilities.  All of these see the devastating effect poor access to public transport has on their own lives and the lives of the people with whom they work.  We can grasp non-accessibility fairly easily when it comes to someone using a wheelchair.  We can see the picture.  However, this is only one aspect of the issue.  Many people have less obvious mobility impairments, for example, people with restricted mobility, those who are deaf or hard of hearing, the blind and visually impaired, and, only now beginning to be recognised, those with sensitivities to the noise and intensity of the environment around them, often but not exclusively people on the autism spectrum.<\/p><p>We also need to look at those citizens who are living longer but lose capacity in a range of areas.  We might say that as we age, we slow down.  That is a point in life when people can lose their confidence and be compromised, particularly when the public services that they are facing do not understand, appreciate and respond to the situation that they are in.  It is incumbent on Government and society to look after all of our citizens.  If disability were associated only with a decline in advancing years, this would still be a serious and growing issue in Ireland.  However, that is not the case.  It is an issue for many people from birth right through the life cycle.  Public transport has a responsibility to make sure that people can have easy access to buses, trains and trams.  That is what I, the members of the DFI and the organisations and people here have and are continuing to work to achieve.<\/p><p>An interesting point for all Members of the D&aacute;il is that each Deputy represents about 4,000 people with disabilities.  That is not seen every day but it is a useful statistic.  Adding about a third of that number gives the number of carers that are in Ireland as well.  The initiative from this committee is about bringing a greatly needed sense of urgency to this issue.  People with disabilities do not have their basic right to free movement.  That unlocks so many things.  I asked the committee at the start to think about the frustration of a bus or a train not turning up because of industrial action or something happening.  That is minimal compared with the routine frustration of people with a whole range of disabilities.  They are never in a position to feel confident that the public service will be there.<\/p><p>There a number of areas that I am not going to go into now.  They are in my paper.  Others can speak to the various issues experienced by people who are blind and visually impaired, deaf and hard of hearing, wheelchair users and people with mobility impairment, and also that area of autism and the need for quiet spaces and more time.  These are all issues and they go across every aspect of public transport provision.  There is not one area.  Let me draw to a close by naming a couple of things.  I will give one example.<\/p><p>It is one of many.  For instance, Irish Rail insists that people with free travel passes who wish to reserve a seat pay &euro;5 per journey each way even though the Oireachtas is underwriting the cost of the journey by providing a free transport pass.  If someone without a free travel pass wants to book a seat, he or she faces no extra cost.  That is a blatant infringement not only of fair play but also of the regulations we have through the EU.  Accessible public transport requires a thoughtful and welcoming approach from all staff involved.  Training and an insistence on standards of customer service are crucial.  An embarrassing apology and expressing the hope that something will not happen again is not a response.  The response is a working service.  The remit of this committee includes tourism and it is important to note that accessible public transport and public spaces are assets to our tourism product.<\/p><p> The following is irksome.  Where non-State transport providers have been licensed by the State to provide public transport, they must provide the same access and compliance that is required of the public operators.  During the recent strike by Bus &Eacute;ireann, I raised an issue, albeit I should probably say \"Senator Dolan raised an issue\" at the committee.  It related to the service from Clonmel to Dublin and on to Dublin Airport.  Bus &Eacute;ireann was removing its fleet and saying the private operator had sufficient capacity.  The Minister, departmental officials and the National Transport Authority, which is the regulator, said there was sufficient capacity to meet the need.  Not one of the privately operated buses was accessible for wheelchair users.  What is worse, not one of them needed to be accessible.  The State had licensed a private operator to provide a public service and did not expect the same from that operator as it expected from the public provider.  We were told publicly that there was no diminution in service for the people using that route.  If it was for any of us who are in this room today, there was no diminution of service; there was no service.  That is a critical issue and I feel strongly about it.<\/p><p> All operators whether public or private, must have effective and efficient complaints systems.  The National Transport Authority must, to put it nicely, be in a position to ensure that learning and remediation follow complaints.  I dealt with a young 20-year old woman who is finishing in college and who needs to come from County Cavan to Dublin on a regular basis.  She has gone through primary, post-primary and three years of a four-year degree in Dundalk.  In fewer than 20 weeks this year, she was let down 20 times even though she had phoned up.  They were fed up of hearing from her because she was phoning up so often to book the 9.15 a.m. bus and the return journey that evening.  She already had the burden of having to give notice two or three days in advance that she planned to travel from home to Dublin and back but the public provider still let her down routinely.  We want her to get a job and have a life but where is she going?  She cannot put her hand on her heart and tell a prospective employer that she will be at a meeting because she cannot depend on the public bus service every day of the week.  That kind of thing is routine.  When purchasing fleet, the transport authority must prioritise and insist on the acquisition of roll-on, roll-off coaches and buses.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for his tolerance.  That is my opening statement.  I am delighted that today there are so many people who can set out their frustrating lived experience of trying to use what is called \"public transport\" in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#B00200","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513171800,"counter":922,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Dolan.

When one has to retrofit or one has to ring up in order for lifts to be put in place and seats taken out of a bus as a temporary measure, that is where issues arise.  One has to have accessible carriages and buses.  The other element is staff who understand the extra minute where people have to be supported if they have different conditions.  That must be grist for the mill of everyone who deals with the public in relation to these services.  That is why I referred specifically to low-floor buses, which we have in Dublin.  However, there is a row going on now because they were put in for wheelchair users but they get used by people with buggies who do not vacate when someone with a wheelchair gets on.  There is a range of issues, some of which are human issues of thoughtlessness and others of which involve getting the stock right to begin with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#C00500","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1513171800,"counter":926,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Eddie Redmond, CEO of the Irish Deaf Society, to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#C00600","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513171800,"counter":927,"content":"<p>While I understand we are constrained by time, I note to the committee that the interpreter may be a couple of seconds behind me.

On behalf of the Irish Deaf Society, IDS, I note what an honour it is to make a presentation here on access to public transport for people with disabilities.  The IDS has done a great deal of work in Ireland over 30 years with people who are deaf and hard of hearing and whose first language is Irish Sign Language.  We are in the process of having Irish Sign Language recognised by the State.  We have been doing that for a long time but we expect the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016 to be passed in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  It will be a great day for the deaf community and we will be in to watch it.  It is a historic time for us.<\/p> <p>  We have had to lobby for a long time for equal access to education, employment, health services and transport.  The IDS is a member of the European Union of the Deaf, EUD, and World Federation of the Deaf, WFD, which organisations work with the UN, especially on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The society provides a range of services to empower deaf and hard of hearing people to live independently, including by supporting people who live in rural areas.  The Irish deaf community is quite marginalised due to barriers to communication, the discrimination members have experienced and poor levels of service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Redmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1513171800,"counter":928,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting, but there is a vote in the Seanad and Senator Dolan has to go.

Public transport in Ireland relies to a great extent on sound and there is not a lot of visual information that can be conveyed.<\/p><p>There is too much reliance on auditory information provision in public transport in Ireland.  While people with disabilities might understand auditory emergency announcements, they would bypass deaf people and people who are hard of hearing.  There is insufficient service provision in an accessible way on bus, train and airport services for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.  Much of the consultation down through the years on disability services provision has been focused on disabilities other than accommodating deaf and hard of hearing people.  It is astounding that in the 21st century there is still a lack of visually accessible information for deaf and hard of hearing people.<\/p><p> Barriers to access to public services can be very frustrating for deaf and hard-of-hearing people.  It would be expected that at this stage, when people are putting in place plans for people with disabilities, they would take into account deaf people.  While the Leap card is a great novel invention which allows a person to tag on and off, because the person also needs to tell the driver where he or she is going, deaf people are often misunderstood by a driver and then overcharged for their journey because the amount charged is based on the destination communicated to the driver.  Also, while ticket machines are welcome, deaf people, including those who have free travel passes, still have to obtain tickets from people in kiosks who do not use a language that is accessible to those deaf people.  There are electronic machines from which people can buy tickets without interaction but deaf people are forced to go to kiosks to obtain tickets.  In one case, a deaf man took a train from Limerick to Dublin and because he fell asleep and did not hear the arrival announcement, when he woke up the train was on the way back to Limerick.  Also, tannoys are used to make announcements regarding platform changes for rail services.  There is no visual information provision in this regard, and often when gate changes are announced at airports, the information is not available on the screen straight away.  Another deaf person who was travelling from Killarney to Dublin by train did not hear an auditory announcement regarding a changeover to a bus for the remainder of the journey, and because he was last off the train, the bus was full and he had to wait an hour for the next bus.<\/p><p> While deaf and hard of hearing people often receive assistance from hearing people, there are other people who are not patient in their interaction with deaf people.  As a deaf person I might be asked to try to lip read in an effort to understand what people are saying, but nobody would ever ask a person who is a wheelchair user to try to walk.  It can be very offensive for deaf people when they are asked to do this because they are not being respected for who they are. <\/p><p> In terms of solutions, one idea in regard to the Leap card would be the installation of a machine which allows deaf people to indicate their destination by pressing a button and selecting it.  In terms of emergency announcements, there need to be live scrolling displays.  I acknowledge that there is some visual information, provision but for deaf and hard of hearing people, emergency announcements need to be made auditorily and visually straight away.  The Irish Deaf Society provides deaf awareness training to businesses, hospitals and health service providers.  We believe that all public transport staff should receive some form of deaf awareness training.  It can be good fun but it is also good for them to learn how to interact with deaf people.  It can change attitudes.  Some people have a less than graceful attitude when it comes to dealing with deaf and hard of hearing people.  There are also basic sign language classes available at which people can learn a few signs related to the area in which they work, for example, the sign for train and ticket and so on.  This is not about people becoming fluent in how to communicate with deaf people and Irish Sign Language, rather it is about having a basic familiarity with the language that can help.<\/p><p> It can be difficult for deaf people to engage with the hearing world, particularly in terms of transport.  Services that are accessible to hearing people and taken for granted are not necessarily accessible to deaf people.  For example, we may not be able to access the theatre or the cinema in the same way as hearing people can.  Services that require use of a phone are a barrier.  For example, we have only one interpreter here today because it was not possible to get another one.  This limits our experiences and our access to events, meetings and so on.  These frustrations arise because of barriers, inequality and discrimination that we experience.  There are useful ways to improve attitudes and change these things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Redmond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513171800,"counter":931,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Redmond for his opening statement and I now invite Ms Carthy to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#D00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513171800,"counter":932,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to today&rsquo;s meeting to discuss the barriers to transport for people with disabilities.  In particular, I thank the members of this committee who have supported the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, in the past and in the run-up to the budget.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Wheelchair Association is Ireland's leading representative organisation and service provider for people with physical disabilities.  We advocate for the needs of people with physical disabilities and provide services and support to more than 20,000 members in homes and communities throughout Ireland.  Everything we do is driven by a vision of an Ireland where people with disabilities can enjoy equal rights, choices and opportunities and live their lives independently.  Mobility is very important for IWA members.  As a service provider we have our own fleet of 140 accessible buses throughout the country and we work with transport operators to ensure that buses, trains and taxis are wheelchair friendly.<\/p> <p>  Transport is key to people with physical disabilities realising their independence.  When it comes to holding down a job, socialising or going on holidays, just getting there can often be the greatest challenge to overcome.  Unbelievably, in 2018 Ireland still does not have a fully accessible public transport system or taxi service.  Almost 50% of people living with a disability experience difficulty going outside their homes, and due to the lack of reliable public transport, only 24% of people with disabilities use community trains and only 35% avail of city buses.<\/p> <p>  Through our membership we know that people with physical disabilities have no faith in public transport due to repeated bad experiences.  This unreliable, disjointed service would not be accepted or tolerated by any other group in society.<\/p><p>As was pointed out, Article 9 of the UNCRPD states:<\/p><blockquote>To enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas. These measures shall include the identification and elimination of obstacles and barriers to accessibility.<\/blockquote><p>I would like to take members through the different public transport systems and the barriers they pose to people with disabilities and then look at some solutions.  Currently, only 5% of taxis throughout the country are wheelchair accessible and while TFI has put in place a wheelchair accessible vehicle grants scheme to support the wider availability of wheelchair accessible vehicles, it does not go far enough to incentivise taxi drivers to invest in making their vehicles more accessible.  Large contracts are awarded by the State on an annual basis to taxi operators to whom it has been reported that more than &euro;60,000 a day is paid out through the HSE.  This is where a major change could happen without any cost to the State, while, at the same time, incentivising taxi drivers to adapt their vehicles.  In the tendering process for the awarding of these contacts considerable additional weighting should be given to taxi operators with accessible vehicles.  While this would not change the position overnight, it should increase the number of accessible taxis on the road to an acceptable number servicing everyone in the country.<br\/><br\/>While the Dublin Bus fleet is fully wheelchair accessible, there is still an issue with people taking up the allocated spaces with buggies, trolleys and bags.  The IWA recently ran an awareness campaign with TFI and Dublin Bus which was launched by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Sport and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath.  Legislation is needed to empower Dublin Bus drivers to ask persons to vacate the spaces and impose a penalty on those who do not do so.  More than 60% of Bus &Eacute;ireann coaches are wheelchair accessible.  However, few, if any, accessible services are currently provided owing to the lack of accessible coach stop infrastructure.  Do members believe there is any use in having a car if they do not have keys and cannot access the car?  I believe they would think this to be pointless and frustrating.  As well as funding for the ongoing purchase of accessible coaches, funding should also be made available to ensure a nationwide network of accessible coach stops will be in place by 2020.  Some pilot schemes between County Donegal and Dublin are being rolled out, but this issue has been ongoing for years.  For how many more years will people with disabilities have to wait before they can access a bus and can travel like everyone else, to enter the workforce or education or be able to travel for social reasons?  We are not asking for accessible stops on dangerous country roads but in cities, towns and villages.<br\/><br\/>Many trains and train stations continue to provide significant barriers for commuters with disabilities.  There are many unmanned stations throughout the country and commuters with disabilities are faced with the uncertainty that ramps or space will be available when they arrive at a station.  People with disabilities have to give 24 hours notice of travel, thus preventing them from making travel plans spontaneously or in emergencies.  Do committee members plan all of their travel arrangements 24 hours in advance?  Perhaps they might do sometimes, but they do not every time they want to leave their home.  I am sure that once they have decided where they want to go, they just get up and go.  The notice time for the DART has been reduced from 24 hours to four for people with disabilities who are supposed to be grateful for this change.  However, it does not make the experience any different for them.  The DART has put in place a manual to help people with disabilities to navigate their way through using the service, but how does this change the experience of travel for a person with a disability?  <br\/><br\/>I will outline a scenario.  Imagine getting up in the morning and deciding to go to town to do some shopping or visit a friend, or, worse, a sick relative.  People with disabilities first have to arrange a time to meet, always keeping in mind that they need to give four hours' notice.  They then need to find their guide to travelling on the DART for people with disabilities, ring the number provided and state the station from which they will start their journey and the station to which they will return.  They must go to the station hoping a member of staff who is being deployed from another station will be there in time to assist with the ramp and that no one else with a disability will need assistance at another station at the same time.  They must live in hope that when they reach their destination, there will be a staff member there to assist them to exit the DART.  Now add to this scenario that, owing to their disability, they have a speech impediment and that their hand function is so poor that using a phone does not work for them.  Perhaps someone is a tourist with a disability and does not have a guide or perhaps it is someone who works and has to go through this every day.  That is the reality for people with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>Unmanned stations do not work for people with disabilities and the allocation of appropriate funding is needed until such time as Irish Rail services are fully wheelchair accessible.  Padraic who is an IWA member spoke recently about the issues as he tried to commute to work every day.  He relies on public transport to commute from Bray into Dublin city centre.  Each morning he must contact his local DART station to ensure the lifts in the station will work, that the station will be manned by a staff member to assist with ramp access and that he will be able to disembark safely at the other end of the journey.  Too often he is met by obstacles, problems and challenges which prohibit him from commuting to work.  I spoke to him earlier this week.  He had yet again been left sitting on a train with no one to help him disembark, which meant he was late for work again.<br\/><br\/>In 2013 the motorised transport grant and mobility allowance were stopped and while it had been decided that the HSE would continue to pay the 4,133 people in receipt of the allowance at the time, there has been no replacement of the schemes for those who find themselves in need of accessible transport.  This has had a major knock-on effect in many aspects of people's lives, including their health.  People with disabilities cancel hospital appointments as they have no transport and cannot afford to pay for a taxi.  The Government&rsquo;s response has been that legislation is at an advanced stage, but it has been at an advanced stage for quite some time.  The Government has spent time launching inclusion and employment strategies to assist people with disabilities to become more involved in society.  This is hugely welcome, but they are no more than hollow words if the same Government ignores the major transport barriers that hinder the very inclusion we seek to ensure.  The aspiration to include people with disabilities will never come to fruition if one of the major barriers is not dealt with in a comprehensive manner.<br\/><br\/>The IWA asks the committee to consider a number of recommendations on behalf of people with disabilities.  When large contracts are being awarded by the State to taxi operators, considerable additional weighting should be given in the tendering process to taxi operators with accessible vehicles.  With regard to Bus &Eacute;ireann services, as well as funding for the ongoing purchase of accessible coaches, funding should also be made available to ensure a nationwide network of accessible coach stops will be in place by 2020.  Train stations thorughout the country should be manned and people with disabilities should not have to give notice of their travel plans in order that they will have the right to travel as freely as everyone else.  We ask that legislation be put in place to empower Dublin Bus drivers to ask persons to vacate the spaces allocated for people with disabilities and impose a penalty on those who do not and that the legislation to reinstate the motorised transport grant and mobility allowance be brought forward.  <br\/><br\/>I again thank the committee for inviting the IWA to present on transport matters that affect people with disabilities.  I am happy to take questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Joan Carthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513171800,"counter":934,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Carthy for her comprehensive statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#E00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513171800,"counter":935,"content":"<p>The NCBI is delighted to have the opportunity, with our peers, to present to the joint committee because, as has been clearly identified by other speakers, public transport is central to the lives of people with disabilities, particularly those who have suffered sight loss and are blind.  Fundamentally, it takes great courage for an individual with a sight loss condition to leave the safety of his or her home.<\/p><p>One must trust the systems and the mobility training received.  In many ways, one takes one's life in one's hands.  This is not an academic discussion or something one would \"like to have\".  This is a key question about how the State deals with public safety and people with sight loss and other disabilities.<\/p><p> According to the 2016 census, there are currently 54,810 people with sight loss.  Sight loss ranges from mild to moderate to severe or total sight loss.  The impact of mild to moderate sight loss is considerable when one can no longer drive and it is life-changing.  Public transport takes on a new significance when it is only access to transport that somebody with sight loss may have.  There are still considerable barriers within our public spaces and built environments, and these are coupled with barriers created by inaccessible public transport.  Those barriers hugely limit the rights and choices of people with sight loss, leaving them unable to fully participate in the workforce, education, training and, fundamentally, in Irish society.<\/p><p> In this presentation we would like to highlight the problems created when trains do not have audible announcements, which allow a person who is blind or vision-impaired to know where he or she is or where to get off.  Buses are capable of audible announcements but they do not happen in a reliable way.  Trams should announce the direction before moving, as not doing so leaves one unsure as to whether the direction is to the Point or Connolly Station.  This is even more relevant with the very welcome opening of the Luas cross-city project this weekend.  That is not to say we do not recognise that progress has been made and we welcome everything that has been done, although it has been slow and hard-won.  We must place disability at the heart of all our discussions, and that is why this meeting is so welcome.  This relates to current and future public transport infrastructure.  We therefore ask the joint committee today to support our recommendations to ensure a fully accessible public transport system.<\/p><p> What do we mean by this?  The majority of the 8,000 people we work with each year have some vision, while a small percentage of people are completely blind.  According to the 2016 census, there are 54,000 people with sight loss in Ireland but that number is rising as the population ages.  Throughout our report we have included extracts from our Out of Sight survey, where we took a considerable sample of 351 people who are blind and vision-impaired and asked them their experience of dealing with transport and accessibility.  We can look at a breakdown by age of people with sight loss, with 5,081 people aged between 0 and 17; 24,000 people between the age of 18 and 65; and 25,000 people above the age of 66.  This is not one cohort of society but rather all ages and all people in our society today.<\/p><p> We have identified sight loss as a huge impact on a person's life, affecting independence, mobility, employment prospects, education, communication and social inclusion.  People who are blind or vision-impaired cannot drive and therefore public transport is their only means of accessing work, school, leisure and their independence.  Similar to the Irish Wheelchair Association, we have identified where the key issues exist around the different forms of public transport.  Fundamentally, even with well-developed mobility skills delivered by the National Council for the Blind in Ireland, NCBI, and our colleagues at Irish Guide Dogs, it is sometimes very difficult for a person to engage with public transport.  The challenges start with the booking or buying of tickets and finding information online or via an app and at the station.  They continue as the person makes his or her way around the station or Luas platform, awaiting the correct train, bus or Luas and tries to figure out which direction he or she will travel.  I cannot emphasise enough the importance of safe spaces when using public transport, and this was tragically highlighted by the death of Ms Patricia Brennan, who in 2014 was killed at Raheny DART station when she fell on the tracks.<\/p><p> For many years the NCBI has engaged with all the transport providers, the Department and the National Transport Authority, NTA, on ways to improve the service for users who are blind and vision-impaired.  We genuinely welcome the progress made to date.  We also welcome the opportunity to highlight areas that still need to be worked on and which need the establishment of regular, formalised engagement and structures with both the NTA and service providers to ensure that accessibility and future provision for public transport can continue to improve.  The NCBI welcomes the Government's commitment in A Programme for Partnership Government to invest in making public transport services accessible for people with disabilities, including the provision of audio announcements on train and bus services to aid people who are blind and vision-impaired.<\/p><p> On the broad points, accessibility to websites and apps - the trend we are all following - is an integral part of people's daily lives.  That is no different with anybody who is blind or vision-impaired.  This includes travel information, ticket booking and timetables, which should all be available online.  A person who is vision-impaired will use either screen magnification or screen reading software but the website and the app must be designed and accessible to make it usable for people with sight loss.  We strongly recommend that public transport operators prepare for the full implementation of the EU web accessibility directive, which will ensure that all websites and apps must be made accessible.  Member states have until 23 September 2018 to transpose the text to national legislation.  The European Commission will adopt implementing Acts by the end of 2018 and this will ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of relevant positions to the directive.<\/p><p> I completely echo Senator John Dolan's points on the public transport review and the difficulty around retro-fitting.  It is a point we see time and again, with disability and public transport not at the centre or thought of at the beginning.  They are an afterthought and people are retrofitting for accessibility.  It is better, cheaper and more effective to think about this at the beginning and everybody wins.  We call for a \"disability-proofing\" approach to everything that is happening in current public transport provision and also the future position of how we are going forward with our public transport.  How will it be proofed to ensure it is effective and fundamentally cheaper?  It would be a society and Government win.  Part of this considers the role of access officers and user groups in the review process and embeds them more fully than they are now.  They are vital to an effective consultation process with representative organisations like ourselves and colleagues here today.<\/p><p> Ms Carthy spoke about access to Luas and DART stations and there is a prime example of a lack of joined-up thinking or communication in a Bus &Eacute;ireann route from Cavan to the Mater hospital in Dublin.  It was used by many people with vision impairments travelling to monthly outpatient clinics for treatment for eye conditions but it was suddenly cancelled by Bus &Eacute;ireann without any communication or information for anybody using it.  This highlights a lack of understanding among senior management in Bus &Eacute;ireann as to the needs of people with sight loss.<\/p><p> We recommend a \"disability-proofing\" approach that is not expensive or retrospective, and that does not make disability an afterthought.  We recommend that the Department and the NTA commit to really consulting with service users and the NCBI in a regular, formalised and more meaningful way than was evident in the current review of public transport services.  We strongly urge that all access officer positions are filled and not left vacant.  We should prioritise and resource user groups and there should be a new structure for regular formalised engagement, along with consultation around route changes and cancellation.  That should be integral to the thinking.<\/p><p> Audible announcements are central to effective public transport for people who are blind or sight-impaired and essential for independent and safe travel.  They provide vital information that is not otherwise available to a person who cannot read signs or notices independently.  We strongly recommend that all public transport should operate audible announcements both within carriages and coaches and at stations and platforms to enable those people with insufficient vision to have access to the same basic information as the sighted population, such as the destination of the train, tram or bus and the location of the next stop or station.<\/p><p>We welcome the progress made in some areas but it is important to maintain standards and deal with faults.  It is also vital staff are trained and aware of the needs of people with disabilities.  We hope the National Transport Authority, NTA, will monitor if this is being done, along with the targets and effectiveness of that training.  We also call for the review and consequences for misuse or non-compliance by employees of transport companies and the publishing of robust key performance indicators for accessibility.<\/p><p> Many trains and train stations continue to present significant barriers for people who are blind and vision-impaired.  In addition to the ongoing lack of audible announcements, with unstaffed stations, people with impaired vision are faced with uncertainty as to the availability of a member of staff to offer assistance on and off the train.  People have to give 24 hours notice of travel if they require assistance.  The National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, finds this situation unacceptable.  The Government&rsquo;s policy has recommended travel notice be reduced to four hours instead of 24 hours.  We welcome this proposal.  We request Irish Rail continues to engage with NCBI more, that stations are more accessible to people who are blind or vision-impaired.  NCBI recommends all Irish Rail staff, be they a train operator or the chief executive, engage in disability awareness training to ensure an organisation-wide standard for customers with disabilities.  All trains and carriages must have audible announcements which are functioning and maintained to operate correctly.  There must be a consistency in approach between public and private operators.  The situation with audible announcements is far more consistent on Dublin Bus than on Irish Rail, DART and commuter trains.  However, there are still instances where they are not functioning.  Customers with vision impairments should be able to rely on the provision of audible announcements for their journeys.  As the Department is also responsible for the provision of licences to private transport operators, audible announcements should be prioritised as part of the licensing process.<\/p><p> As the Luas is a newer form of transport, accessibility has been a consideration from the beginning and this good practice is welcome.  Integration at the beginning of a project makes it much simpler.  However, there are still problems with audible announcements, accessibility and direction.  There should be greater consideration of colour contrast between trams, the fixed physical environments and audible announcements for the destination of the tram as people enter and leave.  Vision Australia recently opened a training centre to enable vision-impaired people to be trained about external public transport environments.<\/p><p> Taxis are central to the use of a public transport system.  We agree with the Irish Wheelchair Association and point to the success of subsidised taxi schemes such as London&rsquo;s Taxicard system, Chicago&rsquo;s Open Taxis and Australia&rsquo;s Multi Purpose Taxi Program, all of which enable subsidised taxi travel to be taken up by people with sight loss and other disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris White","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513171800,"counter":938,"content":"<p>That was an encompassing and inclusive commentary.<\/p> <p>  I invite Ms Sarah Lennon and Ms Sandra McCullagh, Inclusion Ireland, to make their opening statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#G00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513171800,"counter":939,"content":"<p>On behalf of Inclusion Ireland, I thank the committee for the invitation to address it.<\/p> <p>  Inclusion Ireland is a national, rights-based advocacy organisation working to promote the rights of people with intellectual disabilities.<\/p> <p>  Ireland signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 but has not yet ratified it.  The convention requires the State will ensure persons with disabilities can access, on an equal basis with others, transportation.  Inclusion Ireland endorses the National Platform of Self-Advocates, one of the few disabled persons&rsquo; organisations.  It conducted research and produced a report, Our Lived Experiences of Housing and Transport.  It showed when public transport links were good, participants felt happy because it supported them in accessing education, training, work, social and community supports and networks.  However, when public transport did not work well, as can be the experience of many people with disabilities living rurally, connection to opportunities to work, to attend further education and to take part in the community are denied or restricted.  Disabled people living in private households were far less likely to own a car in April 2011.  People with an intellectual disability do not drive and are dependent on people who do drive or public transport.<\/p> <p>  These issues are well known and there have been commitments.  The programme for Government stated it will examine transport service provision for young persons with disabilities to ensure the service is fit for purpose and consistent with their needs.  The recently published national disability inclusion strategy also committed to improving the accessibility.  Crucially, the strategy commits to the maintenance of accessibility features.  From our advocacy work, accessibility features cannot be relied upon.  Lifts in particular can be poorly maintained, leaving it in the lap of the gods as to whether they will be even available.  There is evidence that these commitments are not being realised and that for many disabled people, transport continues to be an ongoing barrier to community inclusion.<\/p> <p>  Inclusion Ireland is aware of poorly accessible information, individuals experiencing less favourable treatment because they are using a free travel pass, late changes to bus timetables or routes which presents a challenge to people with intellectual disabilities or autism, lack of staff or support at train stations meaning difficulty travelling or accessing tickets, inaccurate display or audio systems meaning people travelled beyond their destination.  This affects not only people with disabilities but other commuters and tourists.<\/p> <p>  During recent Inclusion Ireland consultations on public transport, we received feedback that public transport was essential for community living, as well as good mental health and social interaction.  Respondents spoke about it being wearying and time-consuming to arrange access.  Transport is by no means equal.  One participant said carrying disabled people out of their wheelchairs onto Bus &Eacute;ireann buses is obscene and dangerous in the 21st century.<\/p><p>One person who participated said that carrying disabled people from their wheelchairs onto Bus &Eacute;ireann buses is obscene and dangerous in the 21st century.  Other feedback was that people would like timetables and transport information to be accessible and easy to read throughout the network, with a consistent approach, a consistent template and consistent font used for all accessible information in the network.<\/p><p> As I mentioned, one of the biggest accessibility features is simply maintenance, or standing still in some cases, whereby lifts and so forth are maintained.  Senator Dolan mentioned this at the outset but we would encourage the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to give more regard to its public sector duty.  In the Department's most recent strategy statement there was a reference to addressing the commitments by performing an initial assessment of the duty.  We are keen to know how that initial assessment is going or if it has begun.  If it has not, we strongly encourage the Department to consult with experts through lived experience in preparing that assessment and in developing the statement to ensure that the real life experiences about which the committee members have heard today and which exist outside this room permeate any assessment or plan.  That would include passengers with disabilities who are dependent on the public transport system for community inclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Lennon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513171800,"counter":941,"content":"<p>I will briefly outline the link between inadequate public transport and poverty.  People with disabilities are at greater risk of poverty than the general population.  They experience much higher levels of deprivation and persistent poverty.  People with disabilities have extra costs associated with having a disability and living in an inaccessible and unequal society.  Transport can be a significant aspect of those extra costs.  Where public transport is poor or unavailable, people require cars or taxis to get around and to access education, work or social experiences.  If there is no private car available or if the cost of taxis is prohibitive, people simply miss out, which leads to further poverty and social exclusion.<\/p> <p>  A recent report by my colleagues in the NCBI indicated that people with visual impairment face additional weekly transport costs of approximately &euro;20 per week to cover the cost of taxis.  That figure is a bare minimum and assumes there is an adequate public transport system in place.  It is probably an understatement.  The report reiterated that rather than being luxuries, people with vision impairment and others rely on the use of taxi services as a basic necessity to live independently.  The decision in 2013 to close the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant scheme to new applicants has placed an additional burden or risk of social exclusion on people with disabilities.  The proposed scheme, the Health (Transport Support) Bill, to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility needs appears to have stalled, with the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform considering whether the scheme is capable of being costed and whether it is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.  There is an urgent need to introduce a scheme to replace the other schemes.  Sarah Lennon alluded to the consultation we have carried out on our budgetary work.  The issue of transport arose in that, as did the issue of mobility grants.  People told us that they need the reinstatement of the mobility grant.  Its absence has left families in desperate financial distress and has left many people in rural areas without transport.<\/p> <p>  Many of the citizens with disabilities we encounter through our advocacy work reflect interactions with public transport providers that are undignified and discriminatory.  Of particular concern recently is that people we spoke to have referred to the issue of private bus companies not accepting the free travel pass, or private services on public routes prioritising non-free travel customers and leaving disabled passengers behind.  The National Platform of Self Advocates research, which my colleague referred to earlier, addresses these issues and recommends that the Government tackles this through funding or extending the travel pass to include a certain number of taxi trips per month or year or a certain number of private bus trips per month or year.<\/p> <p>  To conclude, Inclusion Ireland thanks the committee for the opportunity to raise these issues.  It is clear that a high quality, reliable and accessible public transport system is a critical component of a life in the community.  Where public transport is not available, often there is a choice between using taxis or, if the cost of that is too high, simply missing out which results in further social exclusion.  The need for accessibility encompasses the entire journey experience.  We have spoken a great deal about the physical infrastructure but it also involves accessible information and timetables, disability aware staff and accessible parking in the case of park-and-ride facilities.  Inclusion Ireland believes that a high quality, accessible and consistent public transport system is a key element in addressing the cost of disability and the social exclusion faced by people with intellectual disabilities.  We urge the Department to equality-proof and disability-proof decisions and consider their actual impact on disabled people. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sandra McCullagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513171800,"counter":942,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be present here today and I thank the chairman, the committee members and especially Deputy Robert Troy for the invitation.  I have entitled my submission, \"Disability transport in Ireland: apartheid or equal?\"  I have a very rare neuro-muscular degenerative disease that I share with my twin sister, hence the wheelchair.  I am a disability rights campaigner and activist.  I do not belong to a group or organisation.  However, I have a Facebook forum entitled \"Wheelchair Rights Ireland\" which has 500 followers.  We are advocating for better wheelchairs for people who need them.  It is sufficient to say that wheelchair provision in Ireland is very poor, and that is where transport begins for many.<\/p> <p>  All disabled people are my concern.  There are 600,000 of them, 13% of the population, and they have been left behind.  We are calling for transport rights inclusion.  Wheels are my focus.  Freedom is my focus.  Equality of participation in all areas of society, by all disabled people, depends on wheels.  That includes wheelchairs, scooters, buses, trains, the DART and the Luas, although one might call them tracks at that point.  Going places is key to living.  Travel is wonderful for all disabled people, whether they are visually impaired, deaf, wheelchair users, learning disabled, older or frail.  We love freedom.<\/p> <p>  When the committee members rolled out of their beds this morning the only thing they had to think about was how they would get here.  They probably decided on using their cars.  However, disabled people no longer have the cars they used to have with the mobility grant or the motorised transport grant, which were removed in 2013 and never replaced.  There was a promise to replace them and the money is ring-fenced, but where is that money now?  Many rural disabled people and severely disabled people who cannot use public transport depended on those grants.<\/p> <p>  With regard to buses, people have given me examples of the problems with buses.  Brid in County Limerick said that her daughter has a free travel pass.  They live in County Limerick outside Limerick city.  The local bus runs there twice a day but her daughter cannot use it because she is a wheelchair user and the bus has steps and does not have access.  Brid said this is a disgrace.  Catherine said that her son cannot travel on the school bus to secondary school as there is no lowering step and he has a physical disability.  Although she has told Bus &Eacute;ireann several times about this, in 2016 and 2017 the private contractor still did not have a lowering step.  Now Catherine drives him to school but he misses travelling with his mates and the other students on the bus.  Claire, a Bus &Eacute;ireann employee, told me that all Expressway buses have lifts for wheelchair users but the lifts can be used only where the footpaths are at the right level.  The footpaths around the country are still not upgraded by the councils.  Apparently, this was supposed to be done in 2016 but the employee said that it will probably take until 2026.  This woman said, \"People with disabilities should not be restricted like this.  I thought we were all supposed to be equal to others\".  This is separating us from society.\"<\/p> <p>  Frank travels from Donegal to Dublin.  He says he is lifted bodily, under his arms and legs, out of his wheelchair and up the bus steps.  He says it is humiliating, degrading and dangerous.  Sometimes the bus staff do not want to help him, so the other passengers do it.  This should not be happening in 21st century Ireland.  Sorcha said that having to use only the front door of the bus is inaccessible for many wheelchair users and is unsafe for others.  It means one must fit into the narrow hallway between the driver and the door.  A power chair like hers should not go downward at an angle as it results in her falling off the ramp and getting stuck.  This is not because of her or her wheelchair but the ill-considered bus design.  It happened to me too.<\/p><p>I have fallen off the ramp several times and do not travel on buses anymore because I am now too scared.  This shows the apartheid and separation in bus travel.  The causes of our transport difficulties are not our disabilities but, rather, issues ranging from the failings of county councils and bus design to broken ramps.  There is apartheid across private and public bus travel and it affects the lives of disabled people, particularly in rural areas, which leads to isolation, separation, frustration, danger and a sense that we are not being catered for.  It is not our bodily conditions or diseases that make us disabled but, rather, the structures in place.  Our disability is politically constructed.  The real cause is disability discrimination and an unwillingness to sort out access issues or regard us as equal passengers.  We rely on accessible taxis, despite our low incomes as sometimes they are our only transport lifeline.  However, there are too few accessible taxis and many taxi drivers do not want the hassle of loading us.  Sean who is sitting behind me has stated he booked an accessible taxi five hours in advance but it did not turn up, leaving him to wait in the freezing cold for one and a half hours .  He had to make alternative arrangements.  Mary stated the HSE had booked an accessible taxi to take her home from St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital after a hospital appointment.  Her appointment was late starting but finished at 5 p.m.  She waited for three hours at the doors of St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital for the taxi to arrive and was distraught, exhausted and crying.  She telephoned a friend of hers who is an RTE reporter who organised and paid for an accessible taxi.  The Government needs to roll out a grants scheme to enable us to get taxis and increase the number of accessible taxis available.<br\/><br\/>Air travel is also a nightmare for many.  Some companies damage power wheelchairs when off-loading them from aeroplanes and many provide no accessible toilets or spaces for wheelchair users.  I was once seated on an aeroplane and saw a head bob up beside me.  It was that of a disabled man who was bottom-shuffling down the aisle to get to the toilet.  The indignity and humiliation is not difficult to perceive. <br\/><br\/>Rail travel is not very different.  Lifts are often broken, while broken or switched off emergency call buttons on the DART are an almost permanent feature because children press them and staff turn them off.What if an emergency occurs?  My twin sister who is present has Crohn&rsquo;s disease and a neuro-muscular disease.  She has had several terrifying episodes when she needed to get off a train urgently but the emergency buttons were locked.  What if someone has a heart attack?  Disabled people have to endure broken ramps and station staff forgetting that they are booked in, or worse, get them off the train.  That happened to me once while travelling to Dublin from Limerick.  It was late, around 9 p.m., and I was exhausted.  My neuro-muscular degenerative disease does not cope well with tiredness.  I was flopping all over the place and needed my bed, but the staff forgot about me.  The train arrived at Heuston Station and everyone got off but me.  I was left in darkness at the end of a very long platform with not a soul in sight and became very scared.  About 20 minutes or half an hour later a single cleaner arrived and I was rescued.<br\/><br\/>The fear and anxiety of travel cannot be underestimated.  Will they get me on?  Will they get me off?  Will I end up in some godforsaken place?  It happens.  That is not what members experience.  Why is that?  Is this travel apartheid?  Why?  Is the answer because we are disabled?  No, it is because we are not considered.  It is not about equality but, rather, discrimination and we must label it as such. <br\/><br\/>On one occasion my twin and I got on the DART at Greystones and had not booked 24 hours in advance.However, as it takes one hour to get to Connolly Station, we telephoned to say we were on the train and would need a ramp to get off.  The officious woman in the Irish Rail office said she could not guarantee that we would be helped off the train.  We were already on the DART.Were we to stay on it for 24 hours until the required notice was given?  I told her that we were on the DART, but she repeated that she could not guarantee we would be helped off the train.  We agonised over whether we would be assisted at Connolly Station, but on that occasion we were.  Requiring 24 hours' notice of travel is an apartheid rule.  It is a separation from the rules for non-disabled people.  Why do different rules apply to us?  Non-disabled people can arrive, hop on and hop off any time they want, but we are marked by our disability and destined to need help.  We must, therefore, book in advance.  The Minister, Deputy Shane Ross has jubilantly declared that we will now only have to give four hours' notice under a pilot scheme, as if that means equality.  It does not.  I do not want to give any notice, nor do many other disabled people.  To have to give four hours' notice means that I have no choice, cannot change my travel plans or go somewhere on the spur of the moment and that I am not free.  The requirement to give four hours' notice is not an improvement on the requirement to give 24 hours' notice.We do not want to have to give any notice, as non-disabled people do not.  I want to arrive, get on, get off and enjoy my freedom.  To have to plan every single journey is a nightmare.  It is discrimination.  Non-disabled people do not have to do it.  There is separation.  It would not happen if stations were staffed.  We demand that all stations remain staffed.  It is unacceptable to take staff away from train stations.  We want to be able to travel freely and when we want to, as non-disabled people do, and that can only happen if stations are staffed.  Every bus and rail station in the country must be staffed.  <br\/><br\/>Why can we not be part of the travelling passenger community and go our own way with freedom and access?  We cannot because of discrimination.  Our bodies are not accepted and we are marked as being different and, being different, cannot expect equality of travel.  Ireland has not yet ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, ten years after it was opened for signature.  We are not accepted as equal in this country.  Ten years on I am still not equal and there is an unwillingness to see us as equal or to make us equal.  There must be a concerted effort to make us equal because it is discrimination not to do so.  We cannot expect things to be made easier or accessible.  We cannot expect humanity or to receive support while travelling.  We are made to deal with frustration, apartheid, separation, fear, anxiety, broken ramps, there being no station toilets, being forgotten on trains or being forgotten and left on freezing cold platforms, with there being broken lifts and escalators, with unstaffed train and DART stations, no wheelchair spaces, narrow train and bus design, switched off alarms on trains and more, as if we did not exist.  We are not thought of in the scheme of travel in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Marsha De Cordova, an MP in the United Kingdom, said it was a political choice to build a transport network that so often was inaccessible.She calls it a political choice.That is where equality happens.  This is a European country.  The President of the European Parliament, Mr. Antonio Tajani, stated:<\/p><blockquote>Our commitment to improve the lives of persons with disabilities is founded in our values as Europeans, including our attachment to freedom, equality and inclusion of all individuals in society.  These values have to be translated into concrete actions, to enable every person to live an independent life, and to make sure that our society empowers everyone.<\/blockquote><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Concrete action is urgently needed on transport provision for disabled people of Ireland.  So far, we are in an apartheid of travel discrimination, which must change.  What is broken needs fixing and what is inaccessible needs to be made accessible.  This is a political choice and the members need to make it happen.  This is our public transport too and we deserve, as full citizens of Ireland, simply to be able to get to the station or bus stop, get on, get off and travel freely, safely and without fear and anxiety.  This is the members' political choice and I call on them to make it happen.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Margaret Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513171800,"counter":945,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Kennedy for her powerful presentation.

Prior to this meeting, I had a meeting scheduled for 2.45 p.m.  I thank the witnesses for attending and for their thorough and informative presentations.  We have known a lot about this and we are battling with the Minister and the Department on it every week.  The Irish Deaf Society has put froward a range of practical solutions; for example a button on a bus which people could press to find out what prices were and a live text system.  Has the society met with the NTA or CIE on these and what responses were received?<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  The National Council for the Blind referred to staff hubs and the pilot system for DART services to bring notification periods down to four hours.  While reducing the notice period from 24 hours to four hours is an improvement, it is still not satisfactory.  Has the council made that abundantly clear?  As the last speaker said, the Minister seems to think it is revolutionary.  However, it is still not equality with everyone else.  A taxi card system was referred to, which would be especially useful for people in rural areas.  Is the council aware of the NTA's attitude or that of taxi drivers to such a scheme?<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  I note to Senator Dolan that we have spoken before.  He referred to audio announcements on Bus &Eacute;ireann which still have not come to fruition notwithstanding the passing of the 30 September date.  Were there commitments from other transport services on the same audio announcements?  He also mentioned the 48-hour notice period.  I have dealt with 24-hour notice for buses in my constituency of Louth and east Meath.  Not only is that restrictive, it is compounded by the problem that on many occasions people were left sitting at the side of the road when a bus pulled up which was not wheelchair accessible because, while there was a lift on the bus, the driver was not trained to operate it.  That has been rectified to some degree locally but it is still not 100%.  That is replicated across the State in every county and town.  Senator Dolan said EU law prohibited the imposition of a fee for booking a seat by persons with travel passes for Irish Rail.  Has he raised the matter with the company, the Minister or the NTA?  We can also do it if that is necessary.  If it has been raised, what was the response?<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  What are the top three proposals Inclusion Ireland has to combat poverty among persons with disabilities?  Do they include the mobility allowance, motorised transport grant, an increase in Bus &Eacute;ireann services or subsidised taxis?  Inclusion Ireland said private bus companies can decide not to honour the free travel pass for users.  How widespread an issue is that given that private bus operators also do not have the same obligation as public transport companies to meet the needs of wheelchair users despite the fact that they have been awarded public contracts?  I am sure other speakers will have plenty of other questions but I apologise for having to leave now.  I will check the responses from the witnesses on the transcripts later.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#K00400","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1513171800,"counter":948,"content":"<p>There are a lot of questions there.

I welcome our guests.  Their presentations have been extremely helpful and beneficial.  This session originated when Dr. Kennedy sent an email to all elected representatives on the proposal for a number of unmanned DART stations.  Senator John Dolan also contacted the Chairman on this.  We felt that we should work cross-party as a committee to listen to concerns and bring forward recommendations to the Minister on what can be done immediately, in the short term and in the longer term to ensure that there is equal access for people of varying abilities and disabilities.  It is very positive to have had the presentations today.  To be fair, each group represented has presented us with very practical suggestions we can adopt when we meet in our next session with companies' representatives and, ultimately, feed into the proposals we make to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  As such, I thank our guests for attending.<\/p> <p>  This week is a very significant one from the point of view of the recognition of Irish Sign Language.  I compliment the Irish Deaf Society for the work it has done and, in particular Senator Mark Daly, who pioneered and pushed the legislation in this regard.  Last week, I had the opportunity to attend a meeting of the Council of Europe.  At that level, there are ongoing efforts to ensure that sign language is recognised across the European Union.  I was happy to speak in favour of that.  It was nice to be in a position to say that Ireland is one of the countries which is leading the way in this regard.  It is an area in which we are doing something positive.<\/p> <p>  A particular issue highlighted by a number of witnesses involved cuts to the mobility allowance and motorised transport scheme in 2013.  There was a promise at the time that it was only a matter of suspending the schemes for new applications for a period of months while a new scheme or schemes were formulated.  Have the witnesses had any contact with the Department to feed into a new scheme or has the Department given any indication in this regard?  To be fair, it is a matter which is raised on an almost weekly basis on the Order of Business and with the Minister in the D&aacute;il but we get the same bland response that a new scheme is nearing completion and will be launched imminently.  It has been \"imminent\" for three years but it has still not been published.  I wonder about that.<\/p> <p>  Another matter I raised last week in the D&aacute;il was the Revenue exemption for people with disabilities when buying a car.<\/p><p>The application of that scheme seems to have become extremely strict.  I have two constituents in my community.  One is paralysed the whole way down on one side and was told he was not sufficiently disabled to qualify for the scheme.  The other person is a young man with very bad multiple sclerosis.  Through sheer willpower, he is staying out of a wheelchair.  He is literally dragging himself along because he knows that once he goes into one, there is no going back.  However, the arm of the State is stating it cannot support him because he is not sufficiently disabled.  Do the delegates have any information on that matter? <\/p><p> The delegates have given a good overview and some good proposals.  It gives members an opportunity to work with everyone concerned and feed the outcome into their ultimate proposals for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.

We acknowledge there is a problem.  I refer to a question that must be asked and which I asked earlier at the other meeting.  Words of comfort are great.  I come from previous experience in politics in local government.  I remember how hard it was to get the councils to make the footpaths dished as a technology for wheelchair users.  We have come a long way now with housing grants to make houses more comfortable and accessible for people.  Ireland commits a certain percentage of GDP for foreign aid and I note we are joining the UN convention in the next couple of days.  For every euro the National Transport Authority gets, can we ask that 1% or 10% of it be designated towards enhancing disability access and mobility?  Are we going down a road whereby as a committee and as a Government, we would seek that?  It is all fine to say we will sing their praises or that this and that are needed but to put a frame in place, are we talking about setting targets for monetary purposes to the effect that a minimum budget would be guaranteed each year?  For instance, when money is given to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, how much of it is earmarked for disability purposes and access? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#L00300","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1513171800,"counter":955,"content":"<p>I think it is important and positive that all the groups and speakers have addressed the committee today.  The points raised are relevant and sharp and put it up to the committee and people in a position of power regarding the transport infrastructure.  I will not go through it company by company but Dublin Bus clearly has issues and questions to answer.  The same applies to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I will use my time to talk about Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann because one thing that struck me from the papers and the presentations is that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann seems to have more questions to answer than some of the others.<\/p> <p>  Five points jumped out at me.  The idea that a person with a disability would have to give 48 hours notice in order to get on a train is not unbelievable, because I do believe it, but it has to be dealt with.  It will be 2018 in a month's time.  Then there are the questions of the cutback in the number of quiet carriages and, if my understanding is correct, the reduction in the number of wheelchair spaces in the new fleet.  There also is a whole range of issues that arise from the presence of unmanned stations such as anti-social behaviour and the protection of people, including women, at night time in stations etc.  However, for people with disabilities to be obliged to be dealing with unmanned stations in the year 2017 is outrageous.

Did I get that right?  It is hard to find a word.  That is disgusting.  While points have been raised well about Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, I will focus my questions today on Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  When Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann appears before the joint committee in the new year, it will be important that those points are raised then also.<\/p><p>I was asked to raise the issue of a particular bus stop in Fermoy in County Cork.  It was a disability access point for buses.  It is not a country area but is in an urban area in a town.  The bus stop was taken out in early 2017 and has not been replaced.  It could and should be replaced, which is the right thing to do.  <\/p><p>The final point I wish to raise is on the private bus companies.  Many, but not all, of the issues there are linked to the question of cutbacks.  When there are cutbacks, passengers suffer and people with disabilities suffer more than other passengers.  The case is well made for the rights of people with disabilities.  The case has also been made in passing for opposition to all cutbacks.  It strikes me, from my observations, that if there are major issues with Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, there are bigger issues again when it comes to private operators that put the maximisation of profit above all else, including the rights of people with disabilities.

I do think one of the prime issues is unmanned stations.<\/p><p>I am very worried about unmanned stations.  There is no doubt that people can become ill very quickly in the cold.  If they are left in an unmanned station, they will need help.  One might have diabetic episode or a heart attack and may need help.  The whole idea of unmanned stations is really contrary to safety and equality.  I do not know what Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is doing.  Recently it told me that it will have an app on a smartphone that will help disabled people.  I have not quite figured out what this smartphone app will be all about.  How can someone access a smartphone if they are going into a diabetic coma, if they are feeling very unwell, if they are visually impaired or if they have a learning disability?<\/p><p> Moreover, a smartphone is very expensive.  I spoke to the Irish Rail manager.  He was jubilant about this smartphone idea and I said I had not got a smartphone.  I have a basic Tesco pay-as-you-go phone.  He said to me that I would simply have to upgrade.  I was incensed.  I pointed out that many disabled people would not be able to afford a smartphone, or even use one.  All he said to me, and cynically, was that I would have to upgrade.  We have to put up with that.<\/p><p> It is not thinking about equality, and this is the bottom line.  This is not about poor little \"crips\" who need a little extra help.  We are citizens of the State who need equality, and that is where it has to start; equality, equality, equality.   People have spoken about undergoing disability awareness training programmes with some companies.  It is true that we need awareness about what our disabilities and illnesses are about.  More often, however, we need disability equality training.  What does it mean to make everybody equal?  The politics of disability need to be discussed.  I will finish there in order that members and other witnesses can have a word, but I feel very strongly about this.  I suppose the committee will feel my anger.  There are real rights issues at stake.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, UNCRPD, is going to ratified next year, we hope.  It will have major implications for all of this, thank God.  People are going to have to adhere to standards of equality.

The problem concerns private property rights and whether we can interfere with the rights of private property owners in order to reasonably accommodate disabled citizens.  We are not setting separate standards for employment because of a European directive.  We have been compelled to have one standard for employment.  Until we are compelled to have one standard for services, we intend to continue with two tiers.  As such, our public services will be of a higher standard than private services.  If the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority, NTA, are compelled by their public sector duty to have equality and human rights approaches in place, they should not grant tenders to private companies unless they reach the higher standard.<\/p> <p>  Unstaffed stations are a significant barrier to people with intellectual disabilities travelling independently.  Travelling independently is a massive issue for people with intellectual disabilities in terms of their dignity and inclusion in their community.  Often, in our rush towards technological solutions, we simply forget what human support is required for people.  I am not just talking about public safety, or protection from anti-social behaviour.  We can train people to use ticket machines, but we cannot necessarily train them in what to do if the ticket machines are not working.  Having humans available to provide support is very important for people, particularly those with an intellectual disability or autism.

She specifically asked for three strategies and that is what I will provide.  There are many ways of addressing the costs of disability.  The three main approaches would be to increase income; to reduce the extra costs people experience; and to remove the disabling barriers that exist in society.  In the context of our discussion about transport today, we can increase income by implementing a cost-of-disability payment.  That would be a personalised payment to people with disabilities to address the extra costs that they experience in order to live an independent life.  It would be a cost of disability payment.<\/p> <p>  The schemes we used to have, the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant scheme, were in essence addressing the extra costs of disability that people experience due to inaccessible transport.  The implementation of the new Health (Transport Support) Bill is an important step, and that should happen as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  The last and most important approach is to remove the disabling barriers that exist in society.  Again, Dr. Kennedy has spoken much more eloquently than I on this topic.  That is one of the crucial ways of reducing those extra costs.  In the context of transport, that would involve the provision of a reliable, accessible and comprehensive public and private transport system that people with disabilities can access on an equal basis to others.

It was never the contention that lesser hours would be good enough.

We have also raised them with the current Government and previous Governments.  All this information is out there in all sorts of different formats, and has been brought forward.

An issue concerning audio was raised at the committee last March and dot matrix facilities are for people who are deaf.  There was a commitment given on foot of that meeting by an official that it was hoped to have those elements in place by 30 September this year, but they are still not in place.  That is the straight-up answer.  The question of whether people are happy having to give 24 hours to 48 hours of notice has been well answered by people here.  It should not exist.  Rosa Parks in the United States was allowed on the bus, although she had to sit at the back.  We do not get on the bus much of the time.  What happened there was wrong and so is this.  <\/p><p>With regard to bus driver training and lifts, I understand from drivers and their representatives that they would be happy to undertake such a step.  We can come back to it later as there are issues with training.  There is the matter of booking cost.  When I was in Brussels with disability representatives last week I met staff from the transport Commissioner's office.  We raised it among a number of matters.  If a state is not charging others to book tickets, there is clearly a violation if a cohort is being charged.  I wonder if a bit of fundraising is going on.<\/p><p>Deputy Robert Troy asked about cuts to the mobility allowance and if we have contacted the Department in that respect.  The petitions committee had a meeting before Christmas attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and it specifically dealt with that matter.  The Deputy is dead right as it was stopped at the end of February 2013 and the devil and all was to be done; it was to be sorted out fairly smartly.  Much has been said about the fact that the scheme has not been closed down and people who were in the scheme can continue in it.  It is almost five years since it was stopped.  People who would have qualified for that scheme over those five years have lost out.  The motorised transport grant was completely abolished, and it would give people a leg-up in buying a new car.<\/p><p>There is quite an interesting solution.  We were told at the time the scheme was abolished because it violated the equal status legislation.  Section 14 of the Equal Status Act 2000 states:<\/p><blockquote>Nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting - (<i>a<\/i>) the taking of any action that is required by or under - <blockquote>(i) any enactment or order of the court,<\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>The Oireachtas could have legislated to keep that scheme as it was running and then dealt with the fact that the scheme was only taking people on up to age 65 years.  It could have introduced subsequent legislation to widen it.  It could have been kept going.  There was mention of prioritising resources in the National Transport Authority, NTA.  It is certainly something to be looked at.  We understand party whips but there is no disability whip when it comes to these matters.  Some issues are prioritised over disability.  We are almost there but we are never there.  This country must swallow hard one of these days and do the right thing.<\/p><p>Deputy Mick Barry asked about the 48-hour notification and focused particularly on Irish Rail.  He mentioned the quiet carriages and less accessible spaces.  We can give information on those chapter and verse.  There will be an opportunity to explore such matters when the rail people come in.  He also mentioned unmanned stations.  With regard to private operators, as a State we give them a licence, so why give this to a for-profit entity without ensuring it is responsible for providing an accessible service?  The person who is disabled should be blind to operators - I hope I will be forgiven for using that phrase - because they should all be able to provide the same service.  One should not need to know the logo.  A public service should be accessible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#N00400","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513171800,"counter":974,"content":"<p>I will take up a couple of points mentioned by Deputy Imelda Munster.  As I said, we welcome the reduction of notice time to four hours, but we do not see it as a finishing point.  We welcome it as a progression from a poor position to a better position but it is not the end.  We want to see fully staffed stations as a matter of course at every location in the country, thus enabling equal access.  The taxi card system would not be a new matter for any Minister in transport or social protection.  We have made the suggestion in many pre-budget submissions and direct engagement with Ministers.  It has always been well received as a good idea but the political will to deliver it is clearly challenging.<\/p> <p>  I echo my colleagues in the sector in that we are very concerned about private bus operators and the ability to deliver an equal and accessible service.  We must ensure that the NTA and the licensing process are rigorous in how they police private operators of bus lines around the country so as to enable equal access, whether people are in Fermoy, Dundalk, Letterkenny or Dublin.  It cannot just be about public services providing accessible transport.  It must be universal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017121300002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris White"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513171800,"counter":975,"content":"<p>The presentations were great.  Unfortunately, I am not surprised by what has been said.  Everybody experiences issues in different ways, but the discrimination is very clear for everyone.  As deaf people, we tend to focus on communication barriers.  I referred to deaf awareness and visibility awareness training, and that may come.  Funding is an issue in providing the training and the Irish Deaf Society would not have sufficient resources to provide deaf awareness training to those bodies.  There needs to be Government support to enhance that awareness and provide training.<\/p> <p>  Before Dublin Airport opened Terminal 2, it asked different organisations to have a look at accessibility issues and try to identify potential barriers.  Five or six years later what we asked for at that time still have not come to fruition.  We asked for live text to be made available but that has not happened.  There is no signing notification either.  Terminal 2 could have had these but the action did not follow the requests.<\/p><p>It can be frustrating that we are involved and are being asked for our views but things are not changing.

It is a great college and they were great and well-meaning boys but they were untrained children.  That was not covered by insurance.  Such a situation is not safe for us.  Apparently, drivers are not allowed to put the ramps down.  I was told that their unions do not allow them to do so because it is not part of their contracts or whatever.  Some drivers put them down.  I had an unfortunate experience with a driver who was quite angry that he had to do so.<\/p> <p>  As regards forgetting people, several disabled people have been forgotten by Irish Rail or other companies.  If a disabled passenger is left stranded, there must be an immediate sanction for the company and an immediate compensatory scheme for the disabled person.  Monetary sanctions always make companies work better.  They should be fined.  There has to be accountability for leaving disabled people sitting on freezing platforms for two, three or four hours and only monetary sanctions will ensure that.  They should be fined and compensation should be given to the affected disabled person.
