Achieving the right governance structure, including when and how to regulate, is central to the performance of each regulated sector.  The financial statements before the committee today are those of the regulators for the aviation, communications and energy sectors, which affect many key aspects of the economy.<\/p><p>  Sector governance arrangements need to be tailored to market conditions.  Where free market conditions exist, private contracts may often be sufficient to protect both private and public interests, subject to oversight by competition authorities and safety and environmental inspectors.  Where markets are weak, or fail in one or more key areas, it may be necessary and cost-effective to implement a system of economic regulation.  In many cases, this is done through an independent regulator or commission with a range of functions or powers.  Depending on the nature of the market, these may include powers to intervene through control over access to the market, directed divestment of assets to reduce market concentration, directed or controlled investments in infrastructure, price control for supplies or services generally aimed at ensuring sustainable development of the sector while avoiding excess profit taking, and monitoring of service standards and performance by market participants, including service access provision for social groups and households in different circumstances.<\/p><p>  Because market and economic conditions are constantly changing, regulators should have the capacity to be flexible and responsive to the appropriate degree.  There needs to be confidence that regulation can respond to external shocks.  Transparency about the performance of regulators is a key element in underpinning that confidence.<\/p><p>  Most regulators are funded through the imposition of levies on market participants, who may have an opportunity from time to time to comment on the level of charges imposed.  A key risk to be avoided is a situation where a regulator loses its independence and becomes captured by market participants. <\/p><p>  I will now briefly outline the key financial results for 2011 for each of the regulators appearing as witnesses today.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation is funded through levies on aviation undertakings and licence fees from the travel industry.  These generated income of &euro;2.7 million in 2011.  The main elements of the commission&rsquo;s expenditure of &euro;2.4 million comprised payroll and pension costs of &euro;1.4 million, with schedules facilitation and consultancies costing around &euro;450,000.  In accordance with the legislation establishing the commission, any surplus of income over expenditure arising in a financial year is taken into account in setting future levies.<\/p><p>  The Commission for Communications Regulation generated &euro;54 million in income comprising &euro;10.9 million from levies on certain providers of electronic communications, postal services and premium rate services to fund the cost of regulation, and &euro;42.6 million from licensing fees for wireless telegraphy, together with licence income arising from the right to use radio spectrum.  The commission&rsquo;s operating costs amounted to &euro;22.3 million with staff and pension costs accounting for nearly half of that total.  Some &euro;6.4 million was spent on technical advice and legal expenses.  The excess of income over the cost of operations is payable - under the direction of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources - to the Exchequer.  This amounted to &euro;30.8 million for 2011.<\/p><p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation finances the cost of its regulation of the electricity and gas sectors through levies on energy undertakings.  In 2011, the income from these levies amounted to &euro;9 million.  The commission was assigned functions under the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Act 2010 with regard to the regulation of petroleum safety activities and has financed the costs incurred to the end of 2011 of &euro;1.6 million through a short-term commercial loan.  It intends to recover these costs through the imposition of a levy.  Over half of the commission&rsquo;s expenditure in 2011 of &euro;9.8 million was made up of payroll and pension costs.  Some &euro;2.3 million was spent on legal, professional and consultancy fees.  The commission is required under legislation to apply any surplus of income over expenditure in setting the levy.<\/p><p>  The financial statements of each of the three regulators received an unqualified audit opinion in respect of the 2011 financial year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700005#D00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Harkness"},{"type":"speech","time":1358417700,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I will now take the opening statements from the aviation regulator, followed by ComReg, and then from the Commission for Energy Regulation.

In this opening statement I will limit myself to three points: the work that the CAR carries out, the expenditures we have incurred for the purpose of carrying out that work over the last ten years, and how we measure our own performance.<\/p><p>  The roles we carry out fall under four groups.  We set a ceiling on charges at Dublin Airport for aeronautical charges the airlines pay to the DAA.  Likewise, we set a ceiling on air traffic control charges the Irish Aviation Authority sets for Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports, which are also paid by the airlines.  We enforce certain air passenger rights under EU laws.  All of our functions, bar one, fall under EU legislation.  In 2012, we received about 3,000 inquiries under this heading.  About 400 of those were matters for ourselves to investigate.  We license three parts of the aviation industry: airlines, travel agents and tour operators, and a class of firm at airports known as ground handlers.  There are 62 airline and ground-handling licences in force at the moment, and about 280 travel trade licences.  There is a more technical role, the last one, whereby under EU law we must choose the runway slot scheduling regime at Dublin Airport and, if required, select a professional services firm to do the actual slot allocation.<\/p><p>  That brings me to a distinction we make in our costs, which are presented in the next slide.  Between core and non-core costs, we class as core costs those which are substantially under our own control.  Non-core costs are those which are essentially driven by the decisions of others.  Those include scheduling, legal expenses and some of the administrative costs that arise when a travel agency or tour operator closes, and we refund customers or, if required, repatriate customers who are abroad.  These expenditures are paid for by a levy on the industry.<\/p><p>  I became commissioner in mid-2006 and the cost of the office has not increased since that date despite the boom time conditions that were in force in the early years.  Since the downturn began, the costs of the office have been cut substantially.  In 2012, they were one third below the costs of 2006, and our staffing was close to one fifth below the level of 2006.  All of these figures are audited accounting information, except for 2012 which are our own estimates.  They will fall to be audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the course of this year, beginning shortly.<\/p><p>  The final slide deals with performance.  We measure and publish a total of 19 indicators of our performance.  These were produced as a consequence of a Government statement in 2009 dealing with economic regulation.  We developed those 19 measures in 2010 covering licensing, consumer protection, the travel industry and trends and costs of the office.  We published them with the 2011 report and will continue to publish them.  A selection are presented in the small table in the slide.<\/p> <p>There is more information available about the office from our corporate website. We also have a dedicated passenger rights website, in a more user-friendly form, to inform members of the public as to what their entitlements are in the event of a flight being cancelled or delayed.  Moreover, we would be happy to respond to any questions the Chairman or members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700005#D01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cathal Guiomard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358418300,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Alex Chisholm, chairperson of the Commission for Communications Regulation, to make his opening presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700006#E00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358418300,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members for the opportunity to appear before the committee today to discuss our accounts and activities.  As chairperson, together with my fellow commissioner, Mr. Kevin O'Brien, I will be very happy to answer any questions members may have in the course of the morning session.  I will provide members with a brief overview of our work and in particular on key financial and governance aspects.<\/p><p>  The Commission for Communications Regulation, known as ComReg, is the national regulatory authority for the electronic, communications and postal sectors.  We were established in 2002, taking over the functions of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation set up in 1997.  ComReg also manages Ireland's radio frequency spectrum and the national numbering resource and regulates the emergency call-answering service, among other activities.  Our overall responsibilities are to promote competition, protect consumers and encourage innovation.  Members may recall that ComReg recently held a successful auction of radio spectrum for next-generation mobile telephone licences.  This will raise &euro;854 million for the Exchequer between now and 2030 and the auction also will allow mobile companies to roll out high-speed mobile communication services from this year.  I also wish to inform members, and I am aware the Chairman tabled a parliamentary question on this subject before Christmas, that &euro;450 million of these auction fees were forwarded to the Exchequer on 14 December last year.<\/p><p>  In terms of our overall mission, the successful spectrum project illustrates in part the kind of work in which ComReg is engaged daily.  Our overarching aim is to facilitate the development of a competitive communications sector in Ireland that attracts investment, encourages innovation and empowers consumers to choose and use communications services with confidence.  To do this, we set regulatory frameworks and we undertake regulatory projects, which often are lengthy and complex, as well as making regulatory interventions, for example, to enforce rules.  I will outline our four principal goals, as set out in our strategy statement for the period 2012 to 2014.  First, our aim is to safeguard the interests of the consumers of communications services by protecting and empowering them.  Second, we apply effective and proportionate regulation to facilitate dynamic and sustainable competition.  Third, we provide regulatory certainty that facilitates innovation and supports investment in communications infrastructure and services.  Fourth, we aim to be a highly effective and innovative organisation ourselves and to provide a centre of excellence that supports and enables all the people who work in our organisation to achieve the objectives set.<\/p><p>  Turning now to funding and operations, ComReg does not receive any funding from the State.  We receive, as members heard from the Comptroller and Auditor General's introduction, levy income from the electronic, communications, postal and premium rate services industries that we regulate and, in addition, we receive licensees and spectrum access fees from firms and individuals, mainly firms, using radio spectrum licensed under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts.  Income in excess of our costs is treated as surplus and handed over to the Exchequer.  Since the establishment of the organisation in 1997, we have passed over more than &euro;820 million in surplus to the Exchequer.  At present, ComReg has a staff of 107 persons.  This is comprised mainly of professionals, engineers, accountants, legal staff, economists and analysts who have the skills and qualifications needed to undertake economic regulation.  Where necessary, we complement the efforts of our own staff with specialist technical advice from suitable external agencies.  Staff costs, technical advice and outsourced services make up the majority of our cost base, which we have been able to reduce in each of the last two years.<\/p><p>  Our income for the year to 30 June 2012 was &euro;57 million, while expenditure was &euro;22 million, leaving a surplus of &euro;35 million.  Members have just heard the figures for the previous year and the surplus in that year was approximately &euro;30 million.  Consequently, our income continues to grow and our expenditure to fall and that obviously expands the surplus as a consequence.  I should mention that the figures for 2012 are subject to ongoing audit at this time by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In addition, I should highlight that this improvement in income and reduction in expenditure is for the second year running.<\/p><p>  Our costs are kept under continual review to ensure we are achieving value for money.  We have achieved savings through initiatives and plans that have been identified in accordance with ComReg's Croke Park agreement action plan.  Based on this and on audited figures for the year to 30 June 2012, we reduced our total costs, excluding legal costs, by 6% and this represents a decrease of approximately 14% from the comparable figure in 2008.  We continually review and update as necessary policies and procedures in respect of expenditure, procurement and risk management.<\/p><p>  In respect of governance, it is ComReg's policy to comply with the code of practice for governance of State bodies and it reports on its compliance with relevant sections of the code either by annual reports or separately by a letter to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Moreover, we have an extensive internal audit programme in place.  It is overseen by the audit committee, which has a majority of external members and which met four times during 2012.  Accountability and transparency obviously are central to the work of economic regulators, as again we heard in the introduction.  We are keenly aware of this and we make sure that we fully comply with the extensive accountability provisions in the Communications Regulation Acts 2002 to 2011, which lay down specific requirements, for example, to conduct open consultations prior to making decisions, to report to Ministers and the Oireachtas on various matters and to bring certain other matters before the courts.<\/p><p>  In 2012, just to highlight a couple of activities, overall it was a very productive year for our agency and members may have seen our written submission, which included a review of that year.  I will highlight some of the projects we have completed which have had significant economic value, such as the multiband spectrum auction, which I mentioned earlier.  However, of almost equal importance, I bring to members' attention the new regulatory frameworks we have put in place for next generation broadband, which is the basis on which companies are investing extensively at present to improve the level of broadband service here.  In addition, I refer to the pricing of bundles and the pricing of both fixed and mobile termination rates, which again make a considerable impact on the market and will collectively, in our view, help to reshape the market towards an even more competitive and high performance future.  Last year was also the year in which ComReg brought into force a new code of conduct for providers of premium rate services to give more protection to users of such services, including for the so-called double opt-in, which has been addressing an area of significant concern.<\/p><p>  In 2013, obviously some of these activities will continue but we also have some new ones.  We must make a firm decision in respect of spectrum trading and we must introduce a price control for universal postal services over the next five years.  We must develop further our plans for various new spectrum assignments, including valuable bands, such as the 2.6 GHz band, and we have a number of consumer initiatives in respect of broadband speeds.  As ever, we continue to refine and, importantly, to enforce existing regulations.  I thank the committee for giving ComReg the opportunity to outline its activities and I am happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alex Chisholm"},{"type":"speech","time":1358418300,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Dermot Nolan, chairperson of the Commission for Energy Regulation, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700006#E00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358418300,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to be present today.  I will give a brief overview on the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and will then deal with any questions members might wish to ask.  The CER is Ireland's independent national energy regulator.  It has broad functions in economic energy issues, in safety issues, as well as in customer protection issues.  These comprise its current set of activities.  These activities have changed over the years.  When the CER was set up in 1999, it originally only had responsibilities for economic regulation of the electricity area.  A few years later, it was given responsibilities in respect of gas regulation and in recent years, it has been given enhanced safety responsibilities in the energy area as well, to the point where at present, approximately a quarter to a third of our staff are generally working in safety areas.  In that sense, we have changed and have been given further responsibilities over the last few years.  Obviously, further details may be found on our website, if anyone wishes to examine that.  The Government has made known its intention, I believe the draft Bill has recently been published, to give the CER, subject to Oireachtas approval, responsibilities for water regulation from approximately 2014 onwards.  That will further change the organisation and give it further responsibilities.  At present the CER has two commissioners, namely, myself and my colleague, Mr. Garrett Blaney.<\/p><p>  I will  turn briefly to key CER activities and will go through them relatively quickly.  The first is what we call the wholesale market, which essentially is the electricity generation market.<\/p> <p>That is jointly regulated.  We regulate it in an entity known as the single electricity market committee.  We do that jointly with Northern Ireland.  It is an all-island initiative.  We have joint functions with an independent member as well in case we disagree.  The committee regulates the generation sector for the entire island.<\/p><p> We then regulate the electricity and gas networks.  They are monopoly networks perhaps similar enough to aviation.  We do price reviews every five years where we directly regulate the sectors.  We investigate how efficient they are, make sure they are efficient and set the level of prices they can charge for the next five years.  That is pure monopoly regulation.<\/p><p> We oversee the Irish smart metering programme as well and it is planned to put energy meters in every house and business in the country in the coming years.  I hope that will stimulate innovation in and of itself, apart from giving considerable consumer benefits.<\/p><p> In terms of the size of the sector; the single electricity market and network sector are large in economic extent and vital to Ireland&rsquo;s electricity security with an annual turnover in electricity of more than &euro;3 billion.  We also monitor energy retail markets, engage in customer protection measures and we resolve customer complaints on the energy sector that come to the CER.<\/p><p> I spoke earlier about safety regulation.  That role has been greatly enhanced in recent years.  In particular, we regulate general gas safety in gas undertakings and businesses.  We also regulate gas and liquid petroleum gas installers &ndash; people who put gas into houses and businesses - and electrical contractors as well.  In recent years we were given a new function in upstream petroleum safety, which makes the CER responsible for regulating safety in the offshore petroleum sector, including Kinsale Energy and the potential Corrib field.  It is envisaged that we will have a function for water regulation in the future as well.<\/p><p> In terms of our financial data, we have included details on expenditure in recent years.  It peaked around 2006 and 2007 when the single electricity market was being set up and it has fallen somewhat since then.  As is the case with the other two regulators, we levy industry every year in December.  We have an arrangement whereby we levy and then spend and if there is a shortfall, we levy less the next year, as is set out specifically in legislation.  We must apportion the levy to specific areas.  We have divided it into electricity, gas and, in recent years, petroleum safety.  The increase in petroleum safety has driven the increase in 2012, as set out in the unaudited accounts, plus legal costs.  As is clear to the committee, there will be greater expenditure in the next two to three years if we take on water functions in addition to the safety functions.  That is all I have to say for the moment but I am happy to take any questions the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358418900,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I wish to question Mr. Guiomard.

This seems to stem from the 2009 price review.  I will not question that process given that it included an appeal and a judicial review.  However, the argument made by the airlines, especially Ryanair, is that when passenger numbers at Dublin Airport were declining significantly - ultimately by approximately 25% - the decision to increase charges disincentivised use of the airport and further compounded the decline in passenger numbers.  Why was the decision taken to increase charges?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700009#H01400","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358420100,"counter":154,"content":"<p>The Dublin Airport Authority published architectural plans and business plans for a second terminal on the October bank holiday weekend of 2006.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation carried out a study of the T2 project which concluded in June 2007.  We were keen to have an early investigation of the matter because the T2 project, in terms of its costs and the size of the building, was very substantial.  We were also very mindful that commitments would be made once the building had been completed that would have to be funded over subsequent decades and the implications for airport charges could be considerable.  We sought to establish that the users of the airport wished to have this facility built and that the construction costs were reasonable.  We published a report on our website in June 2007 containing considerable analysis related to that matter.  We expressed concerns from as early as January 2007 that the building was very large, even relative to the passenger traffic forecasts the Dublin Airport Authority published to accompany the plan.  These have turned out to be too ambitious and, even relative to that much higher level of traffic that was forecast, the building was still large.<\/p><p>  The commission engaged with the industry, including Aer Lingus, and the Dublin Airport Authority.  There was also a Government direction at the time.  All of them were supportive of the building of T2 and I have to say that Ryanair's position, although it did not wish the T2 that was subsequently built to proceed, was supportive of a second terminal being built.  It, too, believed, that traffic would warrant additional capacity at the airport.  As it has turned out, the increase in passenger traffic that was envisaged has not materialised to date and passenger numbers have declined substantially.  The implications for the charges at the airport have been considerable.  <\/p><p>  The commission backloaded the cost of T2 and the terminal's full costs have not fed their way into airport charges thus far.  Our plan would be that this will happen as the building is more intensively utilised.  Nonetheless, the traffic decline and cost increase resulted in a substantial increase in charges in 2009.  As the Deputy noted, this has given rise to controversy and complaint then and since.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700009#H01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cathal Guiomard"},{"type":"speech","time":1358420100,"counter":155,"content":"<p>What increase in charges was passed on to the airlines?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700009#H01600","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358420100,"counter":156,"content":"<p>The increase in the per person charges was approximately &euro;2.70 per passenger in the 2009 pricing decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700009#H01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cathal Guiomard"},{"type":"speech","time":1358420100,"counter":157,"content":"<p>From what level did the charge increase?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700009#H01800","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358420100,"counter":158,"content":"<p>It increased from roughly &euro;7.50 to &euro;10.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700009#H01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cathal Guiomard"},{"type":"speech","time":1358420100,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Has it decreased in recent years or remained flat?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700009#H02000","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358420100,"counter":160,"content":"<p>On the assumption that traffic builds up, there will be a small decline over the four years of the price cap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700009#H02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cathal Guiomard"},{"type":"speech","time":1358420100,"counter":161,"content":"<p>The cap is basically a fixed sum and the manner in which it is achieved depends on passenger traffic.

There are two main brackets within the technical advice.  One is consultancy and the other is outsourcing.<\/p> <p>I will give some examples under each heading to help the Deputy understand the make-up of it.<\/p><p> From the consultancy point of view, the most typical scenario would be where we buy in very specialised economic consultancy and sometimes engineering and other technical consultancies.  In the case of a project like the multi-band spectrum auction, for example, the types of skills necessary to design that auction, such as the very high-level economics and very sophisticated software coding required, are held by perhaps six firms in the world,  We needed those with expertise to advise us on how to get it exactly right.  That particular project proved very successful.  It would not be economic for us to employ those types of people ourselves.  In fact, it is more efficient to secure the required skills on a consultancy basis.  Having said that, we did a huge amount of work ourselves in managing that process, with our own economists, lawyers and spectrum engineers all working on the project.  There was, however, still a need to buy in some element of specialised advice.  It is the most economic way to proceed.<\/p><p> In the case of outscourcing, the services we have tended to outsource are those which are more efficiently done externally.  We have, for instance, outsourced certain types of information technology work, our payroll function and our customer care function.  Another outsourced function is the so-called drive test, where technicians go around with specialised equipment monitoring the strength of mobile telephone signals up and down the country.  We always take the view that we can either do it ourselves or do it externally and what determines which side of the frontier we are on is primarily a value-for-money consideration.  The only exception to that is where certain types of work are actually required to be done externally.  In the case of quality-of-service measures, for example, which apply in regard to both electronic communications and post, it is a requirement of the legislation that they are done by an independent body.  That is a case of compulsory outsourcing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700010#J03500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alex Chisholm","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358421300,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Moving on to the 4G mobile licence auction, will Mr. Chisholm give a brief outline of the steps involved in that process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700011#K00200","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358421300,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Brevity in this regard is a challenge because it has taken us four years to put the auction together.  It was an immense and massively complex project to undertake, but I will attempt to give a brief overview.  We received somewhere between 2,500 and 3,000 pages of submissions from interested parties, some of them written by those parties' law firms, others very technical submissions from economists and specialists.  The aspiration we set for ourselves at the outset was to make the spectrum available on a very competitive and efficient basis.  We sought to conduct a process that was very rigorous and robust and would withstand potential challenge, of which there was a potential risk.  The objective was to have a great degree of certainty at the end of the process rather than getting mired in challenges or tribunals.  We were anxious to ensure a truly commercial and competitive outcome, not one decided by excessive levels of administrative judgment.  That was tremendously important in terms of our desire to ensure that the long-term structure of the mobile industry and the cost of using spectrum would be efficient and manageable.  That will make a huge difference both to the quality and the cost of the mobile services on which we all depend so heavily.<\/p><p>  We are very pleased that at the end of what was admittedly a drawn-out process which has involved 14 consultations thus far, we had the tremendous auction result which we announced in November.  The outturn of &euro;850 million probably exceeded all expectations in terms of financial outcome.  Equally positive, and just as important, was that there were four major winners of spectrum, all of which have declared themselves pleased with the results they achieved and have indicated their intention to roll out very fast mobile broadband services with enhanced capabilities to their customers.

There were also considerable legal costs, both internally and in working with external firms, associated with the requirement to prepare adequately and ensure all of our work, throughout the process, was watertight and capable of withstanding legal challenge.  In fact, our aim was to ensure it would not invite legal challenge.  One must put these expenses against the end result in terms of what we got from the process, and the proof of the pudding is that there has been no challenge.

Instead we set some minimum prices in accordance with an internationally benchmarked approach.  Our advisers provided us with a database of all the results ever obtained in a spectrum auction, to which we made various adjustments for the size of the Irish economy, the amount of spectrum available, the number of firms in the market and so on.  From these data we came up with a conservative minimum estimate of what the payments were likely to be for each part of the spectrum that was on sale.  That was how we priced it.<\/p><p>  What we could not know was how much of an excess there might be.  That depended on the firms and their private, never revealed to us valuations of the spectrum, their business strategies and also how many bidders there would be.  We could see, for example, that the 800 MHz band, which is the new spectrum that was freed up by the move from analogue services to digital terrestrial broadcasting, was attracting a great deal of interest.  There was 30 MHz of paired spectrum available within that band in blocks up to 5 MHz or 10 MHz, with a limit of 10 MHz for each bidder.  This meant that if there were three bidders, everything would fit quite neatly, but less so if there were four.  Factors like that make a huge difference to the competitive edge.<\/p><p>  As it turned out, our minimum estimate was comfortably exceeded.  The lesson there is that no matter how much one consults and dialogues with firms, one will not discover their private valuation for the spectrum until a competitive auction is held.

It is important to bear in mind that we are not dealing with an entirely greenfield site here.  We have had 17 years of mobile licences and there is a lot of mobile spectrum already being used.  Those spectrum provisions are subject to their own rules and regulations as to what level of population coverage must be reached.  Under the ordinary voice telephony requirements, for example, the population coverage requirements vary from 80% up to 90% plus.  However, in terms of what has actually been achieved, the figures are in the 97% to 99% range.  In the case of data services - that is, 3G services - again, there were different requirements, varying between 85% and 90% in different periods of time.  When we set new requirements, the existing ones do not fall away instantly as a consequence.  In the case of 3G, for instance, the requirements will continue until 2022.<\/p><p>  In setting these licence requirements, we had to look at the possibility of an entirely new entrant.  We were not setting a competition which was exclusively for the existing players in the market who were already operating with mobile spectrum.  We also had to take account of the fact that not all of those operators already had spectrum at this particular level, that is, in the 900 MHz band.  Furthermore, we could not specify particular services under the European regime.  In other words, we could not specify the provision of 4G but instead had to provide an offering that was technically neutral and could be used for a range of services.<\/p> <p>It turns out that it probably will be used for 4G but that is actually up to the firms themselves.  With all of those things taken into account, we came up with a 70% level because our primary desire was to ensure that there would not be cherry-picking, with one or perhaps two firms coming in and only providing coverage in the large cities, which we felt might be very destabilising to the overall economics of the industry.  That is why we set the 70% level for all licenceholders but in actual fact the levels that will be achieved will be far in excess of that because of ordinary competitive pressures and the requirements under other parts of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700011#K00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alex Chisholm","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358421900,"counter":216,"content":"<p>The concern that I and others would have is that a 70% requirement really only includes Dublin, the wider area around it and the bigger cities.

In looking at what the actual achievement will be, we need to bear in mind that a 70% population coverage level takes one down to townlands of around 50 persons.  We have said that all licenceholders have to achieve that.  In that context, there are four winners of spectrum which means that four different networks will have to duplicate the mobile network infrastructure down to townlands of 50.  That is quite a high level of duplication but we believe that it is positive competition.  To take the level of duplication beyond that would probably be very wasteful and the consequences of that would be very high levels of charges to consumer and business users.  We have to strike a balance here.<\/p><p>  What we actually think will happen is that the number of operators in that 30% level, bearing in mind that all must cover up to 70%, will very likely turn out to be less than four.  How that emerges will depend on the market dynamics that develop but what we have seen, in observing the market over a number of years, is that all operators have greatly exceeded their minimum requirements because they need to meet the needs of customers.  I am sure the members of this House would have experience of that while travelling throughout the country, using mobile phones and other mobile devices.  Professional users and the ordinary consumers today want to be able to use their devices wherever they are in the country.  They want to have much better data access because they are using their devices more and more for data.  They also want faster speeds.

We thought that debt blocking, which is in place in the UK, was a little too harsh on consumers but we thought debt flagging was reasonable.

I said we had been being given responsibilities in the area of petroleum safety.  This was done in an Act a number of years ago.  Essentially we have to set up an entire framework to regulate safety in offshore petroleum activities at Kinsale, Corrib etc.  That requires the development of a whole new framework and various expenditures.  We are not allowed to levy anybody.  The law prevented us from levying anybody until we set a levy which will be in the next couple of months.  For a two to three period we were in a situation where we needed to fund activities to set up this important framework but we could not levy.  When this happened previously, to respond to the Deputy's earlier comment as to whether we got any money from the Exchequer, we asked whether a loan could be granted in advance.  This was not possible given the financial circumstances this time.  Therefore, we were left with no choice but to borrow from the NTMA and we got permission from both Departments to do so.  We borrowed from the NTMA for a two year period because the Act makes it clear that money we take in from those who supply electricity can only be used for electricity.  We cannot use it for any activities relating to, say, petroleum safety.  In that sense we are in a bind and the only way out of it was a commercial loan.

Obviously it has been reduced but the protections offered to senior citizens in terms of the free gas and electricity allowance tend to pay most of their bills.  I am not in any sense trivialising some of the difficulties facing senior citizens, but in terms of the people who appear to be in arrears and having the most difficulty paying bills and are seeking assistance, most of them are not senior citizens.

We were in front of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications in November last when we discussed this at some depth.  I sent further information and I will send the information to the committee in this regard as well.<\/p><p>  In terms of its profitability, the ESB's main activities are fundamentally in electricity generation and networks.  It is a segmented company.  There is a networks company, there is a generation company and there is a supply business, and it attributes profitability to all three parts.<\/p><p>  I am, perhaps, anticipating.  The question that came up before Christmas was whether the overall level of ESB profitability was too high.  It had reported six-month figures at that point in time of just over &euro;220 million.  I will try and say now what I said then.  I would say there are three factors.<\/p><p>  One, we were genuinely concerned at this level of profitability but we were assured by the ESB in the conversations we had with it - this is reasonably consistent with previous years - that full-year profitability would be nothing like twice that.  In particular, it had bought the Northern Ireland Energy Company, NIE, as it is called, and some of their profitability is purely attributable to what is called a financial swap, the details of which entirely escape me.  About &euro;70 million of it is entirely attributable to that.  Profitability will be much lower in the second half of the year.<\/p><p>  Profitability, in general, in the energy sector will, I think, fall somewhat over the next few years for the following reason.  Over the past five years, any generator of electricity has essentially had what is called a free carbon allowance.  There is a price paid for carbon.  Part of the electricity cost that the end consumer pays is the price of carbon.  The price - coal is dirty, gas is less dirty - is carbon emissions.  There is a set of EU rules that this must be reflected in prices.  However, for various reasons which I could not pretend to elucidate, when this was set up they were given five years of free carbon allowance, so although in some sense they had to pay for them, they were given them for free which is a slightly odd situation.  As of December last year, that disappeared for all generation companies, not just the ESB - obviously, the ESB controls a significant share of generation in Ireland.  The ESB, and other companies, should have somewhat lower profitability as a result because they will be paying for this carbon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700018#R01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1358425500,"counter":426,"content":"<p>The metric for profitability of an organisation such as the ESB is still hundreds of millions of euro.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013011700018#R01100","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358425500,"counter":427,"content":"<p>It is.

I am sure hundreds of pages of conditions are attached to it.  What monitoring is done to ensure they comply with their licence conditions?  The Vodafone signal has been deteriorating and weakening in large parts of Ireland.  I know of many locations throughout the country where the previously modest signal from Vodafone has become very poor.  The service which the licence stated should be provided is not being provided.  How often does the regulator audit masts to examine signal strength?  What is the regulator doing to ensure those who pay for a service continue to receive it?  Vodafone has failed in the delivery of its signal and it is deteriorating in some areas.  I seek reassurance from the regulator that something will be done about it.  The company exists to make a profit and if it can cut costs and corners and possibly weaken the signal and have a few additional grey signal patches, it can probably cope with it.

The Deputy asked in particular about the obligations Vodafone faces, and under its GSM 900 and 1800 licences it has an obligation of 99% population coverage and 92% geographical coverage.  Under its 3G licences it has an obligation of 85% population coverage.  These are some of the key licence obligations it holds.  The Deputy asked what do we do about it.  Drive tests are conducted on our behalf whereby specialised equipment is moved throughout the country to test the strength of signals at various places.  Approximately 60,000 such tests are conducted in a year.<\/p> <p>We analyse the responses from our contact centre, for example, where people say that there does not appear to be a good signal, or where people make complaints or raise issues of which there is not a huge volume.  When those issues are raised we make sure that the route taken by the drive testers is informed by those areas.  They make a particular point of going to areas of reported weak coverage.  We then use the results of those tests for two further tests.  First, we use them to make sure that the companies comply fully with their licence obligations, which is the case.  Second, because those are average national levels we also use them as a way of providing useful feedback to the companies to enable them to address any areas of deficiency that they might have.<\/p><p> The other type of activity which is important for looking at the overall quality of signal coverage across the country is the amount of spectrum that is available and for what period.

Mr. Nolan and I know that people will not want to see the erection of pylons across the landscape on the scale proposed.  We both know this proposed development will go to all the planning authorities and will be referred to Europe.  Given that most of the electricity is required on the eastern side, very little of the proposed generation capacity is in that part of the country.  In essence we are producing electricity in the area in which it is not needed and transfer it by pylon to where it is required.  Is it not the essence of sustainability to produce the goods close to where they are required?  I asked the chief executive of Eirgrid whether he would ensure that electricity is generated closer to where it is needed?  His response is that he has no role in that matter, that producers can produce it where they like but he is legally obliged to get it to where it is required.  Mr. Nolan as chairman of CER regulates both the producers and the transport network for transporting the electricity.  Does he agree it makes more sense from the environmental point of view to produce it close to where it is required?  We are embarking on producing electricity in areas where it is not required and transporting it at enormous cost and thereby creating a significant environmental impact in the process.

Most of the questions that would have been asked by this committee were asked by Mr. O'Leary.  He has pursued the Commissioner for Aviation Regulation, CAR, for answers to his questions.  He wrote to us on 20 March to seek guidance as to why we failed to take action on a quango that employed 18 people.  This is the first time that the three regulators have appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.  We invited them so that we could get a sense of how each one's work, costs and so on impacted on the price the consumer pays for a service, etc.  This has been a worthwhile exercise and members may wish to invite the regulators to appear separately, perhaps alongside their respective Departments so that an overall view could be outlined.  Mr. O'Leary might be pleased to hear this.<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Leary also suggested that the committee should indicate why we believed that \"Irish airlines and passengers should fund this bureaucratic waste and incompetence\".  These are his words, not mine.  I am interested in bureaucratic waste and incompetence, in that it is our job to ensure there is none.  There must be efficiency, value for money and so on.  Achieving these goals forms part of the process of cross-examining or conversing with witnesses about their costs, as does showing the public what those costs are.  Some are substantial, for example, the &euro;1 million in rent, the bonuses, the salaries, etc.  These matters are of public interest.  I hope that, by way of this exchange, we bring pressure to bear, reduce costs - each of the organisations before us is attempting to do this anyway - and ensure value for money.

All other amendments will be discussed individually.<\/p><p>  I will now set out the amendments that have been ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 156(3), which provides that an amendment to a Bill that could have the effect of imposing or increasing a charge upon the Revenue may not be moved by any member, save a member of the Government or a Minister of State. <\/p><p>  The purpose of the Bill is to replace vocational educational committees with bodies to be established as education and training boards, and to reform and modernise governance in this section.  Amendment No. 6 from Deputies Daly, O'Brien and McConalogue proposes as an additional function of the ETB through the provision of Irish language service to any training or education centre or school that operates through Irish within the ETB area.  As the amendment would impose a positive obligation on the ETBs to provide an Irish language service to both ETB schools and non-ETB schools, it involves a potential charge on the Revenue and must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 156(3).<\/p><p>  Section 28 on membership provides that each ETB shall consist of 18 members to be appointed as follows: ten local authority representatives; two staff representatives; two parents' representatives and four community representatives.  Section 36 provides for payment to ETB members of travel and subsistence expenses reasonably incurred in attendance at meetings of the ETB and other events.  A number of amendments propose to increase the number of members of an ETB as set out.  Amendment No. 29, tabled by Deputies Daly and O'Brien, proposes to increase that number from 18 to 20 and amendment No. 39 by Deputy Daly provides for the appointment of two members from the adult student body to an ETB as an additional category of representatives, and is consequential on the proposed increase in membership from 18 to 20.  Amendment No. 38 from Deputy O'Brien is also consequential on the proposed increase in the membership of an ETB and proposes to increase the number of community representatives to be appointed from four to six.  Amendment No. 52 from Deputy O'Brien is consequential on amendment No. 38 in providing for the method of appointment of community representatives, it also makes provision for the appointment of six community representatives, increased from four, to an ETB.  Amendment No. 34 from Deputy McConalogue proposes the number of members elected by local authorities may be increased from ten members in cases where two or more counties are represented on an ETB.  In amendment No. 36, Deputy McConalogue proposes there should be at least one staff representative on an ETB from each county within an ETB area and where there are more than two counties within an ETB area, the number of staff representatives shall be increased proportionally.  Amendment No. 37 from Deputy McConalogue proposes there shall be at least one parent representative on an ETB from each county within an ETB area where there are two or more counties within an ETB area, the number of parent representatives shall be increased proportionally.  In amendment No. 40, Deputy McConalogue provides for the appointment of one learner in a children's detention school or other such facility as an additional category of representatives on an ETB.<\/p><p>  These amendments, as they propose an increase in the membership of an ETB, would give rise to a potential charge on the Revenue and must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 156(3).<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 61 from Deputy McConalogue proposes that an ETB school boards of management shall include at least two members of the ETB and at least one of those members must be present at the meetings of the board of management.  As members of the ETB receive travel and subsistence expenses for attendance at meetings, this amendment could give rise to a potential charge on the Revenue and must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 156(3).<\/p><p>  We will now proceed to the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700003#B00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358416800,"counter":775,"content":"<p>Section 1 agreed.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358416800,"counter":776,"content":"<p>SECTION 2<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1358416800,"counter":777,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote><br \/>In page 8, line 28, after &#8220;instruction&#8221; to insert the following:<br \/>&#8220;to include apprenticeships (formerly provided by F&Aacute;S), adult literacy and community and adult education&#8221;.<\/blockquote>I ask the Minister to consider inserting this line to include apprenticeships formerly provided by F&Aacute;S, adult literacy and community and adult education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700003#B00500","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1358416800,"counter":778,"content":"<p>Before dealing with the first amendment to the Bill, I would like to make the committee aware there are a small number of matters on which I am considering amendments on Report Stage.  With the permission of the Chairman and in the interests of ensuring fairness, and in respect for the committee, I will briefly outline these.  The reason for doing so is that I cannot properly introduce them on Report Stage unless they have been referred to during Committee Stage.<\/p><p>  In moving the Bill on Second Stage, I referred to the fact that the published general scheme of the Bill permitted education and training boards to jointly operate education facilities with bodies that are not education and training boards.  It also contained an enabling provision allowing them to provide support services for other providers.  While this was not included in the published Bill, I indicated that I intended to introduce the necessary amendment on Committee Stage.  Unfortunately it has not been possible to finalise the draft of this provision in time for the committee's consideration of the Bill today.  I remain committed, however, to the inclusion of this provision and intend to bring forward the necessary amendment on Report Stage to give effect to this policy.<\/p><p>  In the published Bill, the Minister is enabled to request the Irish Vocational Education Association to give assistance to education and training boards for the effective implementation of a ministerial direction.  I want to consider if the legislation should reflect the IVEA's current and potential future role both in its capacity to coordinate information and to provide support more generally within the sector.  I may wish to return to this issue on Report Stage.<\/p><p>  Finally, there is a small number of human resource matters, particularly for new chief executives, that are needed to future-proof the restructured sector and to ensure there is a degree of flexibility.  My officials are exploring these points with the drafting office.<\/p><p>  Turning to Deputy McConalogue's amendment, I am inclined to accept it. I will bring to Cabinet the draft of the legislation to deal with the dissolution of F&Aacute;S and those who had apprenticeships under F&Aacute;S.  The speaking note I have states that the definition of education and training facility is deliberately broad as it is intended to cover any place other than a recognised school or centre for education which provides education, training or instruction.  It does not need to be owned, or even run directly, by an education and training board.  The key requirement is that the board maintains or resources it.  I intend to cover the courses the Deputy refers to, and other courses.  It is also intended to be broad enough to anticipate the changes to be brought about by the establishment of SOLAS, the new further education and training body to which I referred earlier.<\/p> <p> My preference is to maintain the current wide definition without going into individual examples.  If we were to start to set down an indicative list of what is to be included, doubts could creep in about courses not on the list.  As I noted, Deputy McConalogue and I are not at odds on this matter.  However, as F&Aacute;S is about to be abolished - the amendment refers to apprenticeships \"formerly provided by F&Aacute;S\" - I am open to considering this measure to provide for a degree of continuity that people other than lawyers would necessarily understand.  I invite the Deputy to table the amendment on Report Stage and we will consider it again. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700003#B00600","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358417400,"counter":780,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister's suggestion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700004#C00200","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1358417400,"counter":781,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy intend to withdraw and resubmit he amendment on Report Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700004#C00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1358417400,"counter":782,"content":"<p>Is the Minister asking that I remove the reference to F&Aacute;S?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700004#C00400","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1358417400,"counter":783,"content":"<p>No.  While I am inclined to accept the amendment, I do not wish to do so yet as I would first like to obtain legal advice.

The effect of Deputy McConalogue&rsquo;s amendment would be to require that these functions be done \"in accordance with the Youth Work Act 2001\".  It should be noted that subsection (5) provides that &ldquo;youth work&rdquo; has the same meaning as it has in the Youth Work Act 2001.  In addition, the inclusion of this function here does not take away from the provisions of the 2001 Act and, through a later amendment, the references to vocational education committees in that Act will be changed to education and training boards.<\/p><p>  The reason for the inclusion of youth work services in the Bill is to ensure that education and training boards are enabled to assist in the implementation of policy in this area which is determined by my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.

The reason these requirements are coming into effect is that youth work is no longer a responsibility of the Department as it has been transferred to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700004#C02400","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1358417400,"counter":803,"content":"<p>As the Minister is satisfied that the Bill, as worded, accommodates my position, I will withdraw the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700004#C02500","speaker":"999"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358417400,"counter":804,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1358417400,"counter":805,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 6 has been ruled out of order as it involves a potential charge on the Revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700004#C02700","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358417400,"counter":806,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 6 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1358417400,"counter":807,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 22 are related and may be discussed together.

Its purpose is to make clear that where an ETB intends to propose a resolution to suspend its chief executive, a notice of intention to propose that resolution must be served on the chief executive.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 relate to the power to suspend and remove a chief executive.  At present, a notice of intention to propose such a resolution requires the signatures of at least one third of education and training board members.  The resolution must be approved of two thirds of members to be passed.<\/p><p>  Given the pivotal role of a chief executive in the running of an education and training board and the effect such a process can have both on him or her and on the organisation generally, this procedure is not something to be entered into lightly.  I have sought to keep the maximum number of members on an education and training board at a relatively modest level to ensure that the governance of the new bodies is workable.  We will return to this matter later.  As a result, it is sufficient for a notice to suspend to be considered if a mere six members approve of it.  Having reflected on this, in my judgment it is too low a threshold.  I am therefore proposing to increase this threshold to half the members or nine people.  Regarding the threshold to have the resolution passed, I have looked again at the local government model from which this is drawn.  In the corresponding provision for county managers, the threshold required is three quarters rather than two thirds.  I am proposing to amend this provision to bring it into line with that position.<\/p><p>  These provisions set the thresholds which, once reached, trigger consideration of suspension of a chief executive and the initiation of a disciplinary process.  The levels set for them must be reasonable having regard to the need to have a consensus among board members as to the seriousness of the matter before them.  I believe that the revised thresholds achieve this.  If there is any change in the composition of the total numbers, we might have to revisit this.  I put the members on notice about that because I am aware it is a matter of concern for people.  However, in the context of 18 members, I propose that members accept these new threshold levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700005#D01500","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1358418000,"counter":831,"content":"<p>If there was a change at local government level, would that have any impact?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700005#D01600","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speech","time":1358418000,"counter":832,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700005#D01700","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1358418000,"counter":833,"content":"<p>It is being used as a mirror.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700005#D01800","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speech","time":1358418000,"counter":834,"content":"<p>We are using the current system and practice in local government.

In regard to staff, the Minister of the day is conferred with a regulation-making power to establish women-only and men-only panels from which people will be elected.  That is the position under the current regulations.  In the case of local authority members, current gender balance requirements applicable to members appointed to VECs can and have given rise to practical difficulties.  Those difficulties arise particularly where a gender balance requirement is applied in a situation where several bodies are coming together to form the local authority membership of an education and training board.<\/p><p>  I would personally favour the introduction of gender quotas in some form for local elections.  It is probably the only way in which this issue can be fairly addressed.  In the absence of such strictures, however, and having regard to the mandate of members who are democratically elected in local elections, I am reluctant to attempt to impose gender balance criteria in regard to education and training boards to which local authority members are appointed and form a majority of the ETB membership.  Nevertheless, I am open to giving this matter further consideration and the Deputy is welcome to return to it on Report Stage.  As a former member of a local authority, he will acknowledge that where there is an imbalance in the gender composition of an authority, a requirement that its appointments to the VEC and subsequently the ETB must be so balanced could prove unworkable.  That is our concern.  It is not that we are opposed ideologically to the notion of gender balance.

The issue in this case is that even if the same legislative provisions regarding the selection of candidates as will apply to general elections were also to apply to local elections, those provisions relate only to the nomination of candidates.  The bottom line is that voters will ultimately determine the gender mix of elected members.  If we were to stipulate that a local authority which does have a gender balance in its membership must ensure the same balance is achieved in its appointments to the education and training board, we would effectively be discriminating against such authorities as against those which do not have a gender balance.  We cannot have legislation which treats local authorities differently in respect of their nominations to VECs and ETBs.  What Deputy O'Brien is proposing would actually impose a restriction in terms of who can be appointed by a local authority.  The requirement would not simply be that the authority must put forward a particular type of candidate; there would actually be a limitation on its democratic mandate.  That is my difficulty with these amendments.<\/p><p>  Deputy Charlie McConalogue's earlier amendment, which was withdrawn, sought to impose a restriction on the staff that could be employed by local authorities.

This is a considerable improvement on the current position whereby parents of registered students do the electing but the representatives themselves do not need to be parents of students in VEC schools.

The direction can specify that, if it is not possible to find an ETB member within the specified distance, such a committee can consist entirely of non-members.<\/p><p>  The Department has taken a policy decision to the effect that living in the locality is, all other elements being equal, a more important factor than being an ETB member.  It is important and of paramount concern that local voices be heard on these governance structures.  A school is of a specific area and community.  Schools draw their board of management members from their localities.  There is no reason that ETB schools should be any different in this respect.  The board will still have nominees on these committees, but it is not essential that these nominees be members of the board.

I take the point about unacceptable practices from the past, which we must get away from.  In VECs across the country, members would have had to travel to schools far away when somebody who lived closer could have just as easily represented the VEC board of management.<\/p><p>  With the way the Bill is laid out, it is quite likely that in many instances boards of management could be meeting without members of the education and training board being present.  That creates governance issues, including ensuring proper linkages between the education and training board and a board of management.  Issues may arise and people should be in a position to contribute to an education and training board meeting with authority with regard to what is going on with the board of management.  If we do not ensure in legislation that education and training board members are always present at board of management meetings, there will be governance issues that could be preventable.  These will take up time if experience is not brought to bear.<\/p><p>  We have mentioned areas that are close to two or three counties, but I am not looking for large boards.  We have reduced the number of education and training board members.  When we speak about a large geographical area, there is a difficulty with the workload that is put on board members, and we should balance having an efficient education and training board with ensuring there is capacity without exceptional duress to be present at board of management meetings.  This concerns a critical role of the education and training board with regard to governance.  Boards of management often need such interaction but with this legislation, the obligation is not there.<\/p><p>  Some of the amendments seek additional members on a board where three VECs are amalgamating.  Elected representatives will ensure there is good representation from each area but there should be additional parent representatives, preferably one from each county.  Without having such a level of flexibility, there will be exceptional pressure on an education and training board in carrying out the role and linking properly to boards of management.  I object to the types of practice that went on in the past in many VECs, and we must ensure that we take the most sensible approach in ensuring we involve people who live close by.<\/p><p>  In some instances it may be useful to have a board member from outside a parish, as it can be difficult for those close to an issue to act.

We should do it rather than have it done to us.<\/p><p>  There will be a transition period.  I cannot think of any other way of doing it and I said this in Piper's Hill at a meeting of the Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA.  In Mayo, Leitrim and Sligo, for example, between the enactment of the Bill and the local elections in June 2014, the combined membership of three vocational education committees, VECs, will meet together, and this will attract public attention.  We will need a communications strategy to minimise the banner headlines we are likely to see.  <\/p><p>  I was struck by a point made by Deputy McConalogue.  Sometimes a stranger from outside the parish can say things that cannot be said in a more intimate community.  I stand over the proposals, but many local community schools will not have a direct member of an education and training board, ECB, on its board of management.  Does that make them any less democratic than the nuns' or brothers' schools up the road?  The traditional assertion has been that there is democratic accountability in a VEC school by virtue of its composition and the fact that there was usually a member of the VEC on its board.  The motivation for being a member of a school board could be questioned.  Whether or not the member made a significant contribution to the discourse of the board of management could also be questioned.  Practice and experience will vary.<\/p><p>  One of the strengths of VEC community schools is that they are accountable to the electorate, if the electorate want to pursue that accountability, through the chief executive or members of the VEC in a way that none of the free voluntary schools are accountable at all.  We have an emerging situation in some of our primary schools where the bishop does not want to know if there is a problem on the ground.  In a primary school the catchment area is smaller, there is a board of management and a parent can get involved, but they are still at the mercy of parents' representatives or community representatives who do not want to exercise their responsibilities.<\/p><p>  I do not have a formula for dealing with this.  One can over-prescribe requirements but one is dependent on human behaviour for which one cannot legislate.  I will reflect and read the blacks of the Committee Stage debate to see if we can get a balance between the perception of democratic accountability and the exercise of that responsibility in a frugal manner, more frugal than has previously been the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700010#K00200","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1358420700,"counter":945,"content":"<p>In my experience of local authorities, although I have never served on a VEC, councillors make difficult and unpopular decisions.

In the past, a former councillor who ran a shop and lost his or her seat in an election could end up representing the business community because he or she is a mate, etc., and unless we specify clearly what is the business community or an adult learner, we will have a problem.  For example, if people are doing a course, they are learning and, therefore, they are adult learners, even though they may have stood and failed to be elected to the local council.  Those are the dynamics that we all know within our own parties but they are within the democratic space that makes politics work.  The alternative is to say to IBEC to nominate a business representative or to NALA to nominate an adult learner.  Does that dilute democratic accountability and control from the point of view of the party system because democracy does not exist without the party system?  We are one of the few democracies in Europe that pays no recognition to the role of political parties in democracy, which is why the so-called leader's allowance that goes to individual Oireachtas Members does so because legally - I was the Minister for Finance who brought it in with the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin - one cannot discriminate against Members who are not members of a political party.<\/p><p>  If the responsibility is left to the elected members of the ETBs to have a say in who is co-opted onto them, it will be left to the elected political system, in which I have full faith, notwithstanding the individual failures of all of us on occasions.

They do reflect a one-party state when the Government of the day can propose anything it likes and Members of the Oireachtas who are not Government supporters cannot do so.  I see the illogicality of it.<\/p><p>  Returning to the spirit of what Deputy McConalogue proposes, and an earlier question that arose.  If the expenses regime changes as all kinds of other matters have had to change, I get the sense from members here that, all other matters being equal, it is desirable that representatives of the ETB, either full members or persons nominated by it to be members of a board of management of a school, should be facilitated.  I understand this is what Deputy McConalogue is trying to achieve.  As a result, logically, a problem may well arise.  The net point is do we trust each other as elected democrats, with the staff representatives and with the parents' representative.  Say, for the sake of argument, that in Carrick-on-Shannon there is no member on the board of management who will be able to sit but that a presence on the ETB is desired.  If such a person cannot be an elected member of the board, a parent representative who, by coincidence, might be from the same school, or a staff member who might live in the area and who could attend the community, then the elected members - they would be ten out of the 14 - could decide in the normal way in which politics works to nominate somebody who is well known - it could be a party activist or a respected person - who is willing to go on the board of the community school in that area.  Deputy McConalogue suggests if there are two such members there is a guarantee that there will always be oversight if an issues arises.<\/p><p>  We do not have any democratic accountability in the free voluntary sector.  There are just under 500 schools in that sector and we do not know what goes on.<\/p><p>  I refer to the existing management infrastructure.  An existentialist crisis is imminent here.  The Catholic Church and the religious teaching orders provided an infrastructure of highly-dedicated highly-motivated persons.  For whatever reason - one can dispute their motivation or not, but one cannot doubt their motivation and commitment to education - they are disappearing in terms of real numbers.  There is an emerging vacuum arising in this regard.  We have a period over the next three to four years to provide for democratic accountability in terms of membership.  I refer to a citizen, not an elected member, who is appointed by the ETB of, for instance and to take the biggest one geographically, Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim.  The Government is asking the person would he or she be prepared to represent the ETB in his or her capacity as a citizen by sitting on the board of the community school in his or her area because he or she has a connection with the school or whatever.  In that way if anything untoward arises or if there is an issue we can then make a contribution.  That is essentially what we are concerned with.<\/p><p>  While the amendment is out of order, I can resubmit it at Report Stage if I wish.  The present system of democratic accountability is limited geographically, with 16 as against 33 areas, and there were more than 33.  I think I am correct in stating that, originally, there were 38 VECs at one stage.  There is a big difference between 38 and 16.<\/p><p>  Logistically, it will not be possible to have the eyes and ears of the ETB on the board of a school for the reason we suggested.  It seems better that we have the capacity to nominate through the ten elected members which, given our political system, will be broadly cross-party representative.  Given proportional representation, it will certainly be democratically representative unlike the free voluntary sector.  This is not in any way to impugn the free voluntary sector.  They will have to address their issues of accountability and representation.  The legacy of the VECs since 1930 is that, however imperfect, ultimately, it still has a line of democratic accountability that does not exist anywhere else in the post-primary sector.<\/p><p>  We are changing the geography.  We are reducing the number to 16.  It seems we should have representation indirectly, if not directly.  We are providing for it directly but we are saying that if the member does not live in the area, then he or she is invalid as a member for the board of management of a particular school, and there is a coherence about that.<\/p><p>  I understand Deputy McConalogue's amendment provides that at all stages the eyes and ears of the ETB will be present on the boards of management of schools in question.  Is that a fair description?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700013#N00500","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1358422500,"counter":994,"content":"<p>Yes.  That has been the practice at VEC level previously.  There have been abuses in terms of how it has been operated but the Bill moves away from a position whereby the ETB has a presence.  I spent a short time, 18 months, as a member of a VEC and sat on two or three boards of management, actually within my own area.  I found it useful that there was a member of the VEC able to comment to VEC board members and it nipped issues in the bud.  It meant there was a linkage at all times between the VEC and its core work at secondary level, which was managing the schools under its remit.  If we get away from that culture whereby there is not a requirement to have an ETB board member at management meetings, over time one will see it becoming increasingly the practice at ETBs that there will not be ETB board members at meetings because it will be difficult and inconvenient for them to attend.<\/p> <p>I attended board of management meetings and they were not necessarily something to which one looked forward.  They were a pain but it was an obligation and the meetings were productive and useful.<\/p><p> Every school has ongoing issues, such as disciplinary or developmental issues.  It would also be very useful for those in VEC management to have somebody on the board who attends meetings who they can ask about what is happening.  The VEC can also talk to school management but an ETB board member could provide this link.  If we move away from this, over time a vacuum will be created which would be to the detriment of the sector.  It would allow issues arise and develop which may not happen as quickly if the link were in place.<\/p><p> I understand what the Minister is saying about having a panel and appointing people directly.  This acknowledges the issue which exists but it does not ensure a direct link between the ETB and each board of management.  I am not sure whether having 18 members makes it logistically feasible.  It would put a lot of work on the members to attend.  It would be more than possible to draw up a structure to ensure members attend local schools.  A scheme should be in place so that where a certain amount of work is to be done a formula ensures members attend the school closest to them and the work burden is divided evenly.

At one stage we were discussing the composition of the ETB itself, but now we are discussing boards of management at VEC schools.  We have 723 post-primary schools and approximately 250 are in the community and VEC, or free voluntary, sector.  Leaving aside isolated schools in isolated communities and to take Dublin city as an example, it has a school population of approximately 31,000 in 80 schools, which means the average population is less than 300.  They are simply not viable in terms of subject choice or varying levels of subject.  There will be some degree of consolidation and rationalisation over time given the exigencies of demographic pressures, and not only the free voluntary sector will contract.  Increasingly we must have a line of democratic accountability and not elections for a school board as exist in some parts of the United States.  We have separated education from the local authority.  In Britain it is a function of the local authority, in some cases with spectacular success, but in many other areas with not as much success.  If one does not have a good local authority, one does not have good schools. This is why the Labour Party Government under Tony Blair introduced the academies for non-performing schools, which the Conservative Party has accelerated.<\/p><p>  I am open to the idea that on the board of management of each school there must be somebody with a direct line of answerability and accountability to the ETB whom the board members and management of the ETB can ask what is happening, just as Deputy McConalogue outlined.

There is a need to have a clear understanding about re-deployment or transfers which, give the physical scale of some of the bodies we are talking about, could have an onerous impact on the working conditions of staff, be they teachers or VEC\/ETB staff members themselves.  However, I do not think - the Deputy might agree with me - that it is appropriate to put it into primary legislation because in order to change it, if there was a change in the agreement, one would have to come back to this House to get it changed.

In order to achieve this goal, my Department has received the support of a number of State bodies, including the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, to assist in the delivery of projects.  The NDFA, which continues to support the Department's public private partnership, PPP, initiatives, has agreed to take responsibility for the delivery of approximately 20 school projects by traditional methods under a devolved scheme currently being finalised.  The projects in question are anticipated to proceed to construction in 2014.  The NDFA will be expected to supervise the design and construction of each designated project and will, on behalf of the Department, manage the procurement of design teams, required consultants and the appointment of contractors.<\/p><p>  To achieve the delivery of this scheme, the NDFA has advised the Department that changes are required to its legislation.  These changes are to expand the NDFA's procurement capability beyond its public private partnership focus, conferring on it the power to procure contractors and to execute contracts for these more traditional projects.  In addition, the proposed amendments will, where necessary, enable the NDFA to process payments to parties acting on its behalf for the delivery of the designated projects including consultants, design teams and contractors, or to assist the Department in processing those payments.  These amendments are designed to achieve those objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700016#Q00600","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358424300,"counter":1056,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358424300,"counter":1057,"content":"<p>SCHEDULE 1<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1358424300,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 77:<\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px\">In page 51, to delete lines 4 to 31 and substitute the following:<\/div><\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>Item<br \/>(1)<\/div><\/th><th><div>Year and Number<br \/>(2)<\/div><\/th><th><div>Short Title<br \/>(3)<\/div><\/th><th><div>Extent of Repeal<br \/>(4)<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td>No. 29 of 1930<\/td><td>Vocational Education Act 1930<\/td><td>The Whole Act<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><td>No. 42 of 1935<\/td><td>Local Authorities (Mutual Assurance) Act 1935<\/td><td>Section 2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><td>No. 50 of 1936<\/td><td>Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 1936<\/td><td>The Whole Act<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><td>No. 9 of 1944<\/td><td>Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 1944<\/td><td>The Whole Act<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td>No. 24 of 1946<\/td><td>Local Government Act 1946<\/td><td>The reference to &#8220;vocational education committee&#8221; in subsection (7) of section 68<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><td>No. 1 of 1947<\/td><td>Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 1947<\/td><td>The Whole Act<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><td>No. 33 of 1950<\/td><td>Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 1950<\/td><td>The Whole Act<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><td>No. 37 of 1953<\/td><td>Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 1953<\/td><td>The Whole Act<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>9<\/div><\/td><td>No. 28 of 1962<\/td><td>Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 1962<\/td><td>The Whole Act<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><td>No. 15 of 1970<\/td><td>Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 1970<\/td><td>The Whole Act<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>11<\/div><\/td><td>No. 31 of 1993<\/td><td>Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993<\/td><td>Section 19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><td>No. 20 of 1999<\/td><td>Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Act 1999<\/td><td>Section 12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>13<\/div><\/td><td>No. 23 of 2001<\/td><td>Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001<\/td><td>The Whole Act, other than section 36<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>14<\/div><\/td><td>No. 37 of 2001<\/td><td>Local Government Act 2001<\/td><td>Section 29(2)<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>As I mentioned towards the beginning of the Committee Stage debate, the Bill on its publication provided for the repeal of all the Vocational Education Acts.

to insert &#8220;, THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCE AGENCY ACT 2002&#8221;.<\/blockquote>On the change of name of the Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA, I wish to make the following comments, which are relevant at this point in order that members can co-ordinate their legislative activities and facilitate the IVEA in its transfer to its new name.  Officials from the Department have been in contact with the IVEA with regard to the proposed change of name.  I understand the association is currently going through an internal process to ratify a change of name to reflect the structural reform taking place in the sector overall and obviously, the name of the IVEA must reflect that change.  The Department has considered this issue and has raised the matter with the drafting office.  The advice of that office is that an amendment changing the reference to the IVEA to its new name cannot be made until the association has formally approved and given effect to that change.  I have indicated to the IVEA that if the change of name has been formalised in time for Report Stage, for which no date has yet been set, I will bring forward an amendment to reflect that.  If the renaming process has not taken place in advance of Report Stage, then it will need to await another legislative item, such as the SOLAS Bill, which is expected to be published shortly.  As I indicated to members earlier, the Bill has been signed off and will be brought to the Cabinet formally by me next Tuesday and will be published.  Thereafter, it is a matter of when Members take it in the House.  In other words, I am not waiting for a train that is not scheduled to arrive, as hopefully this will happen within the next six weeks, as that is the envisaged timespan.<\/p><p>  Therefore, given the current state of play on this issue, any amendment is premature at this time and unfortunately I cannot accept one.  Members cannot put into statutory legislation a name that does not, as yet, have the sanction of the constituent parts that must formally sign off on it and it could be challenged accordingly.  This is the reason I cannot accept such an amendment.  However, the intent is that if the IVEA can come forward with a formally changed name in time for Report Stage, I certainly will do it then.  If not, there is another train approaching onto which I can put it quite readily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700016#Q02400","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358424300,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358424300,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>Title, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1358424300,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>May I say a few words before Committee Stage concludes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12013011700016#Q02700","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1358424300,"counter":1080,"content":"<p>Yes, that would be appropriate.

I refer to the question of representatives of learners, business, etc.  I will revert on that issue and because of the nature of Report Stage, there will be informal consultation with the Opposition parties and Deputies in that regard.<\/p><p>  Second, from my perspective the committee had a useful discussion on how the schools currently under the aegis of the VEC will maintain a relationship back to the ETBs, with representation, comprising either one or two members, on the boards of management of such schools.  I will reflect on how best that can be done and again, there will be informal consultation.<\/p> <p>If either Deputy O'Brien or Deputy McConalogue, on behalf of the Opposition, wishes to speak to me or articulate in writing what they think might be useful I would be happy to consider that.

He also organises Founders, which is an annual gathering of 150 of the world's leading technology company founders.<\/p><p>  As we know there is no more urgent issue facing Ireland at the moment than unemployment, particularly youth unemployment.  Our rate of youth unemployment is more than 30% and some other EU member states are suffering more - some with rates of up to 50%.  This afternoon's meeting with Mr. Cosgrave gives the committee an opportunity to discuss practical steps that might be taken with somebody with a very strong track record in youth entrepreneurship.

I now employ close to 50 people.  We hire, for the most part, highly educated and highly skilled people, some of whom are very recent graduates from this country and the rest are from elsewhere.  Through the Dublin Web Summit in October 2012, attended by more than 4,200 people the majority of whom came from abroad, I have had the privilege of meeting and interacting with many of the CEOs of the fastest-growing technology companies in Europe and further afield.  I have also worked closely with many of the most active investors in the technology sector, which is only one sector in a much broader economy.<\/p><p>  I have thought long and hard about job creation and everything I have learned in recent years.  I contrast that experience in business with everything I learned studying economics not far from here, in Trinity College.  In the time between completing my studies in economics and today, I have had the privilege of meeting and talking with people who define everything that is good about the country - incredible entrepreneurs, incisive public servants, committed politicians, concerned academics and citizens.<\/p> <p> One of those groups stands out in its understanding of how to create a job at a very basic level, that is, business people, entrepreneurs, companies.  I know how to create a job.  I know the type of people I want.  I know how to hire and I know how to train someone into a job, or on the job, but when it comes to creating tens of thousands of jobs, in fact, hundreds of thousands of jobs, not only in Ireland but across Europe, I am not sure my experience in business has taught me anything.  The challenges are, perhaps, distinct.<\/p><p> In economics, I learned about macro-level challenges.  In business, I have learned about incredibly local-level challenges, that is, the challenges distinct to my sector and, more specifically, to my company.  No business person ultimately needs to know how GDP is calculated, why it is used as a measure of economic well-being or why it is relevant.  No business person needs to know how Ireland calculates its unemployment statistics or measures of productivity and how the calculation of these measures may diverge from, say, the United States, and the academic debates within economics that rage about these calculations and miscalculations.  These facts should not take away from the brilliance of so many Irish business people in creating jobs at a company level, but that is distinct from an economy-wide level.<\/p><p> In truth, I am slightly nervous sitting here today because throughout history it has been business people, confident of the applicability of their anecdotal experience, who have influenced politicians with their ideas, rightly or wrongly, naively or otherwise.  Business people like me have funded economic think-tanks and chairs in departments of economics, in this country and elsewhere, to further their ideas, which, in many cases, as a consequence of either their own naivety or otherwise, have proved largely ruinous for most people and beneficial for some.<\/p><p> I do not want to diverge too much from the purpose of this meeting and committee but I want to underline the fact that this has been a consistent feature of most western societies for centuries and something politicians have had to constantly battle with.  There is nothing new in what I am saying.  Adam Smith wrote openly of this tendency nearly 250 years ago when he published <i>The Wealth of Nations<\/i>in 1776.  He warned of &quot;the interested sophistry of merchants and manufacturers&quot;, by which he meant their ideas which, he felt, would naturally try to thwart the aspirations of politicians by turning civil government into civil government instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor.  There are countless other relevant examples but I will not dwell on them.  I am not saying no business person could have a good economic idea, but I am saying that the committee should take what I say with a pinch of salt for historic reasons and because I know a great deal about creating one job, or, at least, a few, but almost nothing about creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in Ireland or millions across Europe.<\/p><p> However, I will say this.  The achievements of our education system over the past number of decades are revolutionary.  In the space of a few decades, we have gone from the most uneducated country in western Europe to the most educated.  The statistics are stark.  For example, 19% of the Irish aged 45 to 64 in 2011 attained only a primary school level of education and in the rest of the EU 15, which excludes the United Kingdom but includes the rest of western Europe, the corresponding figure was 1%, that is, which attained only a primary level education.  Ireland is now ranked joint first in the European Union for third level attainment among those aged 25 to 34, according to the latest survey from the Central Statistics Office.  Germany, for instance, is actually far below.<\/p><p> It is with this reverence that we now have for education in this country that I will make my only suggestion at this point, and then I look forward to further discussion.  Exchequer or European funding for any policy should be allocated on the basis of evidence.  In the absence of any evidence, positive or negative, the policy should be rigorously tested, ideally, initially at a very small level.  When it comes to the provision of health care, doctors implement solutions on the basis of evidence.  What matters is a proven outcome.  Quack doctors, shamans and soothsayers rely on solutions that may sound good; real doctors rely on solutions that are based on evidence.  State funding in this country is not always allocated on the basis of evidence; in others, it is.  In this instance, my only suggestion is that it should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013011700002#A01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Cosgrave","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358431200,"counter":1104,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cosgrave.

As a follow-on, successive Governments have struggled with long-term unemployment, youth employment and various other aspects of employment.  Often the response has been - I am not being party political here as it is a response that has come from successive governments - that governments are not in the business of creating jobs; they are in the business of creating the environment in which jobs are created.  Mr. Cosgrave would seem to bring that forward in his point that one must encourage business people.<\/p><p>  Could Mr. Cosgrave talk to us about State funding for education, retraining, community employment schemes and the various different schemes, such as JobBridge?  Has he any views on that in terms of the pot of funding?  Is there anything that, from his experience in industry, he believes could be utilised better?  It is good in that we tend to see it, from a political point of view, as an activation programme.  It keeps people occupied until such time as conditions improve and when there is a greater availability of jobs.  Should we be trying to do more than only labour activation?<\/p><p>  Without getting into specific courses, we all are familiar with those courses that, when one looks at them in the cold light of day, one might question as to whether they had any long-term potential for the individuals other than to retain that activation, give people a sense of worth and keep them active during the period of unemployment.  I would appreciate Mr. Cosgrave's comments on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013011700003#B01000","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1358431200,"counter":1113,"content":"<p>I am fascinated by the statistics that Mr. Cosgrave has given us about the levels of education, that Ireland is joint first in achieving third level education.

If the old slogan, whether Marxist or Leninist, of \"educate to be free\" is still valid, how does he recommend we look at those who have not attained, in other words, the 20% who have not attained the high levels of third level education?  Do we have a mixed bag there and do we need different policies?<\/p><p>  I will conclude by asking Mr. Cosgrave to expand on the question of EU and Exchequer funding being specifically targeted in an evidence-based formula.  What exactly does that mean?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013011700003#B01100","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358431800,"counter":1114,"content":"<p>I will begin by dealing with the points raised by Deputy Dooley on youth unemployment, which is a huge challenge throughout Europe and not just in Ireland; the use of funding for job creation; and skill levels in Ireland and educational attainment in general.  An interesting report released in the past 12 months by EUROSTAT, which is the CSO of Europe, is on the sectors chosen for study by undergraduates in Ireland, which is one cohort of the population.  One of the sectors dominated by Ireland is maths, computing and engineering in which it has the highest rate in Europe.  With regard to training people for the areas with the greatest demand, Ireland is doing incredibly well.  Much of the rhetoric and many of the opinions published in newspapers are somewhat misleading with regard to the dedication of the education system in Ireland to addressing huge skills deficiencies.<\/p><p>  I wish to speak about the role of the Government in job creation.  There has been a tendency in the past 40 years in economics in general to increasingly sideline the role of the State in job creation and creating companies.  For some reason people tend to forget an enormous amount of economic history, in particular with regard to most of the world's advanced industrial nations.  The United States is a pertinent example, and is a country people look towards as one which has almost entirely embraced free markets with a minimal role for the State in the creation of jobs and companies.  This is largely inaccurate in the face of evidence.<\/p><p>  If one takes snapshots over time one will find the role of the State has been incredibly significant in supporting, nurturing and creating many of the most competitive elements of the US economy globally.  This refers to their largest export industries.  Aviation is a huge driver of US exports, mainly through companies such as Boeing.  In the mid-1960s, many years after the Second World War, the level of research and development funding to the aviation industry in the United States was more than 90%.  In the United States the electronics industry, which was a key driver of exports, was also funded almost entirely by State funding with more than 60% of research and development funded through the National Science Foundation; the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; the Pentagon and elsewhere.  On comparing this to other advanced industrial nations such as Japan, South Korea and Sweden one will find very similar patterns, whereby the state played a huge role in underwriting the costs incurred by companies in research and development, which allowed companies to build new products and find new markets throughout the world and in turn they grew their revenues and employed more people.<\/p><p>  For many years some countries in the western world exported a version of economics to the less-developed world which encouraged those countries not to invest in their own companies but instead to export raw materials.  It was a policy Great Britain foisted on this country for hundreds of years.  The potato famine is a stark example of a government not nurturing or stepping in and helping indigenous industry to create jobs and create demand in this country.  There was sufficient grain to feed a large portion of the starving population but it was exported to England because there was a better market for it there which meant the indigenous population starved or had to leave the country.<\/p><p>  To return to the point on job creation, we need to examine very carefully how governments in other countries have created jobs in key industries and the huge role governments have played, in particular through state agencies.  The United States has the Export-Import Bank which helps provide loans to foreign companies which wish to purchase US products, be they aeroplanes or weapons systems.<\/p><p>  Ireland does an incredible job of nurturing small businesses through a number of State agencies.  Enterprise Ireland in particular must be commended for its ability to work with businesses with between ten and 50 employees.  One of the biggest challenges for Ireland is to work with companies in the middle, which are not very small or very big.  We have incredible big companies such as Glanbia, Kerry group and CRH and incredible small companies, but in between compared to many other European countries one will find a dearth of medium-sized export-focused companies.  The role our agencies are given in helping to create markets and build relationships on behalf of these companies throughout the world is much smaller compared to a number of other countries with a much greater history of international trade than ours.  We are catching up very quickly and I commend Enterprise Ireland in this regard.<\/p><p>  Deputy Byrne asked if there are so many educated people why is there is so much unemployment and this is a relevant point.  With all of these issues there will always be a supply and demand challenge.  It is great to train people to have skills which are, in theory, needed but if the demand is not there for them to be employed they can have all the skills in the world but they will lie idle, hopefully for a short time but in many cases for a much longer time.  One of the greatest challenges not only for Ireland but for a number of European countries is in stimulating and creating this demand, which seems to be a huge challenge.  There is a huge philosophical divide in economics on whether we should take money out of the economy and stop spending or spend money and put money into the economy and create demand.  There are huge structural challenges at European level and in the United States, in that when money is printed through quantitative easing and given to banks it does not seem to seep down into the hands of businesses; much of it appears to be used for speculative purposes which does not help with creating real demand.<\/p><p>  With regard to how to deal with people who do not have a third level degree, it is a highly relevant point.  I grew up on a farm and nobody I worked with there had a third level degree.  I do not think it is necessary in many cases for a range of jobs.  Many vocations and trades require different sets of skills, but unemployment is more acute now in these areas.  Construction was a huge driver of the economy but it has collapsed.  I do not have any quick answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013011700004#C00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Cosgrave"},{"type":"speech","time":1358431800,"counter":1115,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Cosgrave elaborate on the question of targeting of EU and Exchequer funding?

That is all that it means.  One cannot have evidence for every case.  Contentious ethical issues arise all the time, such as the provision of health care for women and children.

Evidence suggests that investing in smaller to medium sized companies tends, over the medium term, to lead to more net new job creation.  There are many reasons for it.  For example, it would be unprecedented for a company like the Kerry Group to triple its number of employees in a year.  It is not unprecedented for a small company of ten employees, having  stumbled upon a great product, to triple in size to 40 employees in a year.

Do they create an opportunity to travel and avail of job opportunities in the European Union?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013011700005#D00700","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1358432400,"counter":1124,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Cosgrave and thank him for his remarks.  People like him are an inspiration to the new generation, particularly at this difficult time.<\/p><p>  Mr. Cosgrave sold himself short when he said that he can only identify where to create a relatively small number of jobs but thousands of jobs is a different issue.  It is not.  It is simply extending the same format, identifying the marketplace, discovering where vacancies exist and identifying the educational qualifications required.<\/p><p>  We are short on statistics here.  I am a great believer in examining statistics and figuring out a response.  People have expressed their despair at the high levels of unemployment which was a natural corollary to the downturn in the European economies.  There was no other way around it and it had to happen.  An upturn will be equally dramatic.  It is critical that we identify where and when an upturn will take place and how best to capitalise on it.  <\/p><p>  Let us examine the European statistics on youth unemployment which state that the chances for a young unemployed person of finding a job are low - only 29.7% of those aged between 15 and 24 years who were unemployed in 2010 found a job in 2011.  That was too soon to expect an improvement.  It was not possible to benefit from economic recovery in such a short period.  It is not a magic formula.  We must find the depth, establish the foundation and start building again.  That applies to Ireland and right across Europe.  When young people do find work their jobs tend to be less stable.  In 2012, 42% of young employees worked on temporary contracts; this is four times greater than the equivalent figure for older employees.  That is true.  I do not want to make a political statement but some of the training schemes introduced by the Government led to surprising results.  Quite a number of the participants found permanent jobs.  The participants benefited from a bit of experience, thus creating confidence in their ability to find their feet in the marketplace.  More of that is required.<\/p><p>  Another interesting statistic is that early school leavers are a high-risk group with 54.2% not being employed while within this group about 70% want to work.  Therefore, 30% of them do not want to work and must be motivated.  That is the point that Senator Colm Burke raised.  We must deal with a sizeable number of the young population on this basis.<\/p> <p>It is important that we inspire the younger generation and generate interest in different areas of work.  If they lack inspiration, there is a serious void in what we are doing and we need to address the issue forensically in a more scientific way than we have done heretofore.<\/p><p> I think employment comes down to a combination of education and training.  The two must be combined.  We need to identify where job vacancies are likely to occur.  We can identify the areas in which jobs were lost in the past five years.  We see recovery in the manufacturing and services sectors, the IT and pharmaceutical sectors and in the export-generated sectors.  There will also be recovery in the construction sector in the not too distant future.  In spite of what people say, our population has not gone away.  The population has risen, which is totally the opposite of what happened in the 1950s, 1960s and 1980s.  We must prepare to capitalise on the rise in population and our people must have the necessary skills to be able to access the employment generated.<\/p><p> Deputy Timmy Dooley is correct in his assessment of the Government's role in job creation.  There are two ways to get involved.  One must create the economic environment.  However, let me sound a word of warning.  We were in similar economic situations in the 1970s and 1980s.  Unfortunately, the economists took several different directions.  I do not want to cast aspersions on economists, but when the economy has stalled and the current budget cannot be balanced, we are not in a position to spend more money as we would be increasing our indebtedness.  We tried this in the 1970s and the 1980s and it did not work.  We have an open economy and we must be very careful how we proceed.  The Government should invest in education and skills improvement as a preliminary measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013011700005#D00800","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358433000,"counter":1126,"content":"<p>Mr. Cosgrave mentioned that we have excellent State organisations doing great work.

Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of American companies that are finding it difficult to hire individuals with the requisite skills.  There are two ways to look at this.  The first is to look at the percentage of the workforce in Ireland employed in the high-tech sector and compare this with the equivalent percentage in other nations in the western world.  In this way we can establish whether there is a deficiency in the workforce; in other words, we can establish whether we are behind other nations, in the middle, or at the front.  EUROSTAT published a report just over a year ago on the percentage of the workforce in Ireland and the rest of Europe employed in the high-tech sector.  It turns out that Ireland has more people employed in the high-tech sector as a percentage of the workforce than any other country in Europe.  In fact it is twice the rate of our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, and twice that of our next nearest neighbour, France.  That is quite a startling statistic.  Second, with regard to the current cohort of young people who are being trained, do we have a sufficient number of students studying these key areas compared to other western nations?  There will always be a deficit of highly skilled labour at the cutting edge of the economy.  Germany in 1880 or 1890 faced the same challenges.  This will inevitably occur because of the feedback loop between new emerging technologies and the reaction of educational establishments in providing the necessary skills.  Nevertheless, if one looks at the number of students studying computing, computing maths and engineering, one can see that Ireland is at the very forefront of Europe, with 14.5% of students studying those subjects.  The only country that is marginally above this is Germany, where just over 14.5% of students are studying these subjects.  Germany has a long tradition of engineering and we are right up there with Germany.  The only other country with marginally more students being trained in these core areas is Malta, which must be discounted because of its size.  Ireland is doing incredibly well.<\/p><p>  I am well aware of the anecdote mentioned by the Senator.  The only issue is that the level of money the individual was prepared to pay was far below the market rates.  If he or she was prepared to pay the market rates, there would be no issue in finding the talent.  The talent exists in Ireland, as a percentage of the population, to a greater extent than anywhere else in Europe, and the statistics back that up.  Nevertheless, there is a deficiency in terms of the number of people available.  Every businessperson would love to employ people as cheaply as possible, but the fact of the matter is that this is one of the most in-demand sectors.<\/p><p>  The Senator mentioned an example of a recent graduate refusing a job on the basis that the salary was only &euro;30,000 and it was better for him or her to remain on social welfare.  One can do a literature review of all of the studies on whether there is a link between generous social welfare systems and disincentives to seek employment.  In fact, despite the perpetuation of some sort of economic myth in certain circles, one will find there is no link.  Incredibly generous welfare systems do not necessarily have much higher rates of unemployment.  The studies show that the tendency of a person to seek work under a generous welfare system is not necessarily less than under an incredibly punitive welfare system.  Thirty years of studies have shown that no such link exists.<\/p><p>  With regard to law graduates, a perpetual challenge faced by the professions is the delay in matching supply with demand in areas such as civil engineering, architecture and law, to take three examples.  At the age of 18 a young person is advised that he should study in one of these areas, but by the time he reaches the point of qualification the demand is no longer at that level.  This is the ribbon effect.  When this occurred in Germany in the 1880s and 1890s, the government put in place a mechanism to stop oversupply in the professions.  That has existed in Germany for about 120 years, but it does not exist in Ireland.  Germany is a good example of how a government can control the supply of graduates in key areas such as law, architecture and engineering.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kyne queried my views on the Irish education system and the teaching of languages.<\/p> <p>The Irish education system is an incredible achievement considering where it has come from.  If one looks at the figures for the level of educational attainment for 2010, 25% of the population aged between 44 and 65 had attained a third level degree.  In the rest of the EU 15 it is 66%.  It is important to look at where we have come in such a short space of time in terms of the quantity of people passing through the education system.  That does not necessarily count for everything but there is a significant correlation between the level of educational attainment, income and other measures.  There may be some quality issues that are highlighted by studies such as PISA which show that our rankings in terms of quality in maths and sciences is not at the very top but that is something on which we must get to work.  The Department of Education and Skills and others have examined the matter closely and many reforms are under way.<\/p><p> In terms of languages and the ability to travel, I can only speak from my experience, and English seems to be universally spoken, certainly in northern Europe in business.  It is great to be able to speak German or French as it makes one more valuable.  Irish is incredibly important in terms of our identity and what it means to be Irish and the teaching of it in schools is crucial.  The huge volume of time that is dedicated to it is a contentious issue.  We spend perhaps a seventh of our time learning a language that helps us form an identity but does not help us get a job during incredibly difficult times.<\/p><p> Deputy Durkan referred to motivation to seek jobs.  From anecdotal experience and the academic literature on the subject, most young people I have met would like to have a job because it gives a sense of identity.  It is something in which they take great pride.  Decades of study indicate that the more generous welfare systems do not necessarily increase the level of disincentive for people to seek jobs.  I welcome the fact that people get permanent jobs following internships on programmes such as JobBridge.<\/p><p> When I got to know the IDA initially I was influenced by the naughty things people from outside the IDA told me.  Then I had the privilege of meeting members of UK Trade and Investment, UKTI, which is the IDA's equivalent in London.  I had a number of meetings in Downing Street with UKTI and Mr. Cameron's senior trade advisers.  I did the same in Denmark, France and elsewhere.  Having met with similar agencies to the IDA and having seen them at work I do not think there is any agency in the world comparable to the IDA.  Compared to other agencies in the world what it does is incredible.  That is backed up by studies by the World Bank and others in terms of its pure metrics in getting people on the ground in Ireland.<\/p><p> The Chairman asked what the IDA is doing and what other chambers could do to encourage people to open up offices here.  It is important to look at World Bank surveys.  One of the most important aspects of trying to get a business to locate to a new country is to get people on the ground.  Irish people are blessed with an ability to talk, socialise and engage with people in a welcoming and warm way.  We have experience of bringing so many founders of high-growth tech companies that never thought of locating in Dublin to come here.  The two days they spend in the city learning about it and experiencing Irish culture makes such a profound impact on people.  It is all well and good to advertise on Bloomberg and in <i>Businessweek<\/i>or <i>Forbes<\/i>but the impact of getting a CEO or key decision maker on the ground is profound.  Everyone knows that.  No one is under any illusions.  The more of that the IDA does, the more I would encourage it.  I am not such a big fan of just advertising in publications.<\/p><p> I have come across the youth guarantee.  It must be welcomed in principle.  If it could be pulled off Europe-wide it would be incredible, although I imagine it is incredibly complicated, even more so because there are such constraints on funding.  There is a European micro-fund for young people.  In many European countries for whatever reason people are not aware of such micro-funds.  It does not take &euro;1 million to invest in an idea and two guys; sometimes, as little as &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000 can get people started.  It is not necessary to invest huge amounts.  In my sector, which is technology, it does not take much money to get an idea off the ground, get it tested and find out if people want to buy into it, but that is just my sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013011700006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Cosgrave","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358433600,"counter":1129,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee I thank Mr. Cosgrave for attending today&rsquo;s meeting and for the interesting presentation and discussion.
