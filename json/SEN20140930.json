There is great support for the principle of this Bill from all sides of the House.  The Committee Stage debate began earlier this year, in April, and it is due to resume once Government amendments have been prepared.  I hope the Leader and I can work to ensure that Committee Stage will resume and that this Bill will pass through the House before the end of this session in December.<\/p><p>I also ask the Leader for a debate on the national dementia strategy.  I was glad to join with members of The Alzheimer Society of Ireland outside Leinster House earlier today and I commend them on their work.  In particular, they seek to highlight the need to ensure the proper roll-out of a national dementia strategy and I ask the Leader for a debate on this issue in early course.  Finally, I commend the Start Strong organisation on its event last Thursday that I attended and at which the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, spoke.  I also wish to state how glad I am that she has made a commitment to making some change in the law to ensure better provision of parental leave and paternity leave in particular.

Since last Wednesday, as all Members are aware and as they just have been reminded by Senator Darragh O'Brien, there has been an ongoing public controversy about the disrespect - the Senator used the word &quot;disrepute&quot; - paid both to the arts and to the Seanad in light of John McNulty's nomination to IMMA and the Seanad by-election.  By contrast, last Wednesday the Irish arts world had much cause for positive celebration outside this Chamber because Eavan Boland, one of Ireland's most eminent poets, turned 70.  This coincided with the publication of her new collection of poems entitled <i>A Woman Without a Country<\/i>.  Throughout the decades, her body of work has had a profound impact on the Irish psyche and soul as she charted new territory in search of a language not voiced before and in search of a nation not fully imagined and that depicted how woman's place outside history could be transformative as well as transformed.  I believe that by way of marking the 24th Seanad's commitment to the arts, as well as to women &quot;finding a voice where they found a vision&quot;, as in the great words of Eavan Boland often quoted by the former president, Mary Robinson, I ask the Leader to bring Eavan Boland's name to the Seanad committee that decides on inviting significant public figures to this Chamber to address Members.  I expect it would be a remarkable and inspiring exchange.<br\/>My second question relates to another date on the calendar, namely, 4 October 2014, when Members will mark the first anniversary of the day on which the Irish people voted in referendum to retain the Seanad.  It is my belief, as well as that of countless citizens throughout Ireland, that the people did not vote to retain the Seanad in its current form but that they voted for real reform.  Consequently, I request that the Bill published by Senator Quinn and I on Seanad reform be brought to Committee Stage as soon as possible.  This would be a fitting way to mark the anniversary of the people's vote.  Senator Quinn and I also will table amendments to ensure the Bill is capable of delivering on a core set of fundamental reforms on which we believe all parties can agree.<\/p> <p>We will be seeking Government time for Committee Stage on the Seanad Bill.  This would be a prime way for the Taoiseach and the Government to demonstrate respect for the people, for the Seanad and for implementing the new politics that all sides of this House agree is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014093000005#D01300","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412085300,"counter":48,"content":"<p>When the handover of Hong Kong to China took place in the 1997, the then Governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, had agreements with the Chinese authorities.

The Commission has put the document out, and we have to participate in this.  What it states is based on the above, that the Commission is of the opinion that the contested rulings do not comply with the arms-length principle and, accordingly, the Commission is of the opinion that through these rulings the Irish authorities confer an advantage on Apple and the advantage is obtained every year, and is ongoing, when the annual tax liability is agreed upon by the tax authorities in view of that ruling.  The Americans estimated last year that the tax avoided per day by Apple in 2012 was &euro;25 million, or &euro;9 billion a year.

Clearly, significant investment and additional resources are required to be put into maternity services as Ireland has the lowest number of obstetricians per patient in the OECD.

We are facing a crisis in ensuring further cases such as that of Dhara Kivlehan can be averted.

Are the Senators aware that the great Bank of Ireland is doubling the interest rate it charges graduate entries to medicine when they qualify?  That is financial thuggery at its best.  In other words, it is telling graduates who want to continue studying that they will get the loan at a certain interest rate but within three months of completing the course, the rate will be doubled.  I want the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Education and Skills to come into the House to address this issue.  It is not only doubling the interest rate but it is also picking rates out of the sky.  According to the Medical Independent, graduate entry medical students are buried in a ditch of debt because of this.  Some 65% of all our young doctors have left the country not only to seek better conditions and better lives but also because they cannot repay these enormous loans.<\/p><p>Education is the right of everybody.  We have, of course, to pay for it, and that includes graduates, but to take the 4.5% interest rate for entrants to graduate medicine and then increase it to 6%, 7% or 9%, to be repaid over ten years, chokes the graduates of this country and beggars them before they even begin.  It is financial thuggery.  Bank of Ireland is back where it began.  When I pointed out to its representatives last week that it had received &euro;3.75 billion out of a universal social charge on all of our wages, they stared blankly at me but they are quite capable of running around America after builders who owe them the millions of euro that they gave out like nuts at a circus tent and of beggaring our graduate students.  This is extremely important because parents in this country do not have the money to send children to universities in their areas and thus have to send them to other cities.  They need to borrow money not for credit but for education.

Unfortunately, the legislation allows it to do so without recourse to us.  We need to make a stand on this.  Nurses are among the only PAYE workers who must pay professional fees to a professional bodies.  They are not solicitors or doctors who are self-employed and can put it off against tax, or employed solicitors whose employer normally pays the society fees.  Nurses must pay it out of their own pockets.  Nurses throughout the country are going mad over this because they have suffered pay cuts and increased hours.  They are the front line of trying to provide an effective service and are under more pressure than they have ever been before.  It is neither fair nor right of An Bord Altranais to seek this increase in fees.

Although BreastCheck offers a free screening to every woman aged 50 to 64 years, women who are aged 65 to 69 years are not being screened.  This is a question of broken promises and ageism.  The programme for Government included a commitment to extend BreastCheck to the 65-69 year old age cohort.  According to the HSE's national service plan for 2012, this planned extension was to be completed before the end of that year.  I joined a protest outside Leinster House today that called on the Government to implement its promise.<br\/>Ageism is an unacceptable prejudice in Irish society.

These people who come from every corner of this country have had their hopes raised and dashed time and again over the past number of years, including by the Kennedy-McCain Bill.  We need to make a renewed effort to work with our friends in Congress and the United States Senate to ensure meaningful immigration reform in the United States.  We are speaking in this regard of people who consider the USA their home.  They want a pathway to legalisation and to be able to pay their taxes, obtain health insurance and the certainty of knowing that when something goes wrong they can return home without the fear of not being able to return to the USA.

He put a person in charge in each part of the office to deal with a county.  I had a query from somebody in Wexford and it was expeditiously handled.  The purpose of the amendment is to specify that student support systems are authorised rather than administered by the Minister and it would not mean the Minister would not have a role, or that the previous Minister, Deputy Quinn, did not have a role.

Students aged under 23 are assessed on their parents' incomes, and can be assessed on their own incomes only if they can prove they are estranged from their parents.  The only proof of estrangement SUSI will accept is verification from a HSE social worker or family support worker, FSW.  This is problematic because HSE social workers and FSWs will not assess people aged over 18.  Therefore, there is no route to verify estrangement from one's parents if it took place when one was over the age of 18.<br\/>My colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, has continuously raised the issue but it has not yet been rectified.  It leaves very vulnerable students in a precarious situation and has forced some to leave their courses if their parents do not co-operate with grant applications, given that SUSI is rigid in its application processing and vehemently sticks to its guidelines.  It is a difficult situation when a Department such as the Department of Social Protection will accept that a person resides in a particular place for the purpose of social welfare claim but not for a student grant.  The purpose of the amendment is to expand the range of information that is acceptable to verify a claim of estrangement for the purposes of a student grant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014093000018#X00700","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1412089500,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I can understand the Senator's concerns about students who live away from their parents but must prove that they are also estranged from their parents.  Cases of genuine estrangement are relatively rare and although they have a significant impact on individual students, each one has unique circumstances.  Having carefully considered the Senator's amendment I will not be accepting it, for the following reasons.  Section 16(3) of the Student Support Act 2011 already makes provision for the Minister to specify a class of applicant or criteria that may be considered in determining whether an applicant is a student of a particular class.<\/p> <p>For example, the student grant scheme, SI 201 of 2014, makes provision in Article 21.3 to allow a dependent student to be exempt from having parents' income taken into account where it is established to the satisfaction of the relevant awarding authority that the dependent student is irreconcilably estranged from both parents and neither parent furnishes financial support to the student.  This provision allows the awarding authority to assess dependent students in genuine estrangement cases without reference to their parents or guardians' income or address.<\/p><p>The legislation allows latitude.  I know the Senator makes the point that the actual practice may be restrictive, but the Student Support Act 2011 allows latitude for specifying some additional class of applicant and the criteria to be applied for such applicant having regard to the resources available and subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  In effect the proposed amendment would replicate the provision in section 16.3 of the Student Support Act 2011.<\/p><p>In looking at how the student grant scheme is being administered, I will certainly consider the Senator's point to see whether we need to look at the administration.  If we are reviewing the scheme again, I would be willing to look at it at that stage.  All Members from time to time come across difficult cases where students do not qualify for grants.  I would certainly like to review the scheme at some stage, but I do not feel it is appropriate to put it into this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014093000018#X00800","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412090100,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Based on what the Minister has said I will not press the amendment, but I reserve the right to submit an amendment on Report Stage having looked at the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014093000019#Y00200","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1412090100,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for agreeing to look at reviewing it.

We had the Minister at the Irish Universities Association conference a few doors down the road only yesterday.  Of the people the Minister was talking to yesterday, no other institution would qualify for it.  It seems to me that it is about the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, so why not put it in the title?  We had the rather strange debate the last day that only people on this side of the House were saying that this was about the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and nobody on the Government side was willing to acknowledge that.  I do not know why it is a secret and it may have weakened the Bill because, as the Minister knows, doubts began to manifest themselves on this side of the House - not with me yet - as to why the body for which this legislation was primarily and probably exclusively intended within our lifetime, was not mentioned in it.<br\/>The second issue is whether it needs to change its charter to become a university for some purposes outside the country but not inside it?  Should it not be referred to in its own legislation, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (Charters Amendment) Act 2003?  Perhaps we will have a longer discussion on it on Report Stage, but that aspect strikes me as strange.  Senator Power expressed doubts when she said it is really a medical university.  Other people subsequently asked whether it was possible to have a university that specialises in such a narrow area.  News to my ears in those discussions was that universities need a full range of subjects and disciplines and particularly that the civilising influence on a university is its arts faculty.<br\/>While it started off with my support - it seemed like a good idea but there were doubts - at least if we want to go there and do it, why is it not mentioned in the Bill?<\/p> <p>It would be very strange to have something implemented by a law and an Act of Parliament which does not refer at all to the body for which it is intended.

As this is the first time I have seen him here since his appointment, I wish him all the best in his role.  The two amendments arise from committee proceedings.  We still have a concern about companies being regarded as a legal entity and having the same rights and &quot;full and unlimited capacity&quot; as a human being.  It is one of the most striking but unremarked upon changes in the Bill and which is contained in section 38.  It gives companies the same capacity and authority as a human being.  I do not have a difficulty with the idea behind the change but I would have a concern about giving &quot;full and unlimited capacity to carry on and undertake any business or activity, do any act or enter into any transaction&quot; and having the full rights and privileges as a human being as going too far.<br\/>Amendment No. 10, which is similar, states:<blockquote>In page 89, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:&quot;(2) In the case of a clash of &quot;rights and privileges&quot; a natural human being's rights and privileges would always take precedence over a company's.&quot;.<\/blockquote>It is difficult to determine the ultimate use that companies and directors will make of this provision.  In the US where there are similar situations, this type of right has resulted in companies claiming a breach of their human rights when they are required to allow inspections of the workplace or that their human right to free speech is infringed upon by advertising rules or that laws dealing with unfair labour practices, such as holding anti-union meetings, are contrary to their employment of their human rights.  That is a difficulty we have.  We agree with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that a human being their human rights need to be protected first and foremost above and beyond any company which would be given, as the Bill does, the same full and unlimited capacity and which would be seen then as a legal person in legal terms.  These issues have been discussed at length on Second and Committee Stages but we are not convinced that our concerns have been taken on board.

It would be good practice and would give confidence to all elements in the chain of supply if people had a tax certificate.

I campaigned on this issue for many years before I came into the Seanad.  I have raised it on five separate occasions here and have tabled four Adjournment motions.  I have done so because it is important to me.  I have visited the school, Gaelscoil Philip Bar&uacute;n, Tramore, County Waterford, several times and far too many of its students are being taught in prefabs.<\/p><p>The school has applied for capital funding to build a new building to move the children out of prefabs.  Since July the school has worked with its design team to clarify the final stage 2(b) report for architectural planning.  All of the Department&rsquo;s queries have been answered.  Ms Noeleen Newman, the major design and construction person for the project, has assured it that the project is effectively at stage 2(b) and needs approval.  Only four other schools in the country have completed all the architectural planning stages.  This project needs to be included in a new building list as it is shovel ready and will benefit the students.  It will create jobs in the area and remove prefabs which have been used for far too long.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s position is that the earliest it can go to tender is 2018.  The school would like the Minister and the Department to bring that forward.  Are there any plans to increase the number of schools being built?  If that was the case, we would hope this school could be included.  The Government is talking about stimulus and investment and if there is, as it says, an upturn in the economy, one would hope for an increase in capital funding across all Departments.  If there is to be any increase in school building programmes, I will make sure to do my part to see that this school is included on that list.<\/p><p>The minor works grant has been withdrawn and the school&rsquo;s maintenance budget has been cut by &euro;10,000 with no prospect of a permanent building being provided in the short or medium term.  I will continue to track this issue and to lobby on behalf of the people who use the school, the pupils and the parents.  I welcome the fact that the application has come this far because the school is in a much better position than it was last year or two years ago.

The Senator will be aware of the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years.  Primary enrolments, which have already risen substantially in recent years, are projected to rise by over 36,000 pupils by 2016 and they are set to continue to rise, with a likely peak at around 574,000 pupils to be catered for in 2018.  This compares with some 526,422 pupils enrolled in primary schools for the 2012-13 school year.  It is vital, therefore, that there is sufficient school accommodation to cope with these pupil enrolments.<\/p><p>In order to meet the needs of our growing population of school-going children, the Department must establish new schools as well as extending or replacing a number of existing schools in areas where demographic growth has been identified.

A priority, therefore, for the Department is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.<\/p><p>The school building project for Gaelscoil Philip Bar&uacute;n comprises a new eight classroom school with ancillary accommodation.  The project is at an advanced stage of the architectural planning process and the stage 2(b) submission was recently approved by the Department.  This was confirmed to the school by letter on 25 September last.  It was explained to the school that due to competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to authorise the project to proceed to tender at this time.  However, the project for Gaelscoil Philip Bar&uacute;n is now well placed to progress to tender and construction in the event that further funding becomes available to the Department in the future.<\/p><p>The Senator also referred to the restoration of the minor works grant.  The Senator will be aware that the focus under the infrastructure and capital investment programme 2012-16 is on meeting the demand for additional school places.  Consequently, there is no funding provided at this time in the 2014 capital allocation for the payment of a minor works grant.  Circular letter 0062\/2013, which accompanied the publication of the minor works grant scheme last November, advised that the grant will be paid in future years only as funding permits.

I can confirm to the Senator that the Department has received an application from the school for major capital funding to provide a new school on a green field site.

I understand that in many parts of the country elderly patients who seek access to a dietician must attend a clinic in a hospital.  This costs the health service because an ambulance or taxi must be provided to take the patient to the hospital.  As a result, many nursing homes now rely on privately-employed dieticians, many of whom are employed by pharmaceutical companies.  I do not doubt that these dieticians are above board and I do not question their decisions but they tend to prescribe drink supplements, some of which are extremely expensive, that are added to the health budget.  I was surprised to learn there is no procedure whereby dieticians are employed to visit nursing homes on a monthly or bi-monthly basis to assess patients and advise as to their management.

The current health reform programme involves a major change process which will see a<\/p><p>greater integration and a streamlining of service access and provision for the public.  The staff appointed to dietician posts will be required to work as part of multi-disciplinary teams delivering a co-ordinated approach to client care.  Currently dieticians practice across health promotion, acute hospital services and primary care and interact on a daily basis with service users.  There are 129 community facilities through which the HSE provides residential care for older persons and all of these facilities have access to dietetic services.  This service recognises the fact that making healthy and nourishing food choices easily accessible to older people in residential care can help reduce the incidence of poor nutrition - both under-nutrition and over-nutrition.<\/p><p>The nursing homes support scheme, the fair deal, provides financial support towards the cost of long-term residential care in nursing homes.  The scheme covers the cost of standard components of residential care.  While access to dieticians is not covered by this scheme, older people in residential settings are entitled to be referred and assessed for HSE ancillary services and therapies.

I am responding to the debate on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.  It relates to the development of fire services in Ireland using the standards and norms in the policy document Keeping Communities Safe, KCS.<\/p><p>It is a function of each individual fire authority, under the Fire Services Act 1981, to provide a fire service in its functional area.  Kerry County Council's fire services are provided primarily through a retained staffing system with full-time officers.  Retained firefighters are employees of fire authorities, and are organised to provide a fire service through a network of ten fire stations located throughout the county.<\/p><p>Published as national policy in February 2013, the national standards contained in KCS are in keeping with international good practice and are considered crucial to achieving consistency across fire services.  From the outset, the work undertaken has focused on the integration of national norms and standards into service planning within each fire service in the period 2013-15.<\/p><p>The approach in KCS is based on an area risk categorisation system which will be applied by all fire services.  That will result in fire station areas being graded across five bands from very high to very low-risk categories.  The fire service approach to risk management, including response in terms of numbers of fire appliances and fire crews in an area, is to correspond to the risk categorisation.  The risk categorisation process has been completed for County Kerry and appropriate risk designations for each station area in the county have been determined.<\/p><p>For the first time KCS sets national norms for crewing levels.  The KCS standard is that the normal crewing level on the first responding class B fire appliance is five, including an incident commander, with four personnel on the second or subsequent appliances mobilised from the same station.  In establishing national standards and norms, the KCS document reflects widespread practice in Ireland and elsewhere for crewing levels on appliances.  A series of task analyses has been prepared to show how an initial crew of five may be used to safely undertake tasks normally associated with a range of fire scenarios.<\/p><p>Rather than compromising or threatening the safety of firefighters, initiatives under KCS enhance the safety of firefighting personnel.  The policy provisions are based on the systems approach and international best practice which have shown how the approaches adopted in KCS can achieve better results in terms of public safety.  Safety provisions under KCS include guidance on managing safety in fire services, and risk assessments for equipment.  They complement existing safeguards such as the national incident command system, the ancillary safety statement, breathing apparatus guidelines and a comprehensive suite of standard operating guidelines.<\/p><p>It is expected that fire service management will bring any proposals for significant change in fire service provision to their local authorities for consideration.  The principles of local democracy and local accountability for service provision are maintained in KCS, while the objectives of national standards for important public services such as fire services are introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014093000031#TT00500","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1412096700,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply.
