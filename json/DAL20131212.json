The European Council agreement on the multi-annual financial framework provides some &euro;313 million per year for the new rural development programme for the period 2014-20, or a total of &euro;2.19 billion, for Ireland under Pillar 2 of the CAP.

Since mid-summer, there has been a change to the way in which mapping is done technically.  It allows us to be much more accurate in photographing land parcels across the country.  As a consequence of this and the pressure the European Commission is under from external auditors, the Commission is demanding that every country in Europe assess whether payments have been drawn down on land parcels that have been ineligible.  Unlike many other countries, Ireland has gone through an extraordinarily detailed process of trying to assess every single land parcel in the country so as to make a judgment on what areas are ineligible for payments.  Obviously, we offer farmers an appeals system to test that.  We are doing so because we are required to.  The alternative is that the Commission would make an assessment of ineligible land in Ireland, multiply its figure probably by five and apply a fine or what is called a disallowance, for which every farmer would have to pay substantially.  I cannot and will not allow that.<\/p><p>  We have the capacity technologically to proceed accurately.  I have no intention of penalising farmers but simply of asking them not to accept payments on land deemed ineligible in 2013.  In some limited cases, we have asked farmers to return payments made over the past four years on ineligible land.  That is how we minimise the exposure of Irish farming as a whole to penalties that the European Commission would otherwise supply.  In case the Deputy thinks this is a bluff, he should consider the penalties that have applied to other countries.  In France recently, there was a penalty of &euro;246 million.  I am open to correction on that.  The United Kingdom and Italy have also received penalties, despite their economic muscle in the European Union.  We are trying to minimise the exposure of farmers and we will work with farmers who have a problem to make sure we can put repayment schedules in place for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200005#C00400","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1386841800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>It is totally unacceptable that the Department is now claiming retrospectively on lands that were approved as far back as 2008.

This is a genuine problem but we are working to solve it so that food produced in Northern Ireland can be labelled as Irish.

The ground is moving on this issue.<\/p><p>  On the issue of Irish-grown, British-finished beef and the labelling system around that, there is a genuine problem with the labelling, marketing and selling of that product in the UK.  That is why beef that is being sold in the UK is generally either British beef which is grown, slaughtered and processed in the UK or Irish beef, grown, slaughtered and processed here.  Moving live cattle from Ireland to finish them in the UK would be welcome from a competition point of view and would also be very beneficial to live cattle exporters from a cost perspective, given the proximity of the market.  This issue has been under the spotlight this year in particular because British beef prices have been higher than Irish prices, particularly for steer beef but less so for heifers.  That is because of a very strong demand for British beef in Britain.  However, it is also true that the prices of Irish beef have been above the EU average for most of this year.  They are now slightly below the average for the first time in approximately two years.  <\/p><p>  There is a particular labelling issue in play here.  <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Harmonised EU rules require mandatory traceability and origin labelling for beef from slaughterhouse to point of sale to consumers with the objective of providing maximum transparency for the marketing of beef.  Compulsory beef labelling requires food business operators to label fresh, frozen or minced beef with specific information <\/font>to enable the product to be traced back to the animals from which it was derived and must include details of the slaughterhouse and de-boning hall in which the animal was processed as well as the country in which it was born and reared.<\/p><p>  The problem is confusion for the consumer around cattle born and raised here but finished and processed in the United Kingdom.  That is why a lot of those involved in the beef industry in Britain do not want live cattle from Ireland<\/p><p><i>  Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>  The mandatory labelling rules prevent final retailers from describing any beef products derived from animals born in Ireland but exported live for finishing and processing in Britain as either British or Irish.  Labelling of such product has to state the country of birth as Ireland, the country of rearing as Ireland and the country of slaughter as the United Kingdom.  As the Irish-born but UK-finished proposition is regarded as difficult to communicate to consumers and likely to cause unnecessary labelling complications, retailers prefer to market British and Irish beef separately as part of their product mix.  This effectively means, as a matter of policy, they prefer beef to be sourced from animals originating in one country only.  Furthermore, meat from such animals would not be eligible for the UK&rsquo;s Red Tractor scheme which guarantees the UK prevalence of the meat to consumers.  In addition, logistical difficulties arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant.  These carcasses have to be deboned in a separate batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor.<\/p><p>  Bord Bia actively supports the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity.  Although Bord Bia has repeatedly raised the labelling issue in discussions with the British retail sector, the multiples are unlikely to change their stance as they seek to shorten their supply chains in the wake of the equine DNA issue.  Nevertheless, Bord Bia will continue to pursue all opportunities to maximise the value and volume of our beef and livestock exports to the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200008#F00900","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1386843600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I would point out that the labelling law in the UK is the same as that in every other EU member state.

Regardless of what we want or what suits Ireland, the British beef industry has made a judgment call that British consumers want clarity in terms of labelling.

move amendment No. 1:<blockquote>In page 5, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:&ldquo;(3) The Companies (Amendment) Act 1990 is further amended&mdash;<blockquote>(a) in section 29 by amending subsection (4) to read:<blockquote>&ldquo;(4) The functions of an examiner should be performed with the maximum use of the services of the staff and facilities of the company to which he has been appointed to assist him in the performance of his functions, save for exceptional circumstances where the assistance of persons appointed or employed by him for that purpose may be used.&rdquo;,<\/blockquote>(b) in section 29(5) by adding the following sentence:<blockquote>&ldquo;, to the proviso to subsection (6), to the Court before which the proceedings is brought, to the value of the work done for the company, its employees, secured creditors and unsecured creditors.&rdquo;,<\/blockquote>(c) in section 29 by adding the following subsection (6) after subsection (5):<blockquote>&ldquo;(6) A nominated examiner must provide an estimate of the remuneration, costs and expenses of the examiner to the Court when presenting the petition.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>I compliment the Minister on choosing to fast-track this element of the overall companies consolidation legislation, which is overdue and needed.  I appreciate the urgency the Minister has afforded to this Bill.<\/p><p>  I have consulted very widely with the SME sector and particularly with the small number of companies that carry out examinership.  We have a very small pool of people with the expertise, and as the Minister knows, it is an extremely costly process.  Part of the purpose of the legislation is to try to reduce cost, reduce the jurisdiction, and afford the opportunity to smaller companies to move from the assumed and normal practice of applying for examinership in the High Court and moving it into the Circuit Court.  I do not dispute that the likelihood is that by moving the jurisdiction, legal fees can be reduced and can be contained to some extent.  The difficulty is that the vast bulk of the cost of examinership is not the legal fees involved but rather the examinership fees themselves.  This is proving very off-putting to all companies, especially small and medium-sized companies, in applying for examinership.<\/p><p>  The Minister will be well aware of another problem.  The majority of small accountancy firms do not have the skillset to carry out examinership which is why such a small pool of people are involved.  To highlight the importance of this to the real economy and the Minister's agenda of job creation, 60% of those employed in this country are employed in the indigenous SME sector.<\/p><p>Only 10% are employed by foreign direct investment, FDI, companies.  Many people are not aware of that.  There is a perception that most employment is generated by the large multinationals.  The Minister knows as well as I do that is not the case.<\/p><p> Small businesses are struggling.  They face enormous challenges.  A RED C survey by the Department of Finance on SME credit gives a very good picture of the challenges facing SMEs: credit demand from SMEs has declined to 36% and 80% of that 36% were granted the credit; and half of SMEs now agree that banks are lending, which is up from 39% this time last year and is a positive sign.  There is a sense of confidence emerging.  There is a big opportunity for small businesses, particularly those focused on exports and which are trying to expand.  The difficulty is that many small businesses are still in financial distress.  I recently met with the examiner who deals with 50% of all examinerships in the country.  He told me that in his experience 99% of companies in distress do not opt for restructuring through examinership because they do not have the resources.  When they meet the examiners, the upfront costs seem too onerous and the expertise does not necessarily exist around the country to help them.<\/p><p> My amendment is very simple and straightforward.  It could drive transparency and oblige professional examiners and accountants to set out to the court upon petition the estimated costs of the examinership process.  They would be obliged to give an estimated figure for which they would then have to account before the court in the later stages of examinership.  It is a very simple amendment, one that I am sure the Minister will be minded to accept because it does not alter the nature of the legislation.  It would make it far more effective and user-friendly and would oblige examiners to introduce a much greater degree of transparency in terms of how costs are arrived at and present a much clearer picture of what is involved and how much the examinership process will cost them to companies availing of this process, as is the Minister's intention <\/p><p> The other crucial aspect of the amendment is that it obliges the examiners, other than in exceptional circumstances, to use the professional expertise within the company itself.  These are small companies with between 20 and 40 employees, many of which have in-house legal and accounting expertise upon which the examiner can draw.  Depending on the examiner and the practices of a particular company it can be but it is not always the case that the examiners already use the professional expertise within a company.  My amendment would oblige the examiner to avail of that in-house expertise to avoid bringing in very expensive outside expertise in the form of accountants and so on.  This would help to minimise the cost of the examinership process.  My amendment provides for an obligation on the examiner to explain to the court, if and when he or she chooses not to use in-house expertise, why he or she has gone outside the company and brought in external, expensive practitioners.  This is a very simple and practical change which would improve and enhance the legislation and would certainly keep the costs down for the companies involved which are in distress and ensure that fees and the cost of the overall examinership process are contained, which I think is the Minister's objective and it is certainly mine.<\/p><p> I am very pleased to say that I have been in touch with several of the concerned agencies which represent employers and the companies that are in distress.  I have secured the endorsement of retail excellence Ireland, REI, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, the Small Firms Association, SFA, and the Restaurants Association of Ireland, all of whom in the past 24 hours have said that they are happy to publicly endorse the amendment I have tabled here today.  They see it as a practical way to make this legislation more user-friendly and affordable and to help it achieve its objective, to ensure that companies in financial distress which require restructuring do not wind up or go into liquidation or bankruptcy.  Those companies can stay in operation, continue trading and provide jobs.<\/p><p> Earlier this week in an appeal to the Supreme Court a company in Limerick was saved from going bust and because of a successful examinership application, the 33 employees in that company will have their jobs this Christmas and they and their families will not have to go through the distress and trauma of being made redundant two weeks before Christmas.  That is a fantastic outcome.  I want to see more companies, employees and families protected by the examinership process.  That is what this legislation is intended to do and by accepting the amendments that I have laid before the House the Minister can help to enhance the legislation and ensure that it has a better chance of fulfilling that objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200010#H02500","speaker":"1186","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386845400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Creighton&rsquo;s amendment.

We are united in the desire to see companies avail of examinership, which has been successful, albeit only for large companies.  Of the 80 or so examinerships each year, 75% are successful.  It is an instrument that we need to make accessible to small companies and that is what this legislation sets out to do.  By making it accessible to more companies, we will develop the capabilities of the accountancy profession to provide skilled and effective examinerships.<\/p><p>  I agree that we need a framework to manage the costs but I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s proposals as representing an improvement on what we already provide here.  Section 29 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990 prescribes that &quot;an examiner shall, insofar as is reasonably possible, make use of the services of the staff and facilities of the company to which he has been appointed to assist him in the performance of his functions&quot;.<\/p><p>What the Deputy is proposing is to replace the phrase \"insofar as is reasonably possible\" with the phrase \"with the maximum use of\".  My view is there is greater legal clarity in the use of \"insofar as is reasonably possible\" than in the use of terms such as \"maximum\" or in \"exceptional circumstances\".  We have looked at this but the view is that this is subjective rather than objective, and that the current text is more objective and is one to which the court must have particular regard.  In that sense, it is a better and more robust approach.<\/p><p> The other issue the amendment provides for is that a &quot;nominated examiner must provide an estimate of the remuneration, costs and expenses of the examiner to the Court when presenting the petition.&quot;  As of now, it is not the examiner who presents the petition; it is the company or the creditor who presents it and nominates the examiner, while the court appoints.  Clearly, it is for the company to seek to work out with the examiner the approach that will be taken.  The company is in a better position to do that with a nominated examiner than presenting in advance some fee schedule.<\/p><p> The other point the Deputy makes is on the need to ensure costs are contained.  The rules of the court set out the procedure for an application of an examiner under section 29 of the Act for &quot;payment of the remuneration and costs of, and reasonable expenses properly incurred by, an examiner.&quot;  The examiner in looking for those costs must in an affidavit &quot;set forth a full account of the work carried out by him to the date of the application and a full account of the costs and expenses incurred by him and shall vouch same and of the basis for the proposed remuneration which he is seeking to be paid.&quot;  This will be against the backdrop of the examiner having to show he or she &quot;shall, insofar as is reasonably possible, make use of the services of the staff and facilities of the company&quot; to the most reasonable extent he or she can.  In addition, &quot;[t]he Court may, where it thinks fit, order that notice of the application be given to all such persons as the Court may direct, and may give directions as to the service of the said notice&quot;.  The court will vigilantly scrutinise the examiner's application for payment and disallow items, or allow a lower charge-out rate than the examiner has claimed.  In that regard, the court will seek to ensure that the examiner and his staff are only remunerated for work properly falling within the powers of the examiner.<\/p><p> We have inserted a framework, to use Deputy Calleary's word, that seeks to minimise costs, and the allocation of the responsibilities and how the process works is sensible.  On the wider issue that one would seek to insist that only company resources be used, the difficulty, which I believe Deputy Creighton acknowledges in her comments, is that the expertise is not generally within the companies to manage the whole of the examinership, which is why the skills in this area are being brought to bear.  The proposed amendment would seek to restrict severely the ability of the examiner to employ expertise external to the company to assist him or her in the performance of his or her functions.  The appointing of an examiner to a company does not usurp the functions of the board of directors, which will continue to manage the affairs of the company during the period under the protection of the court.  Hence, the staff of the company are not answerable to the examiner.  Further, in the case of small private companies in particular, the company may not have the staff with the necessary skills to assist in the formulation of proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangements.  There is, in addition, the potential for conflicts of interest, for example, under section 22 of the Companies Act the examiner's proposals for a scheme of arrangement may, if the examiner considers it desirable to do so to facilitate the survival of the company, specify whatever changes should be made to the management or direction of the company.  There could also be potential conflicts of interest between the interests of the staff in the company and other creditors.<\/p><p> For all of those reasons, while I understand the motivation of Deputy Creighton's amendment, and it is a motivation I share, I believe the framework here is balanced and proportionate and is designed to achieve the outcome.  With regard to using the phrase &quot;insofar as is reasonably possible&quot;, given the understanding that the examiner is intended to bring new expertise and may have to take a view of the future of the company that is at odds with the view of those who are directing the company, we need to have the flexibility within the framework that is now provided for in the way we have set in the text of the Bill as it stands.  That is why I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p><p> On the wider issue the Deputy raises, I am acutely conscious of the challenges for SMEs.  The Red C survey was, as they say, a mixed bag.  It showed a declining demand for credit but it also showed a falling refusal rate.  At 20%, that refusal rate is still too high and would put us in the top third of European figures, but I must acknowledge it was a 30% refusal rate when those surveys started and has come down to 20%.  We are working hard with the Credit Review Office.  We have extended its remit to loans of &euro;3 million and are trying to drive more cases to its office to try to reduce further that rate.<\/p><p> It is worth recording here, because people do not get the message often enough, that the Credit Review Office is a very valuable tool in the hands of people who have been turned down for credit.  Its head, Mr. John Trethowan, is at present turning over nearly 60% of those cases that are appealed to him, so it is not that the bank's refusal should be regarded as the end of the road.  The Credit Review Office is very successful at turning over decisions.  We would like to see more decisions coming Mr. Trethowan's way, and that is why, during the course of the budget, the Minister announced the raising of the threshold from &euro;500,000 to &euro;3 million.<\/p><p> I know the Deputies encourage people to use these services, which are a way of improving access to credit.  In addition, &euro;2.5 billion has been provided from non-bank sources that are put out into the marketplace for SMEs across the whole suite of Government-backed lending measures.  While those have still to prove their value and are in their various stages of development, looking back at the history of the seed and venture capital fund, which also started small, it is now a very established and strong element of the SME funding environment.  We certainly hope that the development finance, microfinance loan guarantee and the various equity and lending funds from the NPRF will similarly build to become an important part of the non-bank finance infrastructure.  We will have to develop a much stronger element of non-bank sources against a background of more constrained rules of credit from bank sources, even if the banks are fully healthy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200011#J00300","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386846000,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I appreciate that, at this point, it is difficult for the Minister to accept amendments to legislation.  The practice in this House is to be not all that interested in accepting amendments from the Opposition or from backbenchers, which is unfortunate.  We are all essentially trying to paddle in the same direction.  Some of the Minister's logic for declining to entertain this amendment is a little thin, to say the least.<\/p><p>The bottom line is that 99% of companies which find themselves in financial difficulty end up going bust.  That is a far higher percentage than in other EU member states.  If one compares it to the US, it is pretty incomparable.  What we are essentially saying is that we want entrepreneurship, innovation and companies to establish but when they find themselves in difficulty, we are not really prepared to help them to restructure, become more fit for purpose, survive, stay in business and keep people in employment, which is the crucial point in all of this.  That is really unfortunate.<\/p><p> The Minister's statistics are correct.  A total of 75% of examinerships are successful but it is a minute number of companies.  When it comes to small companies, the number is even more minute.  We are talking about dozens of companies every year rather than the thousands that should be going through the examinership process.  The sad thing is that from speaking to business owners and the people who conduct examinerships in this country, we know that this is not likely to change substantially with this legislation, which is a missed opportunity.  To give the Minister a flavour of it, I was surprised to learn that the small handful of companies that carry out all of the examinerships in the country were not consulted by the Department in framing this legislation.  I asked all of them and none of them had been consulted.  That in itself is quite extraordinary but when I spoke to them, what was very interesting was that the one examiner which conducts over 50% of examinerships for small companies in this country estimated the cost of examinership at about &euro;50,000.  He pre-negotiates fees with the legal profession, accountants etc. and estimates that all in, the amount is about &euro;50,000.  When I spoke to the other companies which specialise far more in examinerships involving big companies rather than SMEs, although they do some SME examinerships, they estimated the cost at &euro;100,000 as a minimum so there is a big distinction even in the approach of examiners coming from the big firms and small firms.<\/p><p> The Minister may have misinterpreted my point about SMEs and their capacity to provide skills internally.  I was not saying that small companies do not contain professional skills.  Many of them do have these skills and what my amendment would do is simply oblige the examiner from the outset to use all of those professional skills within those companies before turning to junior associates in the big companies.  That is what is happening at the moment and that is why those fees are estimated up-front at &euro;100,000, which is off-putting for a small company with a small turnover.  The idea that these are onerous obligations on an examiner that would not somehow fit the process is mistaken.<\/p><p> Another element of my amendment is to oblige the examiner to take into account the jurisdiction of the court.  There is no obligation in the legislation for the examiner to take into account the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the High Court.  That is something that the Minister, unfortunately, does not seem willing to accept, which is very disappointing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200012#K00200","speaker":"1186","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386846600,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I support the amendment put forward by Deputy Creighton.  While the Minister gave a very plausible explanation as to why he would not accept it, I disagree with him.  We continually extol the virtues of SMEs in this country yet there is a perception, much of it based on experience, that much effort is put into facilitating foreign direct investment and other industries but SMEs are not facilitated in their operations.  I know the Minister in the past couple of days made an announcement about data analysis research and the investment into it but at the same time, a company in north Wicklow had to take on various arms of the State and met frustration at every hand's corner.  Fortunately, it worked out for the company but telling it that the State is assisting SMEs certainly would not wash.  I encountered an individual in recent days who had a very successful company.  Three-quarters of the company was very profitable and one-quarter brought it down.  He did not have the opportunity to save the three-quarters and felt he did not have the money to take on the authorities to try to hold on to that section of his company that was profitable.<\/p><p>  Deputy Creighton's amendment tries to facilitate SMEs in meeting the intention in this Bill.  I certainly welcome this Bill.  The intention behind it and the Minister's motivation for it are very welcome.  However, I believe there is a weakness in it that Deputy Creighton's amendment seeks to address.  She said she realises it is difficult for Ministers to take on amendments but I do not believe that should be the case.  It is not difficult for a Minister to take on an amendment.  Surely the case put forward and the fact that the stakeholders are supportive of it should make the Minister at least reflect on it.<\/p><p>  The Minister mentioned the Credit Review Office and the 60% turnover, if I heard him correctly.  While that is welcome, does it not tell us something about the banks that they are turning down so many cases in the first instance?  How many small companies or individuals do not have the wherewithal or are basically afraid to approach the Credit Review Office?  We must look again at banks being more amenable.  Yes, there must be responsible lending and correct business plans but a 60% turnover shows a clear breakdown in policy between what the Government wants and what banks are actually doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200013#L00200","speaker":"1184"},{"type":"speech","time":1386846600,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I also support Deputy Creighton's amendment which I think is sensible and rational.  This is a difficult country for a small business.  The turnover must be very dramatic in terms of businesses starting up and closing down every year.  I would like to see comparisons with Europe.  Not long ago, just short of 20% of restaurants in Dublin were closing down each year although, obviously, new ones were starting up as well.  That is a dramatic figure.  The State needs to consider facilitating small businesses more and helping them stay in business in a more proactive way.<\/p><p>  The Minister made two points with regard to allowing companies to provide some of the expertise.  He said that many of them do not have it and that if they were directors, they would obviously be biased regarding how the process would proceed.  There is merit in those two points, particularly the second.  Some companies employing between 20 and 100 people do not have the expertise but more of them do.  Some of the companies that do not have expertise have access to it.  A company using its own auditor for ten or 15 years will have built a relationship with him.  That professional would very likely be keen for the company to survive because there is business in it for him.  I am sure he would be prepared to work for a smaller fee than some stranger the examiner might bring in.  Giving the company in trouble an opportunity to supply some expertise, be it inhouse or through an independent professional with whom it has a relationship, would be a very helpful addition to the Bill.<\/p><p> Most of us agree with Deputy Timmins that we are better at helping larger companies than smaller ones, as has been borne out in recent years.

They do not have substantial state agencies that invest in hundreds of companies at the seed and emerging phases.  We have a good network for supporting SMEs and cannot let it go.

It is not true to say that there is some sort of a bias towards FDI.<\/p><p>  The purpose of this provision is to bring examinership within reach.  Under the Bill, an examiner shall, as far as is reasonably possible, make use of the services of the staff and facilities of the company to which he or she has been appointed to assist him or her in the performance of his or her functions.  We are providing that the examiner must use those facilities.  It would only be sensible for him or her to do so, as an examiner has knowledge of the business, trends, how a company is doing, what its customer base is and who its creditors are.  However, the purpose of appointing an examiner is to bring additional expertise to bear.  We are not going to insert legislative provisions that would seek to minimise the necessary use of such resources, but an examiner must justify those costs to a scrutineer at the end of the process.<\/p><p>  Reverting to Deputy Calleary's point, the framework seeks to minimise the costs.

Bringing the process to the Circuit Court is a first move.

As the current Long Title of the Bill suggests, it amends the 2004 recruitment Act to provide for redeployment of public servants.  The amendments being brought forward are beyond the scope of the current Title of the Bill, so it is proposed to amend the Title to provide for regulations concerning sick leave in the public service.  It is also my intention to accept, in essence, the suggestion of Deputy Fleming to lay such regulations before the House.<\/p><p>  Deputies will recall that when we were dealing with Second Stage of this Bill in late September, I advised the House of my intention to bring forward provisions relating to sick leave on Report Stage.  I thank the House for its co-operation in facilitating the bringing forward of this motion to include these amendments on Report Stage of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) (Amendment) Bill 2013.  The amendments, which will be inserted as Part 7A of the Bill, will enable the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to provide for a sick leave scheme that will apply to all public servants based on important principles and policies set out in the legislation.<\/p><p>  Before turning to the detail of the proposed new Part, I will provide the House with some background information on the new public service sick leave scheme and the rationale for the proposed changes.  As Deputies will be aware, the new public service sick leave scheme is being introduced following a binding 2012 Labour Court recommendation concerning sick pay in the public service.  The rationale for the new scheme was the need to reduce the unsustainable cost of sick leave for the public service overall.  This is to be achieved through a substantial reduction in the period of time for which paid sick leave will generally be available from the one year period available at present, comprising six months full pay and six months half pay, to three months full pay and three months half pay.<\/p><p>  We know that in many areas of the public service absenteeism levels are high compared to best practice benchmarks, ranging from 4% to 5%.  The direct pay bill cost of this absenteeism has been estimated at approximately &euro;500 million and necessary substitution of staff in some sectors attracts additional costs.  This is unsustainable given the severe fiscal pressures that the State continues to face.  While the amendments being introduced today are enabling provisions, which will allow the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to provide for the new scheme by ministerial regulations, it is the binding recommendations from the Labour Court which define the parameters of the new sick leave scheme.  Although the new sick leave arrangements could be applied in some sectors, such as the Civil Service, by administrative circulars, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that legislation is required to ensure that the new public service sick leave scheme can be applied across the public service, particularly as many public servants have employment contracts that are governed by contract law.  In addition, and in accordance with the Labour Court recommendation, a review of the operation of the new scheme is to be carried out after a full year of its operation.  Given the extent of the changes being implemented across multiple organisations and multiple sectors it is important that there is potential to make adjustments to enhance the operation of the scheme in light of operational experience.<\/p><p>  Public servants have been aware of the intended changes to the sick leave scheme since the Labour Court recommendation in 2012.  For most public servants, the recommendation of the Labour Court as set out in the new scheme will mean a reduction in access to paid sick leave in normal circumstances.  The Labour Court recommendation provides for a reduction of access to paid sick leave for non-critical illness from &quot;6 months full pay and 6 months half pay&quot; to &quot;3 months full pay and 3 months half pay&quot;.  Having exhausted sick leave on both full and half pay, in certain circumstances an individual can apply to be given access to a payment that equates to what they might receive by way of a pension payment were they to retire.  This is referred to as &quot;pension rate of pay&quot;.  I intend to replace this provision with &quot;temporary rehabilitation pay&quot; which is calculated and awarded in the same way and is only paid when an individual has a reasonable prospect of returning to work.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Labour Court recommended that special arrangements were to be put in place, through the development of a critical illness protocol, under which staff with serious illnesses or injury of a specified severity might be able to benefit from extended paid sick leave on an exceptional and normally non-recurring basis.  In effect this means that staff covered by the critical illness protocol would continue to have the same level of support that is available under the current sick leave scheme.  This protocol, which is at an advanced stage of development, is the subject of ongoing consultation with the public service unions and has been referred back to the Labour Court for a binding recommendation on a limited number of issues.  I understand that recommendation is imminent.<\/p><p>  While the introduction of the new sick leave arrangements is very important, it is obviously vitally important that sick absences and workplace rehabilitation are managed properly, both for the benefit of the individual and the organisation.  In addition to reducing the financial costs associated with sick leave, long-term absence from work due to sickness is associated with a poor prognosis for return to work.  Indeed, the likelihood of successfully returning to work may be reduced after an extended sick leave absence.  There is much medical evidence that being out of work for an extended period of time is associated with poor health.  In general, rehabilitating people back to work after illness or when they have a disability is likely to benefit their long-term health.<\/p><p>  I assure Deputies that the new scheme, as recommended by the Labour Court recommendation in 2012 and which will be provided for in the regulations, will ensure a balanced and reasonable approach to supporting staff while they are ill and unable to attend work, particularly in circumstances where they have a serious illness and medical condition which falls under the critical illness protocol, and at the same time to trying to reduce the significant and unsustainable costs of sick leave which I indicated.  It is important to note that in overall terms, the new scheme will provide access to some form of income for public service employees who find themselves out of work due to illness or injury for a period of two years in total.<\/p><p>  As we move through the Report Stage of the proposed amendments and the inclusion of the new Part 7A to the Bill, I will deal with each of the new provisions relating to the new sick leave arrangements in detail for the House.  The central part of the proposed amendments are contained in sections 58(A) and 58(B), which provide the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with the basis for drawing up regulations for sick leave in the public service.<\/p><p>  The regulations that will be made under this Bill will provide for access to the amount of sick leave as set out in the binding recommendation of the Labour Court and identify the public service bodies that will be covered by the new scheme.  It is my intention to cover all areas of the public service in the first instance.  Specifically, that will include public servants in the health sector, the local government sector, the Civil Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the non-commercial semi-State bodies.  The education sector will be joining the scheme at the start of the new school year in September 2014.  This is the approach that makes the most sense for that sector from an administrative perspective as its arrangements relate to the school year rather than the calendar year.<\/p><p>  The Permanent Defence Forces will not be included in the new scheme as there are specific issues arising in respect of the nature of the work in the Defence Forces.  Notwithstanding this there will, however, be reductions in the access to sick pay in the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>The Defence Forces regulations are the appropriate vehicle for the amendment of their sick leave arrangements.<\/p><p> As I have already told the House, the policy objective, which is consistent with the Labour Court's binding recommendation, is that all of the public service would be covered by the new scheme.  In any circumstances where there are bodies that are not explicitly covered by the new regulations, reflecting the complexity of introducing new terms and conditions across multiple and hugely varied sectors and organisations, this can be addressed through an amendment of the regulations in order to widen coverage of the new scheme where that is deemed appropriate in the future.<\/p><p> Although it had been intended to put the scheme in place by 1 January 2014 - I have indicated that publicly - in accordance with the Labour Court's recommendation, this would mean that I would not be able to lay the regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the interests of transparency and equity, I think that it is important that I do so.  On that basis, I am delaying the commencement of the scheme until the regulations have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> Deputies will appreciate that the State is not in a position to continue to meet a sick leave bill of over &euro;500 million a year.  A cost of this magnitude is unsustainable.  Nor can the public service be expected to absorb the associated loss in productivity in light of the consequential impact on the provision of public services.  The reform of sick leave across the public service as a whole is, therefore, a fundamental reform priority that I set out early in my tenure as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I seek the support of the House for this motion, in the first instance, to provide a legislative basis for a reformed sick leave arrangement for the public service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200015#N00200","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386848400,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion which is to introduce a new sick leave scheme in the public service.  The scheme is being included in the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointment) (Amendment) Bill 2013.  Everybody should accept that the cost of sick leave is a major issue for the Irish taxpayer.  The cost of sick leave in the public service is higher than in the private sector and the taxpayer pays the bill.  It is important, therefore, that, in line with everything in Irish society, there should be cost reductions in this excessive bill.  I do not know where the Minister got his estimate but it is substantial in any event.<\/p><p>  Before dealing with the main points I have prepared, I wish to raise some of the points from the Minister's contribution a few minutes ago when he said:<blockquote>Although the new sick leave arrangements could be applied in some sectors, such as the Civil Service, by administrative circulars, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that legislation is required to ensure that the new public service sick leave scheme can be applied across the public service, particularly as many public servants have employment contracts that are governed by contract law. <\/blockquote>The Attorney General, therefore, has advised that legislation is required.  Towards the end of his contribution, the Minister said that &quot;in the interests of transparency and equity&quot; it is important that he prepare the regulations.  He is doing so, however, because the Attorney General said it is the appropriate way to go.  I do not accept the Minister's attempt to make a virtue out of the fact that he is doing something, to quote his words, &quot;in the interests of transparency and equity&quot; when he is being forced to do it on legal advice from the Attorney General.  The Minister's script is contradictory on that issue because while he says it is in the interests of transparency and equity, he is doing this for sound legal reasons.  That is why I said, in the first place, that there should be regulations to deal with this matter.<\/p><p>  There is a two year period in total during which people will be able to receive some pay at the end of the temporary rehabilitative payment, which comes in lieu of pension pay.  Is that two year period a new figure?  I understand the Minister is talking about excluding the Defence Forces from these regulations because these matters will be dealt with under the Defence Forces regulations, and I accept that.  However, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na understood that they would also be excluded, but I see no mention of it in the Minister's script.  They made a strong case for exclusion and some of them understood that their case had been accepted.<\/p><p>  In essence, the arrangements before us are to make changes to the sick leave mechanism across the public service from six months of full pay to six months on half pay.  After that period, people will go on to what was known as the pension rate of pay, but is now to be called rehabilitation pay.  There is general support for this measure which aims to reduce costs. One way of achieving this is to reduce the amount of payments from six months of full pay to three months on full pay and three months on half pay.  That is a major, significant and substantial change.  I support the general principle involved.  It would be less than honest, and it would be unfair to the Irish taxpayer, if I were to oppose the principle of some reduction in the public sector sick pay bill.  Every private company is doing it, so there is nothing new in this.  Nobody in Irish society is exempt from trying to make some cost savings, so I support the principle involved.  These savings for the taxpayer are to be achieved by the change from six months to three months.  However, it is important that a small number of limited, exceptional, critical-illness cases can still be dealt with in the system.  I will revert to that point later.<\/p><p>  I wish to thank the Minister's departmental officials for the excellent briefing they provided to me on this matter on Tuesday afternoon.  I will now deal with some of the reasons that I have difficulties with the motion before us.  First of all, as the Minister has said, the issue is going to the Labour Court next week over some minor aspects.  However, this was before the Labour Court ruling on 19 July 2012 when Mr. Kevin Duffy, the court's chairman, signed the agreement.  At the time, Mr. Duffy said that subject to the necessary legislation being enacted, the proposals and recommendations should take effect from 1 January 2014.  The Minister has had 18 months to get his act together and get this measure in place in a more open and transparent way through the Oireachtas, instead of bringing in a motion at this late stage.  Clearly, this motion is not in order with the original legislation.  It is rushing things to come here at this stage, a week before Christmas, with this legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200016#O00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1386848400,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I told the Deputy about this in September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200016#O00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1386848400,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Yes, I accept that but we have all known about this issue since 19 July 2012.

Some 18 months ago, the Labour Court recommended that the proposals should take effect from 1 January 2014.  In addition, I tabled a parliamentary question on this matter on 28 November, which is only two weeks ago.  In his written reply, the Minister said that the finalisation of the protocol was recently the subject of conciliation talks at the Labour Relations Commission, which were aimed at securing agreement as soon as possible to facilitate the introduction of the new sick leave arrangements from 1 January 2014.

He said they were a key deliverable of the Government's reform programme.<\/p><p>  The 1 January 2014 date has been announced three times.  We had it as recently as last week from the Chief Whip's office and from the Minister's written reply two weeks ago, yet we now find that this is not the case.  We are now told that the Labour Court will be dealing with the issue next week.  The Minister expects us to pass legislation today in respect of rules and conditions on sick pay for 290,000 public servants and their families while these matters have yet to be decided in the Labour Court next week.  Not only is it disrespectful to the Labour Court for us to be doing this today, before it has finished its considerations, but it is also disrespectful to ask the Houses of the Oireachtas to pass regulations which the Minister cannot be specific about until the Labour Court has fully adjudicated.<\/p><p>I understand it is dealing with issues such as critical, disability, pregnancy-related and mental health illness.<\/p><p> On mental health, the opening paragraph of the Department's critical illness protocol, to which the Minister, Deputy Howlin referred, states: &quot;Therefore, when an individual becomes incapacitated as a result of critical illness or serious physical injury and has supporting medical evidence.....&quot;.  While &quot;physical injury&quot; is specifically mentioned in the protocol no mention is made of mental illness.  I do not believe adequate provision is being made in this regard.  It would have been far more appropriate to be more inclusive in the terminology dealing with this issue.  It is no wonder, when this is the line being taken by the Department, that this matter is back before the Labour Court.<\/p><p> Neither the Minister nor I know what will happen in the Labour Court next week.  The Minister in ramming the legislation through this House during the next few hours is asking us to support something in regard to which we do not yet know the outcome.  I have tabled an amendment to the Bill to the effect that some of these matters be addressed by way of regulation.  As everybody knows a regulation does not come into effect until 21 days after it has been laid before the Houses.  I acknowledge that the Minister has accepted the principle of my amendment and has tabled his own amendment in this regard.  The Government Chief Whip in saying last week that the scheme would come into effect on 1 January next obviously does not understand the regulatory process.  The Minister in reply to a parliamentary question tabled by me on 28 November also said this scheme would come into effect on 1 January, which means he thought he could rush this through by way of circular without the need for regulation.  He now knows this cannot be done.  The regulations cannot come into effect until 21 sitting days after they had been laid before the Houses, which equates to seven weeks in terms of D&aacute;il sittings.  If they are not published until some time in the New Year it will be well into March before the scheme comes into effect.<\/p><p> I do not have a problem with the date on which the scheme will come into effect.  However, I do have a problem with the fact that up to recently the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and parliamentary system were indicating it would come into effect on 1 January next when they should have known that this was physically and legally not possible, which meant everybody was being led astray.  As the scheme will not come into effect on 1 January next there is no rush in terms of the passage of the legislation.  The Minister should await the outcome of the Labour Court process, at which time we will all know the full implications in this regard.  I ask that the Minister defer this motion and the legislation until we know the outcome of the Labour Court process.  I cannot support the hamfisted manner in which the Minister is pushing this through.  <\/p><p> The Minister has made a virtue of pre-legislative scrutiny.  There has been no pre-legislative scrutiny on this matter which affects sick pay entitlements for 290,000 public servants and their families.  The Department should have engaged with Members on it in advance of its publication and representatives of the public sector trade unions and of the taxpayer who is paying for this should have come before the a committee to brief us on it.  This is another example of rushed legislation in terms of the few hours being allowed for debate on it.  This may explain the reason this legislation was not gender, equality or poverty proofed.  I would expect nothing more from a Labour Party Minister who supported the decision earlier this year in the budget to reduce maternity benefit and to, for the first time, tax maternity benefit.  The Government is now attacking low paid workers in the public service, in particular women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200016#O00600","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386849000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>We are not attacking them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200017#P00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1386849000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Women in the public sector are being attacked in that some of these measures will not impact on male workers.  We all know that there are far more women employed at the lower pay grade rate in the public sector.  The measures being introduced will have a greater impact on people on lower incomes.  This legislation has not been gender proofed.  The Minister would have noticed this had there not been a rush to have it passed.<\/p><p>  The legislation provides that pay in respect of a person on half pay should not be less than the social welfare rate of &euro;188 per week.  However, there are many women in the public service who are now the sole bread winner within households.  The social welfare entitlement of a woman not working in the public sector, who is the sole bread winner and whose husband has lost his job and may be back in education and has three children, is &euro;402 per week yet provision is made in the legislation for only &euro;188 per week in this regard.  Will the Minister guarantee that the wage of a family, the main bread winner of which is a public sector worker who is on half pay will be equivalent to the social welfare payment to which the family would be entitled?  The legislation provides only for the single rate of &euro;188.  Under the legislation a person in receipt of this money will be required to provide signed certificates to his or her employer.  This measure is anti-women.<\/p><p>  Another issue not addressed in the legislation is pregnancy-related illness.  A woman who has had an illness in the past may suffer a pregnancy-related illness.  As only women can have a pregnancy related illness, they will be hit by the reduction to half pay despite that the illness may be no fault of their own.  This measure hits only women.  This is a further example of a lack of gender proofing of the legislation.  The legislation will affect low paid workers and women.  The Minister should have considered this measure in greater detail.  <\/p><p>  I also object to the retrospection aspect of the sick leave arrangements.  The Minister is aware that when it comes to sick leave one is counting backwards.  While I understand the need for some element of retrospection I do not agree with what is provided for in the circular issued across the public sector which states: &quot;Because we calculate sick leave on the basis of a four year rolling period, i.e, counting backwards from the latest day of absence, the changes to be introduced on 1 January 2014.....&quot;.   In counting backwards retrospective effect is being given to this measure.  The original proposal was more reasonable.  I was prepared to support the Minister in that regard.  Fianna F&aacute;il also put forward proposals in regard to these issues in its budget submission last year.<\/p><p>  I ask that the Minister wait until after the Labour Court has issued its ruling to deal with the legislation.  It has been already delayed for more than a year and half but is now being rushed through the D&aacute;il.  The 290,000 public servants and their families deserve better.  There was no pre-legislative scrutiny on this matter.  It is possible to delay debate on the Bill because the regulations cannot come into effect until March.  The more I examine the detail of the legislation the more I believe it has the potential to be anti-women and anti-low paid workers.  It is blatant discrimination, as evidenced by the examples I have given.  The measures being introduced under the legislation should have been given greater consideration.  I ask that the Minister go back to the drawing board on it.  I will be opposing this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200017#P00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1386849000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>The rushed manner in which this measure is being introduced has been already referred to.  In essence, it is a substantive legislative measure in its own right.  The Minister is correct in saying that he gave us notice in September that he would be bringing this matter forward.  However, we did not envisage it would be done at the tail-end of this session in such a hurried and rushed fashion.  Given the nature and novelty of the legislation, it deserves proper Committee Stage scrutiny and consideration.<\/p><p>  There is currently no legislation on the books in regard to the sick pay regime.  As such, this is a new departure, one which, as in the case of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation places substantial new powers in the hands of the Minister.  The legislation will have serious consequences for public sector workers and in terms of industrial relations and the power of negotiation and collective bargaining across the public sector.<\/p><p>  I do not think anybody disagrees that savings must be made in respect of the sick leave bill in the public sector.  The Minister will be aware it was noted in the LRC recommendations and agreement that the unions understood and subscribed to the envisaged &euro;25 million savings to be achieved in this area.  It is important as part of this debate to say that it was their view, and reasonably their view, that savings of this magnitude could have been achieved under the current scheme by way of, as reflected in the recommendations, &quot;more active control&quot;.  <\/p><p>  I share the concern in regard to the critical illness protocol.  It is worrying that disability, mental health and pregnancy-related illness are not specifically mentioned in this regard.  I appreciate that pregnant workers are protected by other legislative tools.  None the less, it is critical in respect of sick leave arrangements that because women workers can become pregnant several times in the course of their working lives, long-term illness and recurring illness are captured in that protocol.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200017#P00400","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1386849000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1386849600,"counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200018#Q00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1386849600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>The members of the Committee of Public Accounts are to be commended on the manner in which they conducted yesterday's hearing with the Central Remedial Clinic.  Some of the practices that were revealed during yesterday's hearing are unacceptable.  These include the use of charitable donations to top-up lavish executive salaries and pension payouts, the highly irregular recruitment process for the chief executive and the mystery annual payment of &euro;660,000 to the Mater hospital.  The saddest part of all this is that the children and adults with physical disabilities who rely on the services of the CRC will potentially suffer as public donations inevitably fall off.  There is also a growing concern now that public trust and confidence in charities generally will be negatively affected by this controversy.<\/p><p>  If we want people to continue to support charities as generously as they always have done, they need to be assured that their hard-earned money will be spent on those for whom it is intended.  We would be naive to think that the issues at the CRC pertain only to that organisation and that it is the only publicly funded body to operate in this manner.  The Minister for Health said late last month that of the 44 so-called section 38 bodies contacted by the HSE, more than half, 24 of them, stated they did not comply with public sector pay policy.  A further eight did not even bother to reply to the HSE.  What about the 2,000 or so section 39 bodies that also receive substantial funding from the HSE?  Do we know what is going on within these organisations?<\/p><p>  We await the implementation of the Charities Act 2009.  The Act expressly provides for the Minister for Justice and Equality to regulate for narrative and financial disclosure standards.  Were these standards in force they would require every charity of any significant scale to provide a report on the sources of its revenues, the pay bands of its highest paid employees, the costs of governance and the specific uses to which it puts income and assets.  Will the T&aacute;naiste advise the House when this legislation will be enacted?

The bottom line is that the agencies and organisations which are substantially funded from the public purse should adhere to stated pay policy.<\/p><p>  The chairman and members of the board of the CRC and the former chief executive appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts yesterday together with the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  On foot of calls for the board of the CRC to resign, the chairman indicated he would call a meeting of the members of the board to consider their position.  It is regrettable that the former chief executive of the CRC, who resigned this week, decided not to attend the Committee of Public Accounts hearing.  The HSE will be following up urgently on the governance deficits identified in the CRC and the issues that arose relating to pension arrangements.  I understand that arising from the PAC hearing yesterday the HSE has been asked to appear again before the Committee of Public Accounts on Thursday, 19 December together with representatives from the Mater hospital, which has a role in respect of superannuation arrangements in the CRC.  Officials from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will also attend at that committee hearing.<\/p><p>  Deputy McGrath referred to the general subject of top-up payments and section 38 agencies.  The HSE has a team of senior managers following up with individual agencies in respect of non-compliance with public pay policy.  The reason these breaches of policy came to light in the first place was on foot of an audit of the section 38 agencies.  As part of this process, the director general of the HSE is meeting the chairpersons of all section 38 organisations today.  This meeting will focus on the requirement of the board of each agency to strengthen governance standards further and will set out the need to furnish the HSE with a compliance statement from the current financial year and for each year thereafter.  This statement will be required to be approved by the board of each agency on an annual basis and signed by the chairman and another director on behalf of the board.  It will be submitted to the HSE together with the organisation's annual audited accounts.  This annual compliance statement will be required in addition to the annual service agreement between the agency and the HSE.<\/p><p>  Further and separate meetings will be held by senior HSE managers with all of the disability organisations and hospitals concerned in the week commencing 16 December to ensure appropriate steps are taken to bring these organisations into compliance with public pay policy and that any governance deficits are rectified immediately.<\/p><p>  Deputy McGrath asked me specifically about the commencement of the Charities Act.

The key issue is the lack of accountability and transparency and the inevitable consequence for public trust and confidence in charities.  It is inevitable that donations will fall off.  The people who will suffer and bear the brunt will be those who rely on the services.  That is the sad part about what is going to unfold at the CRC.  I hope other issues of a comparable nature will not emerge in other organisations, but that may well be the case.  We know the HSE identified these issues in its internal audit report dating back to March of this year.  It is scandalous that 24 of the 44 section 38 organisations have openly admitted to the HSE that they are not in compliance with public sector pay policy.  That position is untenable.  I want to know specifically what the HSE is going to do about that in terms of signing up to new service level agreements with those organisations.  What is the ultimate power the HSE has at its disposal and is prepared to use to ensure all those organisations fully comply with public pay policy?<\/p><p>  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's commitment on the Charities Act.  In November 2011 the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, said the Government was postponing the establishment of a charities regulator on budgetary grounds.  That was the wrong decision.  We are now seeing some of the fall-out from the lack of standards applying across the 8,000 charities in the country.

It needs to be made clear to people who contribute to charities or people who are contemplating contributing to charities that the act is being cleaned up and that the problems identified in respect of top-ups or excessive payments - whatever we call it - to senior management staff and senior executives in charitable organisations are being dealt with.  They are being dealt with at the initiative of the Minister for Health, who asked the HSE to conduct an audit of these organisations following the Health Information Quality Authority report on Tallaght hospital in 2012.  It was the audit of the section 38 agencies which identified the problems and which brought to light the various top-up payments, pension arrangements and all the other matters that have come into the public domain.<\/p><p>That audit now is being followed up by meetings that are being conducted by senior managers from the Health Service Executive, HSE, with the agencies concerned.  The chief executive officer of the HSE is meeting the chairpersons of the section 38 agencies to make clear to them what is expected of them in respect of compliance with public pay policy.  As I stated earlier, the mechanism it is intended to use is to require each of the section 38 agencies to sign a compliance statement.  In other words, the chairman of the board of each agency, as well as another director of the board, will be obliged to sign a compliance statement that will be submitted to the HSE making clear that the agency in question is complying with public pay policy.  As a consequence, members of the public can have confidence that when they donate their money, they know where their money is going and that there is transparency in respect of the administration, the management and the payment of senior executives in such organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200018#Q00500","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386850200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Everyone agrees the testimony given yesterday to the Committee of Public Accounts by former and current members of the board of the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, was both shocking in content and arrogant in its delivery.

As someone who sits on that committee, I must state that as matters unfolded, I was minded of Myles na gCopaleen, because one literally could not have made up the story the committee was told.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste and his colleagues in government are now almost breathing a sigh of relief because in a way, the CRC being at the eye of the storm takes the eye off the Government and in particular, away from the Minister for Health and his shambolic stewardship of the portfolio.  I caught sight of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, on television commenting on this matter and it struck me that he looked like a disinterested observer or as someone who had been vox popped while out Christmas shopping.  The truth is that these top-ups in the CRC have been known about by the system since 2009.  Incidentally, Members should remember that Fianna F&aacute;il was in charge at the time.  Senior HSE management was ignored and was virtually told to get lost by the board of the CRC.

However, this was an exercise the HSE conducted at the direction of the Minister for Health.  That process now is coming to a conclusion.  The Government has information that has been submitted by the different agencies and it is being followed through.  At present, 17 senior managers of the HSE are pursuing this matter with the various agencies concerned in order to drill down into what payments are being made, what is their nature and so on.  The chief executive officer of the HSE is meeting the chairperson of each section 38 agency, first, to clarify all of the facts and, second, to make it absolutely clear to them what is expected of them with regard to pay policy.  There will be transparency in this regard and there will be compliance with public pay policy.  This will be structured in such a way that each agency will be required to sign a compliance statement each year.  This compliance statement will be part and parcel of the arrangements and will be separate from the service agreement that such agencies much sign with the HSE in any event.  The Deputy asked what recourse is open to the HSE if such agencies are not compliant.  If an agency cannot sign the compliance agreement, there are consequences in terms of the portions of public funding that go to the payment of salaries and, certainly, that go to the payment of any of these top-up arrangements.  Consequently, there are options that will be open to the HSE but it will centre on the compliance statement being signed by each agency.  This is a matter on which the Government already has taken action.  The information that now was in the public domain is as a result of the audit conducted by the HSE.

The ESRI also published a second report which studied the impact of social transfers on people at risk of poverty.<\/p><p>  In the report on the distributional analysis the ESRI acknowledges that it is having difficulties with the Switch model.  I acknowledge it is making some progress in expanding the coverage of that model.  However, the ESRI accepts in the report that it is still experiencing difficulties in incorporating all of the budget measures within the model, particularly in assessing the impact on higher incomes.  The ESRI has acknowledged that the model exaggerates the scale of the actual losses in the budget as it assumes more income is taxed and welfare payments fall behind average incomes.  No one doubts, however, that all recent budgets have had a serious impact on the incomes of people in all parts of the country.  Despite those difficulties we have managed to maintain core social welfare rates.

Social transfers, including pensions, have reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate by 71%.  In other words, seven out of every ten people in society would be regarded as being at increased risk of poverty without the redistribution provided for by the social protection system.  The report shows that Ireland is in the top section of 15 EU member states for the effectiveness of social transfers in reducing poverty and that the welfare system is playing a pivotal role in alleviating poverty in Ireland.<\/p><p>  No one is attempting to argue that the budget measures can be sugar-coated.

While I presume it remains the view among workers and unions that those savings could have been achieved by means of more active control of the current system, the binding Labour Court recommendation must be enforced.  As I said earlier, I am concerned about the critical illness protocol.  While I appreciate that pregnant workers are covered by other legal mechanisms and forms of legislation, any regulation dealing with this matter must acknowledge the circumstances, which are fortunately not common, in which such a worker may find herself needing long-term sick leave.  That might not happen on a once-off basis.  It is unfortunate that this matter was not fully ironed out before we were asked to consider this legislation.  There will be an appearance in the Labour Court on 16 December next.  Ideally, the regulations would be completed, the discussions between employers and workers would be concluded and agreement would be reached before we would be asked to pass this ground-breaking legislation.  During today's debate, the Minister might put my mind, and more importantly, the minds of public servants, to rest on that issue.<\/p><p>  I would like to speak about the issue of retrospection, which was raised earlier.  I tabled some questions on this matter to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which kindly supplied me with answers.  I asked whether these regulations will include a provision to retrospectively apply the new certified sick leave arrangements.  In its response, the Department recounted the necessity to give public service employees advance notice of the new scheme and make provision for a transitional period, etc., and informed me that access to the new reduced limits of sick leave is not being applied retrospectively.  I thought that was fairly clearcut until I read the rest of the response.  The Department went on to explain that individual sick leave records will remain unchanged following this legislation and will continue to be used to determine whether an individual has access to paid sick leave and at what rate.  It pointed out that when an individual is absent from work due to sick leave, his or her record over the previous four-year rolling period will be examined to see if the sick leave limits have been exhausted.  The Department claims that this is in line with the Labour Court recommendation.<\/p><p>When is retrospection not retrospective?  Despite the initial line that I read out, this answer actually concedes that the new regime will be retrospective.  For instance, when this new scheme is introduced if a worker has reason to take sick leave, his or her past record will be taken into account and weighed and measured.  That person's entitlement to future sick leave will be on the basis not of the sick leave arrangement which existed two or three years ago when he or she took the leave but in line with the new mechanisms and standards set in place by this change.<\/p><p> I envisage that causing some difficulties.  For many workers it has caused a degree of alarm.  Public sector workers who are concerned about this matter have contacted my office and I am sure other Deputies' offices.  The Minister has said from time to time on the record that the new sick-pay scheme would be retrospective.  He has cited the Labour Court recommendation to support that position.  I have in my hand recommendation LCR 20335 with the direction that the new scheme should take effect from 1 January 2014.  I do not see in this recommendation that the instruction is to be applied retrospectively.  The Minister will need to enlighten us on the matter because it is causing considerable concern for many workers who have contacted me.<\/p><p> I raised this issue when we debated the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill.  I understand we need to cut our cloth according to our measure.  That is a reality of our times and should, in fact, be a prevailing reality in good times or in bad.  I accept that savings can and should be made from what is a very substantial sick leave bill.  However, by introducing legislation such as this - I appreciate the advice the Minister received from the Attorney General - and conferring upon not just the present Minister but any future holder of that office the power and capacity to make regulations in respect of public servants' entitlement to sick leave, be it certified or uncertified, short-term or long-term, represents a very radical departure from the established practice.<\/p><p> I am concerned that that type of authority would rest in the hands of a Minister because we cannot predict the bias or world-view any future Minister might have.  It establishes a trend for the Minister, Deputy Howlin, of moving away - incrementally but nonetheless measurably - from a system of established industrial relations and bargaining positions within the public sector to a much more centralised ministerially controlled and therefore management-weighted approach to the terms and conditions of public servants.  He is obviously minded to do this.<\/p><p> In his earlier contribution the Minister cited the Attorney General's advice and stated: &quot;Although the new sick leave arrangements could be applied in some sectors, such as the Civil Service, by administrative circulars, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that legislation is required to ensure that the new public service sick leave scheme can be applied across the public service&quot;.  I strongly favour sticking to the established norms of bargaining between public sector workers and their employer - a very powerful employer as things stand.  I am anxious and uncomfortable with those powers resting in the office of the Minister.  I do not direct that personally at the Minister, Deputy Howlin, because, as he knows, he may come and go but these powers will endure.<\/p><p> I hope that this trend of last-minute introduction of fairly complicated and important issues in respect of legislation coming from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does not continue.  On the watch of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, all of us had expected and continue to expect that during pre-legislative scrutiny and on Committee Stage room for consideration would be taken seriously so that we do not get bounced or rushed into dealing with very serious and substantive issues at the last minute.  I do not believe that is the way to do business. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200023#V05100","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386853200,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Healy, who is sharing time with Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200024#W00200","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1386853200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>The amendment before us to cut the sick leave arrangements for public sector workers is a savage attack on those workers.  In his contribution the Minister mentioned that this was a Labour Court recommendation and is supported by some of the trade unions involved.  We must never forget that these changes were demanded by the Government under threat and indeed under a bullying regime.  However, I am still amazed that some public service unions agreed to these measures.  Trade unions exist to protect and improve the pay and conditions of their members.  This is certainly not an improvement in pay or conditions.  Clearly we not only need a change of government but also need radical changes in the trade union movement.<\/p><p>  The new section 7 is an enabling section, enabling the Minister to cut sick-leave entitlements across the public service.  While it does not specify the details of the cuts, they are widely known and were mentioned by the Minister in his contribution.  From one year on full pay in the preceding four years, sick leave is to be reduced to 13 weeks on full pay with the next 13 weeks on half pay in the preceding four-year period.  This represents a reduction to three eights - less than half - of the previous entitlement.  This is a massive cut affecting sick public sector workers.  It is another example of the Government's hostility to public servants who have suffered several rounds of cuts to pay and pensions and the imposition of more onerous conditions of service.<\/p><p>  Public sector workers competed for careers in the public service based on the pay, conditions and pensions that existed at the time.  Now, having given many years of satisfactory public service the Government is moving the goalposts.<\/p><p>While by far the worst impact is on sick people, this new cut will in effect reduce the pay of all.  The cost of income continuance insurance, normally deducted from salary, will more than double.  Many public service workers, across the sector, teachers, nurses, garda&iacute;, social workers and many others, work in very stressful situations and have a high incidence of work-related illness.  There is objective evidence of this in their income continuance schemes.  These changes being made by the Minister are a savage blow to public sector workers who suffer work-related illnesses.<\/p><p> Probably the most regressive and disturbing measure in this amendment is its retrospective aspect.  A person who has been sick for more than 26 weeks in the past four years will have no sick leave entitlement from the day that these measures come into effect.  The retrospective aspect of this legislation is unconstitutional.  I have had sight of strong legal advice to this effect.  There are several areas in which this legislation can be challenged on a constitutional basis, for instant retrospective legislation is <i>prima facie<\/i>unconstitutional pursuant to Article 15.  The retrospective effect of the legislation amounts to an unjust attack on property rights.  The retrospective effect of the legislation amounts to an attack on that individual's constitutional guarantee of equality pursuant to Article 40.1.  Pursuant to private contract law the employer is stopped from unilaterally varying the terms of the contract of employment retrospectively so as to include past periods of sick leave lawfully availed of at the material time when prospectively applying the new reduced sick leave scheme.  This amendment seriously affects serving public servants.  It has a particularly obnoxious retrospective aspect which I believe is unconstitutional and I believe that the Minister should withdraw this section immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200024#W00300","speaker":"960","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386853800,"counter":404,"content":"<p>In my na&iuml;vet&eacute; I used to think that public sector reform had something to do with improving the quality of public services.  I have learnt definitively with this Government that it means nothing of the sort.  This amendment seeks to slash the illness entitlement of public sector workers and amend a Bill that has already carved up the conditions of public sector workers.  It comes on the back of a relentless and in many cases vitriolic assault on ordinary low and middle earning public sector workers who have become scapegoats for the economic crisis created by others.  It is inevitably justified by the narrative of setting the private sector worker against the public sector worker.  It is a completely bogus narrative although it is as predictable as the clock ticking that certain newspapers will wheel out articles assaulting public sector workers in their constant tirade attacking low and middle income workers.  For the record, not that it will make any difference to the narrative that we hear here or read in the tabloid or rag media that passes for proper reporting, this distinction between public and private is utterly bogus.  The real distinction is between low and middle income workers who, whether in the public or private sectors, have been slaughtered in the current recession, and those at the top of the public and private sectors who have been completely insulated and have continued to line their pockets, give themselves bonuses, pay themselves obscene salaries and are never subject to the caps or strictures put on the ordinary worker.  Even when certain strictures are put in place they are flagrantly disregarded by the Government and the top executives in the health service or wherever the hell it might be in the banks.<\/p><p>  It is clear that what reform really means is making ordinary workers work harder, longer and for less, and relentlessly battering them with cuts.  The result is that public services deteriorate and are seriously degraded.  The Government said that it had successfully redeployed 10,000 people, which sounds wonderful but we need to see an example of how this works.  The centralisation of medical card services, the redeployment of people to the centre in Finglas, has been a disaster for people applying for medical cards.  It has been the mechanism through which, as a matter of default in a bureaucratic box-ticking exercise, people are denied the right to their medical cards and cannot find a human being to talk to because there is no local office any more where one can speak to a human being and state one's case.  That is so-called public sector reform and is nothing other than a systematic degrading of our public services and of those who work in them.  The Government deems it entirely appropriate and logical to take the sick and illness entitlement from public sector workers while demoralising them and causing them more stress and almost certainly making them more ill more frequently.  What else would the Government do when that is the direction of policy?<\/p><p>  The highest level of absenteeism is in the health service.  Is there any wonder about that when the Government has taken 10,000 health workers and &euro;3 billion out of the system and workers are absolutely traumatised by what they must deal with, an impossible situation that they face when they go to work day in, day out?  Is it any wonder that they get sick more often?  Other workers have been mentioned, such as garda&iacute; and firemen.  What about community welfare officers who have to deal with desperate people coming in day after day begging them for money that the Government does not give them?  The list goes on.  The Government is slashing their entitlements and disgracefully, it is doing it retrospectively.  Is it not absolutely amazing that we cannot retrospectively vary the pensions of previous Taoisigh, Ministers and all the rest with their massive pensions?  We can do nothing about the disgrace that is going on with executives in the Central Remedial Clinic because they had contracts but we can retrospectively vary the sick leave entitlements of ordinary workers and be damned to their constitutional or legal rights.  Those are the disgraceful double standards that operate in this country.<\/p><p>  The distinction is made between critical and non-critical illness.  How exactly is critical illness going to be defined in these arbitrary powers now being given to the Minister to lay down the specifics of the new regulations for sick leave entitlements and so on?  Will cancer treatments, which could be strung out over six or nine months, or a year, be defined as critical?  I certainly hope they will but I strongly fear they will not.  What about mental health issues?  This is a major problem but there is an attitude among certain people on the Government benches that mental or stress-related illness is not real illness.<\/p><p>The attitude is that we just need to put measures in place that will force people to go to work even when they are not fit to do so, and even though their unfitness to do so is often related to what this Government has done to their working conditions, pay and so on.  If we were interested in actually taking a reform measure that might improve the stress that is put on ordinary workers at the front line of our public services, why do we not bring in a regulation giving people a voluntary opportunity to work near where they live, so they do not have to travel long distances across the city in congested traffic?  Would that not boost their morale a little and improve the situation of absenteeism, make services more local and so on?  That is a rational approach to public sector reform.  Of course, this has nothing to do with public reform.  It is just another assault, this time on workers who are sick and often on those who were made sick by the activities of this Government in raining down relentless cuts on their pay, conditions and resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200025#X00200","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386854400,"counter":406,"content":"<p>Deputy Nulty indicated he wanted to speak.

There is a requirement for those of us who want to have a future for the public service, and to have decent quality public services, to have regard for the norms that apply across the working environment and to try to make these adjustments.  That is why we engaged with all the public sector unions and why we have taken a very long time to bring these matters to the Labour Court.  The Labour Court has had very careful deliberation on all these matters.<\/p><p>  The Deputy made a point on the specific issue of gender proofing.  The idea is that it does not refer to any gender.  It refers to the degree of sickness.  On the important point made about equality proofing, under the proposed scheme there is no differentiation between different groups of workers and we do not differentiate between workers as women and men.  There are, as Deputy Fleming rightly said, significant bodies of law protecting pregnant women in the workplace and elsewhere, which is important.  We fully recognise and support the need to protect women during pregnancy.  The public service will continue to operate the provisions of pregnancy related illness in accordance with all the relevant European Court of Justice rulings and Labour Court rulings.  In fact, the public service in Ireland is one of the best places for women to work in regard to terms and conditions.  That will remain the case and I am determined it will be so.<\/p><p>  In terms of this being draconian, it is hardly worthwhile to comment on the remarks of Deputy Fleming or Deputy Boyd Barrett because they have a continuous similar rant on every issue we bring forward.

Forgive me.<\/p><p>  These amendments relate to the insertion of a new Part 7A concerning sick leave remuneration into the principal Act, as we have discussed at some length.  The amendment provides for the insertion of a new sentence into the Long Title to reflect that fact.  As the Long Title suggests, the Bill amends the 2004 recruitment Act to provide for the redeployment of public servants.  The amendments being tabled are beyond the scope of the current Long Title.  As such, it is proposed to amend the Long Title to provide for regulations concerning sick leave in the public service.<\/p><p>  As Deputies are aware, the rationale for the new scheme was the need to reduce the unsustainable cost of sick leave in the public service.  This is to be achieved through a substantial reduction in the period of time for which sick leave will be available.  I want to be clear that the reduction in paid sick leave under the new scheme will reflect exactly the binding recommendation of the Labour Court.  Under that recommendation, special arrangements are being put in place through the development of a critical illnesses protocol under which staff with serious illnesses of specific severity might benefit from extended sick leave on an exceptional basis.  I did not have much time to respond on this point previously, but we will deal with it in some detail during our toing and froing.  We are moving away from a single sick leave arrangement to a sick leave arrangement and a critical illness protocol to cover many of the issues raised by the Deputies opposite, including mental health issues.  This was understood in our discussions.<\/p><p>  The new Part 7A empowers the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to make regulations providing for the payment of sick leave remuneration for public sector workers.  The provisions in Part 7A will underpin the introduction of a new sick leave scheme, which was recommended by the Labour Court in 2012, across the public service.  It is also a key deliverable in the Government's reform programme.  The single sick leave arrangement will help mobility in the public service.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 16 seeks to insert the new Part 7A, comprising sections 58A to 58C, into the principal Act.  The overall purpose of Part 7A is to make legislative provision for a sick leave scheme for the public service and to give the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform the statutory authority to set out the scheme in detailed regulations, having regard to certain principles and policies.  A new Part is being inserted to avoid confusion by distinguishing between the provisions that relate to sick leave remuneration, redeployment and the existing provisions in the principal Act that relate to recruitment and appointments.  This new provision empowers the Minister to provide for a definition of &quot;condition&quot; in ministerial regulations to be made under this Part.<\/p><p>The term \"condition\" includes a condition which has been certified and prevents a public servant from attending to his or her duties due to illness or injury.  The word \"condition\" does not refer to a medical condition, but is a condition that will get the public servant into the critical illness protocol.  The inclusion of this definition means that the Minister can include in the regulations that in order to be allowed access to the levels of remuneration and the limit times in the paid sick leave scheme specified in those regulations, a medical practitioner must certify in writing that the public servant concerned is unable to attend to his or her duties due to illness or injury.<\/p><p> Rather than me reading out a great deal of information, it would probably be preferable if the Members asked their questions and I respond to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200028#AA01100","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386855600,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I look forward to working our way through this hybrid of Committee Stage and Report Stage.

I had tabled an amendment providing that these matters should be dealt with by regulation, and the Minister agrees with that principle.  I am happy with that.  I prefer that this be copper-fastened by way of secondary legislation than by way of circular, and the Minister and I agree on that.

I think that is what it means in English, so we will not argue about it.  It is unlikely to happen anyway.<\/p><p>  We come now to the substantive issue in the legislation before us, the amendment regarding sick leave.  After the debate we had earlier the Minister will understand the arguments of different Members because we are essentially dealing with the same point.  I might differ with other Members of the Opposition but I agree with the Minister on the need to curtail the sick leave bill and to bring it into line with what is the norm in Irish society.  It should not be a standard thing for people to say, &quot;I feel like doing a few sickies&quot;.  That phrase should not be part of the Irish lexicon from now on.  In addition, even though the Opposition should not necessarily look for trouble, I support cutting the six month period to three months for both full pay and half pay.  The difficulty I have is with some of the details about it.<\/p><p>  The retrospection is a big issue.  I refer to it as retrospection, but many people would disagree with me on this.  It is unusual for the House to pass a measure that has a retrospective effect.  However, it is to do with the nature of the sick leave scheme.  I have a copy of the circular issued last July to personnel officers containing a notification of the changes.  It states: &quot;Because we calculate sick leave on the basis of a 4 year rolling period (i.e. counting backwards from the latest day of absence) the changes being introduced from 1 January 2014 may result in staff being on half pay on their next sick absence if they have had more than 3 months absence on full pay in the previous 4 years.&quot;  That introduces an element of retrospection.  It counts back for the number of sick leave days.<\/p><p>  Some people would say this House should not pass anything with retrospective effect.  The essence of every legislative measure is that it is the law from when it is passed, but one cannot go back and change the law that previously existed.  However, in effect, this measure has a retrospective impact.  The Minister might be surprised to find that I agree with the principle that there must be some retrospective impact with this.  Some would say there should not be, but there should be some look back.  Otherwise, one would essentially be wiping everybody's previous sick leave record clean, with it starting again from next year under the new regulations.  It would be four years before the four year rolling clock would catch up to reach the current position and it would be four years before the full potential savings could be achieved.  Some Members will respond by saying &quot;So be it&quot;, but we are in a difficult financial situation and there must be some recognition of the sick leave taken prior to the commencement of this new legislation.  To ignore it would be unfair to the taxpayer and to the hundreds of thousands of people in employment in the private sector who do not have a similar four year rolling arrangement for the amount of paid sick leave they receive.  The Minister might not like it but I can see the logic in him doing that.<\/p><p>  I will now turn to my difficulties with the section as amended by this amendment.  I do not think the Minister grasped what I meant - perhaps he was not listening carefully - when I said the legislation was not gender proofed.  Of course, there is no phrase in the legislation singling out females for special treatment as opposed to males, or vice versa.  There cannot be.  Gender proofing means assessing the impact legislation will have on the genders.  Without reference to gender in the legislation, the practical implementation of this legislation will have a greater and more disproportionate impact on women than on men.  It is not written in the legislation but that will be the effect, as sure as night follows day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200029#BB00600","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1386855600,"counter":451,"content":"<p>Why?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200029#BB00700","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1386855600,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I will explain.  The reason I raise this is the complicated cases I encounter in my constituency clinic, and I am speaking from personal experience of dealing with those cases.  Where I believe this measure discriminates against women is at the jump from full pay after three months to half pay.  The Minister has a mechanism in place for people who are going onto the rehabilitative arrangement whereby their payment does not go lower than the social welfare rate at that point.  That is not the point at issue.  I am also not referring to the pre-1995 people but to the people in the public service who are relatively young with young families and are paying and have been paying the full PRSI rate.<\/p><p>The Minister will say that no change, other than the reduction from six months to three months in respect of half pay, is being made.  However, as a result of this change more people will be on half pay sooner than was previously the case, which means many more people will be impacted by it.<\/p><p> Reference is made in the legislation to linkages with the Social Welfare Acts.  Up to 30,000 people in the public service are in the lower paid grades.  The statistics indicate that there are more females than males in the lower pay grades in the public service and that there are many more females than males at clerical officer level in the Civil Service, HSE, local authorities and so on.  As a result of the new arrangements, staff will now drop to half pay much sooner than heretofore.  A female public sector worker earning &euro;30,000 per annum who is the sole bread winner in a household, whose husband or partner has lost his job and has three children would be entitled in terms of illness benefit to the single person allowance of &euro;188 per week, &euro;124.80 in terms of the qualified adult allowance and &euro;29.40 for each child, which amounts to &euro;402 per week.  However, when her salary of &euro;30,000 is reduced by half she will have an income of only &euro;15,000 per annum, which equates to only &euro;300 per week.  That family would be far better off on illness benefit.  As per the circulars issued across the public sector, staff are obliged to sign a certificate instructing the Department of Social Protection to forward information in relation to illness payments to their employer and to fill out the required forms promptly after going on illness benefit.  They do not have the option of having the cheque forwarded directly to them as they will have already signed up to an arrangement whereby it is sent to the employer.  As I said, there are more women than men on low pay.  While this measure was not designed to hit women the fact that more women than men are on low pay means women are more likely to be impacted by it.<\/p><p> I have had extensive discussions in recent days, including again this morning with officials in the Department of Social Protection, on the general theme of this measure, which is that nobody will be on lower pay than their social welfare entitlement, which I accept.  The legislation does not deal specifically with the reduction to half pay after three months but to what happens at the end of the half pay period of entitlement.  I presume there is a presumption in the legislation in this regard, even though I have not been able to locate it.  Under the legislation, after three months on sick pay a person will be entitled to &euro;188 per week in illness benefit.  While it is valid to say that a single person is entitled under social welfare legislation to &euro;188 per week in illness benefit, for social welfare payment purposes the household income of a person on illness benefit is taken into account but for employment purposes a person is classified as an individual.  This means an individualised approach is being taken in terms of salary and a family approach is being taken in terms of social protection.  While the intention is that a person's pay will not be lower than his or her basic social welfare entitlement, as I understand it, this is only the case in respect of the person but he or she may be entitled to claim for other people.  <\/p><p> I discussed the following issue earlier with officials in the Department of Social Protection.  The top-up payment for the qualified adult and child allowance for a person on illness benefit is means-tested.  If the husband is in receipt of jobseeker's allowance he may be able to have the balance made up through his claim.  However, if the husband, because he has lost is job is back in education, he may not be eligible for jobseeker's allowance and may also have no other entitlements because he is not available for work.  The Minister will probably say that this has always been the case.  However, more people will be affected a lot sooner because of this change.  When the people on high incomes of &euro;80,000 or &euro;90,000 are reduced to half pay they will still be receiving payments well above illness benefit and social protection payments but the person on the salary of &euro;30,000 will when reduced to half pay be receiving less than their social welfare entitlement.  I accept it will be difficult to deal with this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200029#BB00800","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386856200,"counter":454,"content":"<p>It is a social welfare issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200030#CC00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1386856200,"counter":455,"content":"<p>It will require employers to liaise with the Department of Social Protection in regard to each individual's entitlement.  I accept that currently when a person goes onto half pay this is automatically calculated on a computer and that as no two situations will be the same, depending on the family situation, this will be difficult to deal with.  However, as I stated earlier this measure will in terms of the statistics in regard to the number of people in the lower pay grades affect women more than men.<\/p><p>  Another issue not addressed but by which women will be affected is pregnancy-related illness.  I believe the current arrangements should be reconfigured to exempt pregnancy-related illness from this scheme, although I do not know if it is possible to do so at this stage.  As the Minister is aware only females get pregnant.  I know he will say that there is nothing in the legislation that discriminates against women but the practical implications of it, because only women can get pregnant, is that it will have an impact on women that it cannot possibly have on men.  This is further evidence that this legislation was not gender proofed. <\/p><p>  Some women have a couple of children.  A woman who becomes pregnant and acquires a pregnancy related illness, who has been already previously absent from work with an illness, will because of the counting backwards aspect of the sick leave calculation aspect, be moved from full to half pay sooner than would otherwise be the case if she had not acquired the pregnancy related illness.  I am not seeking an exemption for women in respect of non-pregnancy related illness.  However, where an illness is defined by a consultant or doctor as a pregnancy related illness this illness should be exempted in the context of the reduction to half pay.  The Minister might consider this matter when drawing up the regulations.  It would be only fair that he do so.  I do not propose to get into the politics of cuts in maternity leave and so on.  The Minister should try to do something to address that issue.<\/p><p>  As stated earlier, I am not happy that the Bill has had to be recommitted in respect of these amendments.  The Minister has made a virtue of pre-legislative scrutiny.  This aspect of the legislation is far more fundamental than what was provided for in the original legislation.  In time, this aspect of the legislation is what people will rely on.  Most public servants will get sick at some stage during their 40 year working career.  This legislation will greatly impact on them.  Issues such as redeployment will not necessarily affect many people during the course of their employment.  As this is a bigger issue it would have been useful if it had been brought forward earlier in the year.<\/p><p>I know the Minister will say it is before the Labour Court and that negotiations are ongoing and so forth.  I understand that and I made those points earlier in the day.<\/p><p> I read line by line the document the Minister has issued on critical illness.  I am satisfied with all of it, by and large, bar the exclusion of mental illness.  The Minister specifically referred to physical injury.  I realise the Minister will say that it can come in under critical illness but the Minister has stipulated physical injury.  People will ask why he has excluded the other category.  Since the Minister went to the trouble of listing physical injury, he could have referred to mental illness.  Some of the examples are given at the back and I follow the logic in all of those.  They refer to people being out in various circumstances.  Some of them are clear, for example, the case of someone who has schizophrenia.  The Minister gave the example of how such a person would be entitled to be included under critical illness.  Another situation might involve someone who perhaps had a difficult family situation on a once-off basis and for whom, perhaps, an early return to work might not be good, either for him or his colleagues.  Perhaps he may need extra time.  I am impressed generally with the document, except for the omission that I would have preferred to see included.  The Minister will tell me it is covered in any event.<\/p><p> I may think of some more points during the debate.  The Minister can see the way I am coming at it.  If he cannot change a great deal today, perhaps he can when it comes to the regulations.  When the Minister is publishing the regulations, will he send the committee members a copy?  I realise they will be laid before the Oireachtas but we get so many e-mails that we could easily miss them.  Will the Minister make a point of sending the document to the committee secretariat in order that we can see a copy and read it?  The Minister might consider the matter of pregnancy related illness when he is making the regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200030#CC00300","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386856800,"counter":457,"content":"<p>Deputy McDonald is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200031#DD00200","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1386856800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>It may be better if we deal with those points first and then I can come back in later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200031#DD00300","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1386856800,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I am happy to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200031#DD00400","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1386856800,"counter":460,"content":"<p>We are dealing with this in committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200031#DD00500","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1386856800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I will accommodate your wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200031#DD00600","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1386856800,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I am happy to deal with it.  There were four substantial points made by Deputy Fleming and I will deal with those in sequence.  We debated the regulation issue earlier.  Deputy Fleming has tabled an amendment to it.  I have before me as many pieces of paper as Deputy Fleming.  I am trying to find the note on Deputy Fleming's amendment on the regulation.  The Deputy proposes the insertion of a new section 58B(9) which would require the Minister to lay draft regulations made under Part 7A before each House of the Oireachtas.  Either House would be able to annul the regulation by resolution.  I accept that.  On the strong advice of the Attorney General, I have reworded it in a way such that the Office of the Attorney General is satisfied, but I do not believe there is an issue with it.  That is the way we should go.<\/p><p>  The second point Deputy Fleming made relates to what I term the fail-safe measure.  It is normal to put in a proviso so that even in the unlikely event of the Oireachtas annulling regulations, nothing purported to have been done up to that point is nullified.  That is simply a fail-safe that is included.  I assure Deputy Fleming that nothing will be done in advance of the regulations coming formally into effect.  That is why I am delaying the implementation of the scheme until whenever that point is arrived at.<\/p><p>  The Deputy referred to two more meaty issues.  The first was the retrospection issue.  Deputy Fleming is perfectly right.  The word &quot;retrospection&quot; is not an appropriate word really, because one must have some snapshot or period to make an evaluation.  It would be bizarre to decide to start now with a new scheme.  That would work counter to what we want to do.  We want to reduce expenditure but if we ignored what is happening now, that is, the four year envelope that is applied at the moment, and decided that we would start a new clock regardless of what a person's record was to date, then we would be pushing things back four years.  In the first instance, that would not be fair to public sector workers who become sick from whatever date this legislation becomes operable.  They would have a legitimate grievance in respect of their work colleagues who had been out of work, perhaps, for a protracted period, in the past two or three years.  That is a reasonable point.<\/p><p>  It is important to be clear about what is meant by the new scheme being applied retrospectively.  The question of retrospection arises in respect of reviewing an individual's sick leave record over the past four years and then using that to determine access to paid sick leave under the new scheme.  When an individual is absent on sick leave, two things are relevant.  First is the number of days of sick leave in the past four years, that is, all the days of sick leave in the past four years added up.  Second is the number of sick leave days in the past 12 months.  The first decision made is whether an individual should have any access to paid sick leave.  To do this, a person's sick leave record is examined in respect of the previous four years.  This will determine whether he can have access to paid sick leave provided he has not exhausted the limits. Currently, the limit on pay during absence from work is 12 months but this will be reduced to six months for non-critical illnesses under the new scheme.<\/p><p>  The second decision to be made is how much an individual can be paid.  This is dependent on the sick leave record of the individual over the past 12 months.  The individual's sick leave record is examined over the previous year to determine whether he can receive full or half pay or whether he should be considered for an award of temporary rehabilitation pay.  This is the new phrase we are using relating to when a person is coming back to work.  The look-back arrangement has always been in place in respect of the calculation of sick leave pay and will continue under the new scheme as set out in the Labour Court recommendation.  There is nothing new in this.  We have always taken a four year time envelope and it is appropriate that this is maintained.  The notion that we are introducing a new element of retrospection is not right.  We are simply changing the arrangements in future having regard to the work patterns and sick leave of the previous four years.  When the new scheme is implemented, an individual's sick leave record will continue to be reviewed with regard to the previous four years where a person has taken sick leave previously.  I hope that is clear enough in respect of the so-called retrospection issue.  In fact, Deputy Fleming has made a compelling case in support of what I am suggesting and I have no issue with him in that regard.<\/p><p>  Deputy Fleming went on to amplify the charge he made about gender proofing.  The legislation is deliberately constructed in order that it is not gender specific.  We treat all workers in the public sector equally.  Deputy Fleming says it has a disproportionate effect and he has given the example of pregnancy related illnesses.  We did not disaggregate pregnancy and certainly pregnancy is not regarded as an illness.  However, there are complications that can arise in pregnancy that are gender specific.  They can and will be captured in the work.  This was a clear point made by the public sector unions.  It is absolutely accepted by the employer, by me.  I must be careful what I say because the Labour Court is seized of this matter at present but we hope the court will help us find an acceptable and reasonable approach to protect women when they are pregnant while maintaining the integrity of the scheme and, more especially, the critical illness protocol.<\/p><p>  For clarity I emphasise that we are moving away from a single sick leave scheme to a reduced sick leave scheme but with a new critical illness protocol which will capture matters such as complications in pregnancy, acute bouts of mental health, cancer or illnesses that are critical and ongoing.  We must define the conditionality in order that it is not an abused protocol that will undermine the basis of the fundamental sick leave arrangement.<\/p><p>  All the fears that the public sector unions and the Deputies opposite have genuinely placed on the table are understood by the management side and they can be well captured.  As part of the reasoning, I have put within the legislation and I will put within the regulation a 12 month review clause.  We we will see how this works in 12 months.  I will be happy to take any questions or debates about this 12 months on.  Perhaps by 12 months we will not have enough information and we may have to wait for a second 12 months, but we will have a review automatically after 12 months of the operation of the new arrangements.  Of course the public sector unions and their representatives will have input into that review.  Is there any other point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200031#DD00700","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1386856800,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I asked about social welfare payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200031#DD00800","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1386856800,"counter":464,"content":"<p>Deputy Fleming made the point about the juxtaposition of reduced formal payment and the interaction it has with social welfare payments, especially for people of low pay when they get to a half-pay rate and the impact that has on the family income generally.<\/p><p>It primarily is a matter for social welfare provision because what is being done here does not alter the current position.  The difficulty the Deputy has addressed regarding a diminution in pay could arise right now.<\/p><p> As for the general principle, in their submission to the Labour Court, the public service unions proposed there should be a floor on temporary rehabilitation pay.  In other words, there would be a minimum payment that is not less than the personal social protection rate of &euro;188 per week.  The Labour Court accepted the unions' proposals in this regard and endorsed the position that a minimum payment equal to social welfare protection rates for those who joined the service before 1995 is reasonable and should be accepted by the management.  Therefore, while there are implementation issues to be worked out, the principle outlined in the aforementioned Labour Court recommendation is clear and will be implemented.  That is the position for pre-1995 people.  In the case of the post-1995 Civil Service, class A contributors have an entitlement to claim illness benefit that is not means tested.  Normally, the individual receives his or her sick leave payment from his or her employer and then the public service body recoups the illness benefit payment from the Department of Social Protection.  This is the way it normally works.  My point is the new arrangement that is being put in place simply mirrors the old arrangements.  While it may be worth my having a chat with the Minister for Social Protection on these matters, as the Deputy rightly stated it would be extraordinarily complicated to implement, through a payroll system, a sort of means testing of income within a household between social welfare and reduced formal pay.  I believe it would make impossible the practical application of the scheme.  However, this may be something that can be caught through the social welfare system, which carries out means testing where people have not paid a class A contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200031#DD00900","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386857400,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I will make a few points just to conclude this line of approach.  As a highly practical person, I will make two real and practical suggestions that I ask the Minister and the Department to take on board.  On the issue of pregnancy-related illness, a system is in place at present whereby a person who is on half pay and has a pregnancy-related illness will not drop to a rehabilitative rate.  There is a simple way to deal with this issue, that is, to have the same provision for a person on full pay, whereby she will not drop to half pay specifically during the period of a pregnancy-related illness.  At present, there is full pay, half pay and the rehabilitative rate and there is already in place a system whereby one will not drop-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200032#EE00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1386857400,"counter":467,"content":"<p>There is a floor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200032#EE00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1386857400,"counter":468,"content":"<p>No, the Minister should bear with me.

I believe the arrangement is that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200032#EE00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1386857400,"counter":469,"content":"<p>One cannot go below half pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200032#EE00500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1386857400,"counter":470,"content":"<p>Exactly.  In other words, a person who is on half pay during her pregnancy and the clock runs out on her, she will not drop below that.  The cost of doing this would not be all that much, that is, someone who commences her pregnancy-related illness on full pay should not be dropped to the half-pay rate during that particular specific illness.  It might be for only two or three months or a similarly short period.  In other words, there already is a mechanism for someone who already is on half pay not to drop off the system and my suggestion is such people should not be dropped from the higher step to the intermediate step during this period.  This is a practical suggestion to which the Minister might give consideration.<\/p><p>  I have a second practical suggestion for the Minister to simplify matters for the employer before the statutory instrument is made.  Illness benefit is based on one's contributions and is not means tested.  Therefore, the amount is fixed at &euro;188 per week if one is entitled to it.  However, the qualified adult allowance is means tested, as is the qualified child allowance.  I accept it is beyond the remit of the employer to know the personal circumstances of each family.  My simple suggestion pertains to a person who is on half pay, who happened to be on &euro;30,000 but whose pay dropped to &euro;15,000 and who now gets &euro;300 per week.  If the cheque from Department of Social Protection comes in at a higher figure, simply give back the balance to that person.  I simply suggest a profit should not be made by the Department or the employer through getting more in illness benefit from the Department of Social Protection than it actually is paying out to the person on half pay.  If the cheque rolls in and it is for &euro;100 more than the Department is paying out, top it back up in order that the person gets the benefit.  This is the principle that already underlines the other arrangements, whereby the Minister stated people will drop to and not below their personal rate.  In other words, there is a figure there and the Department has no calculations to make.  When the Department of Social Protection has done its bit and has started to send in a higher cheque, an employer that discerns it is higher should simply refund the balance.  It would be somewhat perverse for an employer to be making a profit, that is, getting more from the Department of Social Protection during a person's illness than it actually was paying out to the person on sick pay.  I believe the Minister can understand this proposal.  The Minister might be able to put forward a formula in this regard because I do not believe for a second it is his intention that his Department should make a profit on someone being out sick through getting more from social protection than it pays out in sick pay.  I believe all Members are in agreement in this regard.  The Minister should attempt to find a simple way to do this, which would take the employer out of the operation.<\/p><p>  I have one final comment, to which the Minister may have responded earlier.  In his contribution this morning, the Minister stated: &quot;It is important to note that in overall terms, the new scheme will provide access to some form of income for public service employees who find themselves out of work due to illness or injury for a period of two years in total.&quot;  Is that figure of two years the current figure or is it the new, reduced figure?  What will happen at the end of the two years?  Will the chief medical officer tell the person concerned to collect his or her cheque and go?  The Minister should outline what will happen at the end of the two year period and I ask him to consider my two suggestions on pregnancy-related illness and for employers not to make a profit out of the illness benefit paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200032#EE00600","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1386857400,"counter":471,"content":"<p>On the first point made by the Deputy with regard to pregnancy-related illness, I will consider it in the context of the regulations.

I refer to the other point made by the Deputy on ensuring that if a social welfare entitlement happens to be bigger than the reduced rate of pay, the sick person should get the benefit of the balance.

The Deputy's final question was on what happens when one has exhausted one's three months and one goes onto temporary rehabilitation pay, that is, what does it mean and how will that be calculated.  If standard sick leave limits or the critical illness provisions or both are exhausted and there is a realistic prospect that the individual will be able to return to work, as I stated already, he or she will then go on to temporary rehabilitation pay for the further period during the total period over which support is paid, up to two years.  This two-year limit is designed to mirror the two year period over which illness benefit currently is paid by the Department of Social Protection.  Temporary rehabilitation pay, as the Deputy is aware, used to be called the pension rate of pay and will be calculated and awarded in the same way.  It is based on the pension that an individual would be paid, were he or she to retire at that particular point in time.  There are issues on the length of time of the payment of the temporary rehabilitation pay that the public service unions are raising in the context of the final phase of deliberations before the Labour Court on 16 December and that the matter should be clarified then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200032#EE00900","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1386857400,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I note Members are on Committee Stage for amendment No. 1.  Obviously, the Minister was obliged to change the Title because when the legislation was originally considered, it did not envisage legislating in this way for sick leave in the public service.<\/p><p>As the Minister says, it is enabling legislation. <\/p><p> To deal with amendment No. 16, I refer to section 58B(4) which in my view is instructive.  It states: &quot;In making regulations under the subsection the Minister shall have regard to...&quot;.  Front loaded at the beginning is the need to limit the circumstances in which public service bodies can undertake the commitment of financial resources in making payments in cases in which they are unable to receive the benefit of the services of their public servants.  That is reasonable, in my view.  It refers to the resources available.  Subsection 58B(4)(<i>c<\/i>) cites the obligations of the State under the treaty of stability, co-ordination and governance under economic and monetary union, while subsection 58B(4)(<i>d<\/i>) refers to the specification of conditions for an entitlement to be paid remuneration during a period of sick leave and the desirability of having in place a satisfactory means of verifying that the public servant concerned is ill, etc. - in other words, not pulling a sickie when one is not sick.  It is only in subsection 58B(4)(<i>e<\/i>) that there is mention of the need to protect the health of public servants.  Whatever about the decision to order it in that way, an employer has obligations under health and safety law, as do employees themselves for their own well-being, and I am certainly not advocating a situation where people abuse a system of sick leave, be it certified or uncertified.  I understand the scale of the current Bill and I am convinced not just by arguments made by the Minister, but also by arguments from the workers' side that savings need to and can be made.  I do not have an argument with the Minister on that point.  I ask the Minister to give the House the most recent figures for the number of public servants on what would be termed long-term sick leave as this information could provide a sense of the scale of this situation.<\/p><p> I said this earlier and I promise I will not repeat it again after this.  I do not like the idea of the Minister having possession of this kind of enabling legislation.  I reiterate this is not personal to the Minister.  In my view, it may be a step too far.  Subsection 58B(4) instructs any would-be Minister or the current Minister of what he or she needs to have regard to.  It is ordered in that way with the health of public servants almost as the last item in that section and this worries me even more.<\/p><p> I refer to the issue raised by Deputy Fleming about the social welfare payment.  I draw the attention of the Minister to a point on which I ask for clarification.  It comes from the Labour Court recommendation which refers to rehabilitation pay and a minimum payment equal to social protection rates for those who joined the public service before 1995.  I ask the Minister to explain and clarify what this will mean for the regulations.<\/p><p> The point made about gender-proofing of this legislation can be made equally about most, if not all, legislation.  I do not believe there is due regard for the impact on gender of many other measures.  The Minister made, on the face of it, a reasonable remark that the legislation and the regulations would not discriminate between male and female workers.  That is fair enough.  However, that is easily got around by the simple reference to &quot;pregnant workers&quot;.  One of the sexes has the capacity to become pregnant and as of yet, bar scientific advancements, the other does not.  There has to be the very specific reference to pregnant workers in this or any other legislation and certainly in the regulations.  If the regulations did not take account of that, they would run against the existing legislation protecting pregnant workers but it would also be an obvious deficiency in any legislation. <\/p><p> I come now to the clincher.  This Bill proposes cutting the amount of time to which workers are entitled to sick leave.  I remind the Minister that pregnancy is not a sickness,  but I refer to the example of a case of the baby blues, as the condition is called.  It is not uncommon for workers who have been pregnant to have depression.  Where in this specific instance is the worker situated with regard to sick leave?  There is the issue of how the modest period of uncertified sick leave and certified sick leave is accommodated within the definition of critical illness.  However, if the condition persists above and beyond the two years, which, sadly, can be the case, where does that leave that worker?  The Minister is in charge and it is legitimate for him to ensure that provisions are not being abused.  However, it would be a very bad turn if this scheme resulted in people whose illness was extended beyond the scope of what is envisaged by the Minister and who found themselves with no job to return to or who were forced out of their job.  The nuance needs to be considered.  It would have been preferable to have this discussion having had sight of the various regulations because much of what is speculation I presume would be resolved and set out for us.  <\/p><p> The Minister referred to retrospection as being a look-back, which is a nice turn of phrase.  He said, &quot;We are changing the scheme going forward but then having a look back at the past&quot;.  It does not really matter whether it is called retrospection or if another term is used.  The fact is that leave which workers have legitimately taken under the existing regime will now be calculated under the regulation and the norms of a new trimmed down set of limits.  I am not suggesting this would cause significant difficulty in many cases but I can see circumstances where it will cause a problem for the simple fact that the Minister is reducing the period of time and leave to which people are entitled.<\/p><p> I have spoken to the Minister many times on the issue of retrospection, generally about excessive pay and pension pots at the top of the tree. <\/p><p>The Minister has used arguments around property rights, contractual obligations, advice from the Attorney General and so on to state he could not tackle many of those pressing issues.  It seems that on this matter the Attorney General takes a different view.  She does not seem to be so hung-up on people's legitimate expectations or their contractual arrangement with the employer.  In this instance it seems that can be set aside but there is precedent for that because that was also the case in respect of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation.  I note that contradiction for the Minister.  The Minister might respond to those points starting with the figures available to him because I would like to get a picture of long-term illness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200032#EE01000","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386858600,"counter":477,"content":"<p>The Deputy has raised a number of issues, which I will try to deal with sequentially as I did with Deputy Fleming.<\/p><p>  I do not have numbers.

I believe it is a more democratic way of doing it in that we are bringing legislation to be debated here, circumscribing the power of the Minister and debating the power of the Minister as opposed to what happens now where it is done normally by circular that we do not see.  I remember when I was teaching one would get circular 1 of a particular year, circular 2 and circular 3 changing terms and conditions and God knows what not by circular.  This is a more democratic way of doing it.  If we have a formal legislative authority determined by Parliament and a formal statutory instrument laid before Parliament containing a review clause that is a better, more open way of doing it but that would be a matter of viewpoint.<\/p><p>  I do not want to repeat the point I made in reply to Deputy Fleming on the pre-1995 and post-1995 people other than to reiterate that regarding the pre-1995 people, we have accepted the Labour Court recommendation that the minimum position equal to social protection rates for those who joined the public service before 1995 is reasonable and is to be accepted.  That will be reflected in the decision.  The post-1995 people, as the Deputy is aware, are paying a Class A contribution so they are entitled to claim illness benefit.  In the normal circumstances the way it works is that the employer receives that and pays the half pay.  The point made by Deputy Fleming was about a situation where the social welfare recoupment was greater than the half pay of somebody on a low wage.  My understanding is that the balance is rebated but I will check that for the Deputy.<\/p><p>  I hear the points made by the Deputy about pregnancy related illness.

One has had three months on full pay, three months on half pay and the related pay floor determined for the balance.  The idea, and that is the reason we are renaming that payment, is for it to be an encouragement back to work.  I said in the opening remarks, and I know it can sound a bit odd, and this is the advice I have from the medical practitioners, that the notion that the objective is to get people back to work is supportive of recovery.  The system is designed to get people back to work, not to categorise them as permanently ill.  We want to provide the supporting mechanisms, rehabilitation and so on to get people back to work.  The norm would be that after two years one might determine one is not returning to work because the illness is such that one is not capable of that work and one might want to find work elsewhere, in which case one might retire.<\/p><p>If one can return to work under a different set of circumstances, that would be facilitated also.  That is part of the supporting regime we have put into the public service under human resource management.

I like this notion of rehabilitation and back to work.  That is absolutely sound.  The last thing one wants to do is to keep people in the category of \"sick\", psychologically for them and in terms of the work organisation.  However, if the circumstances are exceptional and it takes that bit longer for people to get themselves fit and ready to take up their duties, that should be provided for.  I do not think we should say two years and s&iacute;n &eacute; - one is either fit to come back to work or not - in particular when dealing with illnesses which relate to people's mental health.

The area where there is the highest level of absence through sickness is in the health service.  That is no surprise.  The percentage is higher, the numbers are higher and the cost is higher because the Government has butchered the health service.  It is obvious.<\/p><p>  I spoke to a local authority worker before I came into the House about a study of ordinary bank workers - not the people at the top - I think in Bank of Ireland which reported that two thirds of sickness of among workers in banks has to do with stress.  Why is that?  Is it because bank workers are inherently more subject to stress?  Not at all.  It is because ordinary bank workers have been at the sharp end of the anger and indignation people feel about what has happened to this country.  Of course, it was politicians and people at the top who were actually responsible but the ordinary bank workers feel the stress and must deal with it.  If we broke down the Minister's figures on the health service, we would find exactly the same thing that the stress is induced by having to work longer hours, harder, with fewer resources, with more demands and more desperate people.  I do not know if the Minister still does clinics but I am more stressed going into my clinic now than I was a year ago because there are more desperate people around.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200035#HH00400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1386859200,"counter":494,"content":"<p>The Deputy comes in here to share his stress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200035#HH00500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1386859200,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I do.

Surely that is the point of democracy.  I would not belittle it.<\/p><p>  Those figures deserve to be broken down even more to find out what are the illnesses that are leading to higher levels of absenteeism in the health service, higher levels among special needs assistants than in education generally, which speaks for itself, and higher levels among front-line garda&iacute; than among those who are civilians, which again speaks for itself.  The people at the front line having to deal with the consequence of the economic crisis and the impact of austerity on the ordinary members of the public, with whom they must engage, are more likely to be sick and the figures the Minister gave bear that out.  I would not like to be at the housing desk in a local authority at the moment because the situation is desperate.   These people are dealing with an impossible situation.  How soul destroying must it be to be in the housing department of a local authority with people coming in day after day, more and more desperate because they are longer and longer on the housing list and are living in more deplorable conditions?  What does that do to somebody's mental health?  It crushes it.  That is the reality and that is why people are getting sick.<\/p><p>  Even though sicknesses are being induced by circumstances beyond the control of workers, we are going to put in arbitrary dates and say that after a certain point, people's entitlement to full sick pay will be cut.  That leads on to the point Deputy McDonald made.  One may not be able to go back to work after two years.  What used to be six months is now three months.  These are arbitrary dates.  If the Minister is saying he wants to take into consideration people's illnesses, then he would not have those arbitrary dates.  He would look at what is making people sick and at their illnesses and would look at it on a case-by-case basis, as this Government so often does in other matters.  Let us actually look at what is making people sick and at their illnesses.<\/p><p>  I accept the Minister does not want people to be out sick forever and to be labelled as sick.  I suspect the vast majority of people who are on sick leave would rather get back to work, so let us assist them in doing so.  That is the sort of reform we need but this is arbitrary and will undoubtedly hurt people.<\/p><p>  I refer to defining critical illness and the area of mental illness, which relates to the point about stress.  Let us not yet again make mental illness the poor relation of sickness and not really take it seriously when, in fact, it can be extraordinarily debilitating.  Let us not say it is not really critical.  I am fascinated and worried by how the Minister will define &quot;critical&quot;.  There are lots of grey areas but will every person who has cancer and is getting cancer treatment be assumed, as a matter of course, to be critical?<\/p><p>I would certainly hope that will be the case.

I find it problematic that an onus is being put on people to prove how sick they are when they are at their most vulnerable.  This has to be re-examined.  There is evidence that in the case of medical cards, the default position has been to refuse people and force them to beg and cajole their way through an amazing amount of hoops to prove they are sick.  They have to participate in the appeals process when they are sick and least need the extra hassle and burden.  I am against the whole thing.

People in my Department and in every front-line delivery system were under stress because our country was in a crisis as it tried to recover from the deterioration in its economic conditions.  It was almost like a war.  I do not intend to play that down.  Absenteeism and sickness are not new phenomena.  It would be interesting and instructive to look back at the figures for previous years.  There were significant levels of absenteeism and illness in some sectors at the height of the wealth of the boom, when previous Ministers were saying the country was awash with money.  It is important that we get better at managing our sick leave arrangements in a proactive manner.  There is a responsibility on us to do that in a way that is reflective of the Labour Court recommendations.

I thought that part of the reason for these redeployment, recruitment and appointment moves is to open the possibility of staff moving between these bodies and the rest of the public service.  Perhaps that is not the case.  If it is the case, we should be including them in this measure.  I am proposing that all of these semi-State bodies should be included in this legislation.  There is a case to be made to include companies like Bord na gCon, EirGrid, Horse Racing Ireland, the National Stud Company, the Railway Procurement Agency and the VHI - I will not go through them all - in this sick pay legislation.<\/p><p>  I would like to ask the Minister a question in this context.  Perhaps he will not be able to answer it.  There are different rates of sick pay.<\/p><p>Will they continue with the six months and six months?  We will probably find that some of the commercial semi-State organisations are operating the three months and the three months.  The problem is that we just do not know what they have.  We had this before when pay cuts were introduced under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts.  We all know of people who might work in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, the local authority or the HSE, and the guy next door might work in CIE or Bord na M&oacute;na.  They all generally regard themselves as public service workers in a similar category.  However, when it came to some matters under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts they were in different categories.  We are again going down the road of changing the pay for 290,000 public servants - I do not know how many are involved in the commercial semi-State organisations.  It is important to establish what the sick-pay arrangements are in each of these commercial semi-State organisations and other such bodies.<\/p><p> I believe they should be included under the scope of this legislation because the same general sick-pay principles we have been discussing in the past few hours should apply as equally as possible across all of these.  There may be specific cases such as teachers who might come in in September or members of the Defence Forces who might have a slightly different regulation.  However, it would be better for everybody concerned to have similar arrangements.  There is no point in us doing all that and some of these commercial semi-State companies, such as the ESB and An Post, having a much more generous level of sick leave.  They need to be considered in the same context as the other areas the Minister mentioned, such as the Civil Service, defence, education, health, local government and justice.<\/p><p> Regardless of whether the semi-State bodies are included in the scheme, Irish Water should be on the list given that it has been established and is operational.  It is even more bizarre now than it was when I tabled the amendment because I now understand that Irish Water will have its service level agreements with the local authorities for the next few years to be reviewed subsequently and then they can run on until 2025.  Essentially the delivery of water services will be run by a semi-State body that collects levies, but the work on the ground will be done by local authority workers with a service level agreement.  It is incongruous to have different sick-pay arrangements between people who are essentially working for the same organisation.  The local authority workers who will be working on the pipes will have one arrangement, whereas the people in the Irish Water head office may have an entirely different sick-pay and sick-leave arrangement, and not the three months and three months we are introducing now.  Irish Water is either one project or it is not; the purpose was to centralise it.  It would be bizarre if we ended up with local authority workers doing work for Irish Water coming under the local authority sick-pay scheme, whereas those working for a commercial-State organisation would not be included in the same scheme.  I do not even know what that scheme is.  I am essentially looking for consistency across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200036#JJ03200","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386860400,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I call the Minister, who has two minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200037#KK00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1386860400,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I apologise to the House.

I do not agree that it is necessary or appropriate to have a statutory appeal power.

We have agreed with the unions under the Croke Park agreement that we need to move towards an increasingly integrated public service in any event and to achieve that, the public service will need to be reorganised and public sector bodies and individual public servants will have to have more flexibility.  Our terms and conditions in respect of sick leave, pay, annual leave and so on will have to be regularised so that they are more uniform.  These points are very well made.

I thank the Minister for coming into the D&aacute;il to address this issue.  It has been reported in the national media that ten staff from Stewarts Hospital, which is a care facility for people with intellectual disabilities, have been suspended pending investigation into allegations over the standard of care provided to residents.  I have considerable experience in community work and have had the opportunity at various stages to supervise mature students who are providing a service.  I know all too well that it often takes considerable courage for any student to raise issues of concern because of possible consequences.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Government's commitment to the protection of whistleblowers and am delighted that Stewarts Hospital is working with the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to address these particular issues.  Working as a carer is, of course, a very responsible position and it is an essential part of our society based on trust.  The questions raised in this investigation are somewhat disturbing.  Like the expos&eacute; in this House over recent weeks about charities, long before these events took place, I formed the opinion that greater supervision of all staff, including continuous professional development and assessment, monitoring and reviewing of standards of practice and regular in-service training, are vital components to ensure that the highest standards are adhered to by all care givers but especially those directly involved with the most vulnerable members of society such as those with learning disabilities who very often do not have the full means of protecting themselves.<\/p><p>  I have no doubt that this is particularly distressing for family members and I am asking the Minister to ask Stewarts Hospital to meet individual family members to discuss the outcome of the HIQA investigation.  My fear is that there may be organisations providing care today that are not giving due attention to individual care.  It begs the question as to whether this problem is systemic throughout the care sector bearing in mind the fact that many recipients of care in Stewarts Hospital are moving into their later years and in the circumstances, are regarded as more vulnerable.  They require more sensitive care in such circumstances because of the dual dependency of age and intellectual disability.  I would be very grateful if the Minister could convey to Stewarts Hospital my request that following the outcome of the investigations, including that of HIQA, it would agree to meet with each family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200040#NN00300","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1386862500,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Keating for raising this matter.  I am pleased to take this opportunity to outline the current position in respect of the standard of care provided to residents by the Stewarts Care organisation in Dublin.<\/p><p>  Stewarts Care is a charitable foundation, with a long tradition in the provision of care for people with intellectual disability.  The institution was the first in Ireland to offer such support for people with severe disabilities.  Operating from two main sites at Palmerstown and Balgaddy in south-west Dublin and several satellite residential and service centres throughout west Dublin and north Kildare, Stewarts provides extensive on-site and community-based services.  The organisation supports more than 300 residents and provides wide-ranging services for other clients, children and adults, who attend day services.  Many families are also supported within their homes through the Stewarts home support programme.<\/p><p>  The Government announced the commencement of a new scheme of registration and inspection of residential services for people with disabilities by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, from 1 November 2013.  HIQA is now able to set and monitor standards for designated centres, including residential services provided to persons with disabilities.  HIQA is also empowered to undertake investigations into the safety, quality and standards of these residential services.  This has been called for by the disability sector for a number of years.  The sector was widely consulted in the drawing up of the new standards.  With guidance from HIQA, these standards will empower providers to deliver even higher quality services.<\/p><p>  Regarding the specific issues raised by Deputy Keating, I have been advised by the HSE that Stewarts Care received reports at the end of November from student nurses expressing concerns about some practices in the delivery of residential services to service users.  Like the Deputy, I commend those young students.<\/p><p>  In accordance with statutory requirements, Stewarts Care informed the HSE and HIQA of the reports.  An investigation team was identified in line with guidance received from HIQA.  I understand that, following consultation with HIQA, a number of staff have been suspended pending the outcome of this process.  No one from Stewarts Care is now on the team examining the issues.  It is expected that the chairman of the investigation team will meet each of the complainants over the next few days as part of the external investigation.  Further action will be predicated on the outcome of this.<\/p><p>  As an investigation into the allegations is under way, it is not appropriate for me to comment further.  In addition, Stewarts Care may not be in a position to issue further comment before the completion of this process.  The HSE acknowledges that the provider is working with HIQA to address all concerns and I am assured that the HSE will continue to be in close contact with Stewarts Care.<\/p><p>  I will convey Deputy Keating's suggestion that Stewarts Care should meet each client's family once this process is complete.  Not only does it seem a sensible action to take, but it is essential in order to ensure trust.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200041#OO00100","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1386862500,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive report.

It is interesting that new people can enter an environment and see with new eyes protocols that require revision.

I am disappointed that the Minister for Social Protection is not present.  She is detained elsewhere.  I welcomed her announcement of a couple of weeks ago to the effect that people who were in receipt of social welfare payments and wanted to work during the Christmas period would easily be able to resume those payments.  However, the real problem is not with the Christmas period, but with the entire year.<\/p><p>  This issue was raised with me by a recruitment company in Kildare.  It has approximately 1,000 people on its database.  Many of those are on short-term contracts and doing part-time work.  The company is being asked to fill in forms for the social welfare office.  The form requires it to declare the hours people will work for the weeks ahead, but it is not able to make that prediction.  If it writes &quot;Zero&quot; as requested, yet the people work in those weeks, they could be accused of fraudulently taking payments.<\/p><p>  The company cannot find indigenous people to take these short-term work contracts.  As a result, people who are not on the welfare system are primarily being employed.  I am referring to people who come to this country and take advantage of the short-term, flexible hours.  Make no mistake about it - the Irish want to work, be it for short or long terms.  We must be able to provide sufficient flexibility.<\/p><p>  If the Minister's statement is policy, it must be implemented by every office.  What she wants must be acted upon by the Department.  We must allow people who want to work for short terms and flexible periods to return to the social welfare system as quickly as possible.  Otherwise, we are deterring people from returning to the workforce.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, knows as well as I do that, for the sake of their mental health, most people would rather work for two, four or six hours instead of sitting at home staring at the walls or watching television.<\/p><p>  If it is policy to allow people to return to the social welfare system as quickly as possible, it must be implemented by all sections of the Department of Social Protection.

Regardless of the time of year, people on jobseeker schemes should not have any concern about taking up temporary work for fear of delays in getting back into payment when the jobs are finished.<\/p><p>In cases where a jobseeker customer takes up temporary work for a short period or avails of a short-term training course, arrangements are in place to suspend temporarily the claim so that it can be reinstated without delay when the work or training finishes.  Effectively, the jobseeker's claim is kept open while the person works, although the payment is obviously stopped for the period.  This temporary suspension, which was originally set at a maximum of four weeks, was increased to eight weeks in 2012 and in March 2013 it was further extended to 26 weeks for educational sector workers.  The arrangements are put in place once the customer notifies the Intreo social welfare local office of an offer of temporary work.<\/p><p> In the 11 months from January to November 2013, the temporary suspension has been used on 49,000 occasions.  This compares with less than 14,600 in 2012.  Even where a person does not avail of these special arrangements, payment can be reinstated within a very short timeframe.  For example, in November 2013, almost 35% of all jobseeker claims were awarded on the day the application was received, and these are cases where the special provisions for periods of temporary work were not availed of by the customer.  In summary, if a person on a jobseeker's payment gets an offer of a job for up to eight weeks or gets a chance to go on a training course, they should give the details to their Intreo social welfare local office as soon as possible.  The office will be glad to make the arrangements to fast track the claim back into payment when the time arrives.<\/p><p> Although the arrangements for temporary suspension of claims are in place all year round, the Minister recently issued a reminder of the arrangements to all Members of the Oireachtas in view of the increase in opportunities for temporary work at this time of year.  The Department constantly reviews its operational procedures to ensure the best possible service for its customers.

I understand the arrangement whereby they can come off the register temporarily, but the social welfare office asks them to indicate the hours they will work in the weeks ahead.  One cannot do that if one's job is temporary, and people are worried that they might be accused of fraudulently taking money from the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>  I welcome the fact that officials in the Department are willing to meet with this company to discuss the issues it has, but it is very important, now that we are generating a far more flexible workforce, that we have a social welfare system that is able to cater for that workforce.

I suspect it is one that is rarely raised in the House.<\/p><p>  All Members of the House are rightly concerned with ensuring that the State supports children who may have learning difficulties or other disadvantages that might hamper their educational development or their general opportunities in life.  It might seem a little strange to be seeking support for very bright or gifted children with exceptional learning ability, but it is an issue that we must address both for the well-being of the children concerned and also for the benefit of the country.  It is tempting to be glib and ask what these children could possibly need and to say they are very lucky and that their parents should be thankful.  However, these children have specific requirements which must be met if they are to fulfil their potential and maximise the contribution they can make to society and the economy.<\/p><p>  We all recall from our childhoods that the worst thing a child can be is different, one way or the other.  There is a danger of exceptionally gifted children being isolated and sometimes frustrated in the learning environment they occupy in the standard State school system.  These children learn faster, earlier and differently.  There is a growing population of children in Ireland with what is called dual exceptionality.  This is where their intellectual ability is often in the top 5% quotient or above, but they also might have a mild to severe learning challenge and sometimes even a profound disability.  Being an exceptionally bright child does not always mean that the child will have an exceptionally bright future, and parenting can be a daunting challenge for those who are rearing what is known as a gifted child.<\/p><p>  Unlike many countries, there appear to be scant resources available in Ireland for exceptionally able children, yet it is estimated there are over 27,000 children who fit into this category.  There is also probably a need to ensure that training is provided for teachers to recognise and cater for children with exceptional ability.  On the face of it, there appears to be a lack of opportunities for those children to develop their talents and skills further.  I am aware of the facilities in Dublin City University, DCU, and the University of Limerick.  However, if one identifies a gifted footballer, musician or artist when they are young, those skills are honed, encouraged and developed.  There is a vast number of children in this country, 27,000, who fit the profile of being exceptionally able, so it is important that we try, in so far as we can and notwithstanding the resources available to us, to contribute as much as possible to develop their ability so they can fit in and continue to enjoy the school and general learning experience they encounter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200042#PP00400","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1386863100,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the issue raised by Deputy Nash and to clarify the position regarding the supports available for gifted children in schools.<\/p><p>  The Education Act 1998 requires the board of management of each school to publish the policy of the school relating to participation by students with special educational needs, including students who are exceptionally able.  The measures schools take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan.  It is the duty of school boards of management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students.<\/p><p>  Schools at both primary and second level use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able.  Syllabi and curricula for second level schools have been designed in such a way as to enable teachers to cater for the wide range of pupil ability.<\/p><p>The revised primary curriculum recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils.  The curriculum at primary and secondary school level identifies curricular content and matters relating to the learning process and places strong emphasis on enabling children to learn how to learn.  The curriculum also places considerable emphasis on the development of language skills, investigatory and problem solving skills, higher-order thinking skills, working individually and as a member of a group.  These skills are encouraged at both levels.<\/p><p> Use of information and communication technologies and class and school libraries is meant to benefit all pupils in terms of additional learning.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, in collaboration with its counterpart in Northern Ireland, the Council for Curriculum Examination and Assessment, CCEA, has produced draft guidelines for teachers of exceptionally able students.  These guidelines issued to all primary and post primary schools in November 2007, along with a questionnaire for feedback.  The NCCA-CCEA guidelines are designed to raise awareness of the social, emotional and academic needs of exceptionally able students and to assist teachers in planning their teaching and learning.  The guidelines provide advice to schools on the identification of gifted children.  They set out profiles of students and identify whole school and classroom strategies and case studies which demonstrate how schools can best meet the needs of such students.<\/p><p> The Special Education Support Service, SESS, is a service under the management of the Department of Education and Skills which provides support for teachers to assist them in meeting the needs of all pupils with special educational needs, including pupils who are exceptionally able.  The service is available to schools which may be seeking advice or support relating to a specific special education issue in the school.  In addition, the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, also under the management of the Department, provides training to assist teachers to differentiate for all pupils, whether less or more able.  Issues around exceptional ability and giftedness are addressed as part of the school planning process which is facilitated by the PDST.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200042#PP00500","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386863700,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply which sets out the services available and the policies which inform those services.

Operation Liath was introduced within Donegal division in January 2013 as an operational strategy to improve public safety and enhance the effectiveness of high-visibility police resources within the division.  This operation in Donegal is running in conjunction with national operations such as Operation Fiacla and other Garda operations in existence to combat criminality within the Donegal division.  The main focus of this ongoing operation is to disrupt and prevent criminality against older persons within the community, to apprehend suspects in the commission and the attempted commission of offences and to fully investigate detect and prosecute any offences outstanding against those suspects and groups.  This will be achieved through a focused, targeted and co-ordinated approach by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> The objectives of the operation are being addressed through intelligence-led patrols, checkpoints, continued liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, intelligence gathering and the continued support and rejuvenation of neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes.

Also, it is not the best type of leadership in terms of giving a message to the Garda about how the Government understands the particular needs.
